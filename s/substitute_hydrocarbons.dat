As an example, ethanol {{is used as a}} gasoline extender to both partly <b>substitute</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and increase octane number while improving vehicle emissions.

However the incorporation of small amounts of water in ethanol dramatically decreases this already narrow miscibility domain.

Halogenated hydrocarbons on surfaces are systems of particular interest. These molecules adsorb and self–assembly at surfaces and many experimental works show that, if one provides {{energy to the}} complex, {{in the form of}} heat, light, or electrons dropped with an STM tip, they easily react resulting in single, or patterns of, chemisorbed atoms at specific and controllable sites.

Particularly, {{improvements in the}} sustainable production of commodity chemicals, such lactic acid, by fermentation are desirable when they are used as feedstock for production of polymers, e. g. polylactic acid (PLA). PLA can <b>substitute</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> based polymers in several applications. It is well know that lactic acid production by fermentation is impaired by product inhibition at high lactate concentration in the cultivation broth. A continuous removal of lactate from the fermentation broth will diminish the inhibitory effect, and therefore increase productivity and product yield. Integrating separation and fermentation will also enable operation at higher cell densities, thereby providing additional enhanced productivity potential. Integration also moves the degrees of freedom for control, therefore a model based study of the design, control and optimization is desirable. In 1980 ’s, electrodialysis was suggested {{as an alternative to}} intensify lactic acid fermentation, since lactate can be selectively removed by ion exchange membranes during electrochemically pH-controlled electrodialysis of the fermentation broth (Hongo, M. et al., 1986).

All strains were cultivated in liquid media with crude oil as a sole carbon and energy source. Bacterial strains capable of degrading hydrocarbons belong to the genera Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas sp. Carbon dioxide evolution experiments were used as the major indicator of microbial degradation of oil in biometric flasks. The measurements of CO 2 evolution rates have shown to effectively evaluate the biodegradation rates by providing significant data within a short period. The chemical composition of the residual oil was determined by gas-chromatographic techniques.

UV/ozone treatment offered a hydrophilic surface (water contact angle ([theta][superscript]water) less than 10 °), reflecting the formation of a surface oxide layer with the maximum thickness of ca. 1 nm and possibly the removal of surface contaminants. Upon immersion in a toluene solution of a RX, [theta][superscript]water increased due to adsorption of the RX onto gallium substrates. In particular, UV/ozone-treated gallium substrates (UV-Ga) immersed in an ODPA solution exhibited [theta][superscript]water close to 105 °. The ellipsometric thickness of the adsorbed ODPA layer was ca. 2. 4 nm and CV data measured in an acetonitrile solution showed significant inhibition of redox reaction on the substrate surface. These results indicate the formation of a densely-packed ODPA monolayer on UV-Ga. The coverage of a C[subscript] 17 H[subscript] 35 COOH layer adsorbed onto UV-Ga was lower, as shown by smaller [theta][superscript]water (ca. 99 °), smaller ellipsometric thickness (ca. 1. 3 nm) and smaller electrode reaction inhibition. Adsorption of the other RX onto UV-Ga was weaker, as indicated by smaller [theta][superscript]water (82 - 92 °). ODPA did not strongly adsorb onto UV-untreated gallium substrates, suggesting that the ODPA adsorption mainly originates from hydrogen bond interaction of a phosphonate group with surface oxide.

A comparison of alkylbenzene and alkene partition coefficient estimates from two different linear solvation energy relations, one containing a McGowan specific volume term and one without such a term, suggests that no branching correction is needed for alkyl groups at sp 2 carbons.

Determinations of the total carbon content gives values from 0. 23 to 0. 35 per cent. The presumed indigenous insoluble carbon is thus present in a ratio of 2300 : 1 relative to contaminant carbon. A sample of the meteorite was extracted with a deuterated solvent containing benzene:methanol (4 : 1 w/w) to remove contaminants and then was subjected to pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to investigate the nature of the remaining carbon. The pyrolysis products (about 20 ppm) consisted chiefly of aromatic and <b>substituted</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The pyrolysis results were confirmed by oxidative thermal analysis which showed that the bulk of the carbon present was a macromolecular structure and not graphite. This suggests that an insoluble nongraphitic condensed aromatic polymer is indigenous to the meteorite. The origin and precise chemical structure of this material has not been determined, but it bears a superficial resemblance to coal-like structures...|$|R
30|$|Asphaltenes {{behave like}} blood {{cholesterol}} {{in that they}} deposit {{on the walls of}} crude oil transportation pipes thereby narrowing the internal diameters, thus posing great dangers. This study was designed to remove asphaltenes from light crudes by solvent precipitation and to investigate the comparative performance of n-heptane (single solvent) and n-pentane/n-heptane (mixed solvent) in this regard. Each of three Nigerian crudes: Bonny Export, Bodo and Mogho crudes were first distilled at 350  °C to obtain the atmospheric residuum. Asphaltenes were precipitated from each residuum at different stirring times with single n-heptane and mixed n-pentane + n-heptane solvents. The precipitated asphaltenes were characterized with FTIR, UV–visible spectrophotometers while the maltenes were fractionated to obtain the various fractions. Results show that the asphaltenes were made up of saturated (cyclic aliphatic <b>hydrocarbons)</b> and unsaturated (<b>substituted</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbon).</b> Also, aromatics to saturates ratio and resins to asphaltenes ratio was higher in Bonny Export and lower in Mogho crude, thus, indicating that Bonny Export has the lowest asphaltene precipitation risk while Mogho crude has the highest risk. The results also showed that resins stabilize asphaltenes in crude as addition of resins to the different crudes reduced the quantity of asphaltene precipitated.|$|R
40|$|Concentrating {{solar power}} (CSP) {{may be an}} {{alternative}} to generating electricity from fossil fuels; however, greater thermodynamic efficiency is needed to improve the economics of CSP operation. One way of achieving improved efficiency is to operate the CSP loop at higher temperatures than the current maximum of about 400 C. ORNL has been investigating a synthetic polyaromatic oil {{for use in a}} trough type CSP collector, to temperatures up to 500 C. The oil was chosen because of its thermal stability and calculated low vapor and critical pressures. The oil has been synthesized using a Suzuki coupling mechanism and has been tested in static heating experiments. Analysis has been conducted on the oil after heating and suggests that there may be some isomerization taking place at 450 C, but the fluid appears to remain stable above that temperature. Tests were conducted over one week and further tests are planned to investigate stabilities after heating for months and in flow configurations. Thermochemical data and thermophysical predictions indicate that <b>substituted</b> polyaromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> may be useful for applications that run at higher temperatures than possible with commercial fluids such as Therminol-VP 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel method of sample {{preparation for the}} determination of trace concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in high-boiling petroleum products. Limits of quantitation of the investigated PAHs in materials of this type range from tens of nanograms per kilogram to < 20  μg/kg. The studies revealed {{that in order to}} separate most of interferences from the analytes without a significant loss of PAHs, it is necessary to use size exclusion chromatography as the first step of sample preparation, followed by adsorption using normal-phase liquid chromatography. The use of orthogonal separation procedure described in the paper allows the isolation of only a group of unsubstituted and <b>substituted</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> with a specific range of molar mass. The lower the required limit of quantitation of PAHs, the larger is the scale of preparative liquid chromatography in both steps of sample preparation needed. The use of internal standard allows quantitative results to be corrected for the degree of recovery of PAHs during the sample preparation step. Final determination can be carried out using HPLC-FLD, GC-MS, or HPLC-UV–VIS/DAD. The last technique provides a degree of identification through the acquired UV–VIS spectra...|$|R
40|$|A {{debate has}} begun on the {{potential}} for renewable raw materials (RRM) to <b>substitute</b> fossil <b>hydrocarbons</b> in synthetic products. A related debate has arisen in the liquidfuels sector with contested proposals {{for the expansion of}} biofuels production. A transition to integrated biorefineries as analogues of oil refineries has been advocated, to enable RRM to compete with petroleum and minimise environmental impacts. Transitions between technological systems involve evolutionary processes, in which change emerges from reinforcing feedbacks between different levels of the socio-technical system. The past both shapes the current system and influences and constrains future options and pathways. Thus, over the past half century oil refiners and the associated petrochemical industry have achieved a high level of integration that challenges the competitive development of RRM, for which the full range of necessary technologies and product families are not well established and the commercial and technical risks are high. This paper explores a case study of the transition from coal-based to petrochemical feedstocks in the UK (1921 – 1967), applying a system dynamics approach to extract and elucidate the key interrelationships between technologies, policy and society. The findings and insights are then used to inform a discussion of scenarios for future biorefinery technologies, with a focus on bio-based chemicals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceReactive poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) plastisols {{have been}} {{developed}} to <b>substitute</b> the <b>hydrocarbon</b> diluents generally used in low viscosity PVC plastisols. For this purpose, methacrylate monomers (5 - 15 %) were added in the PVC suspension (based on diisononyl phtalate plasticizer) to reduce the viscosity at room temperature and to polymerize (by radical polymerization initiated by an organic peroxide) during the gelation process. Both the reactive processing and the gelation process were carried out between the plates of a rheometer cell in the linear viscoelasticity domain (small deformation) and under increasing temperature from room temperature up to 160 °C (= 6. 283 rad s- 1, = 5 °C min- 1). A temperature criterion was proposed to define the right balance between the polymerization and the gelation to get the best mechanical properties (i. e., elongation and stress at break). The polymerization process must be slower than the gelation process as the polymerization must take place when PVC grains have fused together to form a homogeneous medium at least at the microscale. Actually, the polymerization kinetics can be controlled by the decomposition kinetics of the organic peroxide. Finally, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate and lauryl methacrylate monomers and dicumyl peroxide as initiator {{turned out to be the}} best reactive system for some potential industrial application...|$|R
