25|$|The <b>social</b> <b>milieu</b> {{was that}} of a few Austronesian men who settled on the {{outskirts}} of an East Trans-Fly group, intermarried, and whose children were either bilingual, or speakers of their mothers' language, with some knowledge of their fathers' language. The local people did not need to speak the traders' language, who in turn had to speak the local language. The children in turn would then speak the local language, with varying ability in the fathers' language, particularly in areas that were culturally important for the fathers.|$|E
25|$|It {{was into}} this {{environment}} and <b>social</b> <b>milieu</b> that trade union leader James Larkin (a Liverpool-born Irish Catholic) arrived in January 1907. He {{was sent to}} Belfast by James Sexton, head of the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL), {{with the aim of}} bringing the dock workers and carters into the union. Addressing crowds of people on the steps of Belfast's Custom House, he vociferously articulated the grievances of the working classes. Due to his charismatic personality and considerable oratorial skill, Larkin succeeded in unionising the unskilled Protestant and Catholic workers.|$|E

25|$|In his seminal study (1982) on livable {{streets that}} was {{conducted}} in neighbourhoods with a grid, Donald Appleyard showed that social networking and street playing degraded as traffic increased on a street. His research provided the groundwork for traffic calming and for several initiatives such as living streets and Home Zones, {{all of which are}} aimed at improving a street's <b>social</b> <b>milieu.</b> The amount of traffic on a street depends on variables such as the population density of the neighbourhood, car ownership and its proximity to commercial, institutional or recreational edifices. Most importantly, however, it depends on whether a street is or could become a through road to a destination. As a through road, it could sustain unpredictable levels of traffic that may fluctuate during the day and increase over time.|$|E
25|$|Although {{strongly}} influenced by traditional mento and calypso music, as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, reggae owes its direct origins to the ska and rocksteady of 1960s Jamaica. The generic title for Jamaican music recorded between 1961 and 1967, ska emerged from Jamaican R, which itself was largely based on American R and doo-wop. Rastafari entered some countries primarily through reggae music; thus, the movement in these places is more particularly stamped by its origins in reggae music and <b>social</b> <b>milieu.</b> The Rastafari movement was a significant influence on reggae, with Rasta drummers like Count Ossie taking part in seminal recordings. One of the predecessors of reggae drumming is the Nyabinghi rhythm, a style of ritual drumming performed as a communal meditative practice in the Rastafarian life.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{views on}} slavery {{represent}} {{a complex and}} multifaceted body of Islamic thought, with various Islamic groups or thinkers espousing views on the matter which have been radically different throughout history. Slavery was a mainstay of life in pre-Islamic Arabia and surrounding lands. It was in this <b>social</b> <b>milieu</b> that Islam emerged, whence the Quran and the hadith (sayings of Muhammad) address slavery extensively, assuming its existence as part of society but viewing it as an exceptional condition and restricting its scope. Early Islamic dogma forbade enslavement of free members of Islamic society, including non-Muslims (dhimmis), {{and set out to}} improve conditions of human bondage. In later classical Islamic law, the topic of slavery is covered at great length. Slaves, be they Muslim or those of any other religion, were equal to their fellow practitioners in religious issues.|$|E

France was seen {{at the time as}} a model of civilization and progress. The literary nationalism began in the 1840s with the works of José de Alencar, who used French literary models to describe the regions and <b>social</b> <b>milieus</b> of Brazil.

25|$|Mozart's music, like Haydn's, {{stands as}} an {{archetype}} of the Classical style. At {{the time he}} began composing, European music was dominated by the style galant, a reaction against the highly evolved intricacy of the Baroque. Progressively, and in large part {{at the hands of}} Mozart himself, the contrapuntal complexities of the late Baroque emerged once more, moderated and disciplined by new forms, and adapted to a new aesthetic and <b>social</b> <b>milieu.</b> Mozart was a versatile composer, and wrote in every major genre, including symphony, opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including string quartet and string quintet, and the piano sonata. These forms were not new, but Mozart advanced their technical sophistication and emotional reach. He almost single-handedly developed and popularized the Classical piano concerto. He wrote a great deal of religious music, including large-scale masses, as well as dances, divertimenti, serenades, and other forms of light entertainment.|$|E
25|$|Dembski {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, {{the only child of}} Catholic parents, his mother an art dealer and his father a college {{professor}} and lecturer. His father held a D.Sc. in biology from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and taught evolutionary biology; while growing up Dembski was neither particularly religious nor did he question the theory of evolution. He attended an all-male Catholic preparatory school in Chicago. Dembski finished high school a year early, excelling in math and finishing a calculus course in one summer. After high school he attended the University of Chicago. There, Dembski experienced educational and personal difficulties, struggling with the advanced courses and finding the unfamiliar <b>social</b> <b>milieu</b> of college challenging. Dembski dropped out of school and worked at his mother's art business while reading works on creationism and the Bible. Finding the creationist works interesting in their challenge of evolution but their literal interpretations lacking, Dembski returned to school at the University of Illinois at Chicago, studying statistics.|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{efforts were}} rarely {{organised}}, those that were, were organised through the traditional social networks of the Islands; {{the absence of}} political parties and the weakness of trade unions meant that political networks that facilitated resistance in other countries were lacking in the Channel Islands. Patriotic pride was bound up more in survival than in imagery of resistance. Some individuals who were later eligible for awards from the Soviet Union for their help towards Soviet prisoners were reluctant to participate in what they considered propaganda. Personal contacts between fugitive prisoners and the families that had helped them were in some cases maintained after the war despite the Cold War and the barriers to communication. Communists and conscientious objectors, groups regarded with disdain by many Islanders, were among those who identified with and sympathised with fugitive workers. Others sympathised on compassionate grounds; some offering help {{in the way they}} hoped members of their own family caught up in the war might be treated by others wherever they might be. Some saw helping fugitives as the only practical way of defying the Germans in the face of obstacles to more active forms of resistance. In other occupied countries, those who sheltered victims of Nazism were generally offering help to local deserters from forced service and Jews – mostly their friends, neighbours, family, or people from the same <b>social</b> <b>milieu.</b> With so few Jews in the community, and the forced labour situation being different, in the Channel Islands those who helped fugitives were generally harbouring strangers with whom they did not share a language.|$|E
40|$|Despite its {{prevalence}} {{in academic}} research, formal adoption {{is actually a}} specific sort of child placement. The more general phenomenon of the circulation of children could better help us to explain the centrality of minors in broader <b>social</b> <b>milieus,</b> since so-called ‘informal’ placements do frequently act as productive and reproductive strategies with social cohesion purposes that go far beyond the specificity of the punctual child transfer. These forms of child mobility are commonly found in many cultures, including our own in a not so distant past and may become a crucial social structuring factor...|$|R
5000|$|As a {{community}} sociologist, Wellman began arguing {{that too much}} analysis of life online was happening in isolation from other aspects of everyday life.

[...] The New York Post critic Farran Smith Nehme disagreed, writing, [...] "While the <b>social</b> <b>milieu</b> is nicely realized, other parts of the drama are not.

40|$|The {{application}} of Marxist analysis in accounting has been seriously hampered by an economistic specter, promulgated even {{by those who}} profess to be “Marxists”. One consequence for accounting research has been a regression into culturalist, linguistic, and relativistic analysis, that putatively eschew the “Grand Narratives ” of critical social analysis. Using two recent contributions to the accounting literature, this paper examines accounting variants of this mis-reading of Marx, and their roots {{in terms of the}} <b>social</b> <b>milieus</b> in which Marxism evolved.

40|$|Based on Moscovici’s (1961) {{classical}} {{study on}} the cultivation of psychoanalytic ideas in France in the 1950 ’s and our own research on modern biotechnology, we propose a paradigm for researching social representations. Following {{a consideration of the}} nature of representations and of the ‘iconoclastic suspicion’ that haunts them, we propose a model of the emergence of meaning relating three elements: subjects, objects, and projects. The basic unit of analysis is the elongated triangle of mediation (SOPS) : subject 1, object, project, and subject 2, captured in the image of a ‘Toblerone’. Such social units cultivate, that is produce, circulate and receive representation which may be embodied in four modes–habitual behaviour, individual cognition, informal communication and formal communication–and in three mediums–words, visual images or non-linguistic sounds. We propose an operational definition of a ‘social representation’ as the comparison of four characteristics of communication systems: the content structures (anchorings and objectifications; core and peripheral elements), the typified processes (diffusion, propagation, propaganda etc.), and their functions (identity, attitude, opinion, resistance, ideology etc.), within the context of segmented <b>social</b> <b>milieus.</b> Seven implications for research on social representations are outlined: (1) content and process; (2) segmentation by <b>social</b> <b>milieus</b> rather than taxonomies; (3) cultivation studies within social milieus; (4) multi-method (mode and medium) analysis; (5) time structures and longitudinal data; (6) the crossover of cultural projects and trajectories; (7) the disinterested research attitude.
