40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the performance of seed drill with different covering devices of wheat seeds. The parameters used for evaluation were draft, seed depth, fuel consumption, number of plants/mt, power requirement and length of plant root. The experiment was designed as split plot and the main plot was the seed covering devices and the sub plot was forward speed. An instrumented tractor was used that consisted of sensitive sensors and a datalogger for measuring and recording performance parameters including fuel consumption, tractor forward speed and draft. Experiments were conducted with four types of seed covering devices named: <b>spike</b> <b>tooth,</b> wooden sweep, chains and smooth plastic wheel. Seed drill performance parameters were measured at various forward speeds (5. 94, 6. 53 and 7. 65 kmIh) and the planting depth was adjusted on 50 mm before planting. The results showed that there were significant differences among the used seed covering devices and forward speeds for all performance parameters were found. The <b>spike</b> <b>tooth</b> seed covering device had the smallest average value of draft compared with the other seed covering devices and was equal to 3. 85 kN as average for three forward speeds. On the other hand, the smooth plastic wheel seed covering device had the smallest average values of fuel consumption and seed depth, and big~est average values of length of plant root and number of plants/m compared with the other seed covering devices and were equal to 16. 36 litlh, 53. 11 rnm, 94. 3 rnm, and 174 plants/m' respectively as average for the three forward speeds...|$|R

The objective {{of this paper was}} to obtain the structural variables of a TLFC unit by theoretical modeling and experimentation on a tangential flow threshing cylinder unit (TFC unit) and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder unit (LFC unit). Threshing and separation equations for five types of threshing teeth (knife bar, trapezoidal <b>tooth,</b> <b>spike</b> <b>tooth,</b> rasp bar, and rectangular bar), were obtained using probability theory. Results demonstrate that the threshing and separation capacity of the knife bar TFC unit was stronger than the other threshing teeth. The length of the LFC unit was divided into four sections, with helical blades on the first section (0 - 0. 17 m), the <b>spike</b> <b>tooth</b> on the second section (0. 17 - 1. 48 m), the trapezoidal tooth on the third section (1. 48 - 2. 91 m), and the discharge plate on the fourth section (2. 91 - 3. 35 m). Test results showed an un-threshed grain rate of 0. 243 %, un-separated grain rate of 0. 346 %, and broken grain rate of 0. 184 %. Evidenced by these results, threshing and separation performance is significantly improved by analyzing and optimizing the structure and variables of a TLFC unit.

As the early 2WTs did not have steering clutches, longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content.

Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment.
