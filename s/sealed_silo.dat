40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to study}} the co-processing of POPs (DDTs and HCHs) {{contaminated}} soil as an alternative raw material for sustainable clinker production. The milling system designed solely to contaminated soil was introduced with hot air (250 - 350 °C) to dry water and simultaneously vaporize POPs. The gaseous POPs was directly destroyed in the precalciner, while the milled soil with partly removal of organic pollutants was homogenized in a <b>sealed</b> <b>silo</b> and then took part in clinker sintering. According to the experiment results the moisture content reached an average of 0. 4 %, and the average 200 μm and 80 μm sieve residues were 1. 9 % and 19. 0 % respectively after grinding. Furthermore, clinkers and emission which were produced with contaminated soil as SiO 2 substitute were monitored. There was no DDTs and HCHs residue both in clinkers and in exhaust, which demonstrated the success of eliminating organic pollutants and utilizing the soil as alternative SiO 2 materials in our cement plant...|$|E

However, fumigating in {{unsealed}} structures {{is the leading cause}} of control failures and subsequent development of insect resistance. Sealing the storage structure is the only practical way to ensure a complete kill of all insects at all life stages. The cost, effort, and feasibility of sealing a U. S. corrugated steel silo during construction was evaluated and compared against an Australian <b>sealed</b> <b>silo</b> designed for fumigation. Gas monitoring and thermosiphon recirculation equipment was installed on both silos. Fumigation efficacy was evaluated using pressure half-life decay times, fumigant concentrations, insect bioassays, and grain quality data. Three fumigations with phosphine (PH₃) pellets or tablets and two with VAPORPH₃OS® cylinderized PH₃ and ProFume® cylinderized sulfuryl fluoride (SF) were performed in each silo for a total of ten experimental treatments. The Australian silo required 266 man-hours to construct and cost $ 180 for additional sealing, compared to 359 man-hours and $ 3, 284 for constructing and sealing the U. S. silo. The Australian silo had a maximum pressure half-life decay time of 163 s versus 50 s for the U. S. silo. At application rates of 1. 5 g/mᶟ of PH₃ both silos maintained an average concentration of approximately 0. 28 g/mᶟ for 14 days. With thermosiphon recirculation the average minimum-to-maximum PH₃ concentration ratio in the U. S. silo was 0. 52, compared to a ratio of 0. 17 when fumigating without thermosiphon recirculation. Greater than 99 % adult mortality was observed in all insect bioassays which included PH₃ resistant strains of R. dominica and T. castaneum. The average emergence from fumigated bioassays was 7 adult insects, compared to an average of 383 adults for the non-fumigated controls. Grain stored for 10 months in the sealed silos increased from approximately 11. 5 % to 17 % m. c. in the top 0. 3 m of grain, and decreased in test weight from approximately 77 to 65 kg/hL. Although the Australian silo retained higher fumigant concentrations than the U. S. silo, fumigations were successful in both. Long-term storage in sealed silos is a concern because grain quality can deteriorate due to condensation and mold in the top grain layer...|$|E

40|$|Timber {{storage is}} a key aspect of storm damage management. After huge storms, {{sprinkling}} storage is usually the most used conservation process but anaerobic storage in <b>sealed</b> <b>silos</b> appears as good alternative to preserve wood quality over long periods. This paper investigates the impact of long-term (57 months) storage of Norway spruce logs in anaerobic atmosphere on wood properties. Tests were performed on clear wood specimens and on lumbers to determine the modulus of elasticity (E), the static bending strength (σf) and the dynamic bending strength (K). Storage effects on impregnability and colour variation were also studied. Results show no effect of storage on E, σf and K. The naturally poor impregnability of Norway spruce is not improved by the anaerobic conditions, compared to traditional wet storage. Triangle tests reveal no discernible colour variation between logs that underwent anaerobic storage and the control sample. As a conclusion, despite a mould (Gliocladium solani) frequently observed on logs surface after the storage, the process offers ideal conservation conditions. While overall cost remains the main drawback for using anaerobic storage at large scale, the process can be recommended for high value logs, especially since it has few environmental impacts.

40|$|Managing pests of stored grain {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} serious problem in Brazil. This is because grain production {{has more than doubled}} in the last 10 years and insect pests have become resistant to protectant insecticides. In the same period, use of phosphine fumigation has increased rapidly and is now widely practised. However, control failures with phosphine have become common as fumigations are undertaken in unsealed silos and in situations where sanitation is poor. As a consequence, many parcels of grain are repeatedly fumigated. In response to this situation, Embrapa initiated a programme to introduce IPM into the central grain storage facilities. Our strategy included the following elements: (a) changing behaviour through training of the storage facilities personnel; (b) improving knowledge of stored grain unit; (c) cleanliness of the equipment and premises and, after that, spray residual insecticide; (d) identification of grain-stored pests; (e) resistance tests; (f) insecticide treatment and fumigation; (g) sampling and monitoring the grain. The IPM programme was introduced into two storage facilities in Paraná State. Following successful implementation of IPM, these facilities were able to supply insect-free grain and had a bonus from the market. The success of these companies led to the adoption of IPM by other storage companies. IPM systems are now running in 13 separate facilities owned by nine companies. To support the programme, Embrapa Wheat has trained more than 1, 000 stored grain operators and released an IPM manual and website www. cnpt. embrapa. br/pesquisa/entomologia/mip.

In, response to the increasing global concern on safety and environment, new applications had been developed to expand {{the use of these}} two phosphine fumigants. As an alternative to methyl bromide, new fumigation protocols for Eco 2 Fume and Vaporph 3 OS ® to kill all stages of insects were established and approved in the USA which allows a shorter fumigation time of 24 hrs at 500 - 1, 000 ppm phosphine concentration and 27 °C or higher temperatures. In Australia, a new fumigation protocol was approved which can completely kill all stages of insects in 3 - 24 days at 70 – 700 ppm phosphine concentration and 15 -> 30 °C temperature. Trials conducted on the fruit fumigation showed that cylinderised phosphine can effectively kill all stages of insects using 1400 ppm at 0 - 6 °C in 48 – 72 hours and a residue level below the maximum residue limit of 0. 01 mg/kg. For treatment of exported cut flower and foliage in New Zealand, a shorter fumigation time of 4 hours is in commercial use with Eco 2 Fume under vacuum condition.

A heat disinfestation system can be designed and developed which will balance the workable window between heat dosage, insect mortality and damage to the commodity or grain quality.

The system needs to be simple, easy to use and operate and cost effective. Two approaches are being considered. The first is a low-cost spouted bed system capable of disinfesting at 10 t h – 1.

There were no significant differences in nutritional composition of silages between conventional and double sealing.

Botswana is an arid area, it can go {{for longer periods of}} time without rain and therefore hermetic storage has helped in times without rain i.e. draught. Seeds are well stored for the next season of plowing even though at times seeds are purchase. Usually seeds purchase is done in supplementary measures. In Botswana, traditional people usually use the hermetic storage placed inside a jute bag to increase efficiency and effectiveness in eradicating living organisms within few days. Also, hermetic is crucial in Africa as most of the seeds are produced and stored in the farm. Experimental results proved that hermetic storage of seeds for twelve months can retain germination and viability characteristics, whilst extremely harsh conditions can render an opposite effect.Brazilian grain producers are starting to use hermetic bags on site to store grains as an alternative to bins. They claim that the cost is accessible and the quality of the grain remains the same for a period of 18 months. The bags are made of polyethylene that are capable of reflect sunlight and avoid the heating of the product as well as degradation by light.Argentina has to, frequently, deal with a storage shortage of 20 to 35 million tonnes of grain. This led to quality and quantity loss since the grain has to be transported directly from the farms to elevators, and from elevators to terminal ports. Hermetically <b>sealed</b> plastic bags (<b>silo</b> bags) has gained popularity among producers to overcome this issue. In 2008 harvest season, more than 33 million tonnes of grain were stored using the silo bags in the country for several grains and oilseeds, and, now, this technology is being adopted by other South American countries.Sealed bag has been used to store mostly silage in North America, however, the use of this storage system started to grown since the early 2000s. Still, instead using hermetic choices, the most common option when dealing with storage shortage is piling the grain on the ground.|$|R
