5000|$|A <b>strap</b> <b>wrench</b> is any {{of various}} types of wrench that grip an object via a strap or chain being pulled in tension around it until it firmly grips. High static {{friction}} keeps it from slipping.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{oil-filter}} <b>wrenches</b> {{are actually}} <b>strap</b> <b>wrenches.</b> Others {{are of the}} socket type or the pliers type.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>strap</b> <b>wrenches</b> have {{built-in}} handles. Others {{are made}} to receive the square drive of a ratchet wrench.|$|R
5000|$|Piston-ring {{compressors}} are <b>strap</b> <b>wrenches</b> that evenly squeeze (compress) {{the piston}} rings around a piston {{long enough to}} slide it into a cylinder. They {{look a lot like}} an oil-filter <b>wrench</b> of the <b>strap</b> type ( [...] Except they are a flat piece of metal that wraps around the piston). If no wrench is available, an old piston ring snapped into two halves can be used to compress each of the new rings as the piston is inserted.|$|R
