Conditioned on the interference phase, an equivalent loop model of the limiter phase detector is developed under this situation. The conditional cycle slip rate is obtained by adapting a recent formula, and the mean cycle slip rate is reported for the uniformly distributed interference phase. It is shown that the cochannel interference enhances the mean cycle slip rate by reducing the relevant effective loop signal-to-noise ratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of setup of three point linkage on {{energetic}} and performance parameters of tractor aggregate. For this purpose were made two series of measurements. The first series was realized with the tractor NewHolland T 7050 aggregate with 5 -furrow reversible plough plough KUHN HUARD VM 150 5 NS. Data such as engine load, engine revolution, diesel fuel consumption, diesel fuel temperature, were got from CAN Bus network during the measurement. Then were measured following parameters total time of ploughing, dephth of ploughing, time of turning and swath of the tractor aggregate. The specific consumption of diesel fuel and the efficiency of the aggregate were calculated using the aforementioned parameters. The second series of measurements was realized with the tractor Zetor Proxima Plus 115 aggregate with four-furrow plough Kverneland 150 B. During the measurement the data such theoretical and actual speed of the tractor and force in the top link of three point hitch were recorded in the computer. Then were measured following parameters such as main time of ploughing, dephth of ploughing and swath of the tractor aggregate. By the first and second tractor aggregate were approved linear dependence of <b>slip,</b> <b>performance</b> and fuel consumption on the force in top link of three point linkage...|$|E
40|$|Wheel slip is {{a common}} problem in {{planetary}} rover exploration tasks. During the current Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, the Spirit rover almost became trapped on a dune because of wheel slip. As rover missions on harsh terrains expand in scope, mission success will depend not only on rover safety, but also alacrity in task completion. Speed combined with exploration of varied and difficult terrains, the risk of slip increases dramatically. We first characterize <b>slip</b> <b>performance</b> of a rover on harsh terrains by implementing a novel High Fidelity Traversability Analysis (HFTA) algorithm {{in order to provide}} slip prediction and detection capabilities to a planetary rover. The algorithm, utilizing path and energy cost functions in conjunction with simulated navigation, allows a rover to select the best path through any given terrain by predicting high slip paths. Integrated software allows the rover to then accurately follow a designated path while compensating for slippage, and reach intended goals independent of the terrain over which it is traversing. The algorithm was verified using ROAMS, a high fidelity simulation package, at 3. 5 x real time speed. We propose an adaptive path following algorithm as well as a human-trained neural network to traverse multiple harsh terrains using slip as an advantage. On a near-real-time system, and at rover speeds 15 times the current average speed of the Mars Exploration Rovers, we show that the adaptive algorithm traverses paths in less time than a standard path follower. We also train a standard back-propagation neural network, using human and path following data from a near-real-time system. The neural network demonstrates it ability to traverse new paths on multiple terrains and utilize slip to minimize time and path error. M. S.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of two commercially available offset mechanical reinforcement bar splice systems is presented. The two splice systems, the BarSplice Double Barrel Zap Screwlok© and the Lenton QuickWedge©, were evaluated in four series of tests with reinforcement bar sizes ranging from # 4 to # 6. The tests were as follows: Direct Tension which tested the splice in open-air tension and allowed the splice to rotate freely; Restrained Tension which tested the reinforcement splice {{in a manner that}} inhibited the splice from rotating; Fatigue testing cycled the specimens through a 20 ksi (172 MPa) stress range for 10, 000 cycles; In situ beam tests embedded the splices in concrete beams. The beams were subjected to monotonic testing to failure with and without initial fatigue conditioning. Observations from the tension tests indicate current test methods do not effectively evaluate offset splices. Current practice assumes direct tension testing to be a conservative method for evaluating the ultimate load carrying capacity, and the slip through the splice. Due to rotation produced by the self aligning loads, there is an increase in load carrying capacity caused by large frictional forces at the face of the coupler. The restrained tension tests show promise as an effective test method for mitigating these large friction forces, and more accurately predicting in situ behavior of these types of splices, particular expected <b>slip</b> <b>performance.</b> Fatigue testing for offset mechanical splices proved to be an impractical test method for this type of splice. Results from this program correlate with the limiting stress restrictions contained in current design provisions. Flexural beam tests demonstrated that there was little degradation from fatigue conditioning on the performance of the splice. In situ tests also demonstrated that concrete was unable to confine the splice and prevent rotation near ultimate load levels...|$|E
40|$|Existing models {{assume that}} pursuit {{attempts}} a direct minimization of retinal image motion or "slip" (e. g. Robinson et al., 1986; Krauzlis & Weisberger, 1989). Using occluded line-figure stimuli, we have previously shown that humans can accurately pursue stimuli for which perfect tracking does not zero retinal slip (Neurologic ARCO). These findings are {{inconsistent with the}} standard control strategy of matching eye motion to a target-motion signal reconstructed by adding retinal slip and eye motion, but consistent with a visual front-end which estimates target motion via a global spatio-temporal integration for pursuit and perception. Another {{possible explanation is that}} pursuit simply attempts to minimize slip perpendicular to the segments (and neglects parallel "sliding" motion). To resolve this, 4 observers (3 naive) were asked to pursue the center of 2 types of stimuli with identical velocity-space descriptions and matched motion energy. The line-figure "diamond" stimulus was viewed through 2 invisible 3 deg-wide vertical apertures (38 cd/m 2 equal to background) such that only the sinusoidal motion of 4 oblique line segments (44 cd/m 2 was visible. The "cross" was identical except that the segments exchanged positions. Two trajectories (8 's and infinity's) with 4 possible initial directions were randomly interleaved (1. 25 cycles, 2. 5 s period, Ax = Ay = 1. 4 deg). In 91 % of trials, the diamond appeared rigid. Correspondingly, pursuit was vigorous (mean Again: 0. 74) with a V/H aspect ratio approx. 1 (mean: 0. 9). Despite a valid rigid solution, the cross however appeared rigid in 8 % of trials. Correspondingly, pursuit was weaker (mean Hgain: 0. 38) with an incorrect aspect ratio (mean: 1. 5). If pursuit were just minimizing perpendicular <b>slip,</b> <b>performance</b> would be the same in both conditions...|$|E

To {{explore the}} {{performance}} of the flexible nodes between the precast concrete exterior wall cladding panel and the frame structure, a steel truss is used as an analogue of the frame structure to develop a test.

Hence, {{in order to gain}} fundamental knowledge on wear mechanism, progressive wear and surface alteration processes of the shoes are investigated during repetitive dry rubbing. It is assumed that geometry changes of the shoe surface caused by wear development would be a major factor that affects the <b>slip</b> resistance <b>performance.</b> With the measurements of slip resistance, wear characteristics of two different shoes are comprehensively investigated based on the surface analyses and microscopic observations. For the systematic investigation of the surface alterations, topographic changes of each shoe were thoroughly examined on a regular time basis. The results show that surface alterations of each shoe were more severe than expected and occurred from the very early stage of sliding. It is also found that initially unstable friction process changed into the steady state friction process in the later stage of the slip resistance tests...|$|R

Anti lock brake system (ABS) which is a nonlinear system, may not be easily controlled by classical control methods. An intelligent Fuzzy control method is very useful {{for this kind of}} nonlinear system.

In this paper, an intelligent fuzzy ABS controller is designed to adjust <b>slipping</b> <b>performance</b> for variety of roads. There are tow major sections in the proposing control system. First section consists of tow Fuzzy-Logic Controllers (FLC) providing optimal brake torque for both front and rear wheels.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{performance analysis}} results of SMC (Sliding mode control) with changing the chattering functions applied to slip suppression problem of electric vehicles (EVs). In SMC, chattering phenomenon always occurs through high frequency switching {{of the control}} inputs. It is undesirable phenomenon and degrade the control performance, since it causes the oscillations of the control inputs. Several {{studies have been conducted}} on this problem by introducing some general saturation function. However, study about whether saturation function was really best and the performance analysis when using the other functions, weren't being done so much. Therefore, in this paper, several candidate functions for SMC are selected and control performance of candidate functions is analyzed. In the analysis, evaluation function based on the trade-off between <b>slip</b> suppression <b>performance</b> and chattering reduction performance is proposed. The analyses are conducted in several numerical simulations of slip suppression problem of EVs. Then, we can see that there is no difference of employed candidate functions in chattering reduction performance. On the other hand, in <b>slip</b> suppression <b>performance,</b> the saturation function is excellent overall. So, we conclude the saturation function is most suitable for slip suppression sliding mode control...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalized nonlinear (Markov) analysis technique {{that is used}} to evaluate the statistical performance of uniforn ly sampled digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) demodulators. Although the rigorous analysis of the statistical performance of the analog PLL for digitally modulated signals (i. e., Costas loops) remains an open problem, the discrete time analysis for MPSK modulation is tractable. This paper characterizes the first-order, decisiondirected DPLL based demodulator as a Markov chain. Traditional analytical techniques are used to evaluate the steady-state statistical performance. Numerical results for the steady-state density function are derived for BPSK, QPSK, and 8 PSK. The resulting steady-state bit error probabilities for these modulations are also calculated. Traditional Markov analytical techniques (absorbing boundaries) permit a numerical evaluation of the transient characteristics of the DPLL. The numerical work focuses on loops for both unmodulated and BPSK, QPSK, andl 8 PSK modulated input signals. The transient characteristics are shown to be a function of the loop bandwidth but converge to those predicted by a diffusion analysis as the loop bandwidth decreases. The susceptibility of small bandwidth loops to hangup is shown to be the largest reason for the acquisition performance difference. The cycle slipping characterization for 2 ̆ 7 MPSK modulated signals is also a function of the loop bandwidth and each increase (doubling) of the modulation alphabet size reduces the <b>slipping</b> <b>performance</b> by approximately 6 dB...|$|R

40|$|The {{algorithms}} {{described in}} this thesis are designed to schedule cells in a very high-speed, parallel, input-queued crossbar switch. We present several novel scheduling algorithms that we have devised, each aims to match the set of inputs of an input-queued switch to the set of outputs more efficiently, fairly and quickly than existing techniques. In Chapter 2 we present the simplest and fastest of these algorithms: SLIP [...] - a parallel algorithm that uses rotating priority ("round-robin") arbitration. SLIP is simple: it is readily implemented in hardware and can operate at high speed. SLIP has high performance: for uniform i. i. d. Bernoulli arrivals, SLIP is stable for any admissible load, because the arbiters tend to desynchronize. We present analytical results to model this behavior. However, SLIP is not always stable and is not always monotonic: adding more traffic can actually make the algorithm operate more efficiently. We present an approximate analytical model of this behavior. SLIP prevents starvation: all contending inputs are eventually served. We present simulation results, indicating <b>SLIP's</b> <b>performance.</b> We argue that SLIP can be readily implemented for a 32 x 32 switch on a single chip. In Chapter 3 we present i-SLIP, an iterative algorithm that improves upon SLIP by converging on a maximal size match. The performance of i-SLIP improves with up to log 2 N iterations. We show that although it has a longer running time than SLIP, an i-SLIP scheduler is little more complex to implement. In Chapter 4 we describe maximum or maximal weight matching algorithms based on the occupancy of queues, or waiting times of cells. These algorithms are stabl [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a four-part needle prototype inspired by the ovipositor of parasitic wasps. In the wasp ovipositor, three longitudinal segments called valves move reciprocally to gain depth in the substrate. It has been suggested that serrations located along the wasp ovipositor induce a friction difference between moving and anchoring valves that is needed for this reciprocal motion. Such an anchoring mechanism may not be desired in a medical setting, as serrations can induce tissue damage. Our aim was to investigate whether a multipart needle can penetrate tissue phantom material with near-zero net push force while using needle parts devoid of surface gripping textures or serrations. Accordingly, a four-part needle prototype was developed and tested in gelatine substrates. The performance of the prototype was assessed in terms of the degree of slipping of the needle with respect to the gelatine, with less <b>slip</b> implying better <b>performance.</b> <b>Slip</b> decreased with decreasing gelatine concentration and increasing offset between the needle parts.
