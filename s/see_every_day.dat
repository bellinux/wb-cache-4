Saran {{said in an interview}} that the film basically has a family-oriented theme and is about falling in love with [...] "small, little things that you sort of don't <b>see</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> but are really, really important". Unlike other reincarnation based films, the film's story develops two separate themes— the relationship between reborn lovers, but also the relationship between reborn parents and their children. Naga Chaitanya acknowledged in an interview with The Hindu that the film's script might seem to have a few overly-convenient coincidences, but felt that Kumar's detailing in every scene made the script believable.|$|E

She told Warhol that he should paint [...] "Something you <b>see</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> and something that everybody would recognize. Something like a can of Campbell's Soup." [...] Ted Carey, who was there at the time, said that Warhol responded by exclaiming: [...] "Oh that sounds fabulous." [...] According to Carey, Warhol went to a supermarket the following day and bought a case of [...] "all the soups", which Carey said he saw when he stopped by Warhol's apartment the next day. When the art critic G. R. Swenson asked Warhol in 1963 why he painted soup cans, the artist replied, [...] "I used to drink it, I used to have the same lunch every day, for twenty years." ...|$|E

Chairman Mao". Harvey Milk, who spoke at political rallies at the Temple, wrote to Jones after one such visit: [...] "Rev Jim, It may take me many a day to come back down from the high that I reach today. I found something dear today. I found a sense of being that makes up for all the hours and energy placed in a fight. I found what you wanted me to find. I shall be back.

60|$|The {{greatest}} painters {{who have}} ever lived {{have tried to}} paint the beauty of that simple thing--a mother with her babe: and have failed. One of them, Rafaelle by name, to whom God gave the spirit of beauty in a measure in which he never gave it, perhaps, to any other man, tried again and again, for years, painting {{over and over that}} simple subject--the mother and her babe--and could not satisfy himself. Each of his pictures is most beautiful--each in a different way; and yet none of them is perfect.

To {{come into the}} world in imbecility, {{in the midst of}} anguish and cries; to be the toy of ignorance, of error, of necessity, of sickness, of malice, of all passions; to return step by step to that imbecility whence one sprang; from the moment when we lisp our first words, down to the moment when we mumble the words of our dotage, to live among rascals and charlatans of every kind; to lie expiring between a man who feels your pulse, and another man who frets and wearies your head; not to know whence one comes, nor why one has come, nor whither one is going--that is what we call the greatest gift of our parents and of nature--human life."[206] ...|$|E
60|$|In many cases, where a fault {{has been}} {{publicly}} committed, it seems, at first view, {{to be necessary}} {{that it should be}} publicly punished; but the end will, in most cases, be answered, if it is noticed publicly, so that the pupils may know that it received attention, and then the ultimate disposal of the case, may be made a private affair, between the teacher and the individual concerned. If, however, every case of disobedience, or idleness, or disorder, is brought out publicly before the school, so that all witness the teacher's displeasure, and feel the effects of it, (for to witness it, is to feel its most unpleasant effects,) the school becomes, in a short time, hardened to such scenes. Unpleasant associations become connected with the management of the school, and the scholars are prepared to do wrong with less reluctance, since the consequence is only a repetition of what they are obliged to <b>see</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we <b>see</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?

6000|$|Some would now-a-days {{use that}} story merely {{to prove that}} the monkey's nature and the man's nature are, after all, one and the same. Well: I, at least, have never denied that there is a monkey-nature in man as there is a peacock-nature, and a swine-nature, and a wolf-nature--of all which four I <b>see</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> too much. The sharp and stern {{distinction}} between men and animals, as far as their natures are concerned, is of a more modern origin than people fancy. Of old the Assyrian took the eagle, the ox, and the lion--and not unwisely--as the three highest types of human capacity. The horses of Homer might be immortal, and weep for their master's death. The animals and monsters of Greek myth--like the Ananzi spider of Negro fable--glide insensibly into speech and reason. Birds--the most wonderful of all animals in the eyes of a man of science or a poet--are sometimes looked on as wiser, and nearer to the gods, than man. The Norseman--the noblest and ablest human being, save the Greek, of whom history can tell us--was not ashamed to say of the bear of his native forests that he had [...] "ten men's strength and eleven men's wisdom." [...] How could Reinecke Fuchs have gained immortality, in the Middle Ages and since, save by the truth of its too solid and humiliating theorem--that the actions of the world of men were, on the whole, guided by passions but too exactly like those of the lower animals?

6000|$|How rich {{in strange}} and {{touching}} utterances {{have been the}} last fifty years of English literature. Do you think that God has been teaching us nothing in them? Will He not make our children listen to that teaching, whether we like or not? And suppose our most modern writers had added nothing to the stock of national knowledge, which I most fervently deny, yet are they not actually influencing the minds of the young? and can we prevent their doing so either directly or indirectly? If we do not find them right teaching about their own day, will they not be sure to find self-chosen teachers about it themselves, who will be almost certainly the first who may come to hand, and therefore as likely as not to be bad teachers? And do we not <b>see</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> that it is just the most tender, the most enthusiastic, the most precious spirits, {{who are most likely to}} be misled, because their honest disgust at the follies of the day has most utterly outgrown their critical training? And that lazy wholesale disapprobation of living writers, so common and convenient, what does it do but injure all reverence for parents and teachers, when the young find out that the poet, who, as they were told, was a bungler and a charlatan, somehow continues to touch the purest and noblest nerves of their souls, and that the author who was said to be dangerous and unchristian, somehow makes them more dutiful, more earnest, more industrious, more loving to the poor?

6000|$|It {{seems to}} me, for my part, that Mr. Rawdon's {{marriage}} {{was one of}} the honestest actions which we shall have to record in any portion of that gentleman's biography which {{has to do with the}} present history. No one will say it is unmanly to be captivated by a woman, or, being captivated, to marry her; and the admiration, the delight, the passion, the wonder, the unbounded confidence, and frantic adoration with which, by degrees, this big warrior got to regard the little Rebecca, were feelings which the ladies at least will pronounce were not altogether discreditable to him. When she sang, every note thrilled in his dull soul, and tingled through his huge frame. When she spoke, he brought all the force of his brains to listen and wonder. If she was jocular, he used to revolve her jokes in his mind, and explode over them half an hour afterwards in the street, to the surprise of the groom in the tilbury by his side, or the comrade riding with him in Rotten Row. Her words were oracles to him, her smallest actions marked by an infallible grace and wisdom. [...] "How she sings,--how she paints," [...] thought he. [...] "How she rode that kicking mare at Queen's Crawley!" [...] And he would say to her in confidential moments, [...] "By Jove, Beck, you're fit to be Commander-in-Chief, or Archbishop of Canterbury, by Jove."
