Apart from the limited power of detecting associations, biobank studies aim to link genetic information to EHR phenotypes, despite the limitations from non-standard lab tests, ambiguity of diagnosis codes, geolocations, database diversity. A recent study [39] has identified three T 2 D subtypes {{on the basis of}} comorbidities (more than 11, 000 patients). Genomics can extend the stratification ability to cover genetically identified treatment strata. EHRs can instead enrich <b>strata</b> through <b>identification</b> of geographic areas with differential diabetes treatment (at risk neighbourhood-level community-based interventions) and from geo-localized environmental factors (say for instance triggers of autoimmunity), thus improving the precision prevention plan. Another study on more than 11, 000 T 2 D patients analyzed patient similarity with a topological approach and identified 3 clusters with specific features, confirmed then by use of SNPs [40]. Conversely, Big Data will require additional multiple testing penalties, need for replication, even if reproducibility of results may be an issue and interpretability too.|$|R
50|$|Sequence Stratigraphy is {{a branch}} of geology that {{attempts}} to subdivide and link sedimentary deposits into unconformity bound units {{on a variety of}} scales and explain these stratigraphic units in terms of variations in sediment supply and variations in the rate of change in accommodation space (often associated with changes in relative sea level). The essence of the method is mapping of <b>strata</b> based on <b>identification</b> of surfaces which are assumed to represent time lines (e.g. subaerial unconformities, maximum flooding surfaces), and therefore placing stratigraphy in chronostratigraphic framework. Sequence stratigraphy is a useful alternative to a lithostratigraphic approach, which emphasizes similarity of the lithology of rock units rather than time significance.|$|R

40|$|The {{interspersed}} repeat {{content of}} mammalian genomes has been best characterized in human, mouse and cow. In this study, we carried out de novo identification of repeated {{elements in the}} equine genome and identified previously unknown elements present at low copy number. The equine genome contains typical eutherian mammal repeats, but also has {{a significant number of}} hybrid repeats in addition to clade-specific Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINE). Equus caballus clade specific LINE 1 (L 1) repeats can be classified into approximately five subfamilies, three of which have undergone significant expansion. There are 1115 full-length copies of these equine L 1, but of the 103 presumptive active copies, 93 fall within a single subfamily, indicating a rapid recent expansion of this subfamily. We also analysed both interspersed and simple sequence repeats (SSR) genome-wide, finding that some repeat classes are spatially correlated with each other as well as with G+C content and gene density. Based on these spatial correlations, we have confirmed that recently-described ancestral vs. clade-specific genome territories can be defined by their repeat content. The clade-specific Short Interspersed Nuclear Element correlations were scattered over the genome and appear to have been extensively remodelled. In contrast, territories enriched for ancestral repeats tended to be contiguous domains. To determine if the latter territories were evolutionarily conserved, we compared these results with a similar analysis of the human genome, and observed similar ancestral repeat enriched domains. These results indicate that ancestral, evolutionarily conserved mammalian genome territories can be identified on the basis of repeat content alone. Interspersed repeats of different ages appear to be analogous to geologic <b>strata,</b> allowing <b>identification</b> of ancient vs. newly remodelled regions of mammalian genomes. D. L. Adelson, J.

The purpose of the system is to make current adequate decisions on determining of oil-and-gas saturation of <b>strata</b> and future <b>identification</b> of the most significant methods for that, with these methods forming the foundation of knowledge bases for oil-and-gas deposits of the Apsheron pe-ninsula of Azerbaijan.

40|$|Present models {{suggest that}} fluvial and marine depositional {{patterns}} were distinct from modern patterns {{prior to the}} appearance of land plants. Although these models are likely correct, problems exist when one attempts to distinguish between fluvial and shallow marine deposits in pre-Silurian strata, {{making it difficult to}} accurately determine depositional patterns. The lack of land plants and scarcity of body and trace fossils, especially in Precambrian and early Cambrian <b>strata,</b> make <b>identification</b> difficult. Based on core data and limited outcrops, the Lower Hickory Sandstone, a late Cambrian sandstone, has been interpreted to progress from fluvial to shallow marine. These data have allowed the development of an overall depositional model, but minimal detail of facies changes is available. Based on the limited data, both deltaic and estuarine models have been suggested for the Lower Hickory. Mining of the Lower Hickory for frac sand has created highwalls in the CarmeuseNA Mine, which provides an opportunity to study facies changes at this site. The CarmeuseNA Mine, located in McCulloch County, Texas, has exposed the formation along ~ 500 m long and 20 m-high faces, respectively. Because of limited exposure, only the south and west walls, as well as part of the east wall, could be examined. Digital photographs of the faces were mosaiced using standard photogrammetrical practices to produce visual representation of the highwalls. Bedding geometry was then mapped on the digital images to facilitate a detailed interpretation of the depositional process. Core and well data were used to map Hickory thickness to produce an isopach map. Four primary facies were observed in the quarry, dominated by small-scale and large-scale cross-bedding. Paleocurrents are generally unidirectional to the southsoutheast indicating a braided fluvial origin, but rarely opposing directions are seen. Bioturbation is rare low in the section, but increases upwards. Together with the rare herringbone cross-bedding, clay drapes, and bioturbation, a tidal influence is strongly suggested. The model suggested is a braided stream setting influenced and reworked by tides. A braided-delta fed by braided streams guided by a ridge and swale-dominated setting, which served as the sediment supply for the delta, is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of seismic energy generation and propagation, shallow high-resolution seismic-reflection surveys often fail in the identification of the shallowest horizons and, due to the limited offsets, accuracy of velocity analyses is often not very high. In recent years, Rayleigh wave dispersion analysis have proved to have good potential also for near-surface applications but dispersion curve inversion and related uncertainty evaluation pose serious problems to a completely stand-alone application. In order to overcome these problems a joint inversion scheme is proposed, which is based on the identification of the Pareto front, performed in the framework of a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA). Seismic data considered to design the two objectives are the Rayleigh wave dispersion curve and reflection travel times. We initially analyse a set of synthetic cases and evaluate the obtained results. A significant improvement of the retrieved models is observed as long as reflection travel times are added to the dispersion curve alone. Furthermore, the proposed methodology also provides relevant indications about the consistency of the overall inversion process. In fact, the distribution of the models in the objective space, the trend of the objectives over the passing generations and the evolution of the Pareto front can provide useful information to evaluate the provisional tentative interpretation (number of <b>strata</b> and reflector <b>identification)</b> inherently adopted for the data inversion. On the basis of the results obtained from the tests on the synthetic datasets, the analyses of a field dataset are interpreted as possible evidence of lateral heterogeneities...|$|R
30|$|Extensive {{fieldwork}} {{was done}} along several transverse cuttings across the imbricated, {{high and low}} folded thrust zones, including ten outcrops of stratigraphic section and six wells (Fig.  1). The distribution of the outcrops is almost perpendicular to the NW–SE trending palaeoshoreline as indicated by regional work of Jassim and Goeff (2006). The outcrops data have been integrated with oil well data. Particularly, this approach is focused on analysing changes in facies (both laterally and vertically), taking in consideration the geometric character of <b>strata</b> and the <b>identification</b> of key surfaces (e.g. unconformities, bioturbated surfaces, coquina bands, condestae sections) to determine the chronological order of basin filling and erosion events. From the imbricated zone, the following section was described and sampled: 1 -Qaywan, 2 -Kona Massy, 3 -Bazageer, 4 -Alasiwa, while from the high folded thrust zone the study sections are: 5 -Mergapan, 6 -Zeywey, 7 -Qarasirt, 8 -Khalakan, 9 -Smaqwly and 10 -Choman. They are traced and correlated with a stratigraphic succession from the oil wells, and they are: 1 -Miran (Mr. 1), 2 -Chamchamal (Ch. 1), 3 -Taq Taq (TT. 1), 4 -Qaradagh (QD. 1), 5 -Sangaw south (SS. 1) and 6 -Sarqla (SQ- 1). The parasequences and stacking pattern of the studied sequence were essentially based on the lithological, facies associations and biostratigraphic data, and also on the key surfaces (e.g. sequence boundaries and flooding surfaces) that, in combination with biostratigraphy, allow robust correlation. Also for palaeontological purposes, the planktonic, benthonic and large foraminifera were studied and analysed in more than 220 cooked samples and 188 thin sections. For cooking purposes, each sample was weighed, crushed and boiled for several hours, washed with tap water and dried and size-sorted using a set of different sieves; all specimens were picked and prepared for identification under a binocular microscope. Also, about 50 macrofossils have been identified of rudist, gastropods, pelecypods, ammonites, echinodermata and coral.|$|R
40|$|Discerning {{the roles}} of autogenic and {{allogenic}} controls on the deposition, accumulation and preservation of sedimentary successions requires characterisation {{at a variety of}} scales. This is especially true for paralic environments where the preserved stratigraphic record is complicated by spatial and temporal interactions of fluvial, wave and tidal processes. The Campanian Neslen Formation (Utah) represents a marine influenced fluvial succession that accumulated in a humid, low-latitude coastal plain. Detailed lithofacies, architectural element and sequence stratigraphic analyses of the succession has involved the collection of 106 sedimentary logs, 194 architectural panels, 2000 paleocurrent readings, analysis of ichnofacies, and the tracing of key stratal surfaces in order to elucidate the relative balance of autogenic and allogenic processes. Outcrops in a range of orientations relative to the palaeoshoreline, enable the geometries of complicated architectural elements to be constrained. Mapping of channelised elements in three dimensions and the quantified analysis of their facies and geometry has been undertaken. Study sites, average spacing 3 km, have been used to produce a regional-scale correlation between sub-environments. The lower Neslen Formation accumulated as part of a high-accommodation, transgressive succession with variable influence from marine processes. Point-bar elements in the lower Neslen Formation are isolated and lithofacies assemblages within these elements deviate from widely used facies models {{as a result of the}} combined effects of low fluvial discharge and the presence of raised mires, which acted to modify channel dynamics. High-resolution correlation of <b>strata</b> have enabled <b>identification</b> of a several marine-influenced intervals and hence a refined sequence stratigraphic framework is proposed. The upper Neslen Formation is interpreted to represent part of a lower accommodation, highstand succession within which channelised elements became increasingly amalgamated upwards. This study demonstrates a rare example of the transfer of the fluvial-to-marine transition zone into the stratigraphic record and the implications of this for the distribution of reservoir heterogeneities. In contrast with previous studies that emphasise sea-level change as the dominant control on paralic successions; this stratigraphic dataset demonstrates the extent to which autogenic processes can modify the allogenic stratigraphic signature. ...|$|R
