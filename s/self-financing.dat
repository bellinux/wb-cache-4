5|$|As far as {{possible}} elderly inmates were expected to undertake {{the same kind of}} work as the younger men and women, although concessions were made to their relative frailty. They might alternatively be required to chop firewood, clean the wards, or carry out other domestic tasks. In 1882 Lady Brabazon, later the Countess of Meath, set up a project to provide alternative occupation for non-able-bodied inmates, known as the Brabazon scheme. Volunteers provided training in crafts such as knitting, embroidery and lace making, all costs initially being borne by Lady Brabazon herself. Although slow to take off, when workhouses discovered that the goods being produced were saleable and could make the enterprise <b>self-financing,</b> the scheme gradually spread across the country, and by 1897 there were more than 100 branches.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} empirical result that <b>self-finance</b> is an important option for people when financing entrepreneurship. It is, however, not entirely clear what the theoretical explanations for this might look like. In fact, the leading entrepreneurial theories even {{seem to indicate that}} questions about the existence and extent of entrepreneurship more or less are disconnected from the question of <b>self-finance.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify and distill some distinctive theoretical arguments for why <b>self-finance</b> is so important and to clarify what the barriers to <b>self-finance</b> look like. The decisive theoretical argument is that problems related to individual differences in information, perception, interpretation and implementation always will arise as soon as external financing is considered; such problems will not arise when entrepreneurs are able to rely on <b>self-finance.</b> However, there are barriers to <b>self-finance</b> and they fall into two wide categories, (1) barriers to the building up of privately held wealth, regardless of magnitude, and (2) barriers to the preservation of privately held wealth. Many of these barriers are created by political means and can therefore – here they differ from the problems related to external financing – also be alleviated by political means. The conclusions have clear policy implications...|$|R

5|$|In April 1998, Wooller {{claimed that}} the council of the ICAEW was obstructing his {{campaign}} to increase democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998. Wooller's first motion was about electing {{the president of the}} ICAEW democratically by ballot. The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report. The second motion said the district societies should be <b>self-financing</b> and the third motion was on reducing the number of council members to fifty-three. The first motion used a quotation from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison, and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison's quotation after he objected to being quoted. The ICAEW asked members to vote on {{an increase in the number}} of council members from seventy-five after requests made in the Gerrard report. Wooller asked members to reduce the number of council members to fifty-three, which was recommended by the Gerrard report as the ideal council quota. A 54% majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller's motion to reduce the number.|$|E

The remainder is financed through municipal equity, which typically requires no remuneration and thus helps to keep tariffs low.|$|E
