40|$|In modern {{heavy duty}} trucks the battery {{is a central}} component. Its {{traditional}} role as an energy source for engine cranking has been extended to include powering a number of elec- trical components on the truck, both during driving and during standstill. As a consequence of this {{it is important to}} know how much a battery in use has aged and lost in terms of ca- pacity and power output. The difficulty in measuring these factors on a battery in use causes problem, since heavy duty truck batteries are often replaced too early or too late, leading to unnecessary high replacement costs or truck standstill respectively. The overall goal of the effort, of which this thesis is a part, is to use a model of the cranking behaviour of a heavy duty truck engine, which depends on the battery condition, to estimate the ageing and wear of a heavy duty truck battery. This thesis proposes a modelling approach to model the components involved in engine cranking. In the thesis work, system identification is made of the systems forming part of the cranking of a heavy duty truck engine. These components are the <b>starter</b> <b>battery,</b> the starter motor and its electrical circuit and the internal combustion engine. Measurement data has been provided by Scania AB for the evaluation of the models. The data has been collected from crankings of a heavy duty diesel engine at different temperatures and battery charge levels. For every cranking lapse the battery voltage and current have been measured as well as the engine rotational speed. A <b>starter</b> <b>battery</b> model is developed and evaluated. The resulting battery model is then incorporated into two different engine cranking models, Model 1 and Model 2, including a starter motor model and an internal combustion engine model apart form the battery model. The two cranking models differ in several aspects and their differences and resulting evalu- ations are discussed. The battery model is concluded to be sufficiently accurate during model verification, however the two cranking models are not. Model 2 is verified as more correct in in its output than Model 1, but neither is sufficiently accurate for their purpose. The conclusion is drawn that the modelling approach is sound but development of Model 2 is needed before the model can be used in model-based condition estimation. ...|$|E
40|$|Lifetime {{testing of}} {{batteries}} for hybrid-electrical vehicles (HEV) is usually {{performed in the}} lab, either at the cell, module or battery pack level. Complementary field tests of battery packs in vehicles are also often performed. There are, however, difficulties related to field testing of battery-packs. Some examples are cost issues and the complexity of continuously collecting battery performance data, such as capacity fade and impedance increase. In this paper, a novel field test equipment designed primarily for lithium-ion battery cell testing is presented. This equipment {{is intended to be}} used on conventional vehicles, not hybrid vehicles, as a cheaper and faster field testing method for batteries, compared to full scale HEV testing. The equipment emulates an HEV environment for the tested battery cell by using real time vehicle sensor information and the existing <b>starter</b> <b>battery</b> as load and source. In addition to the emulated battery cycling, periodical capacity and pulse testing capability are implemented as well. This paper begins with presenting some background information about hybrid electrical vehicles and describing the limitations with today’s HEV battery testing.

40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of increasing temperature on the corrosion rate of Pb-Ca-Sn alloy, the primary component of the negative grid of a <b>starter</b> <b>battery</b> car, was evaluated by electrochemical techniques: RPL, potentiodynamic curves, Tafel and EIS. By optical microscopy, SEM -EDS and XRD, the compounds formed on the grids were characterized during testing. The passive layer formed on the grids used as cathode and anode in lead-acid batteries allows the anchor in grid-PAM interface (Positive Active Material) or NAM (Negative Active Material). A bad process of to form this layer produces the detachment of PAM/NAM, leading to premature failure. The temperature directly affects the kinetics and thermodynamics degradation of the redox reactions {{taking place in the}} system grid-PAM/NAM. An increase in temperature causes variations in the chemical composition, favoring the formation of oxides and sulphates mixtures in grid-PAM/NAM interface, its volume and porous structure make it susceptible to failure by tri-axial stress on the interface, producing cracks and detachment of PAM or NAM and reducing the lifetime of the battery. It was found that the Pb-Ca-Sn alloys in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution form a multilayer system, verified by the results of EIS and SEM, in which a compact layer of PbO 2 and porous layer by PbSO 4.
