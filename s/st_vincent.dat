5|$|The {{detailed}} {{investigation into}} corruption that <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> began {{caused him to}} become extremely unpopular as many influential men {{were involved in the}} various money making schemes perpetrated. The board of inquiry set up by <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> was responsible for the impeachment of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> had made an enemy of Pitt and Pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the First Lord and the Addington administration. <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> left the office on 14 May 1804 when Addington was replaced as Prime Minister by Pitt. Lord Howick, second son of St Vincent's friend Sir Charles Grey came to his defence and with the assistance of Charles James Fox moved for a vote of thanks in the Commons for St Vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{officers}} during the great age of discovery there are several {{areas of the world}} named in the earl's honour. Cape Jervis and Gulf <b>St</b> <b>Vincent,</b> South Australia, and Jervis Bay, New South Wales, Australia were named for him as was the town of Vincentia and Jervis Bay National Park. The County of <b>St</b> <b>Vincent,</b> New South Wales was also named in his honour. Jervis Inlet, in British Columbia, Canada, was also named for him.|$|E
5|$|Nearing Cape <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> on the Portuguese coast, {{the fleet}} {{split into two}} {{sections}} as ordered by Raleigh. One, under Burrough, headed to the Azores to lie in wait for Spanish and Portuguese ships. The other, under Frobisher in Garland with Clifford, cruised off Cape <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent</b> with the strategy to pin the Spanish fleet against their own lee coast.|$|E
50|$|<b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> Health System, {{based in}} Birmingham, Alabama, United States is an {{operator}} of acute care hospitals {{located in the}} Birmingham area and a health ministry of Ascension Health. <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> Health System {{is made up of}} six facilities: <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> Birmingham, <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> Blount, <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> Chilton, <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> East, <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> <b>St.</b> Clair, and <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> One Nineteen.

5|$|Early in 1798, rumours reached Jervis, {{recently}} ennobled as Earl <b>St</b> <b>Vincent,</b> of a {{buildup of}} French forces around the Mediterranean seaport of Toulon under General Napoleon Bonaparte. Similar rumours had reached the Admiralty in London, and <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> therefore sent Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson and three ships of the line to observe French activity. Nelson arrived too late however, and the French fleet had already sailed, carrying over 30,000 men into the Eastern Mediterranean. Nelson, joined by a fleet of ten ships sent by <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> under Captain Thomas Troubridge, pursued the French, but failed to learn of their destination before the French fleet captured Malta. Ten days later, Bonaparte sailed for Alexandria for {{the second stage of}} his operation and Nelson's fleet unwittingly passed his during the night, the British beating the French to Egypt but sailing off again before Bonaparte arrived.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> {{was made}} an honorary lieutenant-general of Marines and in 1814 was {{promoted}} to general. These positions {{were little more than}} a sinecure and carried no official duties. In 1801 <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> had been created Viscount <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> of Meaford, Staffordshire. a title that because he had no children passed to his nephew, Edward Jervis Ricketts. In 1806 he was appointed as one of the thirty one elder brothers of Trinity House. The elder brothers, along with the master, form the court of Trinity House. In 1809 <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> was honoured by John VI of Portugal who awarded him the Royal Portuguese Military Order of the Tower and Sword in order to commemorate the safe arrival of the Royal Family in Brazil, after Napoleon had invaded Portugal. In May 1814 he was promoted acting admiral of the fleet and commander-in-chief of the Channel squadron. He was confirmed Admiral of the fleet on 19 July 1821 and George IV sent him a gold topped baton {{as a symbol of the}} office. The baton is currently held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. On 2 January 1815 he was made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath when the order was rearranged by the Prince Regent. The knight grand cross is the highest rank in the order.|$|E

5|$|On September 30, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the Windward Islands from <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent</b> and the Grenadines south to Trinidad and Tobago. One hour later, the watch was extended to Saint Lucia. Later that day, the watches were upgraded to warnings in Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada. On October 1, Trinidad's warning was downgraded to a watch. After that, the watches and warnings were gradually discontinued, first in Barbados and <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent</b> and the Grenadines, then Trinidad and Saint Lucia, then Tobago, and finally Grenada. In response to the approaching hurricane, emergency operations centers in Grenada and both main islands of Trinidad and Tobago were placed on alert.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E

Originally a co-educational primary school, the school reopened as <b>St</b> <b>Vincents</b> College, a secondary, fee-paying, private, independent school in May 1882, after the hospital's relocation to the neighbouring suburb of Darlinghurst. In 2008 <b>St</b> <b>Vincent's</b> College celebrated its 150th anniversary, or sesquicentenary.|$|R

5|$|As First Lord, <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> also {{determined}} {{to build a}} breakwater in Plymouth. The First Lord commissioned a civil engineer, John Rennie, and Joseph Whidbey, the former Master-Attendant at Woolwich dockyard, to design the breakwater. Work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force behind its construction.|$|E
5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 27 July, she was ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st Battle Squadron cruised north-west of the Shetland Islands and conducted gunnery practice on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> and the rest of the Grand Fleet conducted another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.|$|E

50|$|The cholera {{epidemic}} of 1849 impelled the Sisters to open <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> Hospital in Manhattan (closed 2010), the first Catholic hospital in New York City. <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> Hospital became {{the centerpiece of}} an extensive health care system under the Sisters' care that included <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> Hospital in Westchester (a psychiatric hospital) {{as well as two}} hospitals on Staten Island: <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent's</b> Hospital (closed 2006) and Bayley Seton Hospital, in addition to a network of nursing homes and other institutions.|$|R

5|$|Four years later, Taylor was {{selected}} for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. In the 4×200m freestyle relay, he helped his team win bronze. There were no Olympic Games in 1916 because of the First World War. Taylor joined the Royal Navy in 1914 and kept fit by swimming around the ships when his ship was anchored at Scapa Flow. He {{was present at the}} Battle of Jutland. A popular story tells that {{during the course of the}} battle, his ship, HMS <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent,</b> was sunk and while the survivors waited for two hours to be rescued, Taylor swam around encouraging his crewmates. However, this story is probably a myth as HMS <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> was not sunk at the Battle of Jutland. He was transferred to HMS Ramillies where he remained until he was demobilised.|$|E
5|$|Further north off Portugal, Frobisher's {{position}} became untenable, {{although he}} captured a prize fresh from Brazil laden with sugar heading to Lisbon on 18 June {{and a few}} days later captured a Spanish caravel.

5|$|HMS <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> was {{the lead}} ship of her class of three {{dreadnought}} battleships built for the Royal Navy {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century. After commissioning in 1910, she spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, often serving as a flagship. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, during which she damaged a German battlecruiser, and the inconclusive Action of 19 August several months later, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to reserve and used as a training ship. <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> was sold for scrap in 1921 and broken up the following year.|$|E

5|$|Having won the battle, Nelson {{needed to}} send despatches to his commander, Vice-Admiral Earl <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent</b> {{reporting}} on {{the destruction of the}} French Mediterranean fleet. These messages were entrusted to Captain Edward Berry, who had served as Nelson's flag captain on HMS Vanguard during the battle. Thompson was ordered to escort Berry to <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent,</b> believed to be with the blockade squadron off Cadiz, in Leander. Although Leander had not suffered serious damage in the battle, Thompson had manning problems: casualties from the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in July 1797 had never been replaced, 14 men had been wounded in the battle at Aboukir Bay and two officers and fifty men had been detached to man the captured French prizes. This left Thompson with just 282 men on board Leander. Following Nelson's orders, Thompson sailed on 5 August.|$|E
