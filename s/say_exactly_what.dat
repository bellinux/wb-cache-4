5|$|Further {{material}} was {{gleaned from the}} De honesta disciplina of 1504 by Petrus Crinitus, which included extracts from Michael Psellos's De daemonibus, and the De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum (Concerning the mysteries of Egypt…), a book on Chaldean and Assyrian magic by Iamblichus, a 4th-century Neo-Platonist. Latin versions of both had recently been published in Lyon, and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) {{in his first two}} verses, the first of which is appended to this article. While it is true that Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to have burned all of the occult works in his library, no one can <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> books were destroyed in this fire.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions {{is that if}} we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E
500|$|To {{celebrate}} their new-found attitude, the town holds a [...] "Do What You Feel" [...] festival. However, the festival soon goes awry because {{those responsible for}} building the stages and maintaining the rides [...] "didn't feel like" [...] doing a thorough job, resulting in a runaway Ferris wheel and more. Arguments begin, as everybody has been encouraged to always <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> is on their mind, and soon a riot starts. Bart is quickly blamed for starting the whole [...] "Do As You Feel" [...] trend. The town chases after Bart, but Homer drives by in a float and saves him. The town gives up the chase despite the float's slow speed and decides {{to go to the}} old mill to get some cider. The Simpson family returns home where they {{try to figure out what}} the lesson of the episode was, before finally concluding that everyone is fine the way they are and start to watch television.|$|E
5000|$|Fukurou is a {{straightforward}} girl and <b>says</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she thinks. She has {{a crush on}} Peganosuke.|$|R
60|$|Rooney {{meant no}} rudeness {{by the last}} remark, but, having {{observed}} the straightforward simplicity of his new friends in <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> they meant, he willingly adopted their style.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{with her}} {{it is neither}} impudence nor affectation. She <b>says</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she thinks at the time, and she is always as good as her word. There are worse women than the Duchess." ...|$|R
2500|$|The main {{challenge}} facing propensity theories is to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> propensity means. [...] (And then, of course, {{to show that}} propensity thus defined has the required properties.) [...] At present, unfortunately, none of the well-recognised accounts of propensity comes close to meeting this challenge.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it is hard}} to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> [...] "arithmetical {{property}} of n" [...] it [...] "expresses", (τ(n) is (2π)−12 times the nth Fourier coefficient in the q-expansion of the modular discriminant function) it is included among the arithmetical functions because it is multiplicative and it occurs in identities involving certain σk(n) and r'k(n) functions (because these are also coefficients in the expansion of modular forms).|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the game}} was found only {{recently}} after centuries of obscurity, {{it is difficult to}} <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> all the rules were. [...] Several documents describing the game have been found; however, there are differences between them. [...] Many of the pieces appear in other shogi variants but their moves may be different. [...] The board, and likewise the pieces, were made much smaller, making archeological finds difficult to decipher. [...] Research into this game continues for historical and cultural reasons, but also to satisfy the curious and those who wish to play what could be the most challenging chess-like game ever made. [...] More research must be done however. [...] This article focuses on one likely set of rules that can make the game playable in modern times but is by no means canon. [...] These rules may change as more discoveries are made and secrets of the game unlocked.|$|E
50|$|Another {{influential}} philosopher, Pavel Tichý initiated Transparent Intensional Logic, {{an original}} {{theory of the}} logical analysis of natural languages - the theory {{is devoted to the}} problem of <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it is that we learn, know and can communicate when we come to understand what a sentence means.|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, the earnestness and {{solidity}} of John's character was of benefit to Walter; and his simple truthfulness, the straightforwardness of his principles, and his blunt frankness in <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he thought, influenced Walter to quite as large an extent {{as he had}} influenced John.|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} put people in my place, so when {{the history of this}} {{administration}} is written at least there's an authoritarian voice <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened." [...] (Announcing he would write a book about [...] "the 12 toughest decisions" [...] he had to make. Presumably [...] "authoritative" [...] was intended.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Some years later, at the Leveson Inquiry in February 2012, Dacre {{rejected}} {{the idea that he}} imposes his will on the paper. He commented that some issues contain opinions which [...] "make my hair go white" [...] and asserted that some journalists [...] "would resign if I told them what to write". He once suggested in general terms to a new employee, sports' columnist Des Kelly, the best way to write for readers: [...] "Make them laugh, make them cry, or make them angry". Peter Preston noted: [...] "He can hire leading voices from the Guardian or the Observer and let them <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> they'd have said in their old homes." [...] James Chapman, in an interview with GQ magazine defending Dacre, pointed to his newspaper's campaign to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and opposition to Kenneth Clarke's proposal for secret courts. The astrologer Jonathan Cainer was first taken on for a Mail horoscope column in December 1992. Given to an unconventional dress code Dacre found objectionable, his contract had a clause insisting he wore a suit. Cainer, who spent the bulk of his career at the Mail although he [...] "never once agreed with an editorial they have published", was the highest paid journalist of his era.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous {{advances}} towards her. Omiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, {{and she gave}} in to Ishida. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant {{to the accompaniment of}} a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936 Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or machiai—the contemporary equivalent of a love hotel—in the Shibuya neighborhood. Planning only for a short 'fling', the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, 1936, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of Futako Tamagawa where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve sake. They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood, and Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, 1936, after an absence of about two weeks. Of Ishida, Abe later said, [...] "It is hard to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stretched}} {{himself at}} full length on the floor, and passed {{his right arm}} into the cavity. 'I can't <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I have got hold of,' he said. 'But I have got it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|So he <b>says</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Adam and Eve said {{in their}} hearts--"I will eat {{of the tree}} of {{knowledge}} of good and evil." [...] He says in his heart, too, just what Solomon the wise said, when he, too, determined to eat of {{the fruit of the}} tree of knowledge.|$|R
40|$|Personal time, {{as opposed}} to {{external}} time, has a certain {{role to play in}} the correct account of death and immortality. But <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> that role is, and what role remains for external time, is not straightforward. I formulate and defend accounts of death and immortality that specify these roles precisely...|$|R
2500|$|Sven Pipien remarked, [...] "The {{beauty of}} Luther {{is more than}} any note he's playing is the feeling behind that note. He was <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> we want to say, {{and the same thing}} goes for Adam. Eddie [...] is not the easiest guy to replace but Adam is his own man AND he fills those shoes really well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rupert!" [...] exclaimed Lucy, colouring--"you know it {{is because}} our {{government}} is republican, {{and that we have}} no nobles among us. Nor do you <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you think; you would not be 'my lord,' if you could." ...|$|E
60|$|A notice {{from the}} president's office, {{commanding}} Carl's instant presence, {{was in his}} post-office box. He slouched into the waiting-room of {{the offices of the}} president and dean.

6000|$|... "This is my house," [...] {{the other}} rejoined, [...] "and {{you came to}} see me. I shall <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I like to you, and if you don't like it you can get out. If it weren't for Lady Dominey's sake, you shouldn't have passed this threshold." ...|$|E
50|$|Ataíde {{wrote that}} Vicente Sodré sunk and died {{immediately}} in the tempest at Kuria Muria, but that Brás Sodré actually survived the wreck. However, once ashore, Brás Sodré decided to blame his Muslim pilots and executed {{them on the}} spot. Ataíde refrains from <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened to Brás Sodré after that, only that 'many things transpired' before his death.|$|R
5000|$|Many dermatologists {{and plastic}} {{surgeons}} are alarmed {{about the growing}} profile of mesotherapy. [...] "No one <b>says</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> they put into the (syringe)," [...] says Naomi Lawrence, a derma-surgeon at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. [...] "One drug they often use, phosphatidylcholine, is unpredictable and causes extreme inflammation and swelling where injected. It is not a benign drug." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} to be {{fighting}} round here, it will be of more interest to you defending your own home than in taking part in general engagements {{for the safety of the}} State. It will, too, enable you to be a good deal at home; and although, so far, the slaves have behaved extremely well, there is no <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> may happen if the Northerners come among us. You can rejoin your own corps afterward, you know, if nothing comes of this." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for him to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> these intruders were doing to Corporal 'Lige, but, from the noises, he judged they had first made a prisoner of the old man by seizing him around the throat, perhaps while he was yet asleep, and now there was every indication that they were making ready to carry out the threat of hanging.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Why,’ replied Parsons, ‘to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she has confessed, {{would be}} rather difficult, because they only spoke in hints, and so forth; but my wife, {{who is no}} bad judge in these cases, {{declared}} {{to me that what}} she had confessed was as good as to say that she was not insensible of your merits—in fact, that no other man should have her.’ ...|$|E
60|$|I {{question}} if my companions were any less uneasy in mind regarding our seeking a {{refuge in the}} city about to be occupied by the British, than was I; but no one ventured to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he thought lest it serve to check our courage, and of a verity we needed that in abundance {{if we were to}} make a success of Jerry's scheme.|$|E
50|$|Stevenson never <b>says</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Hyde takes {{pleasure}} {{in on his}} nightly forays, generally {{saying that it is}} something of an evil and lustful nature. Thus, {{in the context of the}} times, it is abhorrent to Victorian religious morality. Hyde may have been reveling in activities such as engaging with prostitutes or burglary. However, it is Hyde's violent activities that seem to give him the most thrills, driving him to attack and murder Sir Danvers Carew without apparent reason, making him a hunted outlaw throughout England.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well!" [...] said Georgina, {{with her}} lovely smile, [...] "of course {{they think that}} absence would cure me of--cure me of--" [...] And she paused, with a certain natural modesty, not <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> of <b>what.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a later interview, O'Donnell {{said that}} she and her team [...] "were high-fiving each other" [...] after the debate, [...] "thinking that we had exposed Coons doesn't know the First Amendment. And then we read the reports that said the opposite, we were all like 'what?'" [...] She stated, [...] "Well, I think it <b>says</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it says: that the {{government}} will not create - will not dictate - that every American has to believe a certain way, but it won't do anything to prevent the free exercise thereof." ...|$|R
6000|$|Their sabres glitter'd o'er {{her little}} head, [...] Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright, [...] Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead: [...] When Juan {{caught a glimpse}} of this sad sight, [...] I shall not <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he said, [...] Because it might not solace 'ears polite;' [...] But what he did, was to lay on their backs, [...] The readiest way of {{reasoning}} with Cossacques.|$|E
60|$|It {{is hard to}} <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> madness is. I fancy Azuma-zi was mad. The incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed {{may have}} churned up his little store of {{knowledge}} and big store of superstitious fancy, at last, into something akin to frenzy. At any rate, when {{the idea of making}} Holroyd a sacrifice to the Dynamo Fetich was thus suggested to him, it filled him with a strange tumult of exultant emotion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never mind. It {{is a great}} invention, {{and some}} day men will call it writing. At present it is only {{pictures}}, and, {{as we have seen}} to-day, pictures are not always properly understood. But a time will come, O Babe of Tegumai, when we shall make letters--all twenty-six of 'em,--and when we shall be able to read as well as to write, and then we shall always <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> we mean without any mistakes. Let the Neolithic ladies wash the mud out of the stranger's hair.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Felix answered, {{taken aback}} himself. [...] "I can't <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> in <b>what</b> you've transgressed.

50|$|Lucas gives Bill McKay a proposition: since Crocker Jarmon cannot {{lose and}} the race is already decided, McKay is free to {{campaign}} <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he wants. McKay accepts {{in order to have}} the chance to spread his values, and hits the trail. With no serious Democratic opposition, McKay cruises to the nomination on his name alone. Lucas then has distressing news: according to the latest election projections, McKay will be defeated by an overwhelming margin. Lucas says the party expected McKay to lose but not to be humiliated, so he moderates his message to appeal to a broader range of voters.|$|R
