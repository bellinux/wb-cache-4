This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} an in-vacuum, water-cooled beam <b>stop</b> (X-ray <b>shutter)</b> <b>for</b> the materials science (X-ray diffraction) beamline proposed to be built on the wavelength shifter in the Indus- 2 (2. 5 GeV) synchrotron radiation source. The radiation source impinges 1 kW power on the beam stop and the heat transfer capabilities of the beam stop have been evaluated. Temperature distribution in the beam stop has been obtained under various cooling conditions using the finite element analysis calculations with ANSYS software. Design parameters of the beam stop have been optimised. It is also shown that radiation cooling alone is not sufficient for taking away the heat load. Water-cooling of the beam stop is essential...|$|R

5000|$|In {{early days}} of photography, {{available}} shutter speeds were not standardized, though a typical sequence might have been 1/10 s, 1/25 s, 1/50 s, 1/100 s, 1/200 s and 1/500 s; neither were apertures or film sensitivity (at least 3 different national standards existed). Soon this problem resulted in a solution consisting in {{the adoption of a}} standardized way of choosing aperture so that each major step exactly doubled or halved the amount of light entering the camera (2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, etc.), a standardized 2:1 scale was adopted <b>for</b> <b>shutter</b> speed so that opening one aperture stop and reducing the amount of time of the shutter speed by one step resulted in the identical exposure. The agreed standards <b>for</b> <b>shutter</b> speeds are: ...|$|R

Passing the tests prescribed by the TAS norms is required only <b>for</b> <b>shutters</b> approved <b>for</b> use in the Florida HVHZ (High Velocity Hurricane Zone).

50|$|Its {{controls}} were transitional between those of mechanical SLRs and future professional film and digital SLRs: the F4's electronics, LCD viewfinder display, autofocus, programmed auto-exposure, and matrix meter {{looked to the}} future, but it also retained classic dedicated analog dials <b>for</b> <b>shutter</b> speed, lens aperture, metering pattern, and exposure compensation.|$|R

30|$|The {{problem of}} the {{collimator}} settings not being stored in the DICOM header (necessary as input on field size) was addressed by determining the average difference in width and height of the original (unshuttered) and <b>shuttered</b> images <b>for</b> a limited set of images for which both types of data were retained. Considerable variations in measured differences existed, but on average 1  cm had to be added in all four directions to compensate <b>for</b> the <b>shuttering.</b> Although this correction <b>for</b> <b>shuttering</b> is necessarily approximate, its application was preferred over leaving it out as this systematically would overestimate the entrance dose. To derive the effective dose from organ doses, the tissue-weighting factors published in ICRP 103 were chosen in PCXMC.|$|R
