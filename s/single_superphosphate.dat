40|$|Greater use of {{technology}} to assist aerial application of fertiliser will be of benefit to the topdressing industry and farmers. Benefits arise through automating the fertiliser flow control system; reducing off target fertiliser application, and managing fertiliser inputs based on the potential outputs of the farmland; thus increasing the profitability of hill country farming systems. A case for technology assisted application is developed by investigating the field performance of conventional and enhanced flow control systems {{and the effect of}} variable rate application on hill country pasture production. A single particle model that predicts flight trajectory from the particle force balance based on the aircraft groundspeed, axial and tangential propeller wash, wind characteristics and particle properties including sphericity was developed. Model predictions were compared to predictions from AGDISP 8. 15. Results and trends were similar. The single particle ballistics model described above was extended to predict the lateral distribution of fertiliser after release from an aircraft. To achieve this, two parameters are important, the transverse flow profile of material leaving the hopper gatebox and the sphericity of the particles. Techniques for measuring these parameters are described and experimental results are presented for superphosphate. These data were used in the model to predict the lateral distribution pattern from a Gippsland Aeronautics 200 C for a known discharge mass, which was compared to a measured pattern from the same aircraft for the same discharge mass. Good agreement between the shapes of the two distributions was found. The transverse distribution model provides a practical tool for optimising the design of spreaders, or optimum particle characteristics for a given spreader. It has the ability to predict the distribution profile of any particle size distribution from each, or all, of the spreader ducts. Culmination of the single particle and transverse distribution models {{led to the development of}} a deposition footprint model that was capable of predicting field application within a 25 ha trial site. The deposition footprint model was embedded inside a geographical information system and comparisons were made between the actual and predicted deposition across a series of transect lines. Good agreement was found. Following this, a comparison of the predicted field performance between an automated and manual control system were made. Economic benefits for a <b>single</b> application of <b>superphosphate</b> were identified through using automated control, where 10 % less fertiliser was applied outside of the application zone when compared to the manually operated system. This equated to a net benefit of NZD $ 2800 for a 1500 ha hill country farming system. The value of improving the performance of a topdressing aircraft, on an industry level, was also examined. Cost/benefit analysis between a manual and automated system revealed a benefit of NZD $ 111, 700 yr- 1 for a single topdressing aircraft using the automated system. The economic impact of Variable Rate Application Technology (VRAT) is examined, using Limestone Downs as an example. The spatially explicit decision tree modelling technique was used to predict the annual pasture production over the entire Limestone Downs property. The resulting decision tree classes tended to follow the farm's digital elevation model. A series of six different fertiliser application scenarios were developed for comparison to a base line scenario using conventional aerial application techniques. VRAT outperformed the fixed rate applications in terms of pasture production and fertiliser utilisation. Full variable rate application and a model optimised prescription map, produced the highest annual pasture yield. Variable rate techniques were predicted to increase annual production and the spatial variability of that production. An economic analysis of the six production scenarios was undertaken. Farm cash surplus was calculated for each scenario and clearly revealed the benefits of using variable rate application technology. VRAT was found to be the most efficient and highest returning application method per hectare. Additional costs and increased charge-out rates were likely to occur under VRAT; nevertheless, the analysis indicated that significant financial incentives were available to the farmer. A sensitivity analysis revealed that even with a 20 % increase in charge-out rate associated with VRAT, the farm's annual cash position varied by only $ 4500 (0. 4 %), suggesting the cost of implementing such a system is not prohibitive and would allow aircraft operators to add value to their services...|$|R

30|$|The {{ability to}} use {{phosphorus}} from phosphate rock sources differ from crop to crop mainly because the mobilizing capacity of P from various phosphate rocks varies with crop species (Van Straaten 2002). The best known plants with relatively high P-mobilizing capacities are buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), white sweet clover (Melilotus albus), kale, or rape (Brassica napus), white lupins (Lupinus albus), cabbage (Brassica oleraced), Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan). Legumes are especially suited for the utilization of PRs. They are compelling in dissolving PR and in engrossing its disintegration items in view of their interest for Ca and the acidifying impact of nitrogen (N) fixation in the soil close to the root framework (rhizosphere). This effect can be utilized to improve the P nutrition of a companion crop (intercropping) or that of the subsequent crop in a rotation (Perrott 2001). Some plant species (e.g., rapeseed, lupines, and pigeon pea) have been studied because {{of their ability to}} secrete organic acids that result in an enhanced dissolution of PR (Montenegro and Zapata 2002).

40|$|Globally, low zinc (Zn) {{soils are}} widespread, {{but one of}} the largest expanses of such soils is in south west Australia (WA). Early Zn {{research}} in the region determined how much fertiliser Zn was required for profitable production of spring wheat (Triticium aestivum L.) and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneanum L), the major crop and pasture species at the time. The research showed that Zn sulfate and ZnO were equally effective Zn fertilisers, but ZnO was cheaper and so was widely used. The research indicated that in the year of application, depending on soil type, between 0. 5 - 1. 5 kg Zn/ha provided adequate Zn for the production of wheat and subterranean clover. The length of time that a single application of Zn fertiliser remains fully effective in maintaining the production of crops and pasture in future years (residual value; (RV)) had not been determined. This knowledge of the RV of Zn fertilisers is required for soils of WA. The experiments that measured the RV of fertiliser Zn for spring wheat and subterranean clover form the bulk of this thesis. The soils in the region were also initially acutely phosphorus (P) deficient requiring the application of fertiliser P for profitable production. <b>Single</b> <b>superphosphate</b> was the P fertiliser initially used. It was manufactured locally using phosphate rock imported from Nauru and Christmas Islands. This phosphate rock also contained much Zn, and the <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate</b> manufactured from it contained 400 - 600 mg Zn/kg. At amounts of application needed to provide adequate P, the Zn-contaminated superphosphate also supplied about 90 g Zn/ha. Therefore, early field experiments measured the RV of ZnO applied to soil when <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate</b> was applied annually at > 150 kg/ha. In these experiments, the RV of Zn was measured when different amounts of fertiliser nitrogen (N) was applied. This was because it has recently been very profitable to apply fertiliser N to wheat crops, which greatly increased grain yields and so may have increased the demand for Zn, thereby probably decreasing the RV of the original ZnO application. In these experiments, there were many nil-Zn plots. In subsequent years, freshly-applied ZnO amounts were applied to measure the RV of the original ZnO treatments relative to the fresh Zn treatment. No Zn deficiency was detected for up to 23 years after applying ZnO while applying superphosphate at > 150 kg/ha per year and for all amounts of N applied. Subsequently cheap imported DAP fertiliser was used for wheat crops instead of locally produced Zn-contaminated <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate</b> and urea. The imported DAP contained about 50 mg Zn/kg (1 / 12 that of <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate).</b> This new fertiliser strategy induced Zn deficiency in many wheat crops. This led to further field studies to determine the RV of ZnO fertiliser when DAP was applied. The experiments also included 2 Zn-contaminated <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate</b> treatments. In one, no ZnO was applied, and superphosphate was applied at > 150 kg/ha per year to match the amount of P applied as DAP to the other treatments. The other treatment was the same, except 1. 5 kg/ha Zn as ZnO was applied in the first year only. In subsequent years, freshly-applied ZnO amounts were applied to measure the RV of the original ZnO treatments relative to the fresh Zn treatment. Relative to freshly-applied Zn in each year, the RV of the original ZnO treatments decreased as the length of time that the Zn was in contact with soil increased. However, the rate of decline in the RV was also found to differ with soil type, and was affected by soil pH, clay and organic carbon content of soil, and in alkaline soils with the calcium carbonate content of soil. Parallel glasshouse studies measured the RV of Zn, as Zn sulfate, for wheat and subterranean clover, using many soils from WA and other Australian States. The glasshouse studies also showed that the rate of decline in the RV of the original Zn application varied markedly with soil type and was strongly influenced by soil pH, clay and organic carbon content of soil, and in the alkaline soils, the amount of calcium carbonate in soil. In the above studies, the RV of fertiliser Zn was measured relative to freshly-applied Zn using yield of plants (shoots and grain for wheat, shoots for clover), Zn content in shoots and grain, and soil test Zn using the ammonium oxalate and DTPA procedures.

The grain yields were increased by 47. 0 to 68. 0 % over control due to application of fertilizers. The results on straw yield reflected similar trend as in grain yield. Application of fertilizers caused a significant increase during NPKS uptake by rice. The application of fertilizers had a negligible influence on pH, CEC, organic matter, total N, available P, exchangeable K, and available S content of the post-harvest soils compared to their initial status...|$|E

However, these fertilizers can contaminate soils through addition of heavy metals. This work {{was carried out}} to study the lead contamination due to addition of four different phosphorus fertilizers {{as well as the}} Pb uptake by corn (Zea mays) plants. The fertilizers <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> triple superphosphate, Araxá rock phosphate, and Gafsa rock phosphate were added at doses equivalent to 0, 100, 300, 500 and 800 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5.

40|$|Study was {{conducted}} on the role of nitrogen (N), applied either alone or in combination with phosphorus (P), in composting of kallar grass [Leptochloa fusca (L.) Kunth] with particular emphasis on carbon (C) and N conservation during composting. Nitrogen was added as ammonium sulphate and P as <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate.</b> Addition of N alone, though accelerated the composing rate, it did not conserve C and N during composting. However, application of P along with optimum level of N accelerated the composting rate, stimulated the substrate transformation into humic acid, and decreased the N loss.

40|$|Canola (Brassica napus) {{has become}} a major crop grown in {{rotation}} with spring wheat and lupins in Western Australia (WA) since the mid 1990 s. Most soils in WA are highly weathered with very low levels of phosphorus (P). The WA soils initially contained adequate indigenous soil potassium (K) for cropping but removal of K over time in the harvested grains has gradually resulted in the some soils becoming deficient in K for grain production. The sulphur (S) status of WA soils was maintained when <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate</b> (containing about 11 per cent S) was widely used as P fertiliser. The increased and widespread use of fertilisers containing lower S levels than <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> such as DAP and MAP is likely to increase S deficiency in canola. Furthermore, S deficiency has more frequently been identified in canola crops (compared with wheat and lupins). Consequently fertilisers containing P, K and S are now applied to most canola crops. Fertiliser costs represent {{a significant part of the}} variable costs of growing crops in WA. Chen et al. (2009) identified the need for improved soil test interpretation for making fertiliser recommendations due to substantial changes in farming systems, fertiliser practices and crop yield potential since earlier calibrations were developed. The aims of this study were (1) to compile experimental data containing the standard soil test measurements and observed canola crop yield responses for both nil and fertilised treatments across different soil types and seasons from published or unpublished sources, and (2) to critically analyse soil test-crop response relationships to derive better critical soil test values in soils and environments suitable for canola grain production in WA...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the response of groundnut (cv. Bard 699) to N, P and S application on a Typic Torrior Then soil. Application of N and P significantly (p < 0. 05) improved kernal and dry matter yield of groundnut. Addition of S either from potassium sulphate (SOP) or <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate</b> (SSP) further increased groundnut yield. However, S addition from SOP yielded 15 Per cent higher than SSP. Superiority of SOP over SSP was attributed to its quicker release rate of nutrients and hence better utilization by the plants. Nevertheless, combined application of N, P and S increased groundnut yield by 57 to 63 Per cent over control. It is concluded that combined application of S with N and P is beneficial for rainfed groundnut...|$|E

40|$|Sulphur, as a {{secondary}} nutrient {{is vital for}} tea crop. Although, the importance of sulphur in tea crop nutrition was recognized long ago, it received little attention compared to other nutrients. This {{could be due to}} the fact that sulphur estimations in soil and plant are tedious. Quite often, sulphur needs were met through low analysis fertilizers like ammonium sulphate, <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate</b> and some organic sources. However, with increase in productivity of crop over time, removal of sulphur and increased use of high analysis fertilizers viz. urea, di-ammonium phosphate, and triple superphosphate etc. further hastened the depletion of sulphur from the soil.

40|$|This {{research}} {{reviews the}} displacement of phosphorus fertilisers in wheat cropping regions using biochar (biologically derived charcoal). The research aim was to assist agriculturalists to navigate soil carbon mitigation incentives using iterative planning processes, enabling a balanced approach between soil biochar sequestration, conventional productivity co-benefits, and attitudes to risk. This research quantifies conventional productivity benefits from the adoption of carbon soil sequestration, {{and the value of}} carbon sequestered, with scenarios for various prices for biochar, <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> and carbon. The biochar sequestration modelling results indicate that a reduction of phosphorus fertiliser use in cropping regions was possible when applying large quantities of biochar to the soil. The cost-effectiveness of using biochar in cropping systems was found to be insensitive to phosphorus fertiliser price or carbon market values. In contrast, the commercial viability of using biochar in cropping systems was highly dependent on the price of biochar...|$|E

30|$|The use of {{reactive}} {{rock phosphate}} (RP) in acidic soils as a phosphate (P) source for pastures and crops presents attractive economic advantages {{with respect to}} soluble phosphate. However, some {{studies have demonstrated that}} the short-term (1 -year) efficiency of RP, compared with that of water-soluble P, is relatively poor. This fact penalizes not only the yield and quality of the earlier harvests, but even the whole final yield when the crop is affected by some abiotic or biotic stress {{at the beginning of the}} cycle. In the present study, we investigated the ability of new edaphic biostimulants to increase the short-term efficiency of RP-based fertilizer as a P source for pastures cultivated in acid soils. To this end, we have granulated rock phosphate with two edaphic biostimulants: tryptophan and a heteromolecular organic complex formed by humic acid and tryptophan through iron bridges, and compared their short-term P fertilizer efficacy with that of <b>single</b> <b>superphosphate</b> and rock phosphate.|$|E
