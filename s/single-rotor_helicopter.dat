50|$|The {{tail rotor}} is a smaller rotor mounted {{so that it}} rotates {{vertically}} or near-vertically {{at the end of}} the tail of a traditional <b>single-rotor</b> <b>helicopter.</b> The tail rotor's position and distance from the center of gravity allow it to develop thrust in the same direction as the main rotor's rotation, to counter the torque effect created by the main rotor. Tail rotors are simpler than main rotors since they require only collective changes in pitch to vary thrust. The pitch of the tail rotor blades is adjustable by the pilot via the anti-torque pedals, which also provide directional control by allowing the pilot to rotate the helicopter around its vertical axis.|$|E

50|$|The coaxial rotor design {{provides}} a hovering ceiling of 4,000 m and vertical {{rate of climb}} of 10 m a second {{at an altitude of}} 2,500 m.
