40|$|During {{the survey}} we studied {{traditional}} old apple cultivars {{in order to}} test disease resistance, as part of an apple breeding program. Diseases and pests assessments were made throughout the two growing season in 2008 and 2009 in traditional apple cultivars (‘Batul’, ‘Pónyik’, and ‘Sóvári’) from stray and commercial (‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Starkrimson’) apple orchards. Our data add to a body of evidence indicating that traditional apple cultivars under natural selection and without pesticide regime are highly and/or moderately resistant to fire blight, apple powdery mildew and apple scab. High resistance was observed for green apple aphid (‘Sóvári’) and rosy leaf-curling aphid (all cultivars, except ‘Sóvári’) throughout the assessment. Susceptibility from mediate to high level was observed for fruit peel moth and pear-leaf blister moth, while resistance and/or moderate resistance for <b>spotted</b> <b>tentiform</b> leafminer and codling moth. The codling moth damages were significantly correlated with seed number in fruits throughout the whole vegetation period. We can conclude that old apple cultivars sustained in their original regions could be a significant source of genes for apple breeding programs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the vibratory signals produced by the parasitoid Sympiesis sericeicornis Nees (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) while foraging on apple leaves infested by one of its hosts, the <b>spotted</b> <b>tentiform</b> leafminer Phyllonorycter malella (Ger.) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae). This leafminer changes its behaviour as a function of the parasitoid's behaviour to escape parasitization. We propose that the leafminer uses vibrations triggered by the parasitoid to detect the presence of its enemy. We measured vibrations produced by a foraging parasitoid on a mine with a laser vibrometer. By recording concurrently the behaviour of the parasitoid on video, vibrations could be assigned to particular behaviours. Subsequently, vibrations were characterized by their dominant frequencies and intensities. The behaviours Landing and Take-offboth produced strong impact-like vibrations characterized by an initial irregular phase during which frequencies up to 25 kHz occurred followed by a slow decaying regular phase. Vibrations elicited by Moving, Standing and Probing showed no clear temporal pattern. During Probing, dominant frequencies of up to 5. 6 kHz were observed frequently at intensities well above the background noise (>I 0 dB). During Moving and Standing...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} compost {{application}} on weed, fungal, and insect pest management in apple orchards was investigated from 1999 to 2001. Composted poultry manure was applied in June 1999 {{to half of}} two small research orchards which had previously received little or no management. The compost provided weed control for 1 year after application. There was no effect of compost on apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) infection. In a laboratory experiment, growth of the brown rot fungus (Monilinia fructicola) was significantly slower on a compost substrate than a sterilized compost substrate. The compost significantly affected arthropod abundance during two years after application, with more predators and fewer herbivores in the compost treated plots. Populations of <b>spotted</b> <b>tentiform</b> leafminer (Phyllonorycter blancardella) and migrating woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) nymphs were reduced in the compost plots. This study showed {{that the use of}} compost in an orchard ecosystem is beneficial to management of weed, fungal, and insect pests. The use of compost as a mulch in orchard ecosystems should be encouraged as a sustainable management practice because of a potential to reduce pesticide use. Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|ReportApple trees {{grown in}} the eastern United States are subject to attack by several insects and mites that feed on foliage. While injury caused by foliage feeding pests may vary due to the time and type of feeding, the {{principal}} mechanism of damage {{appears to be the}} reduction of photosynthesis by leaves. If individual pests affect the apple tree via reductions in leaf photosynthesis, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the influence of multiple pests is an additive reduction in leaf photosynthesis. Affirming the additive affect of multiple sources of pest injury would bolster current pest management practices. <b>Spotted</b> <b>Tentiform</b> Leafminer (STLM) (Phyllonorychter blancardella) is an important apple insect pest. Larvae burrow beneath the layers of apple leaves and consume the mesophyll creating mines where most of the green tissue has been removed. Unfortunately, {{little is known about the}} influence of damage by this insect on apple tree photosynthesis. Here, we present results from experiments designed to answer three questions: 1. What is the relationship between STLM damage on a leaf and photosynthesis by the leaf? 2. What is the relationship between STLM damage and photosynthesis by the entire tree canopy? 3. Can STLM damage be simulated...|$|R
40|$|A {{pest control}} {{decision}} rule consisting {{of an action}} threshold and a sampling protocol was developed and evaluated for first-generation <b>spotted</b> <b>tentiform</b> leafminer, Phyllonorycter blancardella (F.). An action threshold of two eggs per leaf was chosen based on the criterion of preventing more than one first-generation mine per leaf. Two sequential classification sampling plans for first-generation eggs were developed, one based on variable intensity sampling {{and the other on}} the use of confidence intervals for stop limits. Both plans made use of the nested variance structure of leafminer egg counts and variance-mean models fit to estimated variance components. Performance of the two sequential procedures was studied using simulation and judged to be very similar. Use of either sampling plan required approximately 10 - 20 min. Over a 4 -yr period, 87 % of sampled orchards in western New York had leafminer populations that were below the threshold of two eggs per leaf. During this period, use of sample information to schedule insecticide treatments resulted in only one instance when a treatment may have been required and was not called for (n = 79). Widespread use of the decision rule would result in significant reductions in pesticide use with no attendant increase in risk to grower...|$|R
40|$|Pheromone traps were {{deployed}} in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County (Hungary) between 1982 and 1988, in 1990 and also between 1993 and 2013. These traps attracted 8 Microlepidoptera species: Phyllonorycter blancardella, P. corylifoliella, Anarsia lineatella, Eupoecilia ambiguella, Lobesia botrana, Grapholita funebrana, G. molesta and Cydia pomonella. We examined the trapping data {{of these species}} {{in the context of}} lunar phases and polarized moonlight. Catches of the European Vine Moth (Lobesia botrana) and the Codling Moth (Cydia pomonella) were higher in the First Quarter, whereas catches of Peach Twig Borer (Anarsia lineatella), Vine Moth (Eupoecilia ambiguella), Plum Fruit Moth (Grapholita funebrana) and Oriental Fruit Moth (Grapholita molesta) were larger in the Last Quarter. Catches of the other two species, the <b>Spotted</b> <b>Tentiform</b> Leafminer (Phyllonorycter blancardella) and Hawthorn Red Midget Moth (P. corylifoliella), were higher in both the First and Last Quarters. When using pheromone traps, insects do not fly to a light source, so moonlight does not modify either the catching distance or flight activity. However, at high levels of polarized moonlight, pheromone trap catches will increase, {{as in the case of}} light-trap catches. The results are comprehensible when one considers that the target species can fly both during the daytime and also at night...|$|R
40|$|Weather data is {{fundamental}} for effective IPM, crucial for preventing crop loss, and essential for documenting damaging weather conditions. Over {{the last several}} years the New York State IPM Program's Network for Environment and Weather Applications (NEWA) has expanded through the work of Cornell University faculty, Extension educators, the Northeast Regional Climate Center, RainWise Inc. and farmers. Several apple producers, from Nassau to Niagara counties, recently installed weather stations in the network. RainWise, Inc. retrofitted their weather stations with leaf wetness sensors, developed and upgraded their software to deliver data to NEWA. NEWA's website, delivering the weather app's, was fully redesigned and launched November 2009 : newa. cornell. edu. Our audience consists primarily of high-value fruit and vegetable producers. Workshops and presentations on NEWA were provided for these producers who offered suggestions for NEWA improvements. For apples, faculty revised and created pest forecast model web pages for apple scab, fire blight, sooty blotch/flyspeck, apple maggot, codling moth, oblique-banded leafroller, oriental fruit moth, plum curculio, and <b>spotted</b> <b>tentiform</b> leafminer. An apple evapo-transpiration model is in development and an apple carbohydrate model for thinning has become a proven success. These resources are made possible through coordination by the NYS IPM Program of a network of on-the-ground weather stations delivering weather data for its automated application to agricultural risk management...|$|R
40|$|The Network for Environment & Weather Applications (NEWA) {{system has}} a {{proven track record}} for saving grower's money, {{reducing}} pesticide use, improving IPM and crop production, and documenting crop insurance and risk management needs (Carroll et al 2011). NEWA provides a reliable flow of weather data that supports the implementation of pest, disease and crop forecasts (Agnello and Reissig, 2010). Growers using NEWA state that they reduced spray costs, on average, by $ 19, 500 dollars per year and that they prevented crop losses, on average, of $ 256, 000 dollars per year {{as a direct result}} of using NEWA pest forecast models (Carroll, 2007). In a NEWA survey of NY growers (Carroll, 2007), we found the greatest impact of the system is making pest, disease and crop forecasts available online. This project, researching improvements to sustain NEWA, will result in increased use of forecast models which, in turn, help reduce the number of sprays applied, improve the timing of sprays, and thereby reduce risk to the environment and human health. NEWA pest forecasts have a positive impact on IPM practice: 99. 2 % of farmers using NEWA would recommend NEWA to other farmers. These agricultural forecasts have the potential to save agricultural interests, especially apple farms, substantial money in crop production costs and eliminate unneeded, ineffectual pesticide use. A significant amount of research has been devoted to the development of forecast models; 27 are implemented on NEWA and, of these, 10 are for apple, including apple scab infection events, apple scab ascospore maturity, fire blight Cougar Blight, sooty blotch & flyspeck, obliquebanded leafroller, <b>spotted</b> <b>tentiform</b> leafminer, codling moth, plum curculio, oriental fruit moth, and apple maggot. NEWA provides historical records of weather data, current data, and forecasts. Growers can access growing degree day accumulations and track cold temperatures, such as the frosts and freezes that occurred in May 2010. In addition, NEWA data supports research and development of new models like the highly successful apple carbohydrate utilization model to inform apple thinning sprays. Extension educators will benefit from reliable weather data and forecast model outputs on NEWA that they can utilize in their extension newsletters, crop updates, and pest alerts. Crop consultants also benefit by improving their knowledge of when pests and diseases may be active, when to deploy traps, scout for primary infections, etc. Researchers benefit by having a source of weather data from agroecosystems that is available for use in their research programs. Providing more accurate leaf wetness duration information in NEWA and utilizing this information in the models will improve the precision of the model results. Placing the daily I need to know information in the hands of apple growers with e-NEWA alerts will eliminate the need to dig several clicks down a website for the information and the subscriptions will help sustain the system and all its benefits. This project will lay the groundwork for full development of e-NEWA...|$|R
