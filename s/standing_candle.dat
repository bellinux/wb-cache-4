5000|$|Kid Carrion (voiced by Jeff Bennett) - A zombie cowboy who {{was never}} named, and only {{appeared}} in [...] "Relax-o-Vision" [...] and [...] "The Lobe". He {{can be seen in}} the opening credits <b>standing</b> next to <b>Candle</b> Jack. He bears a passing resemblance to the revamped version of The Scarecrow from Bruce Timm's The New Batman Adventures, yet seems to be a parody of the villain Tex Hex from the 1987 Filmation cartoon series Bravestarr.|$|R
60|$|Taking a lamp {{from the}} ground, {{she led the}} way down a narrow flight of stairs. By the depth to which they descended Edgar judged {{when they reached the}} bottom that they must be below the level of the cellars. She opened a door, and entered an {{apartment}} some twenty feet square. It was lighted by four <b>candles</b> <b>standing</b> on a table. In one corner a woman lay on a pallet; two women servants, sobbing with terror and excitement, stood beside her, while a tall, elderly man rose to meet them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Herbert Harmer," [...] he said, entering. There was {{a slight}} exclamation of astonishment, and then {{the door closed behind}} him. Mr. Harmer looked round; the old hall, seen by the faint light which the servant carried in his hand, was even blacker and more gloomy than he remembered it as a boy. He {{followed}} the man, who in silence led the way across it to a small sitting-room, and who, lighting some <b>candles</b> <b>standing</b> on the mantlepiece, then withdrew, saying he would inform his mistresses that Mr. Harmer was here.|$|R
60|$|He {{mechanically}} pursued his way {{round the}} piers {{into his own}} seat in the north aisle. The lower atmosphere of this spot was shaded by its own wall from the shine which streamed in over the window-sills on the same side. The only light burning inside the church was a small tallow <b>candle,</b> <b>standing</b> in the font, in the opposite aisle of the building to that in which Manston had sat down, and near where the furniture was piled. The candle's mild rays were overpowered by the ruddier light from the ruins, making the weak flame to appear like the moon by day.|$|R
60|$|He {{received}} the great lady {{with a low}} bow which, despite herself, she acknowledged by a shudder. She was very pale, {{and her eyes were}} dilating and preternaturally bright. Fear began to possess her, yet she suffered herself to be ushered into the chapel, which was dimly illumined by a couple of <b>candles</b> <b>standing</b> beside a basin on a table. The altar light had been extinguished. Her maid would have hung back, but that she feared to be parted from her mistress. She passed in with her in the wake of Guibourg, and followed by La Voisin, who closed the door, leaving her daughter in the ante-room.|$|R
50|$|Norna-Gest {{was the son}} of a Danish {{man named}} Thord of Thinghusbit, who once dwelt on the estate of Grøning in Denmark. When he was born, three Norns arrived and had foretold the child's destiny. Two of them gave him good gifts. However Skuld, the {{youngest}} of the Norns, deeming that the two others made rather light of her, determined to render void their promises of good fortune for the child. So she prophesied that his life was to last no longer than that of a <b>candle</b> <b>standing</b> lit beside the cradle. The eldest Norn (Urðr) instantly extinguished the flame and asked his mother to hide it well.|$|R
5000|$|The Christmas Tree {{is first}} put up and {{decorated}} {{on the morning}} of the 24th. The gifts are then placed under the tree. Christmas services in the church serve as well to exchange greetings with neighbors and friends. After an evening meal one of the parents usually goes into the room where the tree is <b>standing,</b> lights the <b>candles</b> and rings a little bell. Then the children are allowed to go into the candlelit room. In many families it is still a custom to sing Christmas songs around the tree before opening up the presents. Some families attend a midnight church service [...] "Christmette" [...] after the evening meal and gift-giving.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a series}} of 4 views of Mexican architecture, showing various street scenes in Mexico, [s. d. ]. The first image (upper left) is of what appears to be an ornate indoor double cabinet? door {{featuring}} a monstrance inside an embellished portion above it. The second image (upper right) shows the inside of a church, with several rows of long benches set beside the ornate designs surrounding statues on the wall. The third image (lower left) is of two large <b>candles</b> <b>standing</b> in the foreground before a large, heavily decorated altar. The last (lower right) is of the left side of an altar, showing several large angel statues set against the embellished background...|$|R
50|$|The first lighted Christmas trees {{made use}} of candles. Attaching the candles was a {{difficult}} process, and {{proved to be a}} fire hazard. The tree could not be left unattended when the candles were lit. A bucket of water also had to be kept near the tree and someone had to keep watch for a possible fire. Candle wax was expensive, so later trees used lamps that were made from nutshell halves filled with oil and a wick. More elegant lamps were made from different colours of glass. The new candle holder, called a counterbalance candle holder, had a weight attached to the bottom that kept the <b>candle</b> <b>standing</b> upright. However, even with these improvements, the trees still proved to be fire hazards.|$|R
500|$|In 1975, {{the activist}} {{citizens}} group Lehigh-Pocono Committee of Concern (LEPOCO) formed a [...] "human peace candle" [...] {{in front of}} the real structure as a protest against the Vietnam War. Three group members formed a triangle while another man stood on top of their shoulders, holding a lighted candle and a sign that read, [...] "Bring the troops home for Christmas {{and the rest of the}} year". The protest marked the 10th anniversary of LEPOCO's first protest against the war when they formed in 1965, which was also held at Center Square. In December 1981, the Polish labor union Solidarity held a late-night peace rally that included a candlelight vigil, singing and prayers for a peaceful resolution to the martial law crisis in Poland. In 1991, the city decided to leave the Peace <b>Candle</b> <b>standing</b> until the Gulf War conflict was resolved in honor of the 500,000 American troops serving in the war. The gesture was approved after a pool of residents indicated a ratio of 10-to-1 supported it. During this time, supporters of the troops tied yellow ribbons around the candle and its surrounding fence, while protesters tied black ribbons to symbolize those who died in the conflict. The candle was taken down that March after the war ended.|$|R
6000|$|Parallel {{with the}} railway was a channel where small fishing-craft lay, {{and where a}} leisurely dredging-machine was {{stirring}} up the depths in a stench so dire that I wonder we do not smell it across the Atlantic. Over this channel a bridge led into the town, and offered the convenient support of its parapet to the crowd of spectators who wished to inhale that powerful odor at their ease, and who hung there throughout the working-day; the working-day of the dredging-machine, that is. The population was so much absorbed in this that when we first crossed into the town, we found no beggar children even, though {{there were a few}} blind beggarmen, but so few that a boy who had one of them in charge was obliged to leave off smelling the river and run and hunt him up for us. Other boys were busy in street-sweeping and b-r-r-r-r-ing to the donkeys that carried off the sweepings in panniers; and in the fine large plaza before the principal church of Algeciras there was a boy who had plainly nothing but mischief to do, though he did not molest us farther than to ask in English, [...] "Want to see the cathedral?" [...] Then he went his way swiftly and we went into the church, which we found very whitewashed and very Moorish in architecture, but very Spanish in the Blessed Virgins on most of the altars, dressed in brocades and jewels. A sacristan was brushing and dusting the place, but he did not bother us, and we went freely about among the tall <b>candles</b> <b>standing</b> on the floor {{as well as on the}} altars, and bearing each a placard attached with black ribbon, and dedicated in black letters on silver [...] "To the Repose of This or That" [...] one among the dead.|$|R
