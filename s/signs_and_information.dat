" When examining the plans, from various types of fast-evolving IT, we chose a technology that we assumed can be introduced in the near future, created a road map, and then suggested solution images. At the same time, based on surveys and research conducted so far, we paid close attention to two factors that will shape the next-generation <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> delivery system: the relationship among information content, means of expression, and location of information; and also the principles behind the means of information expression.

The Berthold Public school Arboretum was {{begun in the}} 1970s when the then science teacher, Tom Hove, and vocational agriculture teacher, Richard Debertin, combined efforts to make an arboretum on the school grounds. Several grants from outside sources and free materials from other public conservation agencies allowed the addition of about 125 varieties of trees and shrubs to the school grounds. About 100 of those varieties were established. <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> are minimal. The best source of information is to look up the retired vocational agriculture teacher who still lives in Berthold.

In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} case study of context aware, on-site {{information}} retrieval using a computervision-based interaction on mobile phones with the goal of facilitating information access for urban commuters that use public transport. Our focus is on intuitive touchless interaction using contextual recognition of existing visual objects, such as <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> plates. Object detection and localization are based on fast matching of local image features represented as Histogrammed Intensity Patches. We show that low-level image features can be learned, organized, and optimized for discrimination between similar, poorly textured object images. The system is integrated with existing software for information retrieval and experiments show that it achieves good performance in real-life situations...|$|E

More and more we {{have to get used to}} reconsider the term quasi-equilibrium stated by Mannoni. The article will investigate the reasons for certain behaviours, trying to find solutions to this situation. Through a critical review of some interventions and a discussion of the literature concerning the possibility of detects situations of quasi-equilibrium, we want to propose a method to approach the problem, trying to focus more on prevention and maintenance in order to push more and more towards the conservation of our heritage...|$|E
40|$|Various {{types of}} {{information}} displayed inside train stations is there {{for the purpose of}} assisting passengers in catching trains to their destinations. It is the "signs " that help these passengers travel smoothly until they arrive at their destinations. In order to ensure smooth travel inside stations and via trains, both physical services, such as the installation of escalators or elevators, and abstract services, such as information services, must work together. The "Law for Promoting Easily Accessible Public Transportation Infrastructure for the Aged and the Disabled " (hereinafter the "Barrier-Free Transportation Law") promulgated on May 17, 2000, and effective as of November 15, 2000, states that ensuring smooth travel for transporting disadvantaged persons is an important issue.

30|$|The most {{frequently}} suggested measures included building a fence or an underpass/overpass. Fencing was relatively more frequently indicated at location 3 than at locations 1 and 2. The opposite {{applies to the}} building of an overpass or underpass. This difference most likely resulted from {{the distance to the}} closest official crossing site being shorter at location 3 (150  m) than at locations 1 and 2 (200 – 300  m). Specifically, the results suggest that people were more willing to accept fencing if the distance to the closest official crossing site was relatively short, {{but in the case of}} a relatively long distance they rather preferred an overpass or underpass.

40|$|Introduction: Past {{research}} has indicated that teaching baby sign language to infants can be stressful for parents. Thus, a previous study to test this assertion was conducted. A baby sign workshop was conducted and consisted of teaching the parents approximately 200 <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> on implementation. Results indicated that parents did not report stress as a result of using baby sign with their children. The current case study administered {{a modified version of the}} baby sign workshop survey one year post hoc. Purpose: To observe continued use of baby sign, as well as parental perception of the impact of baby sign on parental stress and/or parent-child interaction. Methods: Participants of a single group case study completed a qualitative follow-up survey and participated in a brief interview. Results: The results indicate that the majority of the families continued to use baby sign after the workshop until their children began using spoken communication to a greater extent. Parent-reported responses have remained consistent from the previous study, indicating parents did not report stress as a result of using baby sign with their children. Additionally, parents reported positive impacts of baby sign on child development and parent-child interaction. Conclusions: Continued use of baby sign with infants and young children does not produce stress in parents. Some limitations and a discussion for future research are presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Adapting {{translation}} for dubbing {{is not a}} mere linguistic fact: it {{also takes}} on the ideological discussion about globalization in its much debated terms of hope for reciprocity vs. the consequences of its real inequity. Through an analysis of some important landmarks that intersected the history of some Western countries {{in the last two}} centuries, it was possible to trace a lack of reciprocity in the usage of dubbing between North America and Europe. The lack of reciprocity in dubbing non-American films translates into cultural supremacy, as all countries whose languages are less widespread than English have automatically compromised their position on the market. Also, there is some value in taking into consideration that most Americans have always been deprived of the knowledge of other cultures through films. Investigating the main topics related to globalization and the mass media, the research try to demonstrate that in this situation, the only way to resist the cultural hegemony subtly spreading through audiovisual channels is the use of dubbing. Through dubbing spectators can take the <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> concerning the other culture, while still maintaining the local identities – expressed by the target language. They can learn about other cultures, without being ʻ americanized ʼ. The study shows that dubbing can be considered as a form of “cultural democracy”, as it respects the plurality of cultures and spreads pieces of information rather than ideologies...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} data and {{information}} being different in kind {{is based on the}} Foundationalist thesis that there exist raw, brute, facts which constitute the data that form the basis for information, and, ultimately, of knowledge. Foun dationalism fails, however, because if these data are really different in kind from information and knowledge, then no comparisons are possible between the former and the latter, and the notion of data (in the sense of raw, brute, fact) becomes useless. If, on the other hand, comparisons can be made between data and information or knowledge, the data would have to be of the same kind as the latter. Given that an Information Processing System (IPS) cannot process data except in terms of whatever representational language is inherent to it, data could not even be apprehended by an IPS without becoming representational in nature, and thus losing their status of being raw, brute, facts. The representational language of the IPS provides the categories in terms of which the IPS 'views' reality, and thus this language will define what constitutes reality for the IPS in question. Consequently, this language will define what constitutes signals, <b>signs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> for the IPS, as well. Any definition of information must therefore be relative to a given IPS, and, {{in the case of a}} human IPS, what is regarded in common sense terms as linguistically encoded information cannot be independently characterized in purely physical terms...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in restoring urban ecosystems has engendered studies on public perceptions of these ecosystems and future land use. This paper examines {{the perceptions of}} people using the waterfront area of the New York/New Jersey harbour estuary about {{their use of the}} area, and how this environment could be improved. Pollution was viewed as the most important problem in New Jersey, and removing pollution was rated the most important way to improve the waterfront habitat. Using the remaining undeveloped area for natural habitat and to improve quality of life were rated as the most important uses of the waterfront. People valued the waterfront for walking, providing open green space, and as a place to commune with nature without people. Management options people favoured were removing pollution and cleaning up rubbish and adding educational <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> brochures about the remaining, natural habitat. Age, income and education influenced which activities people said they undertook. For improvements to the waterfront: Hispanics rated adding educational signs and creating information brochures higher, Blacks rated building promenades as more important, and Asians and Whites rated improving habitat for birds and butterflies more important than others. The data indicate that the public has a firm understanding of the big picture (pollution in the region and locally), habitat improvement, and of the small improvements that can be done locally. Planners and managers could move forward on three fronts: source reduction, wildlife habitat improvement, and amenity (signs, brochures, cleaning up rubbish) development. Understanding how people use an environment, and wish to improve it, can provide valuable information for future restoration and management of urban environments generally, as well as for structuring a citizen advisory committee. ...|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{tourism and}} {{cultural}} events {{are part of}} the development projects of the Finnish tourism sector, which aims to increase the attractiveness of Finland as a tourist destination. Especially more diverse utilizing of Finnish design in the development of tourist attractions are seen as a possibility. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the opportunities of the Arctic Design Week event as an attractive tourism product. The research subject is approached {{from the perspective of the}} customer and customer value and the starting point has been the event visitor’s experiences. Research data consists of 11 essays of written event experiences, seven short interviews, participatory observation and two blog posts. Theoretical background forms from three theories. For analyzing event experiences I will use Michael Morgan’s (2008) Prism Model of Event Experience as a base and theory guided content analysis will be used for analyzing the whole data. For the product development, my perspective will be co-creation theory and the findings of the analysis will be adapted to Komppula & Boxberg’s (2002) model of the customer-oriented tourism product. The results show that customer value in the events was generated through social interaction, by creating suitable conditions for the event, providing opportunities to learn new things, get new experiences, opportunities to participate in the production of the event itself and making the event accessible with clear <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>information.</b> Based on the theoretical framework and the results of my research I have established a model that describes the event as a tourism product. The event tourism product consists of the event system, event process, event space and the event concept. The event tourism product is born in the encounters and interaction between the organizers of the event, customers and stakeholders, before the event, during the event and after the event. The customer value forms in this whole process. The outlined event tourism product gives the direction on how the events could be developed in order to attract tourists...|$|E
