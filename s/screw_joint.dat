50|$|The {{biological}} <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> is {{a naturally}} occurring {{form of the}} <b>screw</b> <b>joint,</b> a mechanical device that combines rotational movement with single-axis translation. Scientists from Karlsruhe State Museum of Natural History and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology discovered it in specimens of Trigonopterus oblongus, a weevil found in Papua.|$|E
50|$|The species Trigonopterus oblongus (Pascoe, 1885) {{is found}} in Papua. It became notable in July 2011 when {{examination}} of the anatomy of the weevil revealed the first instance of a biological <b>screw</b> <b>joint.</b> T. oblongus is just 4 mm long and can fold their legs below their body. The biological <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> is just 0.5 mm in size. This discovery was made by Alexander Riedel of the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe and by Thomas van de Kamp of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>screw</b> <b>joint,</b> or helical joint, {{has only}} one degree of freedom because the sliding and {{rotational}} motions are related by the helix angle of the thread.|$|E
30|$|On the contrary, maximum {{resistance}} of nailed or <b>screwed</b> <b>joints</b> used alone {{can be improved}} by combining with additional bolted joints. Even if the clearances in predrilled bolt-holes of bolted joints hinder the obvious increase of the allowable resistance estimated following the current design standard, the actual maximum resistance or safety factors of them will increase if the nailed or <b>screwed</b> <b>joints</b> are designed appropriately to have far greater ultimate slips than probable initial slips of the bolted joints.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern <b>screw</b> <b>joints</b> in structures for fixing parts. These <b>screw</b> <b>joints</b> could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of <b>screw</b> <b>joints</b> with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in <b>screw</b> <b>joints</b> both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of <b>screw</b> <b>joints</b> with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of <b>screw</b> <b>joints</b> with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in <b>screw</b> <b>joints</b> of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge. These secondary members are used for reaction to slacking under vibration and consist of castle nuts, retaining washers, locking washers, serrated washers, check plates, disposable clamps. Using FS-nuts allow providing the rating rules for next generation of rolling stock. Besides the modern technologies of FS-nuts production provide their prolonged running time under the conditions of pollution, humidity, differential temperature and other adverse factors...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> is a one-degree-of-freedom {{kinematic}} pair used in mechanisms. [...] Screw joints provide single-axis translation by utilizing the threads of the threaded rod {{to provide such}} translation. This type of joint is used primarily on most types of linear actuators and certain types of cartesian robots.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Screw</b> <b>joint</b> is {{sometimes}} {{considered as a}} separate type but it is actually a variation of bolted joint. The difference is that a screw is used rather that bolt, thus requiring an internal thread {{in one of the}} jointed parts. This can save space, however, continuous reuse of the thread would probably damage the coils, making the whole part unsuitable.|$|E
50|$|The new 1911 version {{improved}} on the 1901 {{gun with}} a new pole trail, recoil buffer, recuperator and gunshield, and increased shell weight from 10 to 12.5 lb. It was a screw gun design, where the barrel could be separated into two parts via a <b>screw</b> <b>joint.</b> This allowed for the gun to have a heavier barrel, but still be broken into smaller portions for transport by mule teams. This was important for a weapon designed {{to be used in}} mountainous and rough terrain, or where adequate vehicle and horse transport was not readily available. The weapon could be carried by six mules or towed.|$|E
30|$|The {{findings}} above {{show that}} tightening speed’s {{effects on the}} torque coefficient and tightening properties of lag <b>screw</b> timber <b>joints</b> with steel side plates differ depending on the wood species of the timber component.

50|$|Inserts are pins, bolts, <b>screws,</b> <b>joints</b> {{and other}} {{structures}} {{that are used}} to transfer localized loads to a composite panel or to join two composite panels together.

50|$|The {{apparently}} tumbling {{movements are}} composed {{of a series of}} very rapid separate jumps (each jump of a duration of approximately 80 ms). They result from the beetle's efforts to get itself back into take-off position for flight when it has been in either lateral or dorsal position. Each individual jump should be considered as an extended rotation, performed by one leg of the third leg pair (metapodium). Depending on whether the left or the right metapodium is used as the leg that provides the leverage for take-off, change occurs {{in the direction of the}} jump. The energy for propulsion varies with the beetle's immediate muscle work, so that jump lengths and heights vary, with rotation frequencies recorded up to 48 per second (Mordellochroa abdominalis) around the gravitation centre of the body's longitudinal axis. Additional revolving around the transverse axis (at lower frequency) effects spiralling somersaults that are perceived as tumbling. The pintail (pygidium) is of no significance for the jump. While the pintail is no significance for the jump, meta-trochanter-femur (thighs and surrounding rings of the third leg pair)has a great capacity of free rotation (up to 270 degrees, at one level only). This capacity is due to a <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> that connects the base of metacoxa to the head of trochanter. The nut gradient is 21 degrees (as seen under a scanning electron microscpoy SEM, 1985). Technically similar jumps, though less powerful, can be observed in family Melandryidae (=Serropalpidae) (genus Orchesia) and family Scraptiidae (genus Anaspis). Their coxa-trochanter-joints are of similar structure. It can be assumed that the capacity of a tumbling form of locomotion is rooted in a common phylogeny and can therefore not be ascribed specifically to Mordellidae.Meanwhile, other authors have also pointed out the uniqueness of the real <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> in nature. (2011)The weevil of the genus Trigonopterus, Curculionidae in the Asian tropical rainforest, for example, has an even tighter connective construction in the Coxa -Trochanter joint than is found in Mordellidae. This construction, however, does not facilitate an equally high angular velocity of the torque. The joint here serves to provide a better grip on plants and easier climbing.|$|E

40|$|The {{replacement}} {{of a single}} molar with 1 implant hasbeen shown {{to be an effective}} treatment modalityin short-term studies; 1, 2 however, this presents a biomechanical challenge. Occlusal forces are greatest in the molar region, leading to possible increased stress on the implant components as well as the surrounding bone. 3 The <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> for a single implant is susceptible to loosening because a torque relative to the implant axis must be counteracted by the <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> itself. 4 One way of control-ling this load is to support a single molar replacement with 2 implants. 4 The clinical feasibility of using 2 implants to support a molar restoration has been reported previously. ...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of a suspended floor element connection (sheet steel hangers) employed in the Masonite Flexible Building (MFB) system. The hangers are mounted with screws and are pre-attached to the floor elements at manufacturing. This arrangement makes {{the design of the}} hanger critical with respect to safety and load transfer redundancy, since the screws transfer all the loads, both withdrawal and shear forces can act simultaneously. Tests have been carried out to examine the structural behaviour of the hanger. The two most critical load cases, vertical floor load and horizontal wind suction load, and three different <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> configurations were investigated. The results indicate that the vertical distance between the <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> and the upper edge of the rim beam should be increased and that withdrawal forces on the screws should be kept as low as possible. Some suggestions for improving the present design are given and a modified design is proposed to enhance the load-bearing capacity and to improve the overall safety and redundancyGodkänd; 2012; 20121205 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} prosthetic screw material on joint stability in implantsupported dentures at two levels of fit. Methods: Ten mandibular implant-supported dentures were fabricated. Twenty cast models were fabricated using these dentures. Four groups (n= 10) were tested, according to the vertical fit of the dentures [passive and non-passive] and prosthetic screw materials [titanium (Ti) or gold (Au) alloy]. The one-screw test was performed to quantify the vertical misfits using an optic microscope. The loosening torque for the prosthetic screws was measured 24 hours after the tightening torque (10 Ncm) using a digital torque meter. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (�= 0. 05). Results: Overall, dentures with passive fit and Ti screws resulted in significantly higher loosening torque of the prosthetic screws (p< 0. 05). No significant interaction was found between fit level and screw material (p= 0. 199). The prosthetic screw material and fit of implant-supported dentures have an influence on <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> stability. Ti screws presented higher joint stability than Au screws and minimum of misfit should be found clinically to improve the mechanical behavior of the <b>screw</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|E
30|$|Considering {{that the}} union between {{prosthesis}} and implant is promoted by a <b>screw</b> <b>joint,</b> the aim to tight the abutment screw {{is to keep the}} components together [5]. A screw is tightened by applying torque as a clamping force to provide a stable joint between the abutment and implant fixture. This clamping force is also known as the preload, which elongates the screw within the material then elastically recovered, increasing the strength with which the abutment and implant are pulled together [6].|$|E

40|$|Today, {{tightening}} {{tools are}} widely used in the industry and on the market you will find several products that have been assembled {{with the help of}} tightening tools. For example, tightening tools are used in the automotive industry and when assembling computer hardware. It is important that the tightening tools are robust and of high quality in order to fulfil the demanded requirements. High assembly speed has entailed an extensive use of tightening tools. To ensure that the tightening tools have the desired properties, tightening tools are tested continuously using so-called test systems. This puts high demands on the test systems since it is of importance that the tightening tools can be tested in a simple, fast and reliable way as well as repeatedly. Therefore, Atlas Copco would like to investigate whether a test system constructed with an electrical motor is a good choice. The idea of this thesis is to investigate possibilities and limitations in a test system consisting of an electrical motor that emulates the behaviour of a <b>screw</b> <b>joint.</b> To be able to investigate hardware limitations a test rig is constructed and then modelled in MATLAB.

40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB in Södertälje at the engine development department, NMKA and at Scania Latin America in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Scania {{is a global}} company with operations in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Scania is the world’s third largest manufacturer for heavy trucks and heavy bus segment. The constant development of new design solutions demands more stable mounting in Scanias production. Assemblies with new screw joints with different parameters affect {{the value of the}} clamping force for the joint and consequently the final product. It is critical that the <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> has the right clamping force to assure that it fulfils its purpose. Large deviations can result in total loss of clamping force and engine breakdown. The purpose with this master thesis was to find the most important factors that affect the clamping force and form the basis of how different screw joints should be handled. Knowledge about Scania screw joints were collected by working in the production, observing drawings, a thorough literature study and by interviewing representatives from different departments. The problems regarding screw joints were found to be rather different at the departments and the problems had been an issue {{for a longer period of}} time. The mapping of screw joints resulted in a number of interesting screw joints with different kinds of problems. A discussion about the interesting screw joints was held in order to select joints to take a closer look at. By focusing on area of interest, area of responsibility and resources, five screw joints were selected, rocker arm shaft, main bearing cap, connecting rod and the oil sump in both aluminum and steel. The chosen screw joints represented specific types of screw joints on which the chosen parameters were tested. The important parameters that were tested are driver speed, friction and settlement. The equipment that was used throughout the work was the Ultrasonic, which measures the length of a screw with ultrasound. The authors feel that the equipment has given reliable results and that it has been easy and convenient to use during the tests since time consuming strain gages were avoided. The test results shows that the speed of the nut runner has a great influence on the clamping force and torque. Depending on the nut runner and which kind of <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> that is examined the clamping force and torque varies. The friction affects the result of the tightening substantially, especially when tightening by torque. If torque and angle tightening is used it is an advantage to keep the initial torque as low as possible but high enough to keep the surfaces tight together before applying the angle. The test results regarding settlement show that the settlement is extremely dependent on the ingoing parts in the <b>screw</b> <b>joint.</b> Parameters such as screw and clamped parts affect both the tightening procedure and degree of settlement. The authors recommendations are that a decision has to be made about what information is important for each department. Furthermore, as the tightening procedure is really important for the final clamping force it is advisable to decide which department that is responsible of making the correct tightening parameters of a specific <b>screw</b> <b>joint</b> in the production. Hopefully this master thesis has woken an interest which in the future can make a difference for an even more stable production and in the end an even better quality at Scania CV AB.
