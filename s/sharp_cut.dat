25|$|In 2009, Anatoliy Serdyukov was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} Minister of Defense of Russia. Serdyukov's 2008 Russian military reform was characterized by a <b>sharp</b> <b>cut</b> in spending. Out of the museum's twenty employees only four retained their positions, continuing to work as security personnel. The museum's bank account was also terminated. Although the museum had officially closed, it continued to serve excursions free of charge on rare occasions. In September 2013, the new defense minister Sergey Shoygu initiated a reform sponsoring organizations of cultural importance, effectively reopening the museum. The Khabarovsk Military Museum is the only war museum in the Russian Far East.|$|E
2500|$|In late January 2009, {{increasing}} political protests led by {{the mayor}} of Antananarivo Andry Rajoelina destabilized the Malagasy government. With {{the backing of the}} military, former President Ravalomanana was removed from office on March 18, and power was handed power over to Rajoelina, making him the President of the High Transitional Authority of Madagascar. This [...] drew sharp criticism from the international community and resulted in a <b>sharp</b> <b>cut</b> in foreign assistance from donor countries. Foreign embassies also discouraged their citizens from visiting the country, causing a sharp drop in ecotourism—a critical part of the economy. Coupled with a recent crash in vanilla prices, this has left an already impoverished Malagasy government and economy in an even more desperate state, especially since communities living within the vicinity of the national parks receive half of the park entrance fees. This set the stage for profitable, illegal activities. To meet the surge in demand for Malagasy rosewood, illegal logging of rosewood surged in the SAVA Region, or northeast corner of the island, including Marojejy and Masoala national parks, starting {{around the time of the}} first political protests.|$|E

50|$|As {{time went}} on it became {{increasingly}} clear that a series of supplementary measures would be taken {{during the course of}} the year as a means to restrain an out-of-control budget deficit. These included <b>sharp</b> <b>cuts</b> in spending on state-run healthcare, education and social security systems, along with widespread tax hikes.|$|R

In August 1992 faculty passed a vote of no confidence in Day and asked the California State University Board of Trustees to replace him. An improvement in the budget situation led to the cuts being rescinded, but Day remained unpopular on campus, and was ultimately asked to resign, ostensibly for health reasons.|$|R
60|$|We {{had sprung}} into the dog-cart, and Holmes, after turning the horse, {{gave it a}} <b>sharp</b> <b>cut</b> with the whip, and we flew back along the road. As we turned the curve, the whole stretch of road between the Hall and the heath was opened up. I grasped Holmes's arm.|$|E

40|$|Current {{surpluses}} in the U. S. {{have been}} achieved {{by a combination of}} a strong economy, low interest rates, and <b>sharp</b> <b>cuts</b> in defence spending. These surpluses follow a period (the eighties) of rather exceptional budget deficits. This paper investigates the origin, size, and expected future patterns of the U. S. budget balance. It discusses how different political forces may generate alternative fiscal scenarios for the U. S. in the next decade. ...|$|R
40|$|We discuss an {{enhancement}} of the Balas-Jeroslow procedure for strengthening disjunctive cuts for mixed 0 - 1 programs. It {{is based on}} the paradox that sometimes weakening a disjunction helps the strengthening procedure and results in <b>sharper</b> <b>cuts.</b> When applied to a split cut derived from a source row of the simplex tableau, the enhanced procedure yields, besides the Gomory Mixed Integer cut (GMI), also inequalities that cut deeper in certain directions. ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{plasma cutter}} {{manufacturers}} build CNC cutting tables, {{and some have}} the cutter built into the table. CNC tables allow a computer to control the torch head producing clean <b>sharp</b> <b>cuts.</b> Modern CNC plasma equipment is capable of multi-axis cutting of thick material, allowing opportunities for complex welding seams that are not possible otherwise. For thinner material, plasma cutting is being progressively replaced by laser cutting, due mainly to the laser cutter's superior hole-cutting abilities.|$|R
60|$|But at last Matt {{managed to}} reach the open doors, and then he gave the horse a <b>sharp</b> <b>cut</b> on the flank, which sent him up the alley on a canter.

60|$|The fight did {{not last}} many minutes. The traders did their best, and {{although}} by no means formidable opponents, distracted {{the attention of the}} robbers, who were startled by the fall of two of their party. Geoffrey received a <b>sharp</b> <b>cut</b> on the head, but at the same moment ran his opponent through the body, while Gerald Burke cut down the man opposed to him. The other four robbers, seeing they were now outnumbered, at once took to their heels.|$|E
60|$|Fired by this ambition, she startled Barkis by a <b>sharp</b> <b>cut,</b> {{and still}} more bewildered him by leaving him to his own {{guidance}} down the steep, stony road. The approach {{would have been a}} fine success if, just as Rose was about to pull up and salute, two or three distracted hens had not scuttled across the road with a great squawking, which caused Barkis to shy and stop so suddenly that his careless rider landed in an ignominious heap just under old Sorrel's astonished nose.|$|E

50|$|Several {{negative}} trends (for the Liberals) were obscured {{somewhat by}} the euphoria of victory. The government's <b>sharp</b> <b>cuts</b> to government services were particularly resented in country Victoria, where the Liberals and their coalition partners, National Party held {{almost all the}} seats. The loss of the Mildura seat to an independent Russell Savage was an indication of this disaffection, and when in February 1997 independent Susan Davies {{was elected to the}} seat of Gippsland West, this trend seemed set to continue.|$|R
5000|$|Reagan's {{economic}} policies (dubbed [...] "Reaganomics") and {{the implementation of}} the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 called for sharply reduced federal budgets, sharply reduced federal regulation of businesses, and <b>sharp</b> <b>cuts</b> in the federal income tax rates, the latter two of which were partially achieved. The top marginal income tax rate on high incomes was lowered from 70% to 28% over the course of seven years, with regulations on cable communication, shipping, and savings and loan associations being reduced.|$|R
60|$|Mr Grant {{said this}} {{with an air}} of vexation, that annoyed his friend a little. He would not have much minded Charley's taking a horse without leave, no matter how wild it might be; but he did not at all relish the idea of making an apology for his son's misconduct, and for the moment did not exactly know what to say. As usual in such a dilemma, the old man took refuge in a towering passion, gave his steed a <b>sharp</b> <b>cut</b> with the whip, and galloped forward to meet the delinquent.|$|E
60|$|The explanation, however, {{was much}} simpler. The horse {{had been taken}} by the luxurious and {{indolent}} Billings unknown to his companions. Overcome at the dreadful prospect of walking home in that weather, this perfect product of lethargic Sidon had artfully allowed Peters and Wingate to precede him, and, cautiously unloosing the tethered animal, had safely passed them in the darkness. When he gained his own inclosure he had lazily dismounted, and, with a <b>sharp</b> <b>cut</b> on the mustang's haunches, sent him galloping back to rejoin his master, with what result has been already told by the unsuspecting Peters in the preceding chapter.|$|E
60|$|When {{within a}} dozen paces of the master, McKinstry, {{scarcely}} checking his mustang, threw {{himself from the}} saddle, and with a <b>sharp</b> <b>cut</b> of his riata on the animal's haunches sent him still galloping towards the distant house. Then, with both hands deeply thrust in the side pockets of his long, loose linen coat, he slowly lounged with clanking spurs towards the young man. He was thick-set, of medium height, densely and reddishly bearded, with heavy-lidded pale blue eyes that wore a look of drowsy pain, and after their first wearied glance at the master, seemed to rest anywhere but on him.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 Californians enacted Proposition 13, which {{limited the}} ability of local public {{agencies}} to increase property taxes based on a property’s assessed value. This change in law, combined with <b>sharp</b> <b>cuts</b> in federal aid {{to state and local}} governments, severely limited local government’s ability to fund public infrastructure. The Marks-Roos Bond Pooling Act was thus created with the intent of providing a flexible alternative method of financing needed improvements, along with the benefit of reduced borrowing costs through the use of bond pools.|$|R
