30|$|The ATM is a {{computerised}} <b>self-service</b> <b>device</b> that dispenses {{cash and}} performs other banking services with {{the insertion of}} a card and the entering of a personal identification number (PIN) (Curran and King, 2008). It {{can be traced to}} the early twentieth century, where increasing interest and rapid development in automation created a trend toward unmanned retail and other services (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Though this innovation emerged from a growing pressure to end Saturday business hours in Europe, as well as branch expansion restrictions in the US, it successfully embedded itself in the economics of everyday life in a way that made it one of the biggest technological innovations in financial history (Goode and Moutinho, 1995; Curran and King, 2008; Volcker, 2009; Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Nevertheless, this entrenchment in society took a period of about 18  years to move from idea generation to commercialisation (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013).|$|E

It provides four thousand seats and 500 computers for readers to use. There are four thousand Internet nodes and the wifi service {{is available in}} the whole building. Services provided include the lending and housing of materials and reference services. Equipped with RFID technology, an automatic sorting system and various other electronic <b>self-service</b> <b>devices,</b> the new library will optimize its collection management practices and provide fast and convenient services. Additionally, the new facility is functionally divided into different service areas, which include general services, targeted services, special topic services, communication and exchange activities, and collection services. The new library is characterized by its distinct combination of contemporary and traditional Lingnan design. It will undoubtedly rank among the best domestic public libraries. It {{will be one of the}} most automated and open facilities, it will be convenient for patrons, and it will offer one of the largest domestic collections.|$|R
40|$|The tragic {{events of}} September 11 th, 2001, {{served as a}} {{catalyst}} for drastic change in the airline industry which was already in a financial downturn. Both the airlines and the government began introducing changes to the various aspects of the travel experience. The most impactful changes have been in the area of security, where an entirely new government agency has been created to oversee security at airports. However, additional changes to the travel experience have come from the airlines. This research provides an overview and analysis of one such change that is sweeping the industry. <b>Self-service</b> check-in <b>devices</b> were first installed by major network airlines in 1995 when Continental Airlines introduced the ETICKET machine. Others have since developed their own self-service products, while Continental has transformed its original machine into the eService product line. These devices empower the traveling customer to perform their own check-in and get through the airport quicker. Additionally, <b>self-service</b> check-in <b>devices</b> represent a cost savings opportunity for the airlines through reduced headcount requirements and ticket distribution fees. While deployment has been rapid both at Continental and other airlines, the development of a process that merges the ticket agents with the new technology has been lacking. In 2002, Continental Airlines began a cross-functional effort to drastically re-engineer the selfservice process. Many of the traits of that process have been implemented to some extent throughout Continental's domestic airports. Through observations of the current self-service process, surveys of both ticket agents and customers, and an in-depth case study comparison of two airports, this research has identified numerous opportunities for improvement of the process. In addition, the research provides recommendations for the next phases of the re-engineering process based on the findings of the observations and surveys. Finally, areas for future research that build off of these findings are presented with the goal of improving the travel experience for the customers and reducing costs for the airlines. by Jared Keith Miller.

40|$|The whole world, {{it would}} seem at first glance, has been moving toward a ―cashless society‖ ever since the {{introduction}} of ATMs and Credit Cards. As a result of on-going and frequent technological advances, society has been experimenting with the diverse use of plastic cards {{in just about every}} area of human activity involving financial transactions. The common concept of ―shopping‖ has been effectively redefined to enable efficient customer- care and service through the upgrading of possible alternatives in the use of credit/debit cards. This dissertation, therefore, explores ‗the future of self-service in a cashless society‘ as it progresses to every socio-economic aspect of life today. As the core of the challenge is to correctly predict, and then promote, changes in human behaviour, this promotes an understanding of the dynamics involved and suggests a basis for improving future business and customer interaction for the future. The dissertation reviews a number of literatures under its literature review in order to provide ground work for the selected topic. It ranges from the beginning of trade and currency up to the use of self-service technology today and the social effects that comes with its use. The research‘s methodology include a self conducted survey consisting of quantitative approaches and hypothesis in order to identify the relationship between usage of <b>self-service</b> technology <b>devices</b> and digital cash options available in the society today. The respondents to the survey include predominantly consumers in Sri Lanka, Australia and India in varying demographics. The methodology further take into account published surveys by reputed institutions in the service industry. The findings of this dissertation concludes that there is a gradual progression towards using digital cash and self-service technologies in developing countries while developed economies are moving towards more advanced means of using the same. This study further recommends certain procedures which businesses can adopt in order to gain a maximum benefit of these advancing changes...|$|R
40|$|Hotels, restaurants, {{and other}} {{hospitality}} industry operations {{are experimenting with}} <b>self-service</b> kiosks, tablet <b>devices,</b> and other technologies intended to augment or replace interactions between guests and front-line employees. While the combination of technology and people is designed to improve service, research suggests that service technologies can impede development of employee-guest rapport and lead to lower service evaluations. The studies presented in this report apply social equity theory to determine when (and why) technology can improve guests’ satisfaction with the service process and when it diminishes the guest experience. Equity theory suggests that when {{the use of technology}} prevents guests from responding to an employee’s friendly advances, guests experience psychological tension and decrease their evaluations of the service experience. The reverse situation also applies, so that when employees are less than friendly the barrier created by technology increases service evaluations by reducing guest anger. However, it is not always the case that friendly frontline staff and technology don’t mix. In a follow up field experiment, guests who used a Monscierge Connect Lobby touchscreen located not far from a bell stand preferred interacting with the technology when a hotel employee was nearby though not directly engaging guests. Thus, frontline employees should still develop a rapport with guests, but when technology acts as an “equity barrier,” the employees should provide guests with “social space,” without abandoning them entirely...|$|R
