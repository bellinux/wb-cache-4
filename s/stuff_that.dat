5|$|Basically it’s {{just about}} having a throwdown {{out in the woods}} — that’s what we used to do in high school. I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say that I do it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun for me to sing about those times and the crazy <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I used to do, and the crazy <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E

25|$|I've got {{everything}} that could be reasonably expected: a good home environment, education, stuff like that, but that's all material stuff. It's all the non-material <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I didn't have— the lineage You know, you've {{just come out of}} nowhere; there you are.|$|E

5000|$|... "It {{feels like}} a {{definite}} progression. I wouldn’t say it’s an insane departure or anything like that. We haven’t gone completely {{the other way and}} tried all kinds of new things. We’ve certainly tried some new things, but I don’t think it’s necessarily going to alienate anyone or push people away that loved the last record. There’s a lot of <b>stuff</b> <b>that’s</b> in line with Don’t Panic, but there’s a lot of <b>stuff</b> <b>that’s</b> a logical next step from it, too."—vocalist/guitarist Alex Gaskarth.|$|R
25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E
25|$|It {{was never}} a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I {{remember}} correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent {{as it would have}} been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.|$|E
25|$|Gayle {{was married}} to ex-professional {{football}}er and football pundit Mark Bright for 10 years, and had one son, Isaiah, with him. The couple separated in 2007. They officially divorced on 18 April 2008. Gayle is godmother to {{the daughter of the}} actress Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence, who played her on-screen mother, Etta Tavernier, in EastEnders. Gayle is a teetotaller and doesn't eat meat. On 4 August 2011 it was announced on The Wright <b>Stuff</b> <b>that</b> she was pregnant. On Twitter, she announced the birth of her son, Luke, on 2 November 2011.|$|E

5000|$|... "A two-year-old kid was... Just {{left him}} for dead, you know? It's terrible <b>stuff...</b> <b>That's</b> when I said this can't go on; people shouldn't {{do this to}} each other." [...] - Everett.|$|R

25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
500|$|... "It {{makes me}} feel sick actually, I feel sick in the stomach...I feel Mitchell did the best {{performance}} that he's done so far, I think Guy {{made the mistake of}} commenting on <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> didn't happen on camera.

50|$|Stove Top is a <b>stuffing</b> <b>that</b> was {{introduced}} by General Foods in 1972 (merging with Kraft in 1990 to form Kraft General Foods). It is a quick cooking ("instant") <b>stuffing</b> <b>that</b> is available in supermarkets. Unlike traditional stuffing, Stove Top can be prepared on the stove, in a pot. It {{is used as a}} side dish for meals as well as a medium in which some meats (pork, chicken) can be baked. It is sold in boxes and canisters. In 2005 it was reported that Kraft Foods, which has owned the brand since 1995, sells about 60 million boxes of Stove Top stuffing at Thanksgiving.|$|R

500|$|We... between {{fear and}} despair and hope. And that formed itself {{into such a}} heap of <b>stuff,</b> <b>that</b> I can't really {{describe}} it – how it was and what it was. Every evening, we went to pieces and during the night, we tried to build ourselves up again, so we could go into the street... and look like human beings again... And [...] was {{like being in a}} windmill; it turned and moved.|$|E
500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk <b>stuff.</b> <b>That</b> was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E
500|$|In her songs, Allen {{develops}} various personas. She {{stated that}} {{she tried to}} [...] "write about <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> happens to people from all different backgrounds". The lyrics are conversational, with a dark sense of humour. In many of the songs, one of Allen's personae disparages someone around her. In [...] "Smile", [...] "Not Big", and [...] "Shame for You", she insults an ex-boyfriend. In [...] "Knock 'Em Out", she mocks suitors at a bar, and Lily reprimands her brother Alfie on {{the song of the}} same name.|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve not," [...] said Mr. Wheeler, vehemently. [...] "I’ve got the two tubs there, flannels in {{one without}} soda, {{the other things}} in the other with soda. It’s bad <b>stuff,</b> <b>that’s</b> what it is. I thought I’d show you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Malone has {{a tattoo}} of U.S. {{president}} John F. Kennedy on his arm. Discussing the tattoo, {{he said that}} Kennedy was [...] "the only President {{to speak out against}} the crazy corruption <b>stuff</b> <b>that's</b> going on in our government nowadays." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bio: [...] "Slimestone is a rock warrior with a {{different}} personality. Short, squat, and disgustingly sinister, Slimestone enjoys wallowing in pools of boiling oil. Slimestone delights in using his slimegun to smear enemies with evil-smelling sticky <b>stuff</b> <b>that's</b> impossible to get off!" ...|$|R
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{wrote that}} the episode was [...] "just right" [...] for the series, and that it {{highlighted}} the fact that [...] "the ending was more {{about the fact that}} you took a journey with these characters." [...] He wrote that all of the character's subplots had emotion, even if they appeared slightly contrived. Ultimately he concluded that [...] "it felt okay to say goodbye because it was the right atmosphere." [...] James Poniewozik of Time {{wrote that the}} finale was [...] "touching, sweet, funny, messy, a little manipulative. And in the end, it worked." [...] He found that [...] "The <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> was like latter-seasons Office", such as Andy and Dwight's antics, were [...] "all right" [...] but that [...] "the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> recalled the sweep of the whole series was wonderful." [...] Poniewozik was slightly critical of Pam and Jim's story, noting that in the grand scheme of the show it was successful, but that it makes slightly less sense when one examines it closely; however, he felt that even [...] "if the details don't add up, the emotions do". He concluded that the episode [...] "worked mostly as an epilogue" [...] and allowed the cast of the series to have their final moments.|$|E
500|$|R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck {{wrote the}} main riff and chorus {{to the song}} on a {{mandolin}} while watching television one day. Buck had just bought the instrument and was attempting {{to learn how to}} play it, recording the music as he practiced. Buck said that [...] "when I listened back to it the next day, there was a bunch of <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> was really just me learning how to play mandolin, and then there's what became 'Losing My Religion', and then a whole bunch more of me learning to play the mandolin." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{recording}} My World, Bieber {{expressed a}} desire to [...] "grow as an artist" [...] and have [...] " [...] fans grow with [...] ". Musically, the project incorporates pop and R styles, similar to the catalogs of Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Chris Brown, Usher, and Ne-Yo. Entertainment Weekly described the record as featuring [...] "sugary puppy-love ballads and dinky dance-pop confections". Bieber looked to address a variety of lyrical themes, which he described as [...] "songs that teens can relate to" [...] and [...] "just <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> happens in everyday life".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that kind}} of miffle-business won't hurt us any. Girly-girly <b>stuff,</b> <b>that's</b> what it is. Regular autoists would rather have one of your home-made {{doughnuts}} than all the crumples in the world, {{and you can just}} bet your bottom dollar on that, Sary Jane." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Paul {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{innovative}} bass players ... half the <b>stuff</b> <b>that's</b> going on now is directly ripped off from his Beatles period ... He's an egomaniac about everything else, but his bass playing he'd always been a bit coy about." [...] —Lennon, Playboy magazine, January 1981 ...|$|R
5000|$|Anthony Caro said, [...] "Some of the <b>stuff</b> <b>that's</b> called art is just damned stupid. I mean, 'That {{glass of}} water's an oak tree' kind of thing." [...] Art critic David Lee and {{the founders of}} the Stuckism art movement, Billy Childish and Charles Thomson also oppose it.|$|R
500|$|Guitarist Kirk Hammett {{commented on}} the lack of guitar solos on St. Anger, a {{departure}} from what Metallica had done in the past: [...] "We wanted to preserve the sound of all four of us in a room just jamming. We tried to put guitar solos on, but we kept on running into this problem. It really sounded like an afterthought." [...] Hammett said that he was happy with the final product. Rock stated, [...] "We made a promise to ourselves that we'd only keep <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> had integrity. We didn't want to make a theatrical statement by adding overdubs." ...|$|E
500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, and he knows that I {{have a sense of humor}} and he feels that people don't recognize that about me. And I'll do <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why is she doing that? Why is she doing the treadmill with her high heels on?" [...] I'm like, [...] "It's a freakin' joke! It's 'Cribs'! Hello! It's a freakin' joke!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1981 Hanneman, who {{was working}} as a {{telemarketer}} at the time, met Kerry King, when King was auditioning for a southern rock band called [...] "Ledger". King remembered: [...] "As I was leaving, I saw Jeff just kinda standing around playing guitar, and he was playing <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I was into, like Def Leppard's 'Wasted' and AC/DC and Priest". After the try-out session, the two guitarists started talking and playing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs. Slayer was born when King asked [...] "Why don't we start our own band?", to which Hanneman replied [...] "...Fuck yeah!".|$|E
