Around 12:30 the harbour bailiff of the Port of Hanko saw something odd amid the waves while standing at {{the window of his}} office. At first he thought it was just a barge being towed by a tug, but after spotting first the red bottom of the vessel and then its propeller and rudder, he realized that a ship had capsized in the storm and immediately contacted the captain of the rescue vessel Russarö, who alerted the Maritime Rescue <b>Sub-Centre</b> (MRSC) of Hanko at 12:40. At the same time a harbour worker standing on one of the easternmost quays saw something that resembled a new island {{in the middle of the}} storm. At first he, too, thought that it was just a towing, but was bothered by several strange details in the barge, such as the bow thruster, and decided to go get binoculars. When he came back to get a better view, he saw Russarö heading out. Finn-Baltic was also photographed only minutes before the combination capsized by a harbour worker, who remembered hearing a rumbling sound, like a freight train, shortly after taking the picture of the ship.|$|E

40|$|In last decades, {{the spatial}} {{structure}} of the metropolitan areas has been characterized by an urban dynamics towards a more polynucleated structure, breaking with the paradigm of the monocentric city. The specialized literature has studied these polynucleated urban structures by identifying the nuclei (<b>sub-centres)</b> that are within of the metropolitan areas. According to this objective, there are two approaches to identify sub-centres: by analyzing the employment or population density and by studying the mobility flows. Although, huge efforts {{have been done in}} the density approach, there are still some uncertainty points to solve: the density analysis could not identify and characterize simultaneously the <b>sub-centres.</b> That means distinguish those <b>sub-centres</b> that only attract workers (in-commuting flows) or retain their resident workers to those <b>sub-centres</b> that are able to attract flows and retain their resident employed population at the same time. In this paper, a new integrated methodology to identify and characterize simultaneously urban <b>sub-centres</b> is proposed by using an Employment Entropy function. In comparison with the density models, now it is possible to identify <b>sub-centres</b> and characterize them by "emerging" or "large-mature" by analyzing their Employment Entropy Information. In doing so, the Employment Entropy Information of each municipality is divided into two Entropy Information functions: the resident workers -RW- and the in-commuting flows -IF- Entropy Information functions. So, the paper is organized as following: firstly, the efficacy of the proposed methodology is tested in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region from 1991 to 2001 and secondly, the impact of these identified and characterized <b>sub-centres</b> on the urban spatial structure is studied by analyzing the evolution of polycentrism level and their influence on the urban hierarchy. The results suggest that in comparison with identifying <b>sub-centres</b> by using the standard density model, the municipalities identified as <b>sub-centres</b> by using "this double" Employment Entropy Information functions are more dominant in terms of in-commuting flows, more self-contained, and its influence on the urban structure are more significant, entailing a more polynucleated metropolitan structure...|$|R

Polycentric {{structures}} in Latin American metropolitan areas: identifying employment <b>sub-centres,</b> Regional Studies. The significant spatial transformations {{that have occurred}} within Latin American metropolitan areas since the 1990 s have triggered many local studies claiming the formation of polycentric structures. This study explores the extent of that process, identifying <b>sub-centres</b> of employment using the double threshold methodology of job concentration and employment density in Mexico City (Mexico), Lima (Peru) and Fortaleza (Brazil). The results, although partial due to an absence of data on informal employment, indicate that Latin American metropolises are moving towards polycentric structures.

40|$|Much of the {{inequality}} {{literature has}} done a great deal of work to study national inequality. However, most people live in cities and their experience of inequality is shaped by their local and metropolitan environment. This fact implies that next to inequality in countries, local inequality is also important. In this context, this paper investigates the relationship that exists between the urban spatial structure (defined by means of CBD and <b>sub-centres)</b> and the causes and the consequences of urban inequality in cities. To do so, this research takes into account the Barcelona Metropolitan Region as study case. Hence, the aim of this work is to determine whether CBD (central business district) and in particularly <b>sub-centres,</b> exert an influence on urban inequality in order to define future polices that enhance social equity. What determines the degree of inequality across the municipalities of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region and, what are the factors behind the inequality growth across these municipalities?. The former question is addressed through using spatial econometric techniques that estimate if per capita income in 2008 is dependent on the past agglomeration economies that have emerged from CBD and <b>sub-centres</b> in 2001 correspondingly. Consequently, the latter point is also studied, through examining whether urbanization and localization economies that have emerged from CBD and <b>sub-centres</b> in the past, matters for the per capita income growth between 2001 and 2008. The results suggest that agglomeration economies that arise from CBD and <b>sub-centres</b> can explain the degree of income inequality and its growth as well. In addition, once is controlled for other conditions, the econometric models reveal that initial income inequality, population density, presence of human capital, land use balance, urban amenities and coast location are positively associated with per capita income as well as they predict its growth until 2008. Inversely, high level of elderly population is negatively significant correlated with per capita income and its growth. Therefore, planning a metropolitan area by taking into account <b>sub-centres</b> entail a remarkably improvement of its social performance...|$|R
