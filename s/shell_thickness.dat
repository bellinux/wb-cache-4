5|$|Examination of the Deinonychus egg's {{microstructure}} {{confirms that}} {{it belonged to}} a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with ornithischian and sauropod eggs. Compared to other maniraptoran theropods, the egg of Deinonychus is more {{similar to those of}} oviraptorids than to those of troodontids, despite studies that show the latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus. While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7cm (2.7in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2cm diameter of the largest Citipati (an oviraptorid) eggs; Citipati and Deinonychus also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of Citipati and Deinonychus eggshells are almost identical, and since <b>shell</b> <b>thickness</b> correlates with egg volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were about the same size.|$|E

25|$|The type {{of shell}} also affects {{the sound of}} a drum. Because the {{vibrations}} resonate in the shell of the drum, the shell can be used to increase the volume and to manipulate the type of sound produced. The larger the diameter of the shell, the lower the pitch. The larger the depth of the drum, the louder the volume. <b>Shell</b> <b>thickness</b> also determines the volume of drums. Thicker shells produce louder drums. Mahogany raises the frequency of low pitches and keeps higher frequencies at about the same speed. When choosing a set of shells, a jazz drummer may want smaller maple shells, while a rock drummer may want larger birch shells.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to study the effect of {{workpiece}} volume on reducing the <b>shell</b> wall <b>thickness</b> in rapid <b>shell</b> casting based upon three-dimensional printing (3 DP) technology, and to evaluate the dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties of aluminum (Al) castings obtained as per the ISO standard UNIEN 20286 -I (1995). Starting from the identification of component/benchmark, castings of different volumes (corresponding to workpieces of ɸ 60 mm, ɸ 50 mm and ɸ 40 mm) were produced with different <b>shell</b> wall <b>thicknesses.</b> Measurements on a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) allowed the calculation of the dimensional tolerances of the castings produced. Some important mechanical properties were also compared to verify the suitability of the castings. The research proved that having a <b>shell</b> wall <b>thickness</b> with a value less than that recommended (12 mm) is more suitable from a dimensional accuracy and economic point of view (irrespective of the workpiece volume within the given selected range). All the castings produced with different <b>shell</b> <b>thicknesses</b> are acceptable as per the ISO standard. The results of the study suggest that workpiece volume has an unnoticeable effect on reducing the <b>shell</b> wall <b>thickness</b> for the selected range of volumes of casting. Furthermore, the hardness of castings produced is almost same for all <b>shell</b> wall <b>thicknesses,</b> from 12 mm to 1 mm. The results are supported by cooling (time-temperature) curves, which show unnoticeable changes in the rate of heat transfer at different <b>shell</b> wall <b>thicknesses.</b> Keeping in mind the cost effectiveness of the process, one (1) mm <b>shell</b> wall <b>thickness</b> has been recommended for the production of castings.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the diameters and <b>shell</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of microbubble resonators is presented; it entails simulating whispering gallery mode (WGM) spectra using a newly developed finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) -based toolkit. Spectra {{for a range of}} <b>shell</b> <b>thicknesses</b> are simulated using FDTD, assuming a linear dependence of the free spectral range on the diameter, and the free spectral ranges and positions of the prominent modes are matched to those of the measured spectrum. This method improves upon existing techniques for extracting the diameter and thickness, such as SEM imaging, which typically require the microbubble to be dissected or otherwise rendered unusable for subsequent use. The model allows a variety of methods of mode excitation to be simulated. Dye coatings are simulated by placing a layer of dipole sources {{on the surface of the}} resonator, yielding mode couplings comparable to those measured in experiments. The model is tested for a small-diameter silica glass microbubble, with the free spectral range being simulated for a range of diameters and <b>shell</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> The numerically simulated spectra are then compared to the experimentally measured spectrum. The ability to determine the geometric parameters of such resonators directly from their WGM spectra represents a step forward in the characterization of microbubble resonators. Furthermore, the model opens the way to previously unstudied spectral behavior of microbubbles with small diameters and thin <b>shell</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> Jonathan M. M.
