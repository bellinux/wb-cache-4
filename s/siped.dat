Loudness is associated with distance {{and the power of}} the generator. Loud noises are awesome and ominous. Music remains inexplicable. Sound pressure is proportional to the number of generators. Noise from motor vehicles is generated by engine accessories, exhaust, engine knock, air flow, rattles, and tires on the pavement. A few years ago, considerable study was devoted to the squeal of tires while cornering, braking, and accelerating. Indeed, the squeal has been abated. Knobby tires, bald tires, and studded tires generate more noise than ribbed and <b>siped</b> tires. Knobbly treads generate vibrations in the casing of the tire. Tires in traction cause the tread rubber to stretch (shear) in proportion to the force; slippage and "snap-back " likely occurs. Air pocketed in tread cavities and compressed under the footprint of the tire may induce whistles or pops. When there is water on the pavement, it seems that certain noises diminish or else are obscured by splash and spray.

40|$|The {{friction}} {{of rubber}} on {{ice and snow}} surfaces is complex. Deeper scientific understanding is important for optimising performance of tyres in winter. Rubber, ice and snow systems exhibit frictional behaviour which depends on their material properties. The viscoelastic nature of rubber results in a higher real contact area compared to most other solids. At temperatures close or below the glass transition temperature, the frictional behaviour of rubber changes and its hardness increases. Thus, the real area of contact decreases, while the dissipation in {{the bulk of the}} rubber increases. Sliding of rubber on ice or snow leads to a temperature increase at the interface because of frictional heating, this can cause the surface to melt which decreases friction significantly. In this study we measured the friction of rubber on ice and snow and related the behaviour to mechanisms that occur. Key parameters affecting friction were examined and quantified. For this work a cold room and a new linear tribometer were specially designed and constructed. The rubber samples were made from various compounds and had different geometries. Typically they were the size of a “tread block element”. The geometries were chosen systematically to investigate the effects of surface area, sharp/rounded edges and sipes (small slits in the tread block that are used on snow tyres). A significant part of the work was developing consistent and reproducible ice and snow surfaces. New protocols were devised for these. The ice surfaces were made of de-ionised water, tap water and de-ionised water with salt. For the snow surface production: artificial snow was made and then compacted in a specially manufactured press, resulting in hard packed snow tracks for testing. Static and dynamic friction were investigated. Both were affected by speed, load, temperature and ice composition. The dynamic friction behaviour on ice was explained in terms of melt-water formation and the real area of contact of the rubber. The static friction was significantly affected by the losses inside the rubber bulk, the adhesive forces at the interface, and the time of stationary contact before the test. The investigation of rubber sliding on snow showed some similarities with sliding on ice; the surface of the rubber block slides over snow particles resulting in similar mechanisms as are seen on ice. However with snow there can also be a “ploughing” effect, where snow is cut by the leading edge of a sharp tread block. This effect contributes to friction. Experiments were made with simple rounded edged samples to avoid ploughing; the results showed the same trends as seen on ice, i. e. lower friction with increased speed, load and temperature. Investigations of <b>siped</b> tread blocks showed the same friction at low speeds as tread blocks without sipes. At higher speeds <b>siped</b> blocks exhibited less, or no, decrease in friction; more sipes gave less friction decrease. Our industrial collaborator, Michelin, made vehicle tests on snow using whole tyres with similar tread blocks. The trends they found were identical to our tests despite the dynamics of the system being more complex. This indicates how powerful the approach of using simple systematic experiments is for generating deeper understanding of the processes involved in sliding on ice and snow...|$|E

40|$|Tyres {{are used}} in {{everyday}} life {{for a variety of}} practical and recreational tasks. Frictional behaviour of tyres on any surface is important for vehicle safety and control; this behaviour becomes more important when that surface is snow. The interaction of rubber and a snow surface is complex and a deeper understanding of both is needed in order to help develop better tyres. Outdoor full scale tyre test results were compared to results from indoor laboratory tests using a linear tribometer and a surface of compacted artificial snow; these were in excellent correlation allowing a systematic and comprehensive study of rubber friction on snow to be conducted in the laboratory. Rubber samples of varied rubber compositions and geometries were used to gain an understanding of friction on snow. Samples with varying glass transition temperature (Tg), dynamic rigidity (G*) and Payne effect (dependence of the dynamic moduli on the amplitude of the applied strain) were investigated along with samples with and without sipes. The rubber friction coefficient (μ) was measured as a function of velocity and temperature. The <b>siped</b> samples exhibited a higher μ than those without sipes. FE simulations, rubber friction tests for varying contact pressures and steel blade force tests were performed to evaluate contributions from ‘surface’ friction and ploughing separately. The increased μ was attributed to the ploughing force from the front edges of the ‘subblocks’ created by the sipes. Although it is well known in the industry that <b>siped</b> tyres grip well, {{this is the first time}} it has been explained how sipes grip effectively through a combination of ploughing and rubber snow interaction. A comprehensive study of varying rubber properties (Tg, G* and Payne effect) was conducted to better understand their impact on snow friction. The findings were evaluated using the WLF shift factor to account for the running frequency of the rubber from the snow surface roughness. G* was found to be the dominant parameter for rubber μ when considering running frequency. Increased μ values were exhibited by rubbers with a lower G*. The decreased G* makes the rubber more compliant, thus increasing the contact area between the rubber and the snow, in turn increasing μ. A better knowledge of the surface roughness of snow will aid the understanding of the interaction between rubber and snow for tyres. A method was developed to characterise the artificial snow surface utilising sectioning and imaging of chemically stabilised snow samples. From images of the snow surface before friction testing the average indentor size can be found, this is used to analyse the running frequency of the rubber. Qualitatively comparing the surfaces before and after rubber friction testing shows a decrease in surface profile aggressivity after a test; this is attributed to melting of the snow from frictional heating and snow grain fracture. Friction tests were conducted to directly compare rubber friction on snow and ice using round edged samples. Again it was found that the rubber with the decreased G* exhibited higher friction; this was seen on both snow and ice confirming G* as the dominant rubber property for both surfaces, regardless of the surface roughness change. It was found that at low temperatures ice had a higher μ than snow, while at high temperatures snow exhibited a higher μ than ice. It is hypothesised that this intriguing switch is due to the surface roughness change leading to differing contact areas both with and without melt water. This switch is not seen when a simple heat transfer model is used, confirming the effect as a surface roughness change. The use of a modified Hertz model shows that indentation is the dominant mechanism at low velocities on snow. It is hypothesised that at high velocities melt water dominates on both snow and ice while adhesion may have a more significant role on ice at low velocities. These findings provide knowledge that can be used in the design of tyres for snow and ice in the future...|$|E
