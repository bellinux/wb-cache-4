5|$|Jenny <b>spends</b> <b>her</b> {{final days}} putting {{together}} a film of memories for Bette and Tina. The film contains friends past and present sharing their best moments. During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes then follow whose exact {{sequence}} is unclear. Odd goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and <b>spends</b> <b>her</b> days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone.

5|$|Izzie {{supports}} Alex when {{he discovers}} his new girlfriend has psychiatric problems, and convinces {{him to have}} her committed. She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities. Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny. She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%. She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully removes a tumor from her brain. Izzie <b>spends</b> <b>her</b> time in the hospital planning Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry {{in front of all}} their friends. The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines moments later. The fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, who has been in an accident and is also currently flatlining. Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work.|$|E
