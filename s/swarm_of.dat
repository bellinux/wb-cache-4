5|$|During {{the weekend}} of June 13–14, 2015, a large <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> mayflies caused several {{vehicular}} accidents on the Columbia–Wrightsville Bridge, carrying Pennsylvania Route 462 across the Susquehanna River between Columbia and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. The bridge had to be closed to traffic twice during that period due to impaired visibility and obstructions posed by piles of dead insects.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{also has}} minor-league {{professional}} sports teams. The Minnesota <b>Swarm</b> <b>of</b> the National Lacrosse League {{played at the}} Xcel Energy Center until the team moved to Georgia in 2015. Minor league baseball is represented by major league-sponsored teams and independent teams such as the St. Paul Saints, who play at CHS Field in St. Paul.|$|E
5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5000|$|Another large set of {{applications}} may be solved using <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> micro air vehicles, {{which are also}} broadly investigated nowadays. In comparison with the pioneering studies <b>of</b> <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> flying robots using precise motion capture systems in laboratory conditions, current systems such as Shooting Star can control teams of hundreds of micro aerial vehicles in outdoor environment using GNSS systems (such as GPS) or even stabilize them using onboard localization systems where GPS is unavailable. [...] <b>Swarms</b> <b>of</b> micro aerial vehicles have been already tested in tasks of autonomous surveillance, plume tracking, and reconnaissance in a compact phalanx. [...] Numerous works on cooperative <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> unmanned ground and aerial vehicles have been conducted with target applications of cooperative environment monitoring, convoy protection, and moving target localization and tracking.|$|R

5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E
5|$|Air-Cobot is {{presented}} as the first robot able to perform visual inspections of aircraft. Inspection robots using other types of sensors have been considered before, such as the European project Robair.

Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.|$|E
5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot {{was not known}} to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, {{but at least one}} earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.|$|E
5|$|Donecle uses a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> drones {{equipped}} with laser sensors and micro-cameras. The algorithms for automatic detection of defects, trained on existing images database {{with a machine}} learning software, are able to identify various elements: texture irregularities, pitot probes, rivets, openings, text, defects, corrosion, oil stains. A damage report is sent on the operator's touch pad with each area of interest and the proposed classification with a probability percentage. After reviewing the images, the verdict is pronounced by a qualified inspector.|$|E

Yukari {{immediately}} grabs Makoto and flees to the roof. However they are cornered by a giant creature who knocks Yukari out. Much to everyone's amazement though, Makoto awakens {{to the power of}} Persona, calling forth Orpheus. However another Persona known as Thanatos, rips out of Orpheus and grotesquely destroys the creature before Makoto faints.|$|E
5|$|Once he is released, Samuel {{returns to}} his {{ministry}} and attempts to heal {{a woman in a}} wheelchair. However, she suffers a seizure and dies, which leads to Samuel's second arrest. An autopsy reveals the woman died of cyanide poisoning, whilst Mulder and Scully find evidence that the <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> locusts, which were actually common grasshoppers, was guided by someone to the courtroom through the building's ventilation system. Mulder believes Samuel to be innocent. However, the local sheriff, Maurice Daniels, allows two of his men to beat Samuel to death in his cell.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{eventually}} {{turns up}} drunk {{at a local}} bar, his faith shaken by the death. He is taken into custody. The agents doubt his ability, but {{he is able to}} convince Mulder that he knows the latter has lost a sister—Samantha—at a young age. Mulder has been seeing visions of Samantha, and continues to see them. At Samuel's bail hearing, the courtroom fills with a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> locusts, which Samuel claims is a sign of God's wrath against him.|$|E

5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, Voyager encounters a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> space-borne lifeforms, which mistake the vessel for a member of their species. The presence of the aliens induce a premature mating cycle in Kes (Jennifer Lien), causing her and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) to question whether or not they are ready to have children.|$|E

In this episode, an amateur stunt performer is killed while performing a daring act for a local cable reality show. Scully, Doggett and Reyes discover that the culprit was apparently a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> killer flies hidden in the victim's brain.|$|E
5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado <b>Swarm</b> <b>of</b> 1787 was {{the largest}} tornado {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched down around 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same path as a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado was nearly as violent as the Wallingford Tornado of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town. What may have been another tornado caused additional damage as far east as Coventry. Another tornado struck East Windsor, damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched down near Killingly, moving northeast into Rhode Island and Massachusetts.|$|E
