Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is ideal for analyzing such safety-critical systems; however, its direct application is limited to small-scale systems of no more than two vehicles due to an exponentially-scaling computational complexity. Previously, the <b>sequential</b> <b>path</b> planning (SPP) method, which assigns strict priorities to vehicles, was proposed; SPP allows multi-vehicle path planning to be done with a linearly-scaling computational complexity.

In this paper, we make SPP more practical by providing three different methods to account for disturbances in dynamics and imperfect knowledge of higher-priority vehicles' states. Each method has different assumptions about information sharing. We demonstrate our proposed methods in simulations. Comment: American Control Conference, 201...|$|E

For monotonic loading, such experiments pointed out, an early localization of the strain field in parallel mesobands, few micrometers width, crossing grain boundaries.

The two best known methods are the regularized phase tracker (RPT), and the two-dimensional Hilbert Transform method (2 D-HT).

In this paper, we show a novel method to demodulate SFPI with closed fringes which follow arbitrary <b>sequential</b> <b>paths.</b> Through the work presented here, we introduce a new technique to demodulate SFPI with estimations within the function space C; in other words, estimations where the phase curvature is continuous.
