40|$|As the {{electronics}} industry continues {{to push for}} miniaturization, several reliability factors become vital issues. The demand for a high population of smaller and smaller <b>solder</b> <b>bumps,</b> while also increasing the current, {{have resulted in a}} significant increase in the current density. As outlined in the International Technology of Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), this trend makes electromigration the limiting factor in high density packages. The heightened current density and correspondingly elevated operating temperatures are a critical issue in reliability since these factors facilitate the effects of electromigration. Therefore, as bump sizes continue to decrease, the study of electromigration reliability becomes crucial in order to understand and possibly prevent the causes of failure. A systematic study of electromigration in eutectic SnPb and Pb-free <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> was conducted in order to characterize the reliability of the Micro SMD package family.

Modern particle tracking systems may feature 100 million channels, or pixels, which need to be individually connected to read-out chains. Silicon pixel detectors are typically connected to readout chips by flip-chip bonding using <b>solder</b> <b>bumps.</b> High-quality electro-mechanical flip-chip interconnects minimizes the number of dead read-out channels in the particle tracking system. Furthermore, the detector modules must endure handling during installation and withstand heat generation and cooling during operation.

Current non-destructive <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> inspection techniques like electrical testing, X-ray and acoustic microscopy have some application gaps. New <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> inspection technique is urgently needed to fill these gaps. Previous work has shown the potential of using a non-contact, non-destructive laser ultrasonics and laser interferometer based inspection system for assessing <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> qualities.

The quality of the solder bumps can be evaluated by analyzing the out-of-plane displacement. However, {{there are still some}} gaps {{that need to be addressed}} before the system is ready on the shelf. This dissertation focuses on addressing some of these existing issues. The research work consists of the following: 1) a control interface was developed to integrate all the different modules to achieve automation. 2) a new signal-processing method for analyzing the transient out-of-plane displacement signals without requiring a known-good reference chip was developed. 3) the application scope of the system was expanded to inspect the second level solder bumps in BGA packages.

The concept of wetting area error ratio was introduced to quantify the change of the designed wetting area on PCB and the actual wetting area. The chip size and the <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> parameters determined the alignment tolerance required on the PCB. The geometry-based model was used to model the solder joint shape and predicted the failure mechanism of solder joint during the bonding process.

Flip-chip-on-flex (FCOF) technology has been developed for various size chips and various flexible substrate designs. The warpage of flexible substrate was critical to the bonding process and the underfill process. The reliability of solder joints in FCOF was evaluated and tested using thermal cycling and temperature/humidity tests.
