40|$|Quantum carpets are generic spacetime {{patterns}} {{formed in}} the probability distributions P(x,t) of one-dimensional quantum particles, first discovered in 1995. For {{the case of an}} infinite square well potential, these patterns are shown to have a detailed quantitative explanation in terms of a travelling-wave decomposition of P(x,t). Each wave directly yields the time-averaged structure of P(x,t) along the (quantised) spacetime direction in which the wave propagates. The decomposition leads to new predictions of locations, widths depths and <b>shapes</b> of <b>carpet</b> structures, and results are also applicable to light diffracted by a periodic grating and to the quantum rotator. A simple connection between the waves and the Wigner function of the initial state of the particle is demonstrated, and some results for more general potentials are given. ...|$|R
50|$|Nearly {{two dozen}} crystal coffins {{from all over}} China were also there for the competition, {{including}} six from Shanghai and one from Sichuan (which featured a circular <b>shape</b> and red <b>carpet</b> inside, reminiscent of Mao's symbol of the red sun during the Cultural Revolution). The design of the 608th factory, after being subject to various environmental tests (including for temperature, vibration, and an 8.0-magnitude earthquake), was selected on the spot as Mao's crystal coffin.|$|R
50|$|Oriental bazaar Altyn Asyr (Altyn Asyr gündogar bazary) {{also known}} locally as Täze jygyldyk (Новая Толкучка; New tolkuchka) is the largest market in Turkmenistan, and the fifth-largest in Central Asia. It {{is located in the}} {{outskirts}} of Ashgabat, in the residential area Choganly. It was built to resemble the <b>shape</b> a Turkmen <b>carpet</b> ornament of Ahal Province. The market covers 154 hectares. At the heart of the bazaar is a tall clock tower, its main landmark. There are 2,155 shops in the market.|$|R
5000|$|The Equicizer has {{a wooden}} body {{resembling}} {{the back of}} a horse in size and <b>shape,</b> covered with <b>carpet,</b> upon which a saddle is placed. The head is sculpted to look like a real horse, and the neck attaches to the horse body so that it pivots at the [...] "shoulder", attached to springs inside the body that create resistance. It has no legs, and the rider takes the reins and pushes the neck to make it move. [...] Instead of legs, it is suspended over a stationary frame, and stays in one place as it realistically simulates the movement of an actual horse.|$|R
5000|$|The carpet is {{worked with}} silk {{embroidery}} thread in tent stitch on a linen ground. The stitching is very fine (400 stitches/inch, 62 stitches/cm) and was worked {{in at least}} 23 different colours. [...] The tension of the tent stitches over time has distorted the <b>shape</b> of the <b>carpet.</b> It is characteristic of professional canvas work popular for furnishings in the Elizabethan era. [...] The field design is a grape vine trellis. The border, thought to represent human progression from a wild state to civilisation, depicts a variety of country pursuits set against a pastoral landscape, described as [...] "perhaps the finest range of genre scenes {{to come down to}} us from Elizabethan times". A manor house, shepherd, travelling vendor with his packhorse, lords and ladies, hunting scenes, milkmaids, millers, water mills and windmills are all shown.|$|R
40|$|Urban growth {{prediction}} {{has acquired}} {{an important consideration}} in urban sustainability. An effective approach of ur-ban prediction can be a valuable tool in urban decision making and planning. A large urban development has been oc-curred during last decade in the touristic village of Pogonia Etoloakarnanias, Greece, where an urban growth of 57. 5 % has been recorded from 2003 to 2011. The prediction of new urban settlements was achieved using fractals and theory of chaos. More specifically, {{it was found that}} the urban growth is taken place within a Sierpinski <b>carpet.</b> Several <b>shapes</b> of Sierpinski <b>carpets</b> were tested in order to find the most appropriate, which produced an accuracy percentage of 70. 6 % for training set and 81. 8 % for validation set. This prediction method can be effectively applied in urban growth model-ling, once cities are fractals and urban complexity can be successfully described through a Sierpinski tessellation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model for the carpet cutting problem in which <b>carpet</b> <b>shapes</b> are cut from a {{rectangular}} carpet roll with a fixed width and sufficiently long length. Our exact solution approaches decompose the problem into smaller parts and minimise the needed carpet roll length for each part separately. The customers requirements are to produce a cutting solution of the carpet within 3 minutes, in order to be usable during the quotation process for estimating the amount of carpet required. Our system can find and prove the optimal solution for 106 of the 150 real-world instances provided by the customer, and find high quality solutions to the remainder within this time limit. In contrast the existing solution developed some years ago finds (but does not prove) optimal solutions for 30 instances. Our solutions reduce the wastage by more than 35 % on average compared to the existing approach. ...|$|R
5000|$|This carpet derives it {{name from}} the village of Pirebedil. The local carpet makers call this carpet [...] "Burma", [...] "Gyrman", {{sometimes}} [...] "Gaichi". Some of the oldest carpet weavers and arts experts refer to it as [...] "Migradi" [...] or [...] "Grou", which is a modification of the Arab word [...] "menrou" [...] ("scissors"). To the left and right of the center field there is an element that is typical only to this carpet type and resembles scissors by its <b>shape.</b> The Pirebedil <b>carpets</b> are more ancient than any other Azerbaijani carpet. The basic elements are [...] "gaichi" [...] or [...] "buinuzu" [...] ("horns") on the left and right sides of the carpet as a symbol heroism and courage, an image of a turkey cock {{in the middle of the}} center field and along its edge line, leaves of fruit trees and octagonal gels. Typically, the color of the background of the center field is dark-navy blue or dark-red.|$|R
40|$|A {{wideband}} published {{slot antenna}} appropriate for wireless code {{division multiple access}} (WCDMA) and sustaining the international interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) applications is planned here. The antenna is fractal line fed and its construction is based on fractal geometry where the resonance frequency of antenna is dropped by applying iteration methods. Fractal antennas are the most suited for aerospace and UWB applications because of their low profile, light weight and low power handling capacity. They can be designed in a variety of shapes in order to obtain enhanced gain and bandwidth, dual band and circular polarization to even ultra-wideband operation. For the simulation process ANSOFT HFSS (high frequency structure simulator) has been used. The effect of antenna dimensions and substrate parameters on the performance of antenna have been discussed. The antenna has been designed using the Arlon substrate with relative permittivity of 1. 3 and a substrate of Sierpinski <b>Carpet</b> <b>shaped</b> placed on it. Feed used is the fractal line feed. The designed antenna is a low profile, small size and multiband antenna since it can be operated at different frequencies within the frequency range of 4. 3 GHz to 11 GHz. It includes the frequencies used for wireless WCDMA application and used to receive and transmit a high-frequency signal...|$|R

50|$|An {{overturned}} anticline is an asymmetrical anticline with a limb {{that has}} been tilted beyond perpendicular so that the beds in that limb have basically flipped over and may dip {{in the same direction}} {{on both sides of the}} axial plane. If the angle between the limbs is large (70-120 degrees), then the fold is an open fold, but if the angle between the limbs is small (30 degrees or less), then the fold is a tight fold. If an anticline plunges (i.e., the anticline crest is inclined to the Earth's surface), it will form Vs on a geologic map view that point in the direction of plunge. A plunging anticline has a hinge that is not parallel to the earth's surface. All anticlines and synclines have some degree of plunge. Periclinal folds are a type of anticlines that have a well-defined, but curved hinge line and are doubly plunging and thus elongate domes.Folds in which the limbs dip toward the hinge and display a more U-like shape are called synclines. They usually flank the sides of anticlines and display opposite characteristics. A syncline's oldest rock strata are in its outer limbs; the rocks become progressively younger toward its hinge. A monocline is a bend in the strata resulting in a local steepening in only one direction of dip. Monoclines have the <b>shape</b> of a <b>carpet</b> draped over a stairstep.|$|R

25|$|The wounded Emery {{suggests}} that Annie {{be killed in}} order to allow everyone to escape, alarming the rest of the group. While in the kitchen, Cathy Kramer is attacked by Mrs. Waterman and is rescued by Nick. The two decide to tie up the deranged woman and leave her in the kitchen. They agree not to inform Emery so that the unstable young man does not become more unbalanced. A ghostly Sukeena appears and drags Mrs. Waterman off into the dark wine cellar. As Nick and Cathy head back toward the main hall, the house changes around them and they become lost. A mysterious <b>shape</b> under the <b>carpet</b> chases them, and they flee. The shape begins to catch up to them, and Nick shoves Cathy into a room and slams the door behind her, turning around {{just in time to see}} a skeletal monster rushing up to him. With silence in the hallway, Cathy opens the door again but finds no sign of Nick or the entity in the empty hallway. As the house continues to change around her, Cathy ends up in the attic. Suddenly overcome by the urge to automatically write, she witnesses the murder of John Rimbauer by Ellen and Sukeena. Steve and Rachel, meanwhile, decide to look for Nick and Cathy. They find Cathy in the attic, where she is about to be attacked by a corpse-like creature. Their presence seemingly prevents the house from acting, and the corpse drops lifeless to the floor. The corpse's withered arm lets them deduce that the carcass is that of Steven's missing great-aunt (and Ellen's daughter), April Rimbauer. Suddenly, April's corpse releases a bright white light from its mouth and instantly disintegrates.|$|R
