50|$|Small Tim {{proteins}} are synthesised {{lacking a}} cleavable presequence, but instead containing internal targeting information {{and need to}} be imported to the intermembrane space. The intermembrane space import and assembly machinery (MIA) is believed to mediate transport of the small Tim precursors into the intermembrane space <b>subcompartment.</b> MIA is composed of two main essential cysteine-rich proteins; Mia40 and Erv1. Mia40 is also referred to as Tim40 in yeast and deficiency of Mia40 has been reported to affect import of the small Tims. Mia40 is anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane via an N-terminal hydrophobic segment, exposing a large domain to the intermembrane space. It contains 6 conserved cysteine residues, which allow the binding of incoming Tim precursor proteins. Following import of small Tim proteins into the intermembrane space Mia40 interacts with small Tim proteins via disulfide bonds. Following isomerisation of the disulfide bridge, the polypeptide is released. Mia40 which is now in reduced state, is then oxidised by Erv1. This oxidation step is vital to facilitate further rounds of precursor protein import. Without Erv1 activity, reduced Mia40 accumulates and is in inactive conformation. Interaction between the incoming precursor proteins, Mia40 and Erv1, is maintained {{as a result of a}} flow of electrons that are transferred from the incoming protein to Mia40 and from reduced Mia40 to oxidised Erv1. Precursors are then released in oxidised state and form disulfide bridges which prevents their escape out of the intermembrane space. Small Tim proteins are then maintained in active conformation within the intermembrane space by Hot13 (helper of Tims). It is possible that Hot13 may have reducing effects on small Tim proteins as they counterbalance the harmful effects that oxidative agents exhibit.|$|E

Herein, we engineer advanced capsosomes and demonstrate the ability to control the number of <b>subcompartments</b> and hence the degree of cargo loading. To achieve this, we employ a range of polymer separation layers and liposomes to form functional capsosomes comprising multiple layers of enzyme-loaded liposomes.

The size-dependent retention of the cargo encapsulated within the liposomal <b>subcompartments</b> during capsosome assembly and its dependence on environmental pH changes are also examined.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Croatian Forest Research Institute and Croatian Forests Ltd., Zagreb, have in 2010 jointly {{proposed}} a scientific experiment on permanent experimental plots called “The Impact of the Intensity of Silvicultural Tending on Pedunculate Oak Dieback”. The basis {{for setting up}} experimental plots were {{the results of the}} analysis of surface structure of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) stands of Spačva Forest and its projection area for the next 140 years, and the related issues of regeneration of old and tending of young stands in conditions of increasing climate change. In the future this will present a major problem for forestry practice in silvicultural operations, both in terms of workers and materials. Materials and Methods: The experiment was conducted in the area of Forest Administration Vinkovci, Forest Office Vinkovci, Management Unit Kunjevci, in three subcompartments of different age (10, 15 and 20 years) where different intensities tending operations of cleaning were conducted. A total of 20 plots were established by using the already established network of silvicultural lines and paths, while the position was recorded by a GPS device. On each plot 30 pedunculate oak trees were permanently marked (600 trees in total). Tree selection was based on spatial and phenotypic criteria. Results: The initial measurement on permanent experimental plots shows unsatisfactory number of pedunculate oak trees along with the high number of common hornbeam trees. The overall basal area has a tendency of continuous growth in relation to the age of experimental plots. The value of crown length in relation to the total height of pedunculate oak trees is 74. 3 % in <b>subcompartment</b> 32 A, 53. 5 % in <b>subcompartment</b> 34 A, and 54. 3 % in <b>subcompartment</b> 38 A.

40|$|High Ca 2 + {{content in}} the Golgi {{apparatus}} (Go) is essential for protein processing and sorting. In addition, the Go can shape the cytosolic Ca 2 + signals by releasing or sequestering Ca 2 +. We generated two new aequorin-based Ca 2 + probes to specifically measure Ca 2 + in the cis/cis-to-medial-Go (cGo) or the trans-Go (tGo). Ca 2 + homoeostasis in these compartments and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been studied and compared. Moreover, the relative size of each <b>subcompartment</b> was estimated from aequorin consumption. We found that the cGo accumulates Ca 2 + to high concentrations (150 - 300  μM) through the sarco plasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA). The tGo, in turn, {{is divided into two}} subcompartments: tGo 1 and tGo 2. The <b>subcompartment</b> tGo 1 contains 20 % of the aequorin and has a high internal [Ca 2 +]; Ca 2 + is accumulated in this <b>subcompartment</b> via the secretory pathway Ca 2 +-ATPase 1 (SPCA- 1) at a very high affinity (K 50 = 30  nM). The <b>subcompartment</b> tGo 2 contains 80 % of aequorin, has a lower [Ca 2 +] and no SPCA- 1 activity; Ca 2 + uptake happens through SERCA and is slower than in tGo 1. The two tGo subcompartments, tGo 1 and tGo 2, are diffusionally isolated. Inositol trisphosphate mobilizes Ca 2 + from the cGo and tGo 2, but not from tGo 1, whereas caffeine releases Ca 2 + from all the Golgi regions, and nicotinic acid dinucleotide phosphate and cADP ribose from none.

40|$|AbstractThe {{nucleolus}} is a multifunctional nuclear compartment usually {{consisting of}} two to three subcompartments which represent stages of ribosomal biogenesis. It is linked to several human diseases including viral infections, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Dictyostelium is a model eukaryote {{for the study of}} fundamental biological processes as well as several human diseases however comparatively little is known about its nucleolus. Unlike most nucleoli it does not possess visible subcompartments at the ultrastructural level. Several recently identified nucleolar proteins in Dictyostelium leave the nucleolus after treatment with the rDNA transcription inhibitor actinomycin-D (AM-D). Different proteins exit in different ways, suggesting that previously unidentified nucleolar subcompartments may exist. The identification of nucleolar subcompartments would help to better understand the nucleolus in this model eukaryote. Here, we show that Dictyostelium nucleolar proteins nucleomorphin isoform NumA 1 and Bud 31 localize throughout the entire nucleolus while calcium-binding protein 4 a localizes to only a portion, representing nucleolar <b>subcompartment</b> 1 (NoSC 1). SWI/SNF complex member Snf 12 localizes to a smaller area within NoSC 1 representing a second nucleolar <b>subcompartment,</b> NoSC 2. The nuclear/nucleolar localization signal KRKR from Snf 12 localized GFP to NoSC 2, and thus also appears to function as a nucleolar <b>subcompartment</b> localization signal. FhkA localizes to the nucleolar periphery displaying a similar pattern to that of Hsp 32. Similarities between the redistribution patterns of Dictyostelium nucleolar proteins during nucleolar disruption as a result of either AM-D treatment or mitosis support these subcompartments. A model for the AM-D-induced redistribution patterns is proposed...|$|E

Live cell imaging and 20 °C block–release experiments showed that VAChT–GFP, SYN–GFP and CgA–RFP specifically and transiently cohabitated in a distinct sorting compartment during cold block and then separated into synaptic protein transport vesicles (SPTVs) and LDCVs, after release from temperature block. We found that in this trans-Golgi <b>subcompartment</b> there was colocalization of SPTV and LDCV proteins, most significantly with VAMP 4 and Golgin 97, {{and to some degree}} with TGN 46, but not at all with TGN 38.

Here we show that STIM 1 dynamically moves in tubulovesicular shape on the ER and its <b>subcompartment</b> in resting living cells, whereas, upon Ca 2 + store depletion, it is rapidly redistributed into discrete puncta that are located underneath, but not inserted into the PM. Normal constitutive movement of STIM 1 is mediated through the coiled-coil and Ser/Thr-rich C-terminal domains in the cytoplasmic region of STIM 1, whereas subsequent inducible puncta formation further requires the sterile α motif domain protruding into the ER lumen. Each of these three domains (coiled-coil, Ser/Thr-rich, and sterile α motif) was essential for activating SOC channels. Hence, our findings based on structure–function experiments suggest that constitutive dynamic movement of STIM 1 in the ER and its <b>subcompartment</b> is obligatory for subsequent depletion-dependent redistribution of STIM 1 into puncta underneath the PM and activation of SOC channels...|$|E

Previous investigations suggest that caspase activation functions in lens epithelial and keratinocyte enucleation, {{as well as}} in early erythropoiesis encompassing erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) differentiation to proerythroblast. To determine whether caspase activation contributes to later erythropoiesis and whether nuclear substructures other than chromatin reorganize, we analyzed distributions of nuclear <b>subcompartment</b> proteins and assayed for caspase-induced cleavage of subcompartmental target proteins in mouse erythroblasts. We found that patterns of lamin B in the filamentous network interacting with both the nuclear envelope and DNA, nuclear matrix protein NuMA (Nuclear mitotic apparatus), and splicing factors Sm and SC 35 persisted during nuclear condensation, consistent with effective transcription of genes expressed late in differentiation. Thus, nuclear reorganization prior to enucleation is selective, allowing maintenance of critical transcriptional processes independent of extensive chromosomal reorganization. Consistent with these data, we found no evidence for caspase-induced cleavage of major nuclear <b>subcompartment</b> proteins during late erythropoiesis, in contrast to what has been observed in early erythropoiesis and in lens epithelial and keratinocyte differentiation. These findings imply that nuclear condensation and extrusion during terminal erythroid differentiation involve novel mechanisms that do not entail major activation of apoptotic machinery.

Colloidal gold particles bound to each nuclear <b>subcompartment</b> were counted and the results expressed in number of colloidal gold parti...|$|E
40|$|The {{past year}} has seen major {{advances}} {{in our understanding of}} the mechanisms through which leaf pattern is elaborated. It has been suggested that developmental <b>subcompartments</b> are delimited within the leaf and that homeobox genes are involved in specifying these domains in compound leaves. Importantly, peptide signaling has emerged as a novel component of leaf developmental pathways...|$|R
40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) consists of <b>subcompartments</b> that have distinct protein constituents, morphological appearances, and functions. To understand the mechanisms that regulate the intricate and dynamic {{organization of the}} {{endoplasmic reticulum}}, {{it is important to}} identify and characterize the molecular machinery involved in the assembly and maintenance of the different <b>subcompartments.</b> Here we report that syntaxin 17 is abundantly expressed in steroidogenic cell types and specifically localizes to smooth membranes of the ER. By immunoprecipitation analyses, syntaxin 17 exists in complexes with a syntaxin regulatory protein, rsly 1, and/or two intermediate compartment SNARE proteins, rsec 22 b and rbet 1. Furthermore, we found that syntaxin 17 is anchored to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum through an unusual mechanism, requiring two adjacent hydrophobic domains near its carboxyl terminus. Converging lines of evidence indicate that syntaxin 17 functions in a vesicle-trafficking step to the smooth-surfaced tubular ER membranes that are abundant in steroidogenic cells...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the great}} mysteries of the {{nucleolus}} surrounds its disappearance during mitosis and subsequent reassembly at late mitosis. Here, the relative dynamics of nucleolar disassembly and reformation were dissected using quantitative 4 D microscopy with fluorescent protein-tagged proteins in human stable cell lines. The data provide a novel insight into the fates of the three distinct nucleolar <b>subcompartments</b> and their associated protein machineries in a single dividing cell. Before the onset of nuclear envelope (NE) breakdown, nucleolar disassembly started {{with the loss of}} RNA polymerase I subunits from the fibrillar centers. Dissociation of proteins from the other <b>subcompartments</b> occurred with faster kinetics but commenced later, coincident with the process of NE breakdown. The reformation pathway also follows a reproducible and defined temporal sequence but the order of reassembly is shown not to be dictated by the order in which individual nucleolar components reaccumulate within the nucleus after mitosis...|$|R
