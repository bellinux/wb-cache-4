A boot that hits the leg just below the knee is thought to be particularly stylish.|$|E

In {{order to}} probe the {{possibility}} of utilizing chromed leather wastes from the view of textile, firstly ultra-short leather fiber of 0. 01 ～ 0. 5 cm was extracted by special equipment. Then the fiber structure was characterized; the moisture absorbency was tested and compared with wool and silk protein fibers. On the above basis, ultra-short collagen fiber <b>suede</b> <b>fabric</b> was developed successfully. The results indicate that ultra-short collagen fibers exist in bundles, adhesion forces between fibers are larger those of single (bundle) fiber strength. Their moisture absorbency {{is similar to that}} of wool. The micro-suede fabric made is suitable for decorating materials...|$|E

50|$|They {{are made}} {{from a wide variety}} of materials, as were the ancient thong sandals. The modern sandals are made of more modern materials, such as rubber, foam, plastic, leather, <b>suede,</b> and even <b>fabric.</b> Thongs made of {{polyurethane}} have caused some environmental concerns; because polyurethane is a number 7 resin, they can't be easily discarded, and they persist in landfills for a very long time. In response to these concerns, some companies have begun selling flip-flops made from recycled rubber, such as that from used bicycle tires, or even hemp, and some offer a recycling program for used flip flops.|$|R
50|$|Ultrasuede is {{the trade}} {{name for a}} {{synthetic}} microfiber fabric invented in 1970 by Dr. Miyoshi Okamoto, a scientist working for Toray Industries. In Japan it is sold under the brand name Ecsaine. It's an ultra-microfiber. It {{is often described as}} an artificial substitute for <b>suede</b> leather. The <b>fabric</b> is multifunctional: it is used in fashion, interior decorating, automotive and other vehicle upholstery, and industrial applications, such as protective fabric for electronic equipment. It is also a very popular fabric in the manufacture of footbags (also known as hacky sacks) and juggling balls. Other manufacturers such as Sensuede and Majilite also produce similar product lines of synthetic microfiber suede construction.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{a group of}} five Bonnie Cashin-designed showroom and runway garments and other design- and marketing-related materials (sketches, patterns, and press essays) in the Textiles and Clothing Museum (TCM) at Iowa State University. Her manufacturer, Philip Sills, donated these materials. Cashin was an American ready-to-wear fashion designer well-known for her use of leather, <b>suede,</b> textured <b>fabrics,</b> and hardware-style closures. The recognizable 2 ̆ 2 Cashin look 2 ̆ 2 was layered using ponchos, capes, coats, and other garments such as jumpsuits that all incorporated leather or suede as trim or major design and structural elements.;The materials analyzed {{in this study are}} typical of Cashin 2 ̆ 7 s work with Sills and date from 1962 to 1975. Research goals were to: (1) connect these garments to Cashin 2 ̆ 7 s design process and philosophy; (2) understand the Sills manufacturing process; (3) understand Cashin 2 ̆ 7 s role in marketing such pieces; and (4) determine if these artifacts were produced commercially. The overarching purpose was to document and interpret the TCM collection of Cashin artifacts. Research methods included a material culture analysis of the artifacts guided by Prown 2 ̆ 7 s sequential three-step model of description, deduction, and speculation. History research methods were used to investigate Cashin 2 ̆ 7 s work, design process and philosophy, and the manufacturing and marketing of her designs. Primary sources on design and marketing of the garments were sought in major Cashin archives and through a search of contemporaneous press and industry sources. The artifacts were documented and interpreted using these source materials. The five TCM artifacts, in connection with their related materials and the materials found in additional archival sources, are a rich source of data to address the study 2 ̆ 7 s goals. Cashin 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy was consistently part of her clothing designs and was the basis for her rhetoric about them. This consistency created and strengthened her brand.;This research is significant because it provides extensive documentation for the TCM, builds a strong descriptive connection between artifacts and designer, and explores Cashin 2 ̆ 7 s design process and the marketing of her work. The descriptive and interpretive connections made between these artifacts and Cashin 2 ̆ 7 s work and branding is new to the body of research about Bonnie Cashin...|$|R
