For members of separatist churches, the Sunday {{walk to the}} meeting house, {{sometimes}} as much as thirty miles, marked the intensity of dissent and strict keeping of the Sabbath was a mark of true membership. Fast days were also important, particularly in <b>Seeder</b> culture. They often did not involve actual fasting, but focused on stricter observance of the Sabbath. The established kirk had three a year, but the seeders as many as six.|$|E

Four months later, on her 60th birthday, the Associated Press reported that Fawcett {{was at that point}} cancer-free. However, in May 2007, Fawcett experienced a recurrence and {{was diagnosed}} with stage IV cancer that had metastasized to her liver (which has a 5-year survival rate of <20%); a malignant polyp was found where she had been treated for the initial cancer. Doctors contemplated whether to implant a radiation <b>seeder</b> (which differs from conventional radiation and is used to treat other types of cancer). Fawcett's U.S. doctors told her that she would require a colostomy.|$|E
500|$|As {{with other}} {{species in the}} genus, B.serrata trees are {{naturally}} adapted {{to the presence of}} regular bushfires and exhibit a form of serotiny known as pyriscence. The seedbank in the plant's canopy is released after bushfire. Fire intervals of 10 to 15 years are recommended for the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, as longer leads to overgrowth by coastal tea tree (Leptospermum laevigatum), while an interval of at least nine years was indicated in a study at Brisbane Water National Park. Repeated intervals of five years' duration or less will result in decline of population as young plants are not yet resistant to fire, and their tall habit makes them especially vulnerable. The seedbank is most productive between 25 and 35 years after a previous fire, although seedlings may be outcompeted by seedlings of [...] <b>seeder</b> species. A field study found that seeds were dispersed up to [...] from the parent plant in an hour by strong wind.|$|E
40|$|Applying {{the correct}} rate {{of a product}} is an {{important}} part of obtaining good results with both <b>seeders</b> and pesticide sprayers. With <b>seeders</b> too little seed reduces crop yields and increases weeds while too much seed increases cost and may reduce yields. With a pesticide application, too little product can mean poor control, while too much can mean crop injury, extra costs, and possible residue on the crop and/or carryover. This NebGuide discusses the various methods for calibrating sprayers and <b>seeders</b> and related application information...|$|R

500|$|Plants need a {{lignotuber}} {{of around}} [...] diameter to survive low intensity fires. Plants {{are able to}} resprout after more intense fires at around 15years of age. [...] I.anemonifolius is also serotinous—the seeds are held on the plant as a canopy-based seedbank and are released after fire. Most seedlings arise {{within a year of}} a bushfire, and very few are seen at other times. The seedbank is most productive between 25 and 35 years after a previous fire. However seedlings may be outcompeted by seedlings of obligate <b>seeder</b> species. The seeds of I.anemonifolius fall directly to the ground or are blown a short distance by wind. Young plants flower about seven years after germinating from seed. Repeated bushfire intervals of less than 10years' duration are likely to result in both reduced survival of older plants and recruitment of seedlings, possibly leading to local extinction in 50years. Intervals of at least 12–13years for low intensity fires and 15years for hotter fires are needed for population stability.|$|E

40|$|BitTorrent has {{attracted}} attention from researchers {{and the press}} for its wide deployment and explicit goal of eliminating free-riding, {{but many of the}} most important peers in BitTorrent operate outside of its incentive mechanisms. Altruistic <b>seeders</b> help bootstrap new peers and provide a significant fraction of the global upload bandwidth. We have taken an empirical approach to understanding <b>seeders</b> by studying 35 BitTorrent sites with nearly four million users at any moment over several weeks. Our study focuses on two aspects of <b>seeders.</b> First, we looked at the relationship between the number of <b>seeders</b> and bandwidth utilization. A case study of a Linux distribution network showed that as bandwidth utilization increased, the rate of seeding decreased. Second, we looked at the relationship between site attributes and the number of <b>seeders.</b> A survey of 34 BitTorrent sites over two weeks found that the presence of niche-content (e. g. only anime, hip-hop, or Linux files), merchandise for sale (e. g. t-shirts with the site URL), and negative reinforcement (e. g. a posted list of the 10 least contributing peers) correlated positively with the rate of seeding. ...|$|R
30|$|Another {{study found}} that obligate <b>seeders</b> {{produced}} more seeds under a regime of short fire intervals (three or four years) than under longer intervals between fire, whilst resprouting shrubs showed the opposite response, and resprouting trees were unaffected (Knox and Morrison 2005).

2500|$|Mouldboard ploughing, in {{cold and}} {{temperate}} climates, no deeper than 20cm, aerates the soil by loosening it. It incorporates crop residues, solid manures, limestone and commercial fertilisers along with oxygen. By doing so, it reduces nitrogen losses by denitrification, accelerates mineralization and increases short-term nitrogen availability for transformation {{of organic matter}} into humus. It erases wheel tracks and ruts caused by harvesting equipment. It controls many perennial weeds and pushes back the growth of other weeds until the following spring. It accelerates soil warming and water evaporation in spring because of the lesser quantity of residues on the soil surface. It facilitates seeding with a lighter <b>seeder.</b> It controls many enemies of crops (slugs, crane flies, seedcorn maggots-bean seed flies, borers).

2500|$|Commercial {{harvesting}} of wild geoducks {{began in}} 1976. In the early 1990s, the cultivation method developed in Washington was adopted in British Columbia by Fan Seafoods Ltd and the Underwater Harvesters Association (UHA), {{a group of}} 55 licence holders for geoduck and horse clam fishery. The UHA used this method to initiate a wild geoduck enhancement program by seeding depleted subtidal areas with cultivated juvenile geoducks thereby ensuring continued supply in the wild. It even invented a mechanical <b>seeder</b> that plants cultured juvenile geoducks on subtidal beds. Through a collaboration agreement between the provincial government's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Fan Seafoods Ltd. and UHA, five pilot sites were selected in 1996 to study the feasibility of a geoduck aquaculture venture. In 2007, the provincial government of B.C. licensed UHA to operate the first commercial geoduck farm on 25.3 ha off Hernando Island.|$|E

40|$|No tillage, {{minimum tillage}} and {{conventional}} tillage practices {{are commonly used}} in maize crops in Alentejo, affecting soil physic conditions and determining <b>seeders</b> performance. <b>Seeders</b> distribution can be evaluated in the longitudinal and vertical planes.

40|$|Times Cited: 0 Fire {{and drought}} are {{selective}} driving forces in Mediterranean plants, and thus {{their ability to}} resprout or recruit after these disturbances is of paramount importance. The contrast in regeneration niche between resprouters and <b>seeders,</b> and each group's different root characteristics, suggest that they are subjected to different degrees of environmental stress and, consequently, to different evolutionary forces. We compared leaf traits, xylem traits related to hydraulic efficiency and vulnerability to cavitation, and the physiological response to an imposed drought between seedlings of resprouters and seedlings of <b>seeders.</b> We used 12 species co-existing in Mediterranean basin ecosystems. Major {{differences were found in}} the xylem architecture and leaf traits, and in the response to drought conditions. <b>Seeders</b> were more efficient at transporting water to leaves but formed, in turn, a safer xylem network. They also presented higher photosynthesis and transpiration rates, and earlier stomatal closure with drought, but good leaf dehydration tolerance. <b>Seeders</b> and resprouters can be considered two syndromes whose different functional characteristics are related to water availability and drought responses. These characteristics, together with their differences in rooting habits, account for their distinct regeneration niches and, thus, their co-existence...|$|R
