This paper briefly {{introduces}} {{the use of}} sound-absorbing materials and <b>sound-proof</b> <b>materials</b> in the buildings, concisely summarizes the factors {{taken into account in}} the acoustic design, and then {{introduces the}} requirements of architectural acoustics materials in sports venues. It ultimately introduces the general requirements for acoustic measurement. Therefore, we can draw some conclusions. On the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen basic research, technical measures and organizational management practices in acoustic materials. On the other hand, we should pay more attention to transmission channels and reception conditions. At last, it is necessary to establish cooperation with various professions for comprehensive study, with a view to obtaining the best technical performance and economic benefits...|$|E
5000|$|The Dagger GT-X {{will be the}} [...] "Luxury" [...] {{model with}} the buyer's {{preferred}} engine and interior features. This model has around 300 pounds of insulation and <b>sound-proofing</b> <b>material.</b> TranStar's aim is {{to give it the}} feel of top-end luxury motorcars. The suspension may be soft, sport or race, as desired by the owner.|$|R
50|$|Papercrete's R-value is {{reported}} to be within 2.0 and 3.0 per inch (2.54 cm); papercrete walls are typically 10 to 12 inches thick (about 25-30 cm). Unlike concrete or adobe, papercrete blocks are lightweight, {{less than a third of}} the weight of a comparably-sized adobe brick. Papercrete is mold resistant and has utility as a <b>sound-proofing</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Safrane's {{design was}} a {{deliberate}} effort to overcome the R25's main weaknesses — insufficient chassis stiffness and poor build quality. Renault was also keen to take noise reduction to best-in-class levels. These constraints resulted in a much heavier car than its predecessor (+200-300 kg / 440-660 lb.) due to a heavily reinforced chassis and the liberal use of <b>sound-proofing</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research and describes the apparatus for measuring the acoustic characteristics of bulk materials. Ultrasound, it has passed through a layer of bulk material, is further passes through an air gap. The presence of air gap prevents from measuring tract mechanical contacts, but complicates the measurement technology Studies were conducted on the example of measuring the acoustic characteristics of the widely used perlite-based <b>sound-proofing</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Nieuw Amsterdam was {{the second}} ship in the world after the Normandie to boast a theater, a feature the larger and faster Queen Mary did not {{initially}} have. The deeply cushioned seats commanded an unobstructed view of the stage, and the egg-shaped contour of the auditorium {{took advantage of the}} latest in scientific <b>sound-proofing</b> <b>materials</b> and amplifying equipment to ensure perfect acoustics for concerts, dramatic performances and pre-release motion pictures. Found at {{the front end of the}} Theatre was a striking mural in red, black and gold by Reyer Stolk.|$|R
40|$|Modified {{spiral bevel}} gears that {{generate}} relatively little noise and vibration designed and fabricated for use in U. S. Army OH- 58 D helicopter. Noise reduced by 12 to 19 dB. Similar low-noise, low-vibration {{spiral bevel gears}} used in other helicopters, with consequent benefits in comfort and health of pilots and passengers, enhancement of pilots' performance and safety through reduction of audible distraction, and reduction in cost and weight of helicopters through reduction in amount of <b>sound-proofing</b> <b>material.</b> Low-noise, low-vibration spiral bevel gears also used in drive axles of cars and trucks for smoother, quieter rides...|$|R
40|$|The column (1) {{from which}} an equipment-holder (2) is suspended, is rotarily {{positioned}} on {{a base plate}} rotarily fixed to the ground. The C-shaped equipment-holder has rapid fastenings for fixing it at different heights to the columns. The column consists of a basic body with two-part metal planking enclosing at least one hollow interior. The top end side of the column has a light; {{the rear of the}} column has a screen (3) made of light-permeable, <b>sound-proof</b> <b>material.</b> The column is joined to a flexible partition(4). ADVANTAGE - Various computer components are easily and suitably contained in a multi-functional container...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{most famous}} {{invention}} was the K Brick, {{which lead to}} the development of the concrete block. It was patented in 1927 and she was honored for it by the American Ceramic Society in 1931. The K Brick was made of clay and used for hollow wall construction. It can be described as an inexpensive, light, fireproof clay brick that could be filled with insulating or <b>sound-proofing</b> <b>material.</b> Keichline noted that her K Brick, “requires less to make than brick and because of its design takes less time to fire - the tile would reduce the weight of the wall by one-half.” ...|$|R
50|$|In December 1994, the {{refinery}} opened a plant {{for the production}} of roofing and waterproofing, <b>sound-proof</b> roll <b>material,</b> as well as bitumen-polymer mastic hot applications. In 1996, a complex {{for the production of}} linear alkyl benzene was opened. In 1999, a technical re-gas fractionation plant was opened.|$|R
50|$|Based on the Porsche 964 was the 1990 racing {{version for}} the new Porsche Carrera Cup. In {{addition}} {{to an increase in}} output by 11 kW to 195 kW (265 hp) the 964 Cup had a welded roll-cage, a modified chassis set-up and the ground clearance was 55 mm lower than on the standard version. To reduce weight: the interior and the <b>sound-proofing</b> <b>material</b> was removed. The gear ratios were modified and it had non power-steering. The vehicle did have a catalytic converter and an anti-lock braking system (ABS).In 1992, the 964 Cup had a major revision. The vehicle now had the body from the 964RS and the engine now produced 202 kW (275 hp). Another major change was that the ABS could be switched off in the event of emergency braking or whilst the car was going backwards. The vehicle now had 18 inch magnesium rims, which replaced the aluminium rims. The car was lowered by a further 20 mm.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} {{investigation}} is {{development of a}} new method of producing fibrous plates from 100 -percent precipitate after mechanical decontamination of waste waters resulting from production of paper and pulp. The researchers have pioneered in studying the physico-chemical, structural and mechanical properties of the precipitate, classifying the precipitate, developing a new method of investigating the filtration properties of precipitates contained in waste waters discharged from paper and pulp plants, determining the optimum methods of intensification of the filtration process and establishing the correlation relationship between the precipitate properties and the physico-mechanical characteristics of fibrous plates. They have determined the ortimal parameters of the process of moulding and hot pressing and developed a new method of utilization of substandard raw materials. The obtained results have been promoted at the "Svyatogorsk" production corporation, St-Petersbourg cardboard-producing and polygraphic integrated works, Kamensk cardboard factory, etc. The said product may find application as a heat-insulating, <b>sound-proofing</b> and constructional <b>materials</b> in the sphere of smale-scale industrial construction and civil engineeringAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
