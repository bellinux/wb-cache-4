The effects of heating power inputs (80 – 180 W) and fluid filling ratios (25 %, 48 %, and 55 %) on the <b>start-up</b> <b>temperature,</b> start-up time, temperature difference, and relative thermal resistance on the Z-axis of the PGHP in a vacuum of 1 × 10 − 3 Pa were studied at unsteady state. Furthermore, the gas-liquid two-phase behavior of the interior working fluid of PGHP, and the coupling heat transfer behavior of the boiling liquid and the condensate were observed through a visualizable window under different experimental conditions. The results show that, {{with the increase of}} heating power input, the <b>start-up</b> <b>temperature</b> of the PGHP increases and the start-up time is shortened. The <b>start-up</b> <b>temperature</b> of the PGHP was around 33 °C and the start-up time was about 320 s at the heating power input of 120 W and working fluid filling ratio of 55 %. The relative thermal resistance and the temperature difference on the Z-axis of the PGHP increase firstly and then decrease with the increase of heating power input at unsteady state. The complex gas-liquid two-phase behavior of the PGHP mainly includes: the formation and growth of bubbles, the merging and break up of bubbles, and the coupling heat transfer between boiling liquid and condensate, which demonstrate that the novel SVPGHP can be used to effectively study the heat transfer process of PGHP...|$|E

A prototype was built and tested on a specially prepared test rig at the Heat Pipe Laboratory of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (LABTUCAL-UFSC). The boiling and condensation heat transfer coefficients were obtained experimentally {{as a function of}} the heat transfer rate for the range of temperatures of interest. The conditions for the correct start-up were studied and the maximum and the minimum heat transfer rates were measured. The results show that start-up of the tested prototype occurs when the evaporator reaches the temperature of approximately 37 °C and the heat transfer rate is approximately 25 W. After start-up, the system works well at power levels less than 25 W. Even a heat transfer rates less than 5 W are sufficient to keep the loop-thermosyphon working properly.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} pulsating heat pipes with dual-layer and single layer configurations {{was conducted in}} order to determine the effect of the heat transfer and overall system performance given a constrained dimensional heat source with a dual-layer arrangement. The dual layer configuration is an assembly of two pulsating heat pipes of equal measurement connected with a cross linking tube, allowing them to operate using the same working fluid. The dual-layer system was compared to the base single-layer system on several different accounts. These included <b>start-up</b> time and <b>temperature,</b> the average/minimum/ and maximum evaporator temperature during steady state operation, the overall heat transfer capability, and the overall thermal resistance of the system. These requirements were reviewed at different fill ratios: 0 %, 25 %, 75 %, and 90 %. The dual layer pulsating heat pipe system (DLPHP) attained the lowest thermal resistance of 0. 12 ºC/W at a fill ratio of 75 %, while also maintaining an average evaporator temperature of 85 degrees Celsius at an input power of 120 Watts. The single layer pulsating effect, however, was attained at 110 degrees Celsius at its most efficient fill ratio of 50 % and a thermal resistance of 0. 85 ºC/W and input power of 120 Watts. It was concluded that the dual-layer system exposed to the same input power and area achieved an overall increase in performance with respect to <b>start-up</b> time and <b>temperature,</b> showing <b>start-up</b> oscillation <b>temperatures</b> as low as 73 degrees Celsius, compared to the 88 degrees Celsius required to observe temperature oscillation in the single layer pulsating heat-pipe (SLPHP) ...|$|R

The system is designed to operate with moderate-temperature heat input {{that is consistent with}} solar-thermal collectors. Diaphragm pistons and nylon flexures are considered for this prototype to eliminate surface friction and to provide appropriate seals. In addition, low loss diaphragm pistons, etched and woven-wire screen heat exchangers, and plastic flexures, as the main components of the system, are outlined. The experimental results are presented and compared with design analysis. Experiments successfully confirm the design models for heat exchanger flow friction losses and gas spring hysteresis dissipation. Furthermore, it is revealed that gas spring hysteresis loss is an important dissipation phenomenon for low-power Stirling engines and should be carefully addressed in design. Analysis shows that the gas hysteresis dissipation is reduced drastically by increasing the number of phases in a multiphase Stirling engine system. It is further shown that for an even number of phases, half of the engine chambers could be eliminated by utilizing a reversing mechanism within the multiphase system. The mathematical formulation and modal analysis of multiphase Stirling engine system are then extended to a system that incorporates a reverser. By introducing a reverser to the fabricated prototype, the system successfully operates in engine mode.

Fabrication and testing of a liquid-liquid PHP based heat exchanger. Distilled Water has beeu used as the hot and cold fluids in the Heat Exchanger. The evaporator section of PHP was kept similar to the condenser section, while the adiabatic section was negligible. Various tests have been carried out to calculate the rate of heat transfer and effectiveness of a heat exchanger at different P 1 -P orientations, filling ratio, flow rates and inlet temperature of fluids.

40|$|The polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) is an electrochemical device {{used for the}} production of power, which is a key for the transition towards green and renewable power delivery devices for mobile, stationary and back-up power applications. PEMFCs consume hydrogen and oxygen to produce power, water and heat. The transient start-up from sub-zero freezing temperature conditions is a problem for the successful, undamaged and unhindered operation. The generation and presence of water in the PEMFC stack in such an environment leads to the formation of ice that hinders the flow of gases, causes morphological changes in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) leading to reversible and irreversible degradation of stack performance. Start-up performance is highly dependent on start-up operational conditions and procedures. The previous state of the stack will influence the ability to perform upon the next start-up and operation. Water generated during normal operation is vital and improves performance when properly managed. Liquid water present at shut-down can form ice and cause unwanted start-up effects. This phase change may cause damage to the MEA and gas diffusion media due to volume expansion. Removal of high water content at shutdown decreases proton conductivity which can delay start-up times. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has established a set of criteria that will make fuel cell technology viable when attained. As specified by DOE, an 80 kWe fuel cell will be required by 2015 to reach 50 % power in 30 seconds from start-up at an ambient temperature of - 20 °C. This work investigates freeze start-up in a multi-kilowatt stack approaching both shut-down conditioning and start-up operations to improve performance, moderate fuel cell damage and determine the limits of current stack technology. The investigation involved a Hydrogenics Corporation 5 kW 506 series fuel cell stack. The investigation is completed through conditioning the fuel cell start-up performance at various temperatures ranging from - 5 °C to below - 20 °C. The control of system <b>start-up</b> <b>temperature</b> is achieved with an environmental chamber that maintains the desired set point during dwell time and start-up. The supply gases for the experiment are conditioned at ambient stack temperature to create a realistic environment that could be experienced in colder weather climates. Temperature controls aim to maintain steady ambient temperatures during progressive start-up in order to best simulate ambient conditions. The control and operation of the fuel cell is maintained by the use of a fuel cell automated test station (FCATS™). FCATS supplies gas feeds, coolant medium and can control temperature and reactant humidity in reactants according to a prescribed procedure for continuous operation. The iv collection of data occurs by the same system recording cell voltage, temperatures, pressures, flow rates and current densities. A procedural start-up and characterization are conducted in order improve start-of performance and examine reactant flows, coolant activation time, stack conditioning and the effects by freezing temperatures. The resulting degradation is investigated by polarization curves and various ex-situ measurements. In this work, it was found that freeze start-up of a fuel cell stack can be aided and managed by conditioning the stack at shut-down and applying a procedure to successfully start-up and mitigate the damage that freezing can cause...|$|E

If the pipe has been {{in an environment where}} ambient temperatures are below the freezing point of the working fluid prior to start-up, the frozen fluid in the condenser and adiabatic region scan prevent initial flow to the evaporator, causing dryout of the evaporator before all of the working fluid is in the liquid phase.

40|$|An {{experimental}} platform {{was designed}} and built for testing the thermal performance of a water/steam cavity receiver. The experimental platform was utilized to investigate the start-up performance and operation characteristics of the receiver. The electrical heating mode was chosen to simulate the non-uniform distribution of heat flux {{on the surface of}} absorber tubes inside the cavity. During <b>start-up</b> the <b>temperature</b> rise rate and the mass flow rate are considered as control variables. A couple of start-up curves under different working pressures were finally obtained. The results showed that the receiver performed at relatively low thermal efficiencies. The main reason for the low thermal efficiency was attributed to the low steam mass flow rate, which causes a high proportional heat loss. In order to study the relationship between thermal efficiency and mass flow rate, a computational model for evaluating the thermal performance of a cavity receiver was built and verified. This model couples three aspects of heat transfer: the radiative heat transfer inside the receiver, the flow boiling heat transfer inside the absorber tubes and the convection heat transfer around the receiver. The water/steam cavity receiver of the experimental platform was studied numerically. The curve of thermal efficiency versus mass flow rate was obtained to show that the thermal efficiency increases with increasing mass flow rate within a certain range, and the increase is more remarkable at low mass flow rates.

40|$|Methanol is an {{attractive}} fuel for fuel cell-powered vehicles {{because it has a}} fairly high energy density, can be pumped into the tank of a vehicle mush like gasoline, and is relatively easy to reform. For on-board reforming, the reformer must be compact and lightweight, and have rapid start-up and good dynamic response. Steam reforming reactors with the tube-and-shell geometry that was used on the prototype fuel cell-powered buses are heat transfer limited. To reach their normal operating temperature, these types of reactors need 45 minutes from ambient <b>temperature</b> <b>start-up.</b> The dynamic response is poor due to temperature control problems. To overcome the limitations of steam reforming, ANL explored the partial oxidation concept used in the petroleum industry to process crude oils. In contrast to the endothermic steam reforming reaction, partial oxidations is exothermic. Fuel and air are passed together over a catalyst or reacted thermally, yielding a hydrogen-rich gas. Since the operating temperature of such a reactor can be controlled by the oxygen-to- methanol ratio, the rates of reaction are not heat transfer limited.

40|$|Microgas {{turbines}} (MGT) are {{an alternative}} for small-scale energy production; however, their small size becomes a drawback since it enhances the heat transfer among their components. Moreover, heat transfer drives to temperature gradients which become higher during transient cycles like start-up.

Stationary and rotational blades of the turbine were numerically simulated using CFD and FEM commercial codes.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} effect of potassium on {{the rate of}} CO₂ gasification of a bituminous coal char and a pure carbon substrate is investigated. The gasification rate depends on both the catalyst concentration (K/C atomic ratio) and the internal porous structure of the solid. For low values of the K/C atomic ratio, the initial gasification rate (mg carbon gasified per initial gram carbon per min) increases sharply {{with the addition of}} catalyst; at higher values, the rate profile levels off. The sharp increase in rate is due to the activation of reaction sites while the plateau is attributed to the saturation of the surface with active sites. The variation of the instantaneous gasification rate (based on remaining carbon) with carbon conversion at various initial K/C ratios is studied. The important reasons for the change in rate are the change in the solid surface area, the loss of active sites, the loss of catalyst by vaporization and the change in the K/C ratio due to carbon depletion. The loss of catalyst from the pure carbon substrate by vaporization is also determined. The extent of this loss depends primarily on the reaction <b>start-up</b> procedure. <b>Temperature</b> programmed experiments show that under inert atmospheres, both KOH and K₂CO₃ react with carbon to give a reduced form of the catalyst which appears to be a prerequisite for the rapid vaporization of potassium. The effect of catalyst loss on both the initial gasification rate and the variation in rate with conversion is determined. The reaction mechanism is studied by a temperature and concentration programmed reaction technique. The proposed redox mechanism contains three surface complexes: -CO₂K, -COK and -CK. The oxide groups are the intermediates during C/CO₂ gasification. The completely reduced form, -CK, is the end product of catalyst reduction and is the precursor for K loss. The stoichiometries of these surface groups are confirmed by oxygen and potassium balance...|$|R

Specifically, the relative abundance of architecturally important Methanosaeta-like (acetoclastic) methanogens decreased, which was concomitant with granule disintegration {{and the development of a}} putatively psychrophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community. Genetic fingerprinting suggested the development of a psychroactive methanogenic community between 4 and 10 [*]°C (phase 2), which was dominated by acetogenic bacteria and Methanocorpusculum-like (hydrogenotrophic) methanogens. High levels of Methanosaeta-like acetoclastic methanogens and granular biofilm integrity were maintained during phase 2. Overall, decreasing temperature resulted in distinctly altered microbial community structure during phase 1, and the development of a less dynamic psychroactive methanogenic consortium during phase 2. Moreover, psychrophilic H 2 -oxidizing methanogens emerged as important members of the psychroactive consortia after &# 62; 1200 days of low-temperature cultivation.

This study shows how dynamic simulation {{can be used to}} conduct engineering studies, operational studies and training simulators to optimize the operability of a greenfield phosphoric acid concentration unit. In order to perform this optimization, a first principle model predicting how process and associated control will respond as a function of time was created based on all plant's engineering information.

The traditional ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3 (TBC's) showed considerable metal temperature reductions during testing in the hydrogen-rich environment. A thermal model was developed to predict the thermal response of the tubes with the various coatings. Good agreement was observed between predicted temperatures and measured temperatures at the inner wall of the tube and in the metal near the coating/metal interface. The thermal model was also {{used to examine the}} effect of the differences in the reported values of the thermal conductivity of plasma sprayed ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3 ceramic coatings, the effect of 100 micron (0. 004 in.) thick metallic bond coat, the effect of tangential heat transfer around the tube, and the effect or radiation {{from the surface of the}} ceramic coating. It was shown that for the short duration testing in the rocket engine, the most important of these considerations was the effect of the uncertainty in the thermal conductivity of temperatures (greater than 100 C) predicted in the tube. The thermal model was also used to predict the thermal response of the coated rod in order to quantify the difference in the metal temperatures between the two substrate geometries and to explain the previously-observed increased life of coatings on rods over that on tubes.

A process control program was also developed and employed for easier measurement and control. The gasifier was then evaluated in the gasification of sorghum, cotton gin trash (CGT) and manure and predicting the slagging and fouling tendencies of CGT and manure. The expected <b>start-up</b> time, operating <b>temperature</b> and desired fluidization were achieved without any {{trouble in the}} instrumented gasifier. The air flow rate was maintained at 1. 99 kg/min and the fuel flow rate at 0. 95 kg/min. The process control program considerably facilitated its operation which can now be remotely done. The gasification of sorghum, CGT and manure showed that they contained high amounts of volatile component matter and comparable yields of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. Manure showed higher ash content while sorghum yielded lower amount of hydrogen. Their heating values and gas yields did not vary but were considered low ranging from only 4. 09 to 4. 19 MJ/m 3 and from 1. 8 to 2. 5 m 3 /kg, respectively. The production of hydrogen and gas calorific values were significantly affected by biomass type but not by the operating temperature. The high values of the alkali index and base-to acid ratio indicated fouling and slagging tendencies of manure and CGT during gasification. The compressive strength profile of pelleted CGT and manure ash showed that the melting (or eutectic point) of these feedstock were around 800 degrees C for CGT and 600 degrees C for manure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed relatively uniform bonding behavior {{and structure of the}} manure ash while CGT showed agglomeration in its structure as the temperature increased. The instrumentation of the fluidized bed gasifier and employing a process control program made its operation more convenient and safe.

40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising energy conversion devices for the future in automotive applications. One of the major technical challenges for the commercialization of PEMFC is the effective <b>start-up</b> from subzero <b>temperatures,</b> often referred to as “cold start”. The major problem of PEMFC cold start is that the product water freezes when the temperature inside the PEMFC is lower than the freezing point. If the catalyst layer (CL) is fully occupied by ice before the cell temperature rises above the freezing point, the electrochemical reaction may stop due to the blockage of the reaction sites. However, only a few of the previous PEMFC studies paid attention to cold start. Hence, understanding the ice formation mechanisms and optimizing the design and operational strategies for PEMFC cold start are critically important. In this research, an experimental setup for the cold start testing with simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions is designed and built; a one-dimensional (1 D) analytical model for quick estimate of purging durations before the cold start processes is formulated; and a comprehensive three-dimensional (3 D) PEMFC cold start model is developed. The unique feature of the cold start experiment is the inclusion of the simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions. Since most of the previous numerical models are limited to either 1 D or two-dimensional (2 D) or 3 D but only considering a section of the entire cell due to computational requirement, the measured distribution data are critically important to better understand the PEMFC cold start characteristics. With a full set of conservation equations, the 3 D model comprehensively accounts for the various transport phenomena during the cold start processes. The unique feature of this model is the inclusion of: (i) the water freezing in the membrane electrolyte and its effects on the membrane conductivity; (ii) the non-equilibrium mass transfer between the water in the ionomer and the water (vapour, liquid and ice) in the pore region of the CL; and (iii) both the water freezing and melting in the CL and gas diffusion layer (GDL). This model therefore provides the fundamental framework for the future top-down multi-dimensional multiphase modelling of PEMFC. The experimental and numerical results elaborate the ice formation mechanisms and other important transport phenomena during the PEMFC cold start processes. The effects of the various cell designs, operating conditions and external heating methods on the cold start performance are studied. Independent tests are carried out to identify and optimize the important design and operational parameters...|$|R

A fuel cell operates quietly and efficiently and, when hydrogen is used as a fuel, it generates only power and water. Thus, a fuel cell is a so called ‘zero-emission engine’. In the past, several fuel cell concepts have been tested in the laboratory but the systems that are being potentially considered for commercial developments are: (i) Alkaline Fuel Cells (AFCs), (ii) Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFCs), (iii) Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs), (iv) Solid Polymer Electrolyte Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (SPE-DMFCs), (v) Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFCs) and (vi) Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs). Among the aforesaid systems, PEFCs that employ hydrogen as fuel are considered attractive power systems for quick <b>start-up</b> and ambient <b>temperature</b> operations. Ironically, however, hydrogen as fuel is not available freely in the nature. Accordingly, it has to be generated from a readily available hydrogen carrying fuel such as natural gas, which needs to be reformed. But, such a process leads to generation of hydrogen contaminated with carbon monoxide, which even at minuscule level is detrimental to the fuel cell performance. Pure hydrogen can be generated through water electrolysis but hydrogen thus generated needs to be stored as compressed/liquefied gas, which is cost-intensive. Therefore, certain hydrogen carrying organic fuels such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, ethylene glycol and diethyl ether have been considered for fueling PEFCs directly. Among these, methanol with hydrogen content of about 12. 8 wt. % (specific energy = 6. 1 kWh kg- 1) is the most attractive organic liquid. PEFCs using methanol directly as fuel are referred to as SPE-DMFCs. But SPE-DMFCs suffer from methanol crossover across the polymer electrolyte membrane, which affects the cathode performance and hence the fuel cell during its operation. SPE-DMFCs also have inherent limitations of low open-circuit-potential and low electrochemical-activity. An obvious solution to the aforesaid problems is to explore other promising hydrogen carrying fuels such as sodium borohydride (specific energy = 12 kWh kg- 1), which has a capacity value of 5. 67 Ah g- 1 and a hydrogen content of about 11 wt. %. Such fuel cells are called direct borohydride fuel cells (DBFCs). This thesis is directed to studies on SPE-DMFCs and DBFC...|$|R
40|$|Althougln {{start-up}} and shutdown only {{account for}} {{a small percentage of}} the total operating time of an industrial chemical plant, still up to 4 6 % of the accidents occur during the start-up or shutdown. Furthermore, a large part of the costs of a start-up account for the extra personnel that is needed on site. Therefore, it is logical to optimise both start-up time and safety. For this optimisation, dynamic models that simulate start-up behaviour are needed. The basis for this graduation assignment is a dynamic model of a glycolether process that has been developed in the equation-oriented simulation environment gPROMS. This process has a typical process layout, which consists of a reaction and recovery section with recycle. The recycle is used for heat integration with the feed. During start-up the system must be heated, because the reaction can only start at a high temperature. In this work the reboiler provides the heat and through the recycle the reactor is heated, making the use of a start-up heater unnecessary. Starting up the system in an integrated way and the presence of discontinuities provide a numerically challenging problem. Discontinuities are present, because the distillation column model incorporates equations for liquid weeping and vapour flowing through a downcomer; flows that are typically present during the first phase of a start-up. General guidelines for start-up were used to generate a basic start-up procedure, which is used for comparison with the optimised procedure. The optimisation objectives are a minimisation of start-up time and a maximisation of safety during start-up of the integrated process. Safety includes a maximum breakthrough of reactants to the separation section, a maximum temperature in the reactor and a maximum temperature change everywhere in the process. A Pareto curve is used to visualise the trade-off between these objectives. Optimisation strategies for the reactor comprise choosing the optimal feed temperature (and thereby the optimal recycle temperature), choosing the optimal moment and quantity of reactant and catalyst addition and choosing the moment that the cooling water is started. Strategies for the distillation column involve establishing an optimal reboiler duty strategy and choosing the initial amount and composition of material in the reboiler and condenser. It has been found that ramping PO feed as well as the cooling water flow have a large influence on the safety objective. It has also been found that the total feed flow should be low for safety and for start-up time, because a large excess of MeOH absorbs so much heat from the process that the reaction can not <b>start-up</b> gradually. The <b>temperature</b> of the feed should be high to minimise start-up time, but low for a maximisation of safety. The Pareto curve obtained from the optimisations in gPROMS shows a trade-off between the objectives time and safety. It also shows that not much extra safety is gained if the start-up time is extended very long. However, which operating point on the curve is preferred depends on specific preferences.

40|$|The {{research}} project concerned {{the study of}} the feasibility of the double stage SHARON (Single reactor for High activity Ammonium Removal Over Nitrite) -ANAMMOX (Anaerobic AMMonium Oxidation) process for the biological treatment of nitrogen-rich refinery wastewater (sour water) produced at Saras SpA facilities located near Sarroch, on the southwestern coast of Sardinia (Italy). The Sarroch refinery's operating capacity is approximately 15 million tons per year (or 300, 000 barrels per day), accounting for approximately 15 % of Italy's total refining capacity. The wastewater of concern was characterized by a high content of ammonium (up to 4, 000 mgN/L), {{as well as by the}} simultaneous presence of toxic compounds like cyanides, phenols and sulfides. The wastewater is currently treated at full scale by steam stripping up to a final NH 4 -N concentration of 25 mg/L: if NH 4 -N level in the effluent from the stripping unit can be set at 2, 000 mg/L and treated by the SHARON-ANAMMOX process, it will imply a considerable reduction in energy requirements and operating costs. The SHARON process was applied successfully and proved to be reliable enough to tolerate the inhibitory substances contained in the wastewater. Depending on influent inorganic carbon to nitrogen molar ratio (Ci/N), it was able to provide an effluent suitable for the subsequent treatment by ANAMMOX or heterotrophic denitrification via nitrite. The ANAMMOX process was shown to be more sensitive to the inhibitory compounds contained in the real wastewater. In particular, the research activity has shown that the extreme variability of industrial refinery wastewaters, combined with and the high sensitivity of ANAMMOX biomass may actually hinder the full-scale application of the SHARON-ANAMMOX process for the treatment of such wastewater: nevertheless, the alternative represented by the SHARON-heterotrophic denitrification via nitrite combined system is worthy of being investigated. During the research abroad at the Technical University of Delft (The Netherlands), the influence of temperature on the ANAMMOX process was investigated: batch tests were carried out in order to determine the maximum specific activities and energies of activation of ANAMMOX bacteria at different temperatures. Moreover, a reactor was started up for {{the study of the}} single stage CANON (Completely Autotrophic Nitrogen removal Over Nitrite) process at 15 °C, in order to evaluate its feasibilty for the treatment of municipal wastewater, even in Countries with a cold climate, or during the winter time. The results have shown the considerable dependence of the ANAMMOX process on temperature: in particular, the specific activities measured at low temperature (10 ÷ 15 °C) were much lower than those observed at high temperatures (30 °C). The difficult CANON reactor start-up at 15 °C, due to lower growth rates and specific activities of the microorganisms involved in the process, demonstrated the need for a <b>start-up</b> at elevated <b>temperatures</b> (30 °C), before the gradual decrease of the operating temperature to the target value, in order to acclimate the bacteria involved at lower temperatures...|$|R
