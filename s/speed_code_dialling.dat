50|$|Speed calling service allows {{telephone}} {{subscribers to}} assign {{one or two}} digit <b>speed</b> calling <b>codes,</b> by <b>dialing</b> a change speed calling list access code, a feature code, and a new telephone number. Thereafter, the subscribers need only use the assigned <b>speed</b> <b>code</b> to reach the desired party rather than dial the long phone number. This service became commonplace in the 1970s with the spread of Stored Program Control exchanges capable of implementing the required databases. It remains useful in installations of many extensions where programming each telephone set would be arduous. Speed calling subscriptions have largely {{been replaced by the}} introduction of telephone handsets which incorporate a local version of speed dial.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} {{appear to have}} been {{originally}} three-digit <b>codes,</b> <b>dialled</b> without the leading area code, and the format of destination numbers dialled to the international senders has changed at various points as ability to call additional nations was added.|$|R
50|$|In {{industry}} jargon, these area {{codes and}} prefixes {{are referred to}} as NDC <b>codes</b> (National <b>Dialing</b> <b>Codes).</b> This is the term used by ComReg and technical documents, as they include non-geographic codes. Historically, like the UK, the term STD <b>code</b> (Subscriber Trunk <b>Dialling)</b> was used.However, the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion.|$|R

50|$|After {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia, with <b>dialing</b> <b>code</b> 38, Kosovo used the Serbian <b>dialing</b> <b>code,</b> 381 for new and {{existing}} landlines. As mobile networks were introduced, PTK adopted the code 377 (Monaco) and IPKO adopted the code 386 (Slovenia). This situation resulted in the highly unusual simultaneous use of three international <b>dialing</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A mobile <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> (MDC) is a phone number, {{typically}} {{preceded by}} a * or #, that allows the request and receipt of information directly to a mobile phone. MDC's are also known in carrier terminology as [...] "abbreviated dialing codes" [...] (ADC's). Mobile <b>dial</b> <b>codes</b> are <b>dialed</b> just like a regular telephone number. The caller can be presented with any one {{of a variety of}} responses that an advertiser defines - a voice or IVR call, a text message, a video or audio clip, a mobile coupon, game or an application. #250 and **MOVE are two such MDC's.|$|R
50|$|A mobile <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> is not {{the same}} as an {{abbreviated}} <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> which only supports voice calls, basically abbreviating a standard phone number and connecting the caller to a person or machine (interactive voice response system or voicemail system) that answers the call.|$|R

50|$|A dialer (American English) or dialler (British English) is an {{electronic}} device that {{is connected to}} a telephone line to monitor the dialed numbers and alter them to seamlessly provide services that otherwise require lengthy National or International access <b>codes</b> to be <b>dialed.</b> A dialer automatically inserts and modifies the numbers depending {{on the time of}} day, country or area <b>code</b> <b>dialed,</b> allowing the user to subscribe to the service providers who offer the best rates. For example, a dialer could be programmed to use one service provider for international calls and another for cellular calls. This process is known as prefix insertion or least cost routing. A line powered dialer does not need any external power but instead takes the power it needs from the telephone line.|$|R

50|$|In 1962, direct-dialed long-distance {{directory}} assistance became available. The number in cities with panel and crossbar switching equipment was area code-555-1212, whereas in cities with step-by-step equipment {{the number was}} 1-555-1212 (or 112-555-1212) for numbers not local {{but in the same}} area code and 1-area code-555-1212 (or 112-area code-555-1212) for numbers in other area codes. In some area codes, the {{directory assistance}} center was able to serve the entire area code, but in many, the operator in the principal city of the area <b>code</b> <b>dialed</b> would connect the caller onward to a more local directory assistance center for the most up-to-date information.|$|R

50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{telephone}} network was that, in most cases, direct distance dialing for long-distance calls was not possible. Although area codes were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of <b>dialing</b> <b>codes</b> with shorter codes for local calls and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area <b>codes</b> and <b>dialing</b> became standardised.|$|R
