40|$|This paper {{describes}} the difficulties marketing research that instructors encounter when using <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> One {{of the difficulties}} in teaching arises from {{the nature of the}} <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> available. Specifically, standard output in these packages generates many values by default. Students must learn “where to find ” the values important for their particular analysis. Also, there are many options which may be selected to run a single procedure, and these are confusing to students. A third problem lies in using the output tables in word processing software. This paper presents a new type of data analysis software, XL Data Analyst, which overcomes these problems. The XL Data Analyst’s features and output are compared with SPSS...|$|R

50|$|SigmaStat is a <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> {{which was}} {{originally}} developed by Jandel Scientific Software in the 1980s. As of October 1996, Systat Software is now based in San Jose, California. SigmaStat users {{have the ability}} to compare effects among groups. This includes before and after or repeated measure studies. The users can also conduct survival analysis, analyze rates and proportions, perform regression and correlation analysis and calculate power and sample size. The program uses a wizard based interface which asks the user questions about the project and its data. After a test is run, the user receives a detailed report that interprets the results.|$|E
5000|$|Wilkinson wrote SYSTAT, a <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> in {{the early}} 1980s. This program was noted for its {{comprehensive}} graphics, including the first software implementation of the heatmap display now widely used among biologists. After his company grew to 50 employees, he sold it to SPSS in 1995. At SPSS, he assembled a team of graphics programmers who developed the nViZn platform [...] that produces the visualizations in SPSS, Clementine, and other analytics products. The nViZn platform was modeled after Wilkinson's 1999 book on statistical graphics, The Grammar of Graphics. This book also served {{as the foundation for}} the R package ggplot2, the Python Bokeh package, the R package ggbio, and helped shape the Polaris project at Stanford. [...] Wilkinson now serves as Chief Scientist at H2O.ai.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> like PSPP, SPSS and SYSTAT {{label the}} {{standardized}} regression coefficients as [...] "Beta" [...] while the unstandardized coefficients are labeled [...] "B".

30|$|The second aspect {{requiring}} {{careful consideration}} is {{the estimation of}} sampling variance. Formulas for computing sampling errors applied in many standard <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> such as the base module of SPSS assume simple random sampling. Applying these formulas to TEDS-M data, which originate from cluster samples, can lead, in many instances, to underestimation of the sampling error (and consequently underestimated p-values). For the correct estimation of sampling errors, TEDS-M employed Fay’s variant of balanced repeated replication (BRR) (Fay, 1989; Judkins, 1990; McCarthy, 1966). <b>Statistical</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> that feature BRR (e.g., the IDB Analyzerm or WesVarn) have {{to be used to}} obtain correct estimates for sampling variances. We applied BRR in order to obtain the sampling errors and the presented significance levels in the TEDS-M examples above.|$|R
40|$|Robust {{statistical}} methods {{are designed to}} work well when classical assumptions, typically normality and/or the lack of outliers, are violated. Almost everyone agrees {{on the value of}} robust statistical procedures. Nonetheless, after more than 40 years and thousands of papers, few robust methods were available in standard <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> until very recently. This paper argues that one of the primary reasons for the lack of robust {{statistical methods}} in standard <b>statistical</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> is the fact that few developers of statistical methods are willing to write user-friendly and readable software for the methods they develop, regardless of the usefulness of the method. Recent changes in academic statistics make it highly desirable for all developers of statistical methods to provide usable code for their statistical methods. ...|$|R
