This paper summarises the salient features of privatisations by public <b>share</b> <b>float</b> in Australia during the period 1989 to 1997. The costs associated with these privatisations are examined, including both direct costs and the opportunity cost of Australian governments selling assets cheaply. Furthermore, the impact that such sales have on the net worth {{of the public sector}} is estimated. The results suggest that there is a cost of underpricing. There is also some evidence that the effect on the public sector net worth may be negative. However, in some cases where the enterprise sold is inefficient the government may realise a gain. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the AMD-K 7 IEEE 754 and x 87 compliant floating point division and square root algorithms and implementation. The AMD-K 7 processor employs an iterative {{implementation of a}} series expansion to converge quadratically to the quotient and square root. Highly accurate initial approximations and a high performance <b>shared</b> <b>floating</b> point multiplier assist in achieving low division and square root latencies at high operating frequencies. A novel time-sharing technique allows independent floating point multiplication operations to proceed while division or square root computation is in progress. Exact IEEE 754 rounding for all rounding modes and target precisions has been verified by conventional directed and random testing procedures, along with the formulation of a mechanically-checked formal proof using the ACL 2 theorem prover. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of the {{dilutive}} offering, the company's board of directors agrees to increase the <b>share</b> <b>float</b> for the purpose of selling more equity in the company. This new inflow of cash might be used to pay off some debt or used for needed company expansion. When new shares are created and then sold by the company, the number of shares outstanding increases and this causes dilution of earnings on a per share basis. Usually the gain of cash inflow from the sale is strategic and is considered positive for the longer term goals of the company and its shareholders. Some owners of the stock however may not view the event as favorably over a more short term valuation horizon.|$|R
