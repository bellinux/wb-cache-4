Lieutenant O'Hare became the conservator to all the Ensign Bafflestir originals and had each cartoon <b>strip</b> <b>framed.</b> Before O'Hare was transferred to Washington DC, he successfully shipped the framed cartoons to other district offices {{as a way of}} preserving the history of an unorthodox approach to Coast Guard morale in the early 1970s.|$|R

40|$|An {{unconstrained}} Farsi handwritten word recognition {{system based}} on fuzzy vector quantization (FVQ) and hidden Markov model (HMM) for reading city names in postal addresses is presented. Preprocessing techniques including binarization, noise removal, slope correction and baseline estimation are described. Each word image is represented by its contour information. The histogram of chain code slopes of the image <b>strips</b> (<b>frames),</b> scanned {{from right to left}} by a sliding window, is used as feature vectors. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering is used for generating a fuzzy codebook. A separate HMM is trained by modified Baum–Welch algorithm for each city name. A test image is recognized by finding the best match (likelihood) between the image and all of the HMM word models using forward algorithm. Experimental results show the advantages of using FVQ/HMM recognizer engine instead of conventional discrete HMMs. Ó 200...|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, Price {{described}} his design as [...] "a campanile with four pilaster faces, the seven flutes being represented by seven rows of windows". The building {{is set on}} an irregular, trapezoidal lot, and designed as a Neo-Renaissance tower clad in Maine granite with a 3-story base, a 12-story shaft, and a 6-story cap. (Its 4th and 15 stories are transitional.) The base is an Ionic entrance colonnade topped with sculptures in a classical style by J. Massey Rhind. Above rises a middle section of horizontally banded piers with vertical <b>strips</b> <b>framing</b> the windows, which culminates {{in a row of}} figural sculptures extending from the 14th to 15th stories. A further six-story cap (subsequently modified) featured a colonnade of Corinthian pilasters, stone cornice, and a crowning parapet of gilded metal acroteria on the setback 20th and 21st stories.|$|R

The <b>stripped</b> <b>frame</b> of {{an early}} automobile is pictured in the foreground just right of center, beneath the boughs of a looming tree. In the background at center, a small, ranch-style house is partially visible, covered in clapboard siding. Separating the two areas is a length of chickenwire fence whose wooden picket gate {{can also be seen}} directly at center.; Northwest of McKittrick in the Temblor Mountains the adobe was one of the aguajes or water holes along Camino Viego. Tradition says that while a party of early Spanish explorers camped here an earthquake rent the earth and a copious spring of water ran from the earth. The country is almost devoid of foliation, but at this place immense cottonwoods, some measuring ten feet through the trunk, and fig trees, some measuring more than five feet through the trunk, surround the deserted ranch buildings. The road to the ranch runs through the lease of the Outpost Oil Company in the Temblor Oil Field...|$|R
500|$|The {{large scale}} {{reproduction}} of a comic <b>strip</b> <b>frame</b> was considered radical and revolutionary at the time. Critics applauded the work's playfulness, inherent humor and irreverence. According to Diane Waldman of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, [...] "Look Mickey is broad comedy and {{falls into the}} category of slapstick..." [...] In Lichtenstein's obituary, Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight described the work as [...] "a slyly hilarious riff on Abstract Expressionism". Lichtenstein's slight alterations to its [...] "linear clarity and colour", the critic writes, add to its aesthetic value and grandeur, reinforced by his choice of scale. A common misconception about Lichtenstein {{comes from the fact that}} in his best known works, his meticulous approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture icons. Graham Bader wrote that [...] "Lichtenstein's painting in fact appears more the product of industrial manufacture than the very pulp image on which it is based." [...] Look Mickey is considered self-referential in the sense that the artist is painting something through which the viewer may see elements of the artist.|$|R

40|$|The role {{of art in}} {{relation}} to maps is being reappraised {{on the basis of}} a perceived ability to depict aspects of a place that maps alone cannot. Many as opposed to one perspective on a place communicates more fully the essence of that place (with art as a valuable source of qualitative geospatial data) and so maps and art should be presented in the same visualization package. This paper outlines the development and implementation of an interface where a scanned painting forms the mode of access to multitemporal maps. The interface is used to represent the history and habitat extent of the kea (alpine parrot) in New Zealand from pre human colonization times through to their present, limited range to a speculation on their future habitat. The painting and the map (in what has been termed in the literature as an anti-map / map combination) are in their own separate layers and joined by an interactive link. The interface harnesses the ability of visual art to aggregate multiple themes, locations and times into a single cohesive image. The ability to contain many temporal instances is close to the comic <b>strip</b> <b>frame</b> (and instances of Renaissance art) in particular, with, in this case, an implicit time frame from left to right on the painting. The use of an artistic image minimizes use of text to depict events, due to the visual and narrative power of the painting. 1...|$|R

40|$|A novel mosaic {{technique}} {{based on}} Strip Search Algorithm is proposed that improves non-linearity, accuracy and vertical distortions possibly found in mosaic image. Strip Search Algorithm based on novel measure of Relative- Sum of the Squared Difference (R-SSD) is proposed to search particular <b>strip</b> of <b>frame</b> within its specified portion {{and it is}} used for normalization and simplification of some important steps of image mosaic. Steps like key frames selection, frames registration, their transformation and combination are suggested for mosaic creation. An optimal criterion is suggested for key frames selections. Hierarchical Seam Line Estimation and Vertical Strip Registration are introduced for precise image warping and distortion-less vertical transformation. Structural linearity, precision and non-deformation property reflects from mosaic results of proposed algorithm...|$|R

One early and impressive demonstration was the sorting movie of Backer and Sherman [BS 82]. A subsequent landmark, which delineated the design of animation systems, was the Zeus system [Bro 91] of Brown (also see his thesis [Bro 83, Bro 87]). Over the years, it has inspired a still growing number of animation systems (Tango [Sta 90], XTango, Polka, Leonardo [CDF + 97]). The advent of Java and the World Wide Web has caused a f [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1969, the phrase "frame problem" has been attributed various interpretations. Most {{researchers in the}} field of Artificial Intelligence, define the frame problem as the problem of finding an effective representation for reasoning about change. Logicians use the phrase to refer to a much less general, technical problem within logic, whereas philosophers tend to interpret the phrase as the more general problem of determining (ir) relevance. All in all, this discrepancy has led to considerable confusion about the meaning of the phrase. We contend that most of this confusion can be avoided, if the original (robotics) context of the frame problem is adhered to. We present an engineering view on the frame problem that allows us to <b>strip</b> the <b>frame</b> problem from associated problem notions like qualification and ramification. The problem that remains is intimately related to the knowledge acquisition bottleneck in knowledge engineering. 1 The Frame Problem Literature spe [...] ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1991, the trust {{attempted}} to buy the frames of the redundant second tender of Flying Scotsman, {{in order to use}} its frames for Tornado. In 1992, No. 5332 was acquired, one of the LNER's original ten 1928 corridor tenders. The tank was removed and the <b>frames</b> <b>stripped</b> in Morpeth. In 1998, due to the cost of overhaul, conversion for roller bearings, and the trust's desire to build Tornado out of completely new parts, it was decided to sell the Flying Scotsman tender frame back to its previous owners.
