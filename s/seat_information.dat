40|$|Wira driver's seat is a {{complicated}} product that consist hundred of part and the material representative are from steel to rubber. Some of the part is easy to assemble {{and some of it}} is difficult to assemble. Parts that are difficult to assemble could cause a rise of cost in terms of labor and time. The objectives of this project are to improve the design of Proton Wira driver's seat by using integrated Value Engineering (YE) and Design for Assembly (DFA) and to make the comparative analysis between current design and proposed design in terms of assembly effectiveness. The flow of this project is started from collecting Wira <b>seat</b> <b>information</b> and using YE approach to identify the function identification and implement function analysis. Then, the alternative design will be generated and the best alternative design will be evaluated using Pugh method. After that, the proposed design will be compared with current design of Wira seat using DFA approached. The result shows that the DFA Index for the proposed design of Wira driver's seat is higher than current design that is 4. 7 compare to 4. 4. Hence, it can be concluded that the integrated of VE and DFA method can improve the design of Wira driver's seat in terms of assembly effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Intermodal {{transport}} {{is one of}} {{the vital}} mechanisms for the 21 st century's need for mobility, from environmental, energy saving, and aging society viewpoints. Fundamentally, intermodality has to have nodes, where different modes of transport meet and therefore physical and psychological barriers exist. Although we have to improve and modify hardware of the changing points, normally it needs large amounts of money and time. In addition to this problem, we would have a potential and more serious concern on the effects to the environment. Physical modifications sometimes cannot be restored to original status. A software-oriented approach to simulate the physical change could be a wiser way to find customers opinions before the real construction. Travellers are interested in seamless and barrier-free transportation from door to door; {{no matter what kind of}} transport means are concerned in between. In this paper, we introduce a concept model of CyberRail, the fabric of ITS enhanced by railway transport, emphasizing characteristics of the information providing functions of CyberRail systems. To remove information barrier, as well as or before removals of physical ones, {{is one of the}} key factors of promoting intermodal transport. Although ITS also will provide this kind of information as back seat one as well as front <b>seat</b> <b>information</b> to control cars, CyberRail considers that informing passengers is the key for every aspect of transport evolutions. The principle of CyberRail is, using the latest information and communication technology, to make a mirror cyberspace recording necessary and sufficient information about travelling passengers, which are used to advice and guide travellers along travel chains. In other words, passengers and vehicles are considered as objects having profile and status including locations. CyberRail put that information on the cyberspace. The standardisation about this mechanism is also a main purpose of proposing this concept. 1...|$|E
40|$|In an {{industry}} such demanding as the automotive one, where all big companies compete {{on a daily}} basis to get a greater market share than their competitors, there is a principle underlying to achieving the maximum profitability possible: looking for the best quality at the lowest possible cost. The aim of this project, performed at Johnson Controls Eurosit Barcelona Headquarters, is reinforcing the quality system for the detection and correction of defects in the finished product in order to fulfil some of the requirements stated on the corporate policies: the pursuit of excellence and the non-stop increasing of the quality standards. This Project seeks to achieve a more reliable, robust and accurate quality system. It also intends to improve the computerized traceability system to provide data management in real time, adapted to the needs of each situation analysis. All of the improvements and modifications are intended to achieve, as an ultimate goal, the reduction of the defects per seat to zero. Nowadays, the quality procedure involves a large number of manual operations: First, a few red moles are placed on the parts of the seat which are defective. After that, the operator records the defects data on a paper sheet. At last, the quality auditor introduces this information on the system. This means the human element is a major factor when evaluating. In order to minimise the "human-error" factor considerably, this system proposes the implementation of touchscreens in the workstations where the review is performed. The values will be recorded using a predefined list of defects, according to the model of seat being inspected. The <b>seat</b> <b>information</b> can be obtained from several ways: It can be obtained directly by reading the barcode label on the seat or by connecting to the Siemens PLC that manages the Assembly line operations. Once the defects are recorded and stored in the database, they will be displayed both in the subsequent repairing workstations and in the final verifications workstation. Additionally, the graphics of the production defects will also be shown all along the assembly line (they include the time and work shift where the defects have been produced). The reports of the defects and other statistics can be removed via Intranet...|$|E
