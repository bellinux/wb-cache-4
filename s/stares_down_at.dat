60|$|The other {{continued}} still unruffled, {{and staring}} {{over the edge}} idly as an angler <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a stream.|$|E
6000|$|... [Then, motionless, he <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his brother's open, [...] sightless eyes. Suddenly he wets {{his finger}} and holds it to the [...] girl's lips, then to LARRY'S.] ...|$|E
6000|$|CARMODY (pleased). Ah, don't be talkin'! She'll {{know more}} than the lot of us before she's grown even. (He pauses in his walk and <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Eileen, frowning.) Are you sick, Eileen, that you're keepin' your eyes shut without a word out of you? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} in tweeds turned to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him, surprised.|$|R
60|$|Renouard, {{his hand}} {{grasping}} {{the back of}} a chair, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him dumbly.|$|R
60|$|He {{held the}} {{envelope}} in his hand, and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the postmark between his horny thumbnails.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to God she {{had never}} set them on the captain, {{whatever}} colour they are," [...] retorted Franklin. [...] "She and that old chap with the scraped jaws who sits over her and <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her dead-white face with his yellow eyes--confound them! Perhaps you will tell us that his eyes are not yellow?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Bill Brasky <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the gang}} in the skit, Holiday Inn ...|$|E
5000|$|Wachter often {{stands in}} a [...] "pigeon-toed" [...] stance (both feet turned in toward each other) when he plays his bass, and <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his feet. He says doing this allows him {{to focus on what}} he's playing and keeps him from being distracted by fans.|$|E
60|$|The boy nodded. He {{got to his}} feet, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the shoes, {{and walked}} slowly toward the door, where he turned.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the picture}} interestedly, forgetting him, {{pinching}} her chin thoughtfully, while she murmured: [...] "They're rather nice. Rather good. Rather good." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again Holmes {{flattened}} out {{the paper}} upon his unused plate. I rose and, leaning over him, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the curious inscription, which ran as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Bruenor is {{fighting}} a terrible battle with Grguch which {{ends with a}} disemboweled and headless Grguch. A battered Bruenor and dying Regis are brought before Obould. As Obould <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Bruenor, the Shaman messenger meant for the parlay heals Regis at Obould's command. Obould lowers his weapon and seemingly agrees to a parlay with Mithral Hall and the North. Hralien allows Tos'un {{to live in the}} Moonwood and the group returns home.|$|E
50|$|But {{the plot}} thickens. The police {{find out that}} Serge is living by himself and attempt {{to put him in}} an orphanage. Just before they enter the building, however, Mme Lambin's friends and Isabelle's mother show up with papers informing the police of Serge's situation, namely that Serge will be under the {{guardianship}} of Dédé and Jeannot (his grandmother's friends) - his father is in Africa, his grandmother in the hospital. Isabelle's mother admits that she called the police in the first place, as she was bitter about Isabelle and Djamal. She appears to fully regret her actions. As Serge leaves, a mysterious boy <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him from a high window, his hands pressed against the glass.|$|E
50|$|Enraged, Gerardo {{attempts}} to throw Miranda from the cliff, only {{to realize he}} cannot bring himself to take a life. Paulina apparently accepts the confession, and they both leave Miranda on the cliff as he <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the water. The camera simulates someone falling off the cliff as seen from his own point of view. In the final scene, Paulina and Gerardo are at the same concert where the film began with Miranda also present, looking down {{with his wife and}} sons. Paulina and Miranda cast uncomfortable glances at each other, and look away. Miranda glances down at the couple again as the camera shows Gerardo glancing up towards the balcony at the now off-screen Miranda.|$|E
60|$|Kells <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the gold. His jaw worked convulsively. He had {{the eyes}} of a trapped wolf. Yet he seemed not wholly to {{comprehend}} what had happened to him.|$|R
60|$|She did not move, {{save the}} convulsive motion of {{her breath and}} the nervous action of her fingers. She <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{a spot in the}} carpet; she couldn't face him.|$|R
6000|$|Peter was puzzled. He {{showed it}} as he <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Mrs. Teeter {{just in front of}} him. [...] "I don't see any nest or eggs or anything," [...] said he rather testily.|$|R
50|$|The group emerges into bright {{sunshine}} {{and sit in}} stunned silence on the grass until a bus arrives. They are shown being driven home on the bus; clean, dressed, and paid {{for participation in the}} experiment. Travis and Barris share a silent glance as Barris <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his $14,000 check. Nix asks Travis if he still believes humans are higher in the chain of evolution than monkeys. Travis responds that he does because people have the ability to change. Audio news snippets suggest that Archaleta is being tried for manslaughter. Travis meets his girlfriend in India. She notices that his knuckles are bruised, in contrast {{to the beginning of the}} film, when she noted his pristine knuckles, an indication that he was, at the time, incapable of violence.|$|E
50|$|Gonzalo's family {{witnesses}} the CIA-backed {{military coup}} of 1973, where Salvador Allende commits suicide and Augusto Pinochet takes over. After Father McEnroe {{is removed from}} the now militarized school, he visits the worship performed by a new priest, consumes the sacramental bread to save it from desecration and declares the ground to be desecrated. Machuca leads the other students in honoring the priest and is expelled. Gonzalo tries to visit the shantytown where Pedro and Silvana live but arrives to find it being destroyed by the soldiers. He then witnesses a soldier murdering Silvana. Himself being dragged into the conflict, Gonzalo convinces a soldier that he is not from the shantytown due to his nice clothing and fair complexion, and is forced to abandon his friend. He returns to his family's new home, which is now even more opulent thanks to his mother's lover and the new redistribution of wealth under the new government. He remains distraught over the events he has witnessed as he remembers his friends as he <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the ruins of their homes. The 17 years of Chilean dictatorship, in which 250,000 Chileans were detained, have begun.|$|E
40|$|As Hafez al Assad <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the rapidly}} deteriorating {{situation}} in Syria from that {{special place in}} heaven for Syrian dictators, surely the thought that a Libyan styled intervention happening in Syria would have crossed his mind. As much as it would make him turn in his grave, {{there is very little}} moral credit these days to staunchly deny that an imminent {{or at the very least}} a likely intervention is just around the corner...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} we'll ever see him again." [...] Gross <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the {{indicator}} dot, still hanging {{at the edge}} of the board. [...] "I wonder if he'll ever move back this way." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thurston's tone carried {{conviction}} with it, but Savine cut him short. [...] "It is {{the practical}} aspect {{that appeals to}} me," [...] he said. He <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the river for several minutes before he asked: ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{long time}} Conger said nothing. He <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the bones, dimly visible in the recess of the wall. How could a man dead centuries be killed? How could he be stalked, brought down? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remarked to}} Mr. Pike {{that the men}} seemed thinner and weaker than when they came on board, and he delayed {{replying}} for a moment while he <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them with that cattle-buyer's eye of his.|$|R
6000|$|Bill {{leaned out}} of the winder and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Joe Barlcomb, and then he ses, in a choking voice, [...] "Is that wot you’ve come {{disturbing}} my sleep for at this time o’ night?" [...] he ses.|$|R
6000|$|They all <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the sample}} case. It {{seemed to be}} an {{ordinary}} leather case, with a metal handle and a snap lock. [...] "I'm getting curious," [...] Thacher said. [...] "What's in there? You're all so tense. Diamonds? Stolen jewels?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Corporal Westerburg hesitated. He <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the floor, {{then out}} the window at the spaceport, then at a fly on the desk. At last he stood up, getting slowly to his feet. [...] "I can't even tell you that, sir," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Sir Robert {{tugged at}} his red beard and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the floor. Presently {{he lifted his head}} and I saw that his face was troubled, the face of a man, indeed, who is {{struggling}} with himself, or, as I thought, with his pride.|$|R
60|$|Raut {{gripped the}} {{hand-rail}} tightly, and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the cone. The heat was intense. The boiling {{of the iron}} and the tumult of the blast made a thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks's voice. But the thing had to be gone through now. Perhaps, after all...|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled at}} his choking collar, {{looked at his}} watch, opened the window to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the street, looked at his watch, tried to read the evening paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, looked again at his watch. Three minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it.|$|R
6000|$|Once on {{the veranda}} Mr. Van Wyk put {{his hands in his}} pockets, and, {{straddling}} his legs, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a black panther skin lying on the floor before a rocking-chair. [...] "It looks as if the fellow had not the pluck to play his own precious game openly," [...] he thought.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Tytherleigh rested {{an elbow}} on the table, and {{thrusting}} {{his fingers through}} his hair, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the note-book in which he had been writing down her answers. [...] "How strange--how very strange!" [...] he remarked. Presently he added, [...] "We must find out where you were baptised, Miss Affleck; you do not know, I suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|Brangwen {{left her}} there, {{in charge of}} the barman, whilst he went to see about the selling of some young stirks. Farmers, butchers, drovers, dirty, uncouth men from whom she shrank instinctively <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her as she sat on her seat, then went to get their drink, talking in {{unabated}} tones. All was big and violent about her.|$|R
50|$|Things get instense between Ramsey Nijem and Juilian Lane {{during their}} <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the weight-in. So {{much so that}} the {{assistant}} coaches from each team, Justin Buchholz and Duane Ludwig get into an argument over their respective gyms and how Duane believes he's the one who turned T.J. into a champion. They, along with Cody and T.J. have to be separated.|$|R
60|$|The {{powerful}} {{grasp on}} the panther's throat {{was on the}} point of relaxing; the brute was digging its claws in the shoulders of the fallen man, and he, feeling faint with loss of blood, looked upon death as it <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him from the beast's golden eyes, and all that he was conscious of was the feeling that death was good.|$|R
