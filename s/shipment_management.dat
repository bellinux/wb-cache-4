40|$|Materials {{handling}} is a {{term that}} includes a corporate transport and warehouse processes. Materials handling has impact on the flow of materials and constitute {{a significant part of}} costs. The aim of the thesis is to identify internal transport and warehouse management. The study will clarify the extent of collaboration between production and warehouse affect materials handling. The aim is to suggest approaches to streamline material <b>shipments</b> and inventory <b>management</b> system enhancing interaction between warehouse and production. The study was initiated with a comprehensive survey of the internal inventory management process. This was made by observations and interviews with operators. Continued work in the study included detailed mapping of materials transport, which mainly was done through observations and interviews. The survey showed that the inventory management process was inefficient in terms of time and resources. A major part of Lundqvist’s internal transports were shown to constitute searching for materials. This resulted in the production suffering from impaired supply of materials. Inventory management process was showed to be interference sensitive and very critical for the production. The study resulted in an inventory management system and a layout solution. The inventory management system was designed for using stock cards and pick lists. The inventory cards' feature at the warehouse management process means that documentation is done at each entry and removal from storage. This will result in increased interaction for all organisational units and reduced interference problems. Solutions for pick lists are targeted to streamline the supply of materials to production, which provides a planned supply of materials that enable just-in-time use.

40|$|As supply chains {{become more}} global and complex, it {{increases}} the importance of end-to-end visibility into the material, information, and financial flows of a firm. This work covers various aspects of supply chain visibility such as current status, its benefits, and the benefit-enabling mechanisms, traced through multiple stages of research, including a survey, round- table, and detailed interviews. Specifically, we developed a multi-case study analysis of supply chain visibility solutions (SCVS) and analyzed its effect on key supply chain processes. A qualitative "with and without SCVS" framework was employed to understand the changes observed in key business processes at several companies that recently implemented SCVS. This was combined with a cross-case study analysis to evaluate the effect of SCVS on the efficiency and effectiveness dimensions of process performance. We found that SCVS has a direct positive effect on data management processes via benefit-enabling mechanisms such as automation, standardization, and better raw data. Key operational processes, such as <b>shipment</b> and inventory <b>management,</b> risk management, and procurement and partner collaboration, were affected positively by SCVS via the antecedent data management process. The strength of impact of SCVS on key operational processes varies by company characteristics and the stage of implementation of SCVS. This research is most useful to companies considering implementing an SCVS to understand {{the potential benefits of}} SCVS and the underlying mechanisms. Managers can increase the relevance and robustness of results by extending the case-study analysis to include more companies with similar operating characteristics. by Anna Stanchik. Thesis: M.

40|$|Manufacturer {{that uses}} {{containers}} to ship products always works {{to optimize the}} space inside the containers. Container loading problems (CLP) are widely encountered in forms of raw material flow and handling, product <b>shipments,</b> warehouse <b>management,</b> facility floor planning, as well as strip-packing nesting problems. Investigations and research conducted two decades ago were logistic orientated, {{on the basis of}} the empirical approaches. Starting from the late 1990 s, researchers and experts in disciplines, such as mathematics, computer science, and industrial engineering, actively participated in the developments of solutions to CLP. Their contributions are mainly in the areas of typological analyses, heuristic methods, and optimization. However, even in the mid- 2010 s, the gaps between those research contributions and the applicable level of problem-solving methods for industry are still tremendously huge. Especially, the majority of existing theoretical solutions fall short in the real-world applications due to the incapability of handling irregular shapes in three-dimensional space. To tackle this shortcoming, this research presents a topology-based metaheuristic approach that simplifies both the irregular shapes and the optimization process. Real-world data and constraints are applied to test the validity of this metaheuristic approach, such as compatibility between commodities, orientation limitations, etc. ^ This research is a project of Center for Technology Development (CTD), sponsored by American Axle Manufacturing, Deere 2 ̆ 6 Company, Eaton, and Faurecia. Within the work scope of this research, two distinctive CLP scenarios are constructed. One scenario is the Shipping Configuration Optimization (SCO), targeting the containerization processes of shipping raw materials and irregular shaped Semi-Knockdown (SKD) modules. The generalized constraints of this scenario are custom and highway regulations, availability of the facilities, labor cost, easiness of loading and unloading, etc. The other scenario is Warehouse and Facility Optimization (WFO). The goal of this scenario was to enhance the efficiency of shelf usage, reduce the floor occupation, corresponding to the change of demands, production plans, regulations, et cetera. ^ The developed metaheuristic approach utilizes topological spatial optimization to handle the complexities related to the three-dimensional irregular shapes. Those irregular shaped items are pixelated into three-dimensional envelop shapes, in which some clearances are added onto the original shapes to ensure the final plan is free of interference. In order to deal with the huge amount of combinations of shipping configurations, this approach applies topology-based category optimization and path optimizations to the existing guided local search (GLS). Topology-based category optimization and path optimization significantly reduce the total number of the possible configuration combinations that need to be analyzed, evaluated, and validated. ^ To test the metaheuristic approach, a proof-of-concept end-user program for engineers that implement the heuristic method is designed and developed. Pilot tests using real world data and conditions from the industrial members of CTD are conducted. The proposed heuristic method satisfactorily takes the constraints into account and generated optimal shipping configurations which cannot be obtained from previous research. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{shipment}} {{scheduling and}} operational control method is developed and tested, to help railroads become more competitive for high revenue, service sensitive freight. A bid-price based, profit maximizing revenue management approach is proposed {{to allow a}} rail carrier to develop achievable and market sensitive quotations of delivery time far new shipments calling in. Bid prices are derived using a subgradient step size algorithm; a modified shortest path procedure is used to solve the decomposed subproblems. ^ Once the service quotation has been developed, a deterministic, cost minimizing, multicommodity network flow model, including train capacity and integral flow constraints is solved to manage shipments moving on the railroad in real time. This model dynamically reroutes shipments {{to take advantage of}} all available train capacity in the network, while still meeting the committed delivery times on priority shipments. A customized dual ascent procedure, using a tabu search approach as an anti-cycling mechanism, adapts the previous solution any time new information is received. ^ Both procedures have been integrated into a rolling horizon simulation model. Simulation results indicate up to a 10 point improvement in railway operating ratio may be achievable through implementation of this <b>shipment</b> <b>management</b> strategy. ...|$|E
40|$|Wrong-product” {{delivery}} - {{the delivery}} of a product different from that desired - is a significant, but as yet unexplored problem in supply-chain management research. There are basically two reasons for wrong-product delivery: either the wrong product is mistakenly ordered or the right product is ordered but the wrong product is picked/shipped. This paper defines and analyzes the “wrong-product delivery” problem using a 2 -product newsvendor model. Two non-substitutable products may be ordered {{at the beginning of}} each time period. However, whenever product i is ordered, then with known probability i, product j is delivered; i, j = 1, 2 (i 6 = j). First, we analyze the “no-recourse scenario”, where management correctly stores whatever was received, but takes no other action. We establish the form of the optimal policy and conduct sensitivity analysis. Although our modeling framework is simple, our results are unexpected and non-intuitive. For example, it is well known that in the single-product newsvendor model, increasing the uncertainty of demand or supply will yield an increase in the corresponding target basestocks and safety stocks. However, increasing the risk of a wrong-product error yields a decrease in the corresponding basestocks and safety stocks. Further, although target basestocks in the single-product newsvendor model are invariant to increases in on-hand inventory, we show that the target basestock for either product is non-decreasing as its inventory increases. We also demonstrate that the cost impact of wrong-product uncertainty is comparable, if not larger than, the cost impact of demand uncertainty. Next, we analyze the “recourse scenario” where management is able to correct errors but only by incurring a fixed cost of $K. We show that it is optimal to take recourse when the wrong-product uncertainty is sufficiently small, but not take recourse when the wrong-product uncertainty is high. In strategic terms, our analysis provides insight into the cost impact of wrong-product errors, and, hence, the importance of reducing them.

40|$|Purpose: {{during the}} last years {{companies}} belonging to the apparel industry have paid increasing attention to RFId technology, attracted {{by the possibility of}} tracing single items as they move along the supply chain. High product value and technological barriers lower than in other industries (i. e. no liquid, limited metal) makes item level tagging an already feasible scenario. Therefore, RFId seems a really promising tool to address the new challenges related to increasing supply chain complexity and virtuality. This technology has the potential of enhancing supply chain performance not only through higher productivity, but also through increased information availability and accuracy. For all these reasons, numerous pilot projects have been launched (e. g. American Apparel, Serafini and Ferragamo just to name a few). However, although the adoption rate proved to be faster than in other industries, the absolute level of adoption is still lower than expected, with just a few widespread implementations. In this sense, a better comprehension of the real benefits enabled by the technology becomes a key factor in fostering the adoption path. With regard to the case of a major Italian apparel company, the paper explores the value of RFId in this supply chain. Research approach: the analysis is based on an in-depth case study carried out with the collaboration of a major Italian apparel company. About 15 face-to-face interviews have been done, and data triangulation has been assured by accessing company’s internal reports and documents. Technological tests have been performed in the RFId Solution Center of Politecnico di Milano and at the company’s facilities in order to verify the reliability of the suggested RFId solution, thus supporting the process re-design. The impact of RFId on operational logistic performance has been assessed using an activity-based approach, whereas a more strategic analysis has been carried out to evaluate the impact of RFId on the whole supply chain, in terms of RFId-based hang label management implications and tagging scenarios. Findings and Originality: the quantitative analysis allowed to identify the activities of the company’s distribution centre mostly affected by RFId, i. e. sorting, sample controls, with positive implications on <b>shipment</b> accuracy and <b>management</b> of contentious issues, and some additional specific activities (e. g. management of flawed products). However, the evidence is that productivity benefits within the distribution centre, although noticeable, cannot justify alone the introduction of RFId. Instead, RFId requires a pervasive technology shift in which profitability stems from a combination of benefits arising in a large number of processes (i. e. logistics, brand protection, product presentation, store management). Research impact: the quantitative assessment model presented in the paper is of general validity, and enlarges the set of analytical models available in the literature to evaluate the benefits of RFId in the apparel industry. Moreover, the strategic analysis helps identify future research directions. Practical impact: the case study presented in the paper is interesting not only for the analysed company, which could assess the economical feasibility of the described RFId project and determine the best tagging scenario, but also for other companies in the apparel industry, which can calculate the achievable benefits and design the appropriate tagging scenario using the illustrated assessment models. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of considering the combination of the numerous benefits enabled by an RFId pervasive project in order to reach a positive return on investmen...|$|R
