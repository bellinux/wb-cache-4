5|$|Raymond's father {{encouraged}} {{his love}} of drawing from an early age, leading him to become an assistant illustrator in the early 1930s on strips such as Tillie the Toiler and Tim Tyler's Luck. Towards the end of 1933, Raymond created the epic Flash Gordon science-fiction comic strip {{to compete with the}} popular Buck Rogers comic strip and, before long, Flash was the more popular strip of the two.

He left the strips in 1944 to join the Marines, saw combat in the Pacific Ocean theater in 1945 and was demobilized in 1946.

Revolution wanted {{to move away from the}} style of its previous projects, making a game with a <b>secret</b> <b>agent</b> theme and set in an action environment. Director Charles Cecil stated that the game was inspired by crime films such as Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. The game engine was written specifically for the title.
