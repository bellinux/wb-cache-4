We {{investigate}} the cardinality {{and structure of}} a ring whose set of algebraic elements is finite, or when the ring has an involution whose set of <b>symmetric</b> <b>elements</b> is finite. In the first case, the subring generated by the algebraic elements is always finite, as is the subring generated by the idempotents, if this set if finite and torsion. When the set of <b>symmetric</b> <b>elements</b> in a ring with involution is finite, {{the sum of all}} nil ideals is a nilpotent idea 1 and its quotient ring is finite.

In a recent paper [8], we obtained two somewhat surprising results concerning how the cardinality of the set H of nilpotent elements in a ring R affects the structure of the ring.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of the real four-qubit Pauli group, being embodied {{in the structure of}} the symplectic polar space W(7, 2), is analyzed in terms of ovoids of a hyperbolic quadric of PG(7, 2), the seven-dimensional projective space of order two. The quadric is selected in such a way that it contains all 135 <b>symmetric</b> <b>elements</b> of the group. Under such circumstances, the third element on the line defined by any two points of an ovoid is skew-symmetric, as is the nucleus of the conic defined by any three points of an ovoid. Each ovoid thus yields 36 / 84 elements of the former/latter type, accounting for all 120 skew-symmetric elements of the group. There are a number of notable types of ovoid-associated subgeometries of the group, of which we mention the following: a subset of 12 skew-symmetric elements lying on four mutually skew lines that span the whole ambient space, a subset of 15 <b>symmetric</b> <b>elements</b> that corresponds to two ovoids sharing three points, a subset of 19 <b>symmetric</b> <b>elements</b> generated by two ovoids on a common point, a subset of 27 <b>symmetric</b> <b>elements</b> that can be partitioned into three ovoids in two unique ways, a subset of 27 skew-symmetric elements that exhibits a 15 + 2 x 6 split reminding that exhibited by an elliptic quadric of PG(5, 2), and a subset of seven skew-symmetric elements formed by the nuclei of seven conics having two points in common, which is an analogue of a Conwell heptad of PG(5, 2). The strategy we employed is completely novel and unique in its nature, as are the results obtained. Such a detailed dissection of the {{geometry of}} the group in question may, for example, be crucial in getting further insights into the still-puzzling black-hole-qubit correspondence/analogy.

We use bilateral trade in cultural goods to proxy for asymmetric and time-dependent CP. We revisit the existing supply/origin-side theories of bilateral FDI to derive a gravity equation suited for testing the impact of both directions of asymmetric CP. To this end, we introduce several ‘destination-side’ mechanisms to rationalize the potential role of the origin’s culture attractiveness for the country that hosts the investment project. The econometric analysis confirms a positive role of asymmetric CP as a determinant of Greenfield FDI, and suggests a stronger contribution of the destination-side channels...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} recent {{progress}} in the analysis and applications of the symmetry-related electromagnetic properties of transmission lines loaded with symmetric configurations of resonant elements. It will be shown that the transmission characteristics of these reactively loaded lines can be controlled by the relative orientation between the line and the resonant elements. Two main types of loaded lines are considered: (i) resonance-based structures; and (ii) frequency-splitting structures. In resonance-based transmission lines, a line is loaded with a single resonant (and <b>symmetric)</b> <b>element.</b> For a perfectly symmetric structure, the line is transparent if the line and resonator exhibit symmetry planes of different electromagnetic nature (electric or magnetic wall), whereas the line exhibits a notch (resonance) in the transmission coefficient if the symmetry planes behave as either electric or magnetic walls (symmetric configuration), or if symmetry is broken. In frequency-splitting lines, paired resonators are typically loaded to the transmission line; the structure exhibits a single notch for the symmetric configuration, whereas generally two split notches appear when symmetry is disrupted. Applications of these structures include microwave sensors (e. g., contactless sensors of spatial variables), selective mode suppressors (of application in common-mode suppressed differential lines, for instance) and spectral signature barcodes, among others...|$|E

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita. Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 25 - 11 - 2013 Protein CopG (45 aa) encoded by plasmid pMV 158 is {{the smallest}} transcriptional repressor characterized so far, and is the prototype {{of a family of}} plasmids replicating by the Rolling-Circle mechanism. CopG represses Pcr promoter, which directs the transcription of its own gen (copG) and that of the initiator protein for plasmid replication (repB). The DNA target of CopG has a <b>symmetric</b> <b>element</b> (SE) that includes a repeat of the sequence 5 ’-TGCA- 3 ’ at each side of the symmetry axis, in the subsites called the Left and Right Symmetric Elements (LSE and RSE, respectively). The LSE overlaps the - 35 promoter region. Crystallographic studies of CopG free and bound to the SE demonstrated that it has a “β-Ribbon-α 1 -Helix-α 2 -Helix” (RHH) threedimensional configuration, and that one dimer of protein binds to each half of the SE. The CopGDNA interaction relies on the contacts made by the β-Ribbon with DNA bases, and on those made by the α 2 helix N-terminal residues with the phosphate backbone. Binding of CopG to its target DNA generates, with a pattern of cooperativity, four well-defined complexes (CI, CII, CIII and CIV), which are supposed to correspond to 1, 2, 3 and 4 dimers bound to the operator DNA. Thus, one dimer binds to each subsite of the SE, and two extra dimers would bind laterally to the SE, in regions located one helical turn apart, defined as the Left and Right Arms (LA and RA, respectively). The RA overlaps the extended - 10 region of Pcr promoter. In this Thesis we demonstrated that, in fact, the specific nucleoprotein complex formed by CopG consists of four dimers bound in a sequential and highly cooperative manner to four subsites of the DNA spanning about 50 bp. We also determined that the RSE is the primary site of protein binding, to which CopG binds establishing interactions beyond those described in the SE-CopG tetramer co-crystals. Then, the second dimer binds to the RA, the third to the LSE and the last one binds to the LA. These results support the hypothesis about the CopG-mediated transcriptional repression by active dissociation, according to which the RSE keeps accessible for CopG binding once the RNAP is bound to the Pcr promoter. Binding of CopG to the RSE then promotes, by cooperative interactions, the formation of the complete nucleoprotein complex, dislodging finally the RNAP. On the other hand, two CopG variants were studied: CopGA 30 E and CopGG 25 E. The altered residues in these mutants are located in the dimer-dimer interaction surface observed in the SE-CopG tetramer co-crystals. By NMR, differences in the structural configuration of the three CopG variants were not observed. However, EMSAs revealed a diminished affinity for DNA and altered cooperative properties in both mutants compared to the wild-type protein. Using the three CopG variants and a battery of operator mutants, we observed and proposed that: i) the recognition sequence that better promotes binding of CopG was the 6 -bp motif 5 ’-(R) TGCA(Y) - 3 ’, and ii) upon binding, the four dimers arrange as two tetramers, each bound to a half of the operator, hence generating at least two different dimerdimer interfaces in the whole nucleoprotein complex formed by CopG, namely the interaction surface observed for the two dimers bound to the SE as described in the co-crystals, and the interface generated between the two dimers bound to either of the operator halves. All together, we demonstrated that binding of CopG to its operator DNA depends both on the nucleotide sequence and on the cooperative interdimeric interactions...|$|E
