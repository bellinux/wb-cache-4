Regarding 1 st case and 3 rd case {{on the time of}} inoculation from fourth to fifth generation, and 2 nd case frcm 5 th to 6 th generation the passage through Seitz E. K. filter was performed. The inoculation was continuously performed up to 22 nd for 3 rd case. The histological changes in the organs of guinea pigs were mainely found as the hyperplasia of septal cells and hypertrophies of septum, resulting in frequent narrowing or disappearing of alveolar cavities. There were present the infiltrations of lymphocytes and monocytes in septum. Around the vessels and bronchioles the hyperplasia of mesenchymal cells was revealed. The pathological findings shown above were indentical with interstitial pneumonia what we call virus pneumonia.

Likewise, the deficient ribs are exposed circumferentially and trimmed to fit rib docking sites on the implant. The pleural defect may be covered with graft or mesh depending on surgeon preference. Prior to final fixation, a chest tube should be placed. Subsequently, the prosthesis is placed and secured. For fixation to the sternum, 4 – 5 transosseous # 5 Fiberwire® (Arthrex, Inc., Naples, FL, USA) sutures are placed through pre-fabricated holes in the implant. The first implant design (described in Case 1 below) utilized tubes with locking trap-doors that provided secure fixation to the ribs. However, due to prominence on the chest wall post-operatively, the second prosthesis (described in Case 2) was designed with smaller rib docking sites where two transosseous # 5 Fiberwire® sutures are placed through pre-fabricated holes for fixation to the ribs. For closure, the sectioned posterior musculature is approximated with reduction of the scapula.

Acellular scaffolds derived from organ decellularization are promising, widely used biomaterials for tissue engineering. However, the acellular skeletal muscle extra cellular matrix (ECM) has been poorly characterized in terms of production, storage and hoste-donor interactions. We have produced acellular scaffolds at the whole organ scale from various skeletal muscles explanted from mice. The acellular scaffolds conserve chemical and architectural features of the tissue of origin, including the vascular bed. Scaffolds can be <b>sterilely</b> stored for weeks at þ 4 C or þ 37 C in tissue culture grade conditions.

We used four vaccine platforms for prime or boost vaccinations: plasmids (DNA), alphavirus replicons (VRP), attenuated adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad), or attenuated poxvirus (Pox). These four platforms combined to produce five different prime/boost vaccine regimens: Pox alone, VRP/Pox, VRP/Ad, Ad/Pox, and DNA/Pox. Five rhesus monkeys were immunized with each regimen, and five Control monkeys received a mock vaccination. The time to complete vaccinations was 420 days.

Feathers are waxy oligotrophic environments low in moisture and rich in recalcitrant beta-keratin subject to freezing temperatures and high UV radiation. Ventral feathers were <b>sterilely</b> collected from wild dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) by mist net capture and shaken in a chaotropic solution to dislodge bacterial cells.

Animals were primed {{with a mixture}} of DNA plasmids encoding two preerythrocytic-stage proteins and two erythrocytic-stage proteins from P. knowlesi and combinations of the cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin- 4, and tumor necrosis factor alpha and were boosted {{with a mixture of}} four recombinant, attenuated vaccinia virus strains encoding the four P. knowlesi antigens. Two weeks after boosting, the geometric mean immunofluorescence titers in the immunized groups against sporozoites and infected erythrocytes ranged from 160 to 8, 096 and from 1, 810 to 5, 120, respectively. The geometric mean anti-P. knowlesi circumsporozoite protein (PkCSP) titers ranged from 1, 761 to 24, 242. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the immunized monkeys produced gamma interferon (IFN-γ) in response to incubation with pooled peptides from the PkCSP at frequencies of 10 to 571 spot-forming cells/ 106 PBMC. Following challenge with 100 infectious P. knowlesi sporozoites, 2 of 11 immunized monkeys were <b>sterilely</b> protected, and 7 of the 9 infected monkeys resolved their parasitemias spontaneously. In contrast, all four controls became infected and required treatment for overwhelming parasitemia. Early protection was strongly associated with IFN-γ responses against a pool of peptides from the preerythrocytic-stage antigen, PkCSP.

Graft infections were established in the back subcutaneous tissue of 240 adult male Wistar rats by implantation of 1 -cm 2 Dacron prostheses, followed by topical inoculation with 2 × 107 CFU of S. epidermidis. The study included a control group (no graft contamination), two contaminated groups that did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis, two contaminated groups to which perioperative intraperitoneal cefazolin prophylaxis (30 mg/kg of body weight) was administered, six contaminated groups that received a peptide- or rifampin-soaked graft, and six contaminated groups that received a peptide- or rifampin-soaked graft and perioperative intraperitoneal cefazolin prophylaxis (30 mg/kg).

40|$|Background. ?Circumsporozoite protein (CS) is the {{antigenic}} {{target for}} RTS,S, {{the most advanced}} malaria vaccine to date. Heterologous prime-boost with the viral vectors ChAd 63 -MVA is the most potent inducer of T-cells in humans, demonstrating significant efficacy when expressing the pre-erythrocytic antigen insert ME-TRAP. We hypothesised that ChAd 63 -MVA containing CS may result in significant, clinical protective efficacy. Methods. ?We conducted an open-label, two-site partially randomized sporozoite controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study to compare the clinical efficacy of ChAd 63 -MVA CS with ChAd 63 -MVA ME-TRAP. The study was registered at: www. clinicaltrials. gov (NCT 01623557). Results. ? 1 / 15 (7 %) vaccinees receiving ChAd 63 -MVA CS and 2 / 15 (13 %) vaccinees receiving ChAd 63 -MVA ME-TRAP were <b>sterilely</b> protected post-CHMI. 3 / 15 (20 %) vaccinees receiving ChAd 63 -MVA CS and 5 / 15 (33 %) vaccinees receiving ChAd 63 -MVA ME-TRAP demonstrated a delay in time to treatment compared to unvaccinated controls. In qPCR analyses, ChAd 63 -MVA CS was estimated to reduce liver parasite burden by 69 - 79 %, compared to 79 - 84 % for ChAd 63 -MVA ME-TRAP. Conclusions. ?ChAd 63 -MVA CS does result in a reduction in liver parasite burden but ChAd 63 -MVA ME-TRAP remains the most promising antigenic insert for a vectored liver-stage vaccine.

Results Here, we identify the light-independent inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) by highly purified fractions of chloroform extracts of H. perforatum. Both cytotoxicity and antiviral activity were evident in initial chloroform extracts, but bioassay-guided fractionation produced fractions that inhibited HIV- 1 with little to no cytotoxicity. Separation of these two biological activities has not been reported for constituents responsible for the light-dependent antiviral activities. Antiviral activity was associated with more polar subfractions. GC/MS analysis {{of the two most}} active subfractions identified 3 -hydroxy lauric acid as predominant in one fraction and 3 -hydroxy myristic acid as predominant in the other. Synthetic 3 -hydroxy lauric acid inhibited HIV infectivity without cytotoxicity, suggesting that this modified fatty acid is likely responsible for observed antiviral activity present in that fraction. As production of 3 -hydroxy fatty acids by plants remains controversial, H. perforatum seedlings were grown <b>sterilely</b> and evaluated for presence of 3 -hydroxy fatty acids by GC/MS. Small quantities of some 3 -hydroxy fatty acids were detected in sterile plants, whereas different 3 -hydroxy fatty acids were detected in our chloroform extracts or field-grown material. Conclusion Through bioguided fractionation, we have identified that 3 -hydroxy lauric acid found in field grown Hypericum perforatum has anti-HIV activity. This novel anti-HIV activity can be potentially developed into inexpensive therapies, expanding the current arsenal of anti-retroviral agents. </p...|$|E

The {{research}} leading to these results has received {{funding from the}} European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement No. 602773 (Project KINDRED) and No. 603240 (Project NMTrypI). American trypanosomiasis, commonly called Chagas disease, {{is one of the}} most neglected illnesses in the world and remains one of the most prevalent chronic infectious diseases of Latin America with thousands of new cases every year. The only treatments available have been introduced five decades ago. They have serious, undesirable side effects and disputed benefits in the chronic stage of the disease – a characteristic and debilitating cardiomyopathy and/or megavisceras. Several laboratories have therefore focused their efforts in finding better drugs. Although recent years have brought new clinical trials, these are few and lack diversity in terms of drug mechanism of action, thus resulting in a weak drug discovery pipeline. This fragility has been recently exposed by the failure of two candidates, posaconazole and E 1224, to <b>sterilely</b> cure patients in phase 2 clinical trials. Such setbacks highlight the need for continuous, novel and high quality drug discovery and development efforts to discover better and safer treatments. In this article we will review past and current findings on drug discovery for Trypanosoma cruzi made by academic research groups, industry and other research organizations over the last half century. We will also analyze the current research landscape that is now better placed than ever to deliver alternative treatments for Chagas disease in the near futurePostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|High pH {{has been}} shown to rapidly destroy gram-negative food-borne pathogens; however, the {{mechanism}} of destruction has not yet been elucidated. Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13706, and Listeria monocytogenes F 5069 were suspended in NaHCO 3 -NaOH buffer solutions at pH 9, 10, 11, or 12 to give a final cell concentration of approximately 5. 2 x 10 (8) CFU/ml and then held at 37 or 45 degrees C. At 0, 5, 10, and 15 min the suspensions were <b>sterilely</b> filtered and each filtrate was analyzed for material with A 260. Viability of the cell suspensions was evaluated by enumeration on nonselective and selective agars. Cell morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. A 260 increased dramatically with pH and temperature for both E. coli and S. enteritidis; however, with L. monocytogenes material with A 260 was not detected at any of the pHs tested. At pH 12, numbers of E. coli and S. enteritidis decreased at least 8 logs within 15 s, whereas L. monocytogenes decreased by only 1 log in 10 min. There was a very strong correlation between the initial rate of release of material with A 260 and death rate of the gram-negative pathogens (r = 0. 997). At pH 12, gram-negative test cells appeared collapsed and showed evidence of lysis while gram-positive L. monocytogenes did not, when observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. It was concluded that destruction of gram-negative food-borne pathogens by high pH involves disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that {{delivery of the}} porcine type I interferon gene (poIFN-α/β) with a replication-defective human adenovirus vector (adenovirus 5 [Ad 5]) can <b>sterilely</b> protect swine challenged with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 1 day later. However, the need of relatively high doses of Ad 5 limits the applicability of such a control strategy in the livestock industry. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) empty replicon particles (VRPs) can induce rapid protection of mice against either homologous or, in some cases, heterologous virus challenge. As an alternative approach to induce rapid protection against FMDV, we have examined the ability of VRPs containing either the gene for green fluorescent protein (VRP-GFP) or poIFN-α (VRP-poIFN- α) to block FMDV replication in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment of swine or bovine cell lines with either VRP significantly inhibited subsequent infection with FMDV as early as 6 h after treatment and for at least 120 h posttreatment. Furthermore, mice pretreated with either 107 or 108 infectious units of VRP-GFP and challenged with a lethal dose of FMDV 24 h later were protected from death. Protection was induced as early as 6 h after treatment and lasted for at least 48 h and correlated with induction of an antiviral response and production of IFN- α. By 6 h after treatment several genes were upregulated, {{and the number of}} genes and the level of induction increased at 24 h. Finally, we demonstrated that the chemokine IP- 10, which is induced by IFN- α and VRP-GFP, is directly involved in protection against FMDV...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A highly efficacious {{vaccine is}} needed for malaria control and eradication. Immunization with Plasmodium falciparum NF 54 parasites under {{chemoprophylaxis}} (chemoprophylaxis and sporozoite (CPS) -immunization) induces the most efficient long-lasting protection against a homologous parasite. However, parasite genetic diversity is a major hurdle for protection against heterologous strains. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 39 healthy participants of NF 54 -CPS immunization by bites of 45 NF 54 -infected (n = 24 volunteers) or uninfected mosquitoes (placebo; n = 15 volunteers) against a controlled human malaria infection with the homologous NF 54 or the genetically distinct NF 135. C 10 and NF 166. C 8 clones. Cellular and humoral immune assays were performed as well as genetic characterization of the parasite clones. RESULTS: NF 54 -CPS immunization induced complete protection in 5 / 5 volunteers against NF 54 challenge infection at 14 weeks post-immunization, but <b>sterilely</b> protected only 2 / 10 and 1 / 9 volunteers against NF 135. C 10 and NF 166. C 8 challenge infection, respectively. Post-immunization plasma showed a significantly lower capacity to block heterologous parasite development in primary human hepatocytes compared to NF 54. Whole genome sequencing showed that NF 135. C 10 and NF 166. C 8 have amino acid changes in multiple antigens targeted by CPS-induced antibodies. Volunteers protected against heterologous challenge were among the stronger immune responders to in vitro parasite stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Although highly protective against homologous parasites, NF 54 -CPS-induced immunity is less effective against heterologous parasite clones both in vivo and in vitro. Our data indicate that whole sporozoite-based vaccine approaches require more potent immune responses for heterologous protection.

40|$|In animal models, {{devices such}} as {{indwelling}} catheters and intracranial cannulae are often fixed on the skull to allow sampling or injection in the freely moving animal. The most commonly used method to fixate these devices is by embedding them in a 'helmet' of cement which is fixed to the skull with screws. Methylmethacrylate cement is commonly used for this purpose. The disadvantages of this cement are the high polymerization temperature, poor bonding to the bone and long hardening time. We have evaluated the use of glass ionomer cement, carboxylat cement and cyanoacrylic glue as alternative for methylmethacrylate cement. Temperature increase during polymerization of methylmethacrylate cement and glass ionomer cement was measured in the cement on the skull and in the brain of 14 rats in an acute model. In a chronic model, 52 rats and 91 mice were equipped with a 'helmet' {{of one of the}} cements. The glass ionomer 'helmets' were applied without or with pretreatment of the skull. The attachment of the cement to the skull was checked every day. After four weeks the bonding strengths of the cements were measured. The glass ionomer cement had less temperature increase during polymerization and good bonding capabilities when compared with methylmethacrylate cement. Mechanical pretreatment of the skull resulted in a significant increase in bonding strength of glass ionomer cement in mice and rats as compared with chemical pretreatment. Furthermore, glass ionomer cement had a shorter hardening time than methylmethacrylate cement, and when the glass ionomer cement was used in prepacked capsules, it was possible to apply the cement <b>sterilely</b> and easily. Cyanoacrylic glue had good bonding capabilities to the skull of mice and is also a good substitute for methylmethacrylate cement...|$|E
40|$|Up to now, {{orthopaedic}} {{management of}} chronic osteomyelitis is still problematic. Debridement and antibiotic administration {{is still a}} widely practiced management. However, oral or parenteral antibiotics often cannot reach the infection site well. Some experts have developed a system to administer local antibiotic {{in the form of}} antibiotic beads. Antibiotic beads on the market are still very expensive. Therefore, we made efforts to make our own antibiotic beads by using ceftriaxone as the antibiotic. Ceftriaxone impregnated beads were made by mixing 2 grams of Ceftriaxone powder with 40 grams of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement <b>sterilely.</b> The size of the beads was 3 x 5 mm. Thirty male rabbits that were induced to get osteomyelitis by inoculating Staphylococcus aureus to their left radius bones were used. In the fourth week, clinical, radiological, histological examination and bacterial culture were performed to prove the presence of osteomyelitis. Then, the samples were divided into 3 groups of ten. The first group only underwent debridement. The second group underwent debridement followed by intravenous ceftriaxone administration. The third group underwent debridement followed by intravenous ceftriaxone and ceftriaxone-impregnated beads administration. After four weeks, clinical, radiological, histological examination and bacterial culture were repeated. In the first group, the incidence rate of osteomyelitis {{at the end of the}} fourth week of therapy was 60 % (success rate 40 %). In the second group, after four weeks of therapy the incidence rate of osteomyelitis after treatment was 20 % (success rate 80 %), whereas that of the third group was 0 % (success rate 100 %). In conclusion, the efficacy of combination of systemic antibiotic therapy and ceftriaxone impregnated beads in the therapy of chronic osteomyelitis is better than systemic antibiotic therapy.   (Med J Indones 2005; 14 : 157 - 62) Keywords: debridement, polymethyl methacrylate </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Gene-based {{vaccination}} using prime/boost regimens protects {{animals and}} humans against malaria, inducing cell-mediated responses that in animal models target liver stage malaria parasites. We tested a DNA prime/adenovirus boost malaria vaccine in a Phase 1 clinical trial with controlled human malaria infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The vaccine regimen was three monthly doses of two DNA plasmids (DNA) followed four months later by a single boost with two non-replicating human serotype 5 adenovirus vectors (Ad). The constructs encoded genes expressing P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and apical membrane antigen- 1 (AMA 1). The regimen was safe and well-tolerated, with mostly mild adverse events that occurred {{at the site of}} injection. Only one AE (diarrhea), possibly related to immunization, was severe (Grade 3), preventing daily activities. Four weeks after the Ad boost, 15 study subjects were challenged with P. falciparum sporozoites by mosquito bite, and four (27 %) were <b>sterilely</b> protected. Antibody responses by ELISA rose after Ad boost but were low (CSP geometric mean titer 210, range 44 - 817; AMA 1 geometric mean micrograms/milliliter 11. 9, range 1. 5 - 102) and were not associated with protection. Ex vivo IFN-gamma ELISpot responses after Ad boost were modest (CSP geometric mean spot forming cells/million peripheral blood mononuclear cells 86, range 13 - 408; AMA 1 348, range 88 - 1270) and were highest in three protected subjects. ELISpot responses to AMA 1 were significantly associated with protection (p = 0. 019). Flow cytometry identified predominant IFN-gamma mono-secreting CD 8 + T cell responses in three protected subjects. No subjects with high pre-existing anti-Ad 5 neutralizing antibodies were protected but the association was not statistically significant. SIGNIFICANCE: The DNA/Ad regimen provided the highest sterile immunity achieved against malaria following immunization with a gene-based subunit vaccine (27 %). Protection was associated with cell-mediated immunity to AMA 1, with CSP probably contributing. Substituting a low seroprevalence vector for Ad 5 and supplementing CSP/AMA 1 with additional antigens may improve protection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials. govNCT 00870987...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{protective}} {{malaria vaccine}} will likely need to elicit both cell-mediated and antibody responses. As adenovirus vaccine vectors induce both these responses in humans, a Phase 1 / 2 {{a clinical trial}} was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an adenovirus serotype 5 -vectored malaria vaccine against sporozoite challenge. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC is an adenovirus vector encoding the Plasmodium falciparum 3 D 7 circumsporozoite protein (CSP). It is one component of a two-component vaccine NMRC-M 3 V-Ad-PfCA consisting of one adenovector encoding CSP and one encoding apical membrane antigen- 1 (AMA 1) that was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in an earlier study (see companion paper, Sedegah et al). Fourteen Ad 5 seropositive or negative adults received two doses of NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC sixteen weeks apart, at 1 x 1010 particle units per dose. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated. All volunteers developed positive ELISpot responses by 28 days after the first immunization (geometric mean 272 spot forming cells/million[sfc/m]) that declined during the following 16 weeks and increased after the second dose to levels that in most cases were less than the initial peak (geometric mean 119 sfc/m). CD 8 + predominated over CD 4 + responses, as in the first clinical trial. Antibody responses were poor and like ELISpot responses increased after the second immunization but did not exceed the initial peak. Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to Ad 5 {{did not affect the}} immunogenicity of the first dose, but the fold increase in NAb induced by the first dose was significantly associated with poorer antibody responses after the second dose, while ELISpot responses remained unaffected. When challenged by the bite of P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes, two of 11 volunteers showed a delay in the time to patency compared to infectivity controls, but no volunteers were <b>sterilely</b> protected. SIGNIFICANCE: The NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC vaccine expressing CSP was safe and well tolerated given as two doses, but did not provide sterile protection.

40|$|The {{co-culture}} of Trametes versicolor and Ganoderma applanatum is a {{model of}} intense basidiomycete interaction, which induces many newly synthesized or highly produced features. Currently, one of the major challenges is an identification of the origin of induced features during the co-culture. Herein, we report a 13 C-dynamic labeling analysis used to determine an association of induced features and corresponding fungus even if the identities of metabolites were not available or almost nothing was known of biochemical aspects. After the co-culture of T. versicolor and G. applanatum for 10 days, the mycelium pellets of T. versicolor and G. applanatum were <b>sterilely</b> harvested and then mono-cultured in the liquid medium containing half fresh medium with 13 C-labeled glucose as carbon source and half co-cultured supernatants collected on day 10. 13 C-labeled metabolome analyzed by LC-MS revealed that 31 induced features including 3 -phenyllactic acid and orsellinic acid were isotopically labeled in the mono-culture after the co-culture stimulation. Twenty features were derived from T. versicolor, 6 from G. applanatum, and 5 features were synthesized by both T. versicolor and G. applanatum. 13 C-labeling further suggested that 12 features such as previously identified novel xyloside [N-(4 -methoxyphenyl) formamide 2 -O-beta-D-xyloside] were likely induced through the direct physical interaction of mycelia. Use of molecular network analysis combined with 13 C-labeling provided an insight into the link between the generation of structural analogs and producing fungus. Compound 1 with m/z 309. 0757, increased 15. 4 -fold in the co-culture and observed 13 C incorporation in the mono-culture of both T. versicolor and G. applanatum, was purified and identified as a phenyl polyketide, 2, 5, 6 -trihydroxy- 4, 6 -diphenylcyclohex- 4 -ene- 1, 3 -dione. The biological activity study indicated that this compound has a potential to inhibit cell viability of leukemic cell line U 937.
