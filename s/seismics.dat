30|$|To {{analyze the}} {{sedimentation}} distribution {{features of the}} time-equivalent <b>seismic</b> unit, {{it is necessary to}} introduce the concepts of time-equivalent <b>seismic</b> attributes and <b>seismic</b> sedimentary bodies. The time-equivalent <b>seismic</b> attribute represents the geometric, kinematics, dynamic, and statistical features of <b>seismic</b> waves corresponding to the time-equivalent <b>seismic</b> unit. The <b>seismic</b> sedimentary body is a reflection of a sedimentary event on the <b>seismic</b> record. In addition to thin sands that cannot be analyzed by stratal slices, gravity flow events exhibit diachroneity in certain cases. Thus, conventional stratal slicing or interlayer <b>seismic</b> attributes can hardly ensure the isochronism of attribute slices, and the time-equivalent <b>seismic</b> unit can ensure the study unit’s unity with time. The extracted time-equivalent <b>seismic</b> attribute reflects the <b>seismic</b> reflection features of the predominant facies in this interval. The planar distribution feature of the time-equivalent <b>seismic</b> attribute provides the base map for sedimentation analysis and overcomes the diachroneity that commonly occurs in continental deposits. When the length of the time-equivalent unit time window approaches zero, the time-equivalent <b>seismic</b> attribute equals the time-equivalent stratal slice. Hence, the time-equivalent stratal slice can be regarded as a particular case of the time-equivalent <b>seismic</b> attribute.|$|R

40|$|<b>Seismic</b> {{fragility}} {{analysis has}} been widely used to evaluate <b>seismic</b> capacities of structures, systems, and components (SSCs) in nuclear power plants. In the <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis, a single ground motion parameter (GMP),such as peak ground acceleration (PGA), is chosen to characterize the Review Level Earthquake (RLE) and represent the <b>seismic</b> capacity of an SSC. However, due {{to the use of}} a single GMP, problems have been observed in engineering practice. It is well known, from elastic structural dynamic analyses, structural responses under earthquake excitations depend primarily on spectral accelerations at its dominant natural frequencies. Choosing spectral accelerations at structural dominant natural frequencies as vector-valued GMPs (VGMPs) can more accurately characterize the input RLE and more precisely predict structural responses. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop weighting <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis method that overcomes the problems in current <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis method. The proposed method mainly includes that 1. vector-valued probabilistic <b>seismic</b> hazard analysis (VPSHA) is performed to determine the weights of input ground response spectra (GRS); 2. <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis considering VGMPs method is proposed to calculate <b>seismic</b> fragility based on VGMPs; 3. weights of input GRS and <b>seismic</b> fragility are combined to obtain the weighting <b>seismic</b> fragility of an SSC. By using VGMPs, the proposed method resolves the problems in current <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis, thus it can obtain more accurate <b>seismic</b> capacities of safety-related SSCs. In addition, weighting <b>seismic</b> fragility curves and High Confidence and Low Probability of Failure (HCLPF) <b>seismic</b> capacities are represented by a single GMP such as PGA, hence they are readily incorporated into <b>Seismic</b> Probabilistic Risk Analysis and <b>Seismic</b> Margin Assessment (SMA). Based on weighting <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis method, an improved SMA procedure is proposed. The procedure combines the use of weighting and current <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis methods, i. e., 1. weighting <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis is performed to determine HCLPF <b>seismic</b> capacities of “weak link” SSCs, and 2. current <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis is conducted to calculate HCLPF <b>seismic</b> capacities of less important SSCs. This ensures that more accurate plant <b>seismic</b> capacity is obtained, while computational cost is acceptable. The proposed SMA procedure can save redesign cost of “weak link” SSCs. The proposed weighting <b>seismic</b> fragility analysis method is accurate and applicable, providing more accurate <b>seismic</b> capacity estimates of safety-related SSCs, thus saving redesign cost of “weak link” SSCs that do not satisfy <b>seismic</b> margin requirement...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{the project}} "Management of Georisk" (MANGEONAD) of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), Hanover, high {{resolution}} shallow shear-wave reflection <b>seismics</b> was applied in the Indonesian province Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, North Sumatra in cooperation with the Government of Indonesia, local counterparts, and the Leibniz Institute for Applied Geosciences, Hanover. The investigations were expected to support classification of earthquake site effects for the reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure as well as for groundwater exploration. The study focussed on the city of Banda Aceh and the surroundings of Aceh Besar. The shear-wave seismic surveys were done parallel to standard geoengineering investigations like cone penetrometer tests to support subsequent site specific statistical calibration. They were also partly supplemented by shallow p-wave <b>seismics</b> for the identification of (a) elastic subsurface parameters and (b) zones with abundance of groundwater. Evaluation of seismic site effects based on shallow reflection <b>seismics</b> has in fact been found to be a highly useful method in Aceh province. In particular, use of a vibratory seismic source was essential for successful application of shear-wave <b>seismics</b> in the city of Banda Aceh and in areas with compacted ground like on farm tracks in the surroundings, presenting mostly agricultural land use areas. We thus were able to explore the mechanical stiffness of the subsurface down to 100 m depth, occasionally even deeper, with remarkably high resolution.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the calculation of}} the <b>seismic</b> demand hazard in a practice-oriented manner via the use of <b>seismic</b> response analyses at few intensity levels. The <b>seismic</b> demand hazard is a more robust measure for quantifying <b>seismic</b> performance, when <b>seismic</b> hazard is represented in a probabilistic format, than intensity-based assessments, which remain prevalent in <b>seismic</b> design codes. It is illustrated that, for a relatively complex bridge–foundation–soil system case study, the <b>seismic</b> demand hazard can be estimated with sufficient accuracy using as little as three intensity measure levels that have exceedance probabilities of 50 %, 10 % and 2 % in 50 years which are already of interest in multi-objective performance-based design. Compared with the conventional use of the mean demand from an intensity-based assessment(s), it is illustrated that, for {{the same number of}} <b>seismic</b> response analyses, a practice-oriented ‘approximate’ <b>seismic</b> demand hazard is a more accurate and precise estimate of the ‘exact’ <b>seismic</b> demand hazard. Direct estimation of the <b>seismic</b> demand hazard also provides information of <b>seismic</b> performance at multiple exceedance rates. Thus, it is advocated that if <b>seismic</b> hazard is considered in a probabilistic format, then <b>seismic</b> performance assessment, and acceptance criteria, should be in terms of the <b>seismic</b> demand hazard and not intensity-based assessments...|$|R
