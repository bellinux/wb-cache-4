40|$|Since 1947, the Vietnam Social Security (VSS) has {{provided}} social insurance to public servants and armed forces personnel in Vietnam. In 1995, the Government merged the social insurance {{unit of the}} Ministry of labour, invalids and social affairs {{with that of the}} Vietnam General Confederation of labor. At the same time the system became mandatory to the employees of the newly developing private sector. The consolidated system is publicly managed by the VSS administration. VSS collects contributions and pay social insurance benefits (in case of <b>sickness</b> <b>and</b> sick leaves, <b>maternity</b> <b>and</b> family planning related leaves, work injury and professional disease, survivorship and to people that reached pension ages). This paper investigates this issue by reviewing the characteristics of employment in Vietnam. It concludes that the risk that social coverage remains limited for many years is high and, presents accordingly some policy options to augment VSS's chances to reach universal coverage in the future.

50|$|In social policy, {{a number}} of {{progressive}} reforms were implemented during Krag's time as Prime Minister. Under the New Care of Children and Juveniles Act of May 1964, local child and juvenile welfare committees were authorized to grant cash benefits to certain families with children, to avoid placing children {{in the care of}} the Municipal Social Welfare Offices. New criteria for day-care institutions stressing social, educational, and therapeutic aspects were also introduced, and municipalities were obliged to provide facilities for day-care and other related services. Under the Employment Service and Unemployment Insurance Act of February 1967, unemployment benefits were raised and indexed to the official wage index and waiting times were abolished. In addition, an accident insurance act of December 1964 indexed benefits. The Basic Education Act of April 1972 extended compulsory basic education from 7 to 9 years. while A law passed in June 1972 introduced a new scheme for daily cash benefits in cases of <b>sickness</b> <b>and</b> <b>maternity.</b> In 1964, a supplementary pension scheme was established, together with universal child allowances in 1967.|$|E
40|$|The Costa Rican Social Insurance Fund - the country's main social {{security}} institution - was established in 1941 to provide compulsory social insurance coverage for employees, through old-age, disability, and survivor pensions, as well as <b>sickness</b> <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> benefits. The current status of the pension system is alarming, and reform is urgently needed. Among other things: 1) the system is costly to the government; 2) it promises generous benefits {{that are difficult to}} sustain; 3) contribution rates are low; 4) the link between contributions and benefits is weak; 5) inflation indexing is inadequate and ad hoc; 6) although there is no explicit early retirement system, individuals have found a substitute for early retirement in disability pensions; 7) health benefits to pensioners are paid out of pension contributions; and 8) the system's reserves have not been well invested. Reform of the system should be immediate. At a minimum, reform should include: reduced benefits; higher contribution rates; a higher retirement age; a stronger link between contributions and benefits; and the unbundling of health and pension accounts.

I also didn't forget to mention some important international organisations, which affect {{in the area of}} social security and also the modification of security within European Union.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the scope of}} the legal protection of pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> with respect to private sector workers in Peninsular or West Malaysia. The analysis focuses on how effectively the law deals with the adverse or unfavourable treatment of women workers in respect of pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity.</b> The feminized workplace in Malaysia is assessed to determine the manner in which women’s ‘double burden’ in productive and reproductive labour results in the various legal issues faced by women workers in respect of pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity.</b> The current legal approaches to pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> protection, comprising statutory and negotiated entitlements in collective agreements and employment contracts are reviewed, together with the dispute resolution bodies and remedies that apply. In addition, the constitutional rights to equality and gender non-discrimination are analysed to determine whether claims of discriminatory treatment relating to pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> may be brought to the courts as violations of those rights. These legal approaches are then benchmarked against international law {{to determine the extent to}} which Malaysia meets international approaches to pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> protection. The analysis reveals that the multi-faceted approach in Malaysia is inadequate. The various statutory rights and the remedial approaches that apply are deficient and lack comprehensiveness. Negotiated pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> entitlements are subject to employer and statutory restrictions, while the Industrial Court has been inconsistent and unaccommodating in resolving disputes involving collective agreements. The right to equality and the prohibition against gender discrimination under the Federal Constitution have been narrowly interpreted by the courts. As a result, the benchmarking of the domestic approach to pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> protection against international law shows that Malaysia falls short in terms of satisfying the international labour standards and its international human rights obligations. The first recommendation focuses on the role and responsibility of the State in either, amending the various statutory entitlements to benefit women workers, or, alternatively, legislating a parental leave act, which applies to working parents. Further, the jurisdictional limits and the conciliation and arbitration procedures of administrative bodies empowered to settle pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> related disputes, must be improved. The second recommendation involves pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> entitlements negotiated by trade unions in collective agreements. Management prerogatives which impact on pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> must be limited in respect of collective bargaining and women’s low membership rates in trade unions must be addressed, to better address pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> workplace issues. In addition, the Industrial Court must exercise its role and powers in a more consistent and accommodative manner when dealing with pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity</b> related matters in collective agreements. The third recommendation refers to the vital need for judicial recognition and adoption of international developments with respect to pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>maternity,</b> which have led to new understandings of equality and sex discrimination...|$|R
