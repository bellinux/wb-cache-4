40|$|The summertime {{atmospheric}} {{boundary layer}} over the South Pole {{has recently been}} shown to be highly oxidizing, with greater concentrations of NO and OH than previously expected. The source of NO has been attributed to photolysis of nitrate impurities in the snowpack, with elevated OH from the reaction NO + HO 2. However, the Antarctic troposphere is not currently in a “natural” state, being subject nowadays to greatly increased incidences of ultraviolet (UV) radiation each spring. Here we analyze the long-term record of surface ozone at the South Pole (1975 – 2001), to look for evidence of a changing oxidation potential. Daily averaged surface ozone concentrations during spring and early summer now regularly exceed the maximum concentration of the previous winter, while in the 1970 s and 1980 s this was not the case. This suggests that the proposed <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> source is greater nowadays than before. Such a feature is consistent with increases in UV radiation accompanying the <b>springtime</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b> Model calculations show that the rate of nitrate photolysis in the South Pole snowpack has increased significantly since the onset of the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole,</b> such that production of NO 2 in November has increased by 43 % between the late 1960 s and the late 1990 s.

40|$|In 1985, {{there was}} a report of a large, sudden, and unanticipated {{decrease}} in the abundance of springtime Antarctic ozone over the last decade. By 1987, ozone decreases of more than 50 percent in the total column, and 95 percent locally between 15 and 20 km, had been observed. The scientific community quickly rose to the challenge of explaining this remarkable discovery; theoreticians soon developed a series of chemical and dynamical hypotheses to explain the ozone loss. Three basic theories were proposed to explain the <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b> (1) The ozone hole is caused by the increasing atmospheric loadings of manmade chemicals containing chlorine (chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) and bromine (halons)). These chemicals efficiently destroy ozone in the lower stratosphere in the Antarctic because of the special geophysical conditions, of an isolated air mass (polar vortex) with very cold temperatures, that exist there. (2) The circulation of the atmosphere in spring has changed from being predominantly downward over Antarctica to upward. This would mean that ozone poor air from the troposphere, instead of ozone rich air from the upper stratosphere, would be transported into the lower Antarctic stratosphere. (3) The abundance of the oxides of nitrogen in the lower Antarctic stratosphere is periodically enhanced by solar activity. Nitrogen oxides are produced in the upper mesosphere and thermosphere and then transported downward into the lower stratosphere in Antarctica, resulting in the chemical destruction of ozone. The climatology and trends of ozone, temperature, and polar stratospheric clouds are discussed. Also, the transport and chemical theories for the Antarctic ozone hole are presented...|$|E
40|$|Lu's "cosmic-ray-driven electron-induced {{reaction}} (CRE) theory" {{is based}} on the assumption that the CRE reaction of halogenated molecules (e. g., chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCl, ClONO 2) adsorbed or trapped in polar stratospheric clouds in the winter polar stratosphere is the key step in forming photoactive halogen species that are the cause of the <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b> This theory has been extended to a warming theory of halogenated molecules for climate change. In this comment, we discuss the chemical and physical foundations of these theories and the conclusions derived from the theories. First, it is unclear whether the loss rates of halogenated molecules induced by dissociative electron attachment (DEA) observed in the laboratory can also be interpreted as atmospheric loss rates, but even if this were the case, the impact of DEA-induced reactions on polar chlorine activation and ozone loss in the stratosphere is limited. Second, we falsify several conclusions that are reported on the basis of the CRE theory: There is no polar ozone loss in darkness, there is no apparent 11 -year periodicity in polar total ozone measurements, the age of air in the polar lower stratosphere is much older than 1 – 2 years, and the reported detection of a pronounced recovery (by about 20 – 25 %) in Antarctic total ozone measurements by the year 2010 is in error. There are also conclusions about the future development of sea ice and global sea level which are fundamentally flawed because Archimedes' principle is neglected. Many elements of the CRE theory are based solely on correlations between certain datasets which are no substitute for providing physical and chemical mechanisms causing a particular behavior noticeable in observations. In summary, the CRE theory cannot be considered as an independent, alternative mechanism for polar stratospheric ozone loss and the conclusions on recent and future surface temperature and global sea level change do not have a physical basis...|$|E
40|$|Polar stratospheric clouds (PSC's) provide {{surfaces}} for heterogeneous processes {{which can}} dramatically alter the normal partitioning of odd nitrogen and chlorine {{families in the}} winter polar stratospheres, setting up conditions for significant ozone depletion as manifested in the <b>springtime</b> Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b> The spatial and temporal distribution of PSC's is important for parameterizing PSC occurrence in multidimensional photochemical models whose use is essential for fully understanding observed Antarctic ozone losses {{as well as for}} accessing the possibility of a similar phemonenon occurring in the future in the Arctic. The Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement (SAM) 2 sensor, a single-channel (1 mu m) photometer launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite in October 1978, provided a unique database to establish the climatology of PSC's. Poole and Pitts (1994) used the record of high-latitude aerosol extinction obtained by SAM II from 1979 - 1989 to establish the climatology of PSC occurrences in the Arctic and Antarctic.

During late September and early October the region of extremely low ozone values was centered on the geographical pole between 85 deg S and 90 deg S. The geographical extent of the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> region, the area within the 220 -DU contour, reached a maximum {{during the first week}} in October at a near-circular area covering 24 x 10 (exp 6) sq km reaching to the southern tip of South America.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a sensitivity analysis of multivariate regressions of recent <b>springtime</b> Antarctic vortex <b>ozone</b> trends using a "big data" ensemble approach. Our {{results indicate that}} the poleward heat flux (Eliassen–Palm flux) and the effective chlorine loading respectively explain most of the short-term and long-term variability in different Antarctic <b>springtime</b> total <b>ozone</b> records. The inclusion in the regression of stratospheric volcanic aerosols, solar variability and the quasi-biennial oscillation is shown to increase rather than decrease the overall uncertainty in the attribution of Antarctic <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> because of large uncertainties in their respective records. Calculating the trend significance for the ozone record from the late 1990 s onwards solely based on the fit of the effective chlorine loading is not recommended, as this does not take fit residuals into account, resulting in too narrow uncertainty intervals, while the fixed temporal change of the effective chlorine loading does not allow for any flexibility in the trends. When taking fit residuals into account in a piecewise linear trend fit, we find that approximately 30 – 60 % of the regressions in the full ensemble result in a statistically significant positive <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> trend over Antarctica from the late 1990 s onwards. Analysis of choices and uncertainties in time series show that, depending on choices in time series and parameters, the fraction of statistically significant trends in parts of the ensemble can range from negligible to a complete 100 % significance. We also find that, consistent with expectations, the number of statistically significant trends increases with increasing record length. Although our {{results indicate that the}} use multivariate regressions is a valid approach for assessing the state of Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> recovery, and it can be expected that results will move towards more confidence in recovery with increasing record length, uncertainties in choices currently do not yet support formal identification of recovery of the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole...</b>|$|R

CMAQ/REAS generally reproduced the observed interannual variability of <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan, showing year-to-year variations larger than the annual rate of increase of the long-term trend. We then analyzed {{the influence of the}} interannual variation of meteorology in simulated results by using the fixed emissions for 2000 and meteorological fields for each year. As a reference parameter, we calculated the area-weighted surface pressure anomaly over the Pacific Ocean east of Japan. When the anomaly has a large negative value, polluted air masses from continental Asia tend to be transported directly to Japan by westerly winds. In contrast, when the anomaly has a large positive value, influence of the outflow from continental Asia tends to be small because the westerly components of wind fields around Japan are comparatively weak. Instead, southerly winds are relatively strong and transport clean air masses from the Pacific Ocean to Japan. Consequently, <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan is higher (lower) than in ordinary years when the anomaly has a large negative (positive) value. In general, the interannual variation of <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan is sensitive to the outflow from continental Asia. We also found some correlation between <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, indicating that higher and lower <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan are related to La Niña and El Niño, respectively.

A coupled chemistry-microphysics model is used to show that widespread distribution of volcanic aerosols in 2000 could have caused severe <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion in the Arctic stratosphere.

40|$|The <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> changes {{considerably}} from {{one year to}} the next. It varies between conditions in which <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> is strongly depleted to others in which ozone is only weakly depleted. Those changes are shown to closely track anomalous planetary wave forcing of the residual circulation. The strong coherence with planetary wave forcing is consistent with similar coherence of springtime temperature, which modulates Polar Stratospheric Cloud (PSC). By controlling the lifetime of PSC, anomalous wave forcing determines the net activation of chlorine and bromine and, hence, <b>springtime</b> depletion of <b>ozone</b> during individual years. The strong coherence with planetary wave forcing affords long-range predictability. It supports a seasonal forecast of springtime depletion, which, through the ozone mass deficit, perturbs ozone across much of the Southern Hemisphere during subsequent months of summer. Conditioned upon wintertime wave structure, a hindcast of springtime depletion faithfully predicts the anomalous ozone observed. A reliable forecast of tropospheric planetary waves would thus enable springtime depletion to be predicted. The current evolution of Antarctic ozone is dominated by dynamically-induced changes. Representing its climate variability, those large changes obscure the more gradual evolution of springtime depletion, like that associated with the decline of chlorine. The strong dependence on planetary wave forcing, however, enables dynamically-induced changes of ozone to be identified accurately. Removing them unmasks the secular variation of Antarctic ozone, the part coherent over a decade and longer. Independent of dynamically-induced changes, that component discriminates to changes associated with stratospheric composition. It reveals a gradual but systematic rebound over the last decade. The upward trend is shown to be robust, significant at the 99. 5 % level. Uncertainty in this trend is thus small enough to make the probability of it arising through chance alignment of error less than 0. 5 %. The discriminated component mirrors the decline of effective stratospheric chlorine, representing a gradual return of <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> toward its level in 1980 of 10 - 15 %. It enables Antarctic ozone to be tracked relative to changes of chlorine, CO₂, and other features of climate more reliably than is otherwise possible. 11 page(s...|$|R

Comparisons between IASI and ozone sonde measurements were also found to be in good agreement with the percentage difference between both ozone profile measurements being less than ± 30 % over the altitude range of 0 – 40 km. The vertical structure of the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> is in particular captured remarkably good by IASI...|$|R
