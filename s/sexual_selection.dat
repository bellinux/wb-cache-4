5|$|Finally, {{selection}} can {{be classified}} according to the resource being competed for. <b>Sexual</b> <b>selection</b> results from competition for mates. <b>Sexual</b> <b>selection</b> typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. Ecological selection is natural selection via any means other than <b>sexual</b> <b>selection,</b> such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case <b>sexual</b> <b>selection</b> is considered a separate mechanism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>selection</b> {{may have}} played a role in the {{diversification}} of skin color and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. <b>Sexual</b> <b>selection</b> is influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. <b>Sexual</b> <b>selection</b> increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in <b>sexual</b> <b>selection,</b> the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that <b>sexual</b> <b>selection</b> is not a valid explanation.|$|E
5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so <b>sexual</b> <b>selection</b> could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. <b>Sexual</b> <b>selection</b> {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E

40|$|In many taxa, {{the left}} and right testes often differ in size. The {{compensation}} hypothesis states that one testis of the pair serves as a ‘back-up’ for any reduced function in the other and provides a mechanism to explain intraspecific variation in degree and direction of gonad asymmetry. Although testis asymmetry is common in birds, evidence for natural testis compensation is unknown. Using a novel quantitative approach that can be applied to any bilateral organ or structure, we show that testis compensation occurs naturally in birds and can be complete when one testis fails to develop. Owing to a recurrent risk of testis impairment and an evolutionary trade-off between natural and <b>sexual</b> <b>selections</b> acting on the arrangement of internal organs in species with abdominal and/or seasonal testes, compensation adds an important, but neglected, dimension to measures of male reproductive investment...|$|R

40|$|Few {{systematic}} {{studies have}} examined differences in women’s behaviour across the entire menstrual cycle. Previous research indicates that women’s sexual motivation and mating behaviour increases near ovulation, as well as <b>sexual</b> desire and <b>selection</b> of provocative clothing. We investigated whether self-perception varies across the menstrual cycle, i. e., whether women consider themselves to be more attractive near ovulation. As a hypothesized by-product of increased desire and a reflection of short-term <b>sexual</b> strategy <b>selection,</b> we tested changes in clothing style, use of cosmetics, and purchasing behaviour across the menstrual cycle. We adopted the daily report method of estimated fertility (Haselton & Gangestad, 2006; Schwarz & Hassebrauck, 2008) over 35 days with 25 College age women who were not taking any kind of hormonal contraceptives. Women reported feeling more attractive and desirable, increased sexual interest and appearance related styling at the days near ovulation (i. e., when conception likelihood was high) than on the other days of the menstrual cycle. However, {{no significant differences between}} high and low fertile phases were found for purchasing behaviour. We discuss our results with reference to the evolutionary psychology of female fertility and mating related behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 15 % of all {{arthropods}} reproduce through haplodiploidy. Yet it {{is unclear}} how this mode of reproduction affects other aspects of reproductive ecology. In this review we outline predictions on how haplodiploidy might affect mating system evolution, the evolution of traits under sexual or <b>sexual</b> antagonistic <b>selection,</b> sex allocation decisions and the evolution of parental care. We also give an overview of the phylogenetic distribution of haplodiploidy. Finally, we discuss how comparisons between different types of haplodiploidy (arrhenotoky, PGE with haploid vs somatically diploid males) might help to discriminate between the effects of virgin birth, haploid gene expression and those of haploid gene transmission...|$|R
5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is <b>sexual</b> <b>selection,</b> which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through <b>sexual</b> <b>selection</b> are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E
5|$|Frank Evers Beddard's 1892 book, Animal Coloration, {{acknowledged}} that natural selection existed but examined {{its application to}} camouflage, mimicry and <b>sexual</b> <b>selection</b> very critically. The book was in turn roundly criticised by Poulton.|$|E

40|$|Variants of the melanocortin- 1 {{receptor}} (MC 1 R) gene {{result in}} abrupt, naturally selected colour morphs. These genetic variants may differentially affect sexual dimorphism if one morph is naturally {{selected in the}} two sexes but another morph is naturally or sexually selected only {{in one of the}} two sexes (e. g. to confer camouflage in reproductive females or confer mating advantage in males). Therefore, the balance between natural and <b>sexual</b> <b>selections</b> can differ between MC 1 R variants, as suggest studies showing interspecific correlations between sexual dimorphism and the rate of nonsynonymous vs. synonymous amino acid substitutions at the MC 1 R. Surprisingly, how MC 1 R is related to within-species sexual dimorphism, and thereby to sex-specific selection, has not yet been investigated. We tackled this issue in the barn owl (Tyto alba), a species showing pronounced variation in the degree of reddish pheomelanin-based coloration and in the number and size of black feather spots. We found that a valine (V) -to-isoleucine (I) substitution at position 126 explains up to 30 % of the variation in the three melanin-based colour traits and in feather melanin content. Interestingly, MC 1 R genotypes also differed in the degree of sexual colour dimorphism, with individuals homozygous for the II MC 1 R variant being 2 times redder and 2. 5 times less sexually dimorphic than homozygous individuals for the VV MC 1 R variant. These findings support that MC 1 R interacts with the expression of sexual dimorphism and suggest that a gene with major phenotypic effects and weakly influenced by variation in body condition can participate in sex-specific selection processes...|$|R
25|$|Mutations {{can have}} many {{different}} effects upon an organism.

50|$|Unlike {{most other}} species of Hymenoptera, male A. manicatum are larger than females in size, {{displays}} male-biased <b>sexual</b> dimorphism.

Although it does not tear other males apart, the abdominal armature of a male A. manicatum may have been developed due to territorial aggression, rather than for mating purposes.

40|$|Since Charles Darwin's initial {{observations}} and hypotheses, {{the evolution of}} elaborate male coloration in sexually dichromatic species {{has been the subject}} of great interest. Of particular recent interest is how <b>sexual</b> and ecological <b>selection</b> interact to shape variation in male coloration between closely-related species. Using darters (Percidae: Etheostomatinae), a group of fishes that vary in male coloration as a model system, my goal is to determine how <b>sexual</b> and ecological <b>selection</b> interact to shape variation in male coloration between as well as within species lineages. In Chapter 1, I used reflectance spectrophotometry to examine correlations between spectral properties of orange and blue pigmentation in the rainbow darter, Etheostoma caeruleum, with parasite load and observed a correlation between the chroma of orange bars with parasite counts. In Chapter 2, I quantified color preferences in the darter genus Etheostoma to determine if the strengths of attraction to different colors coincided with variation in male coloration between species. The females of most achromatic species exhibited no significant color preferences, while chromatic species varied in preferences, with a positive association between the presence of red or orange on the flanks and preference for red detected across all species. In Chapter 3 I utilized phylogenetic comparative approaches and a laboratory experiment of predator color preferences to quantify the role of ecological variables in shaping variation in male coloration in darters. Compared to achromatic species, chromatic darters tend to inhabit environments where predation risk would be lower; specifically, shallower, faster-flowing upland streams with a lower number of overlapping predatory species. Additionally, a common darter predator, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), exhibited significant preferences for red stimuli in a color choice experiment. Finally, in Chapter 4 I investigated color and size correlations, as well as male and female preferences for different sized and colored mates, in the Roanoke darter, Percina roanoka. Using digital photography I found correlations between size and color, but no preferences for larger or more colorful mates were observed in either sex. The results of this dissertation suggest that <b>sexual</b> and ecological <b>selection</b> do interact to shape color variation between darter species...|$|R
30|$|Natural {{selection}} {{refers to}} adaptations that emerge {{in response to}} pressures from the physical environment {{such as the ability}} to walk upright as a physical adaptation to a savannah lifestyle. Yet, as a group living species, many human traits are likely {{to be the result of}} selection pressures in the social environment—the competition and cooperation with other humans—and these may be particularly relevant for management scholars. Social selection includes psychological mechanisms that make individuals better coalition partners and mechanisms to compete for and acquire sexual mates. The latter is called <b>sexual</b> selection—after natural <b>selection,</b> the second pillar of Darwin’s theory.|$|R
40|$|Geographic {{patterns}} of phenotypic and genetic differentiation among populations provide critical insight {{for understanding the}} processes that underlie the origin and maintenance of biological diversity. Fully concordant phylogeographic patterns among co-distributed taxa are an indication that landscape features promote lineage diversification. The dynamics of natural populations, however, are often more complex and organisms respond to common historical processes in different ways. I quantified variation in two co-distributed and wide-ranging Neotropical frogs, Agalychnis callidryas and Dendropsophus ebraccatus that share many ecological traits, yet differ in the geographic distribution of color pattern polymorphisms. Specifically, I compared divergence patterns across multiple populations of each species to determine whether: 1) spatial {{patterns of}} phenotypic and genetic diversity were congruent; 2) the complex biogeographic history of the Central American Isthmus {{has resulted in a}} similar evolutionary history of vicariance and dispersal; 3) landscape features limited gene flow; 4) gene flow patterns explained the geographic distribution of phenotypic diversity. I compared historical (mitochondrial DNA) and contemporary (nuclear DNA) gene flow to patterns of phenotypic differentiation. I determined cases where gene flow processes alone could not explain the patterns of phenotypic diversity, implying that <b>selection</b> (<b>sexual</b> and/or natural <b>selection)</b> has played a role in diversification. My results indicated that Agalychnis callidryas and D. ebraccatus have differences in their biogeographic history, population genetic structure and dispersal biology; therefore color pattern and genetic differentiation have evolved due to independent mechanisms in each taxon...|$|R

5|$|Darwin {{explained}} such male-female {{differences in}} {{his theory of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>selection</b> in his book The Descent of Man. Once the females begin to select males according to any particular characteristic, such as a long tail or a coloured crest, that characteristic is emphasized {{more and more in}} the males. Eventually all the males will have the characteristics that the females are sexually selecting for, as only those males can reproduce. This mechanism is powerful enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to the males in other ways. For example, some male birds of paradise have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight, while their brilliant colours may make the males more vulnerable to predators. In the extreme, <b>sexual</b> <b>selection</b> may drive species to extinction, as has been argued for the enormous horns of the male Irish elk, which may have made it difficult for mature males to move and feed.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate sexual {{displays}} and posturing are {{encountered in the}} behavioural ecology of animals. The birds-of-paradise, for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during courtship.

40|$|The {{question}} of how genetic variation translates into organismal diversity has puzzled biologists for decades. Despite recent advances in evolutionary and developmental genetics, the mechanisms that underlie adaptation, diversification and evolutionary innovation remain largely unknown. The exceptionally diverse species flocks of cichlid fishes are textbook examples of adaptive radiation and explosive speciation and emerge as powerful model systems to study the genetic basis of animal diversification. East Africa's hundreds of endemic cichlid species are akin to a natural mutagenesis screen and differ greatly not only in ecologically relevant (hence naturally selected) characters such as mouth morphology and body shape, but also in sexually selected traits such as coloration. One {{of the most fascinating}} aspects of cichlid evolution is the frequent occurrence of evolutionary parallelisms, which has led to the question whether selection alone is sufficient to produce these parallel morphologies, or whether a developmental or genetic bias has influenced the direction of diversification. Here, I review fitness-relevant traits that could be responsible for the cichlids' evolutionary success and assess whether these were shaped by <b>sexual</b> or natural <b>selection.</b> I then focus on the interaction and the relative importance of <b>sexual</b> vs. natural <b>selection</b> in cichlid evolution. Finally, I discuss what is currently known about the genes underlying the morphogenesis of adaptively relevant traits and highlight the importance of the forthcoming cichlid genomes in the quest of the genetic basis of diversification in this group...|$|R

Intrasexual selection is when members of the same sex compete with each other over a potential mate. Intrasexual competition between women is the behaviour that females engage in to secure a potential mate. Such behaviour might include self-promotion tactics and competitor derogation (direct and indirect forms of aggression) towards other females. Variables that influence female intrasexual competition include: genetic quality of males, ovarian hormones and hormonal variations and interpersonal dynamics.|$|R
