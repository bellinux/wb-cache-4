500|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September 15, Hendrix was asked by his friend Eric Burdon, formerly of the Animals, {{if he wanted to}} participate in a jam session at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club with Burdon's newly formed band, War. Hendrix accepted, but {{when he arrived at the}} club that evening, he was not allowed to play due to his apparently drug-related disorientation. Burdon commented: [...] "Jimi came down and was well out of it. He... was wobbling too much to play, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him to come back the following night." [...] Hendrix returned the next night and presented a healthier appearance. The crowd was enthusiastic and impressed by his performance despite his uncharacteristically subdued guitar playing when he sat in with War on [...] "Tobacco Road" [...] and [...] "Mother Earth". This was the last time Hendrix played guitar in public.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Memphis {{city councilman}} E. C. Jones awarded Edwards and Farley with a {{certificate}} [...] "in appreciation of outstanding {{contributions to the}} community". Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones, who had previously appeared on The Political Cesspool. According to The Commercial Appeal, Jones had not listened to the show before the incident, and was unaware of its ideology. After a reporter informed him of the program's agenda, Jones initially refused to apologize. However, after another reporter confronted him with more details about the show's ideology, he changed his view, saying that he probably would not appear again. Carol Chumney, {{another member of the}} Memphis City Council, was also invited to appear on The Political Cesspool, but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show; Chumney said, [...] "what I heard was about advocating for prostitution... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> them I had other commitments." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about you. People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bloomberg is {{in favor}} of {{providing}} tax breaks to big corporations {{for the good of the}} whole community. As mayor, Bloomberg lobbied the CEO of Goldman Sachs to establish its headquarters across from Ground Zero by promising $1.65 billion in tax breaks. Regarding this deal, Bloomberg stated, [...] "This [...] is where the best want to live and work. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him , 'We can help with minimizing taxes. Minimizing your rent. Improving security. But in the end, this is about people.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, after {{pulling the}} band {{off the road}} mid-tour, Ward said he needed to re-group. [...] "I walked {{out in the middle}} of a tour.... I needed to get away from {{everything}} and everyone. I wasn't enjoying myself at all, and I didn't feel my life or the band was where I wanted it to be... I needed to step back and reassess everything." [...] For two months, he retreated to his home without speaking to anyone in his professional life. In an article with PE.com, Ward said, [...] "When I left, I honestly didn't know if I was going to continue the band or not, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> everyone to pursue whatever they wanted,". During that time, Hinojos left to join The Mars Volta as their new secondary guitarist and sound manipulator, filling the void left by Jeremy Ward's death. Hinojos was replaced by Keeley Davis.|$|E

2500|$|From a New York Times {{interview}} in 1942: [...] "When the war started... {{felt that it}} was up to me to do something, and the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." [...] Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering [...] "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he [...] "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), [...] "the group his letter to Early had helped create".|$|E
2500|$|With Presley's {{explosion}} in popularity in 1956, pressure {{was put on}} Jones to cut a few rockabilly sides and he reluctantly agreed. [...] His heart was never in it, however, and he quickly regretted the decision; in his autobiography he joked, [...] "During the years, when I've encountered those records, I've used them for Frisbees." [...] He explained to Billboard in 2006: [...] "I was desperate. [...] When you're hungry, a poor man with {{a house full of}} kids, you're gonna do some things you ordinarily wouldn't do. [...] I said, 'Well, hell, I'll try anything once.' [...] I tried 'Dadgum It How Come It' and 'Rock It', a bunch of shit. [...] I didn't want my name on the rock and roll thing, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> them to put Thumper Jones on it and if it did something, good, if it didn't, hell, I didn't want to be shamed with it." [...] Jones went on to say he unsuccessfully attempted to buy all the masters to keep the cuts from surfacing later, which they did.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the success}} of his elder brother's fledgling {{television}} commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), that subsequently diverted his attention to film. His brother Ridley said, [...] "Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, 'Don't go to the BBC, come to me first.' I knew that he had a fondness for cars, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him, 'Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari.' And he did!" [...] Scott said, [...] "I was finishing eight years at art school, and Ridley had opened Ridley Scott Associates and said, 'Come and make commercials and make some money' because I owed money left and right and centre." [...] He directed many television commercials for RSA while also overseeing the company's operation while his brother was developing his feature film career. [...] "My goal was to make films but I got sidetracked into commercials and then I took off. I had 15 years , and it was a blast. We were very prolific, and that was our training ground. You'd shoot 100 days in a year, then we gravitated from that to film," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|Describing the {{composition}} of [...] "Oh Yeah", the album's best known track, Blank said, [...] "First I did the music and then I invited Dieter to sing along, and {{he came up with}} some lines which I thought, 'no Dieter, it's too complicated, we don't need that many lyrics'. I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And then he said, 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also. And also I wanted to install lots of human noises, all kind of phonetic rhythms with my mouth; you hear lots of noises in the background which are done with my mouth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about her}} {{relationship}} with Prince {{in an interview with}} Norwegian station NRK in November 2014 she said, [...] "I did meet him a couple of times. [...] We didn’t get on at all. [...] In fact we had a punch-up." [...] She continued: [...] "He summoned me to his house after 'Nothing Compares 2U'. I made it without him. [...] I’d never met him. [...] He summoned me to his house – and it’s foolish to do this to an Irish woman – he said he didn’t like me saying bad words in interviews. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him to fuck off....He got quite violent. I had to escape out of his house at 5 in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine." [...] She told a similar story to an interviewer from Hot Press in December 1990. Prince said the events she described never took place, replying to the allegations in his song [...] "Days of Wild", which deals with misogyny. In a 2004 interview with Graham Norton, O'Connor claimed that the story was [...] "much exaggerated by the press" [...] and referred to him as [...] "a sweet guy".|$|E
