The roof construction is made of steel tubes and covered by a fabric, whereas the panels are made of tin and openable upwards. The mounting of spare wheels is totally different {{at the rear of}} the truck in a perpendicular position. Their position creates more ease for the race crew when a wheel replacement is necessary.|$|E
40|$|International audienceArcs between carbon {{electrodes}} {{present some}} specific differences compared with metallic arcs. The arc voltage is higher, {{but does not}} attain a stable value displaying large fluctuations. Indeed, the arcs are produced by the direct sublimation of the electrodes, without passing through a molten phase. The arc production is also facilitated by both circuit breaking and electric field breakdown. In this paper, arcing has been examined under various conditions (voltage, current, and opening or fixed interelectrode gap) and particular {{attention has been given}} to the ability of the system to sustain the arc due to reignition. Smallangle X-ray scattering has been used to examine the formation of particles within carbon arcs and again the results are different from what is found with metallic electrodes, the particles being larger with rougher surfaces. The ultimate aim of this paper was to gain new knowledge concerning these arcs and their consequences for electrical <b>safety</b> (<b>arc</b> faults in wires) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceArc flash is a {{constant}} hazard when discussing industrial safety, however, {{little is known about}} the arc flash. Current safety standards require the use of the NFPA 70 E equation to establish safety limits for arc flash hazards. However, when compared to an empirically derived model, these safety limits are much too low to account for all working conditions. A comparison of these two methods will lead to the conclusion that arc flash safety distances must be increased. 1. Introduction. In industrial electrical <b>safety,</b> <b>arc</b> flash hazards can be some of the most disastrous and deadly accidents in the work place. An arc flash can reach temperatures of over 35000 degC and cause an explosion with a blast force of 2000 psi and an audible report of over 140 decibels. At a current of just 0. 5 Amps, an electrical shock, such as the shock generated from an arc flash, will stop the heart of an adult. [1]. Current arc flash safety codes require that the worker be at a distance that, if an arc flash were to occur, would only result in 2 nd degree burns. The current accepted standard for arc flash energy calculations is given by the NFPA 70 E equation, which was derived experimentally. However, an empirical approach to determining arc energy will be derived in this paper and the results compared and examined...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} model route {{planning}} problem for emergency logistics management taking both route timeliness and safety into account, a multiobjective mathematical model is proposed {{based on the}} theories of bounded rationality. The route safety is modeled {{as the product of}} <b>safety</b> through <b>arcs</b> included in the path. For solving this model, we convert the multiobjective optimization problem into its equivalent deterministic form. We take uncertainty of the weight coefficient for each objective function in actual multiobjective optimization into account. Finally, we develop an easy-to-implement heuristic in order to gain an efficient and feasible solution and its corresponding appropriate vector of weight coefficients quickly. Simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the models and algorithms presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Safely rcquircmcnis of safely {{critical}} technical {{systems are}} a demanding subset of requirements thai often ask for rigorous formal verification. Formal methods arc difficult and often not easily to understand. In this paper {{we present a}} more approachable semi-formal method using UML (Unified Modeling Language) and SysML (System Modeling Language) elements. An overview of verbally described safety requirements leads to the identification of typical properties of safety requirements. Excmplarily it is shown how <b>safety</b> requirements <b>arc</b> graphically represented {{with the help of}} UML specifications. Depending on the properties of a safety requirement its illustration in UML is more or less feasible. We present how some safety specifications can be verified in UML models of safety-critical embedded systems. Finally we summarize the presented method in a table of verbal safety requirements with their translation and possible verification in UML...|$|R

The HPM is a partially buried, earth-bermed, 2 -story, box-shaped structure. The {{most important factor in}} the improved performance of the HPM is the reduction in the Maximum Credible Event (MCE) to a detonation, explosion, or fire involving {{a small fraction of the}} total quantity of explosives stored in the HPM. This performance is achieved by utilizing nonpropagation walls (NPW) and pit covers to segregate the ordnance and to prevent sympathetic reaction to closed storage cells. The HPM reduces by at least 80 percent the land encumbered by Explosives <b>Safety</b> Quantity-Distance (ESQD) <b>arcs</b> designed to protect people and property from effects of an accidental explosion.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mastering}} 1 F (flat position-fillet) welds on carbon steel using a sequenced pattern of welding was examined. Participants (N = 71) {{were randomly assigned}} a specific sequence of welding between Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) and Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW). The hypothesis of teaching beginning welders the GMAW process before the SMAW process to improve the ability to master American Welding Society (AWS) welds was tested. A welding pretest was administered to determine any prior welding knowledge. Sixty minutes of welding instruction taught proper welding <b>safety,</b> machine set-up, <b>arc</b> length, travel speed, work angle, and correct bead formation. Two practice sessions of 60 minutes were given for participants {{to become familiar with}} each welding process, followed by two testing sessions of ten minutes. During the testing period, individuals were assessed on their ability to produce an AWS 1 F (flat position- fillet) lap weld in a given sequence. Welds were graded according to the AWS rubric for fillets with a total of four criteria categories based on the following criteria: a) presence of cracks or porosity, b) complete fusion, c) fillet leg size is specified minimum, and d) undercut - not to exceed 1 / 32 inches. The study indicate that students perform welds that meet AWS quality standards when using the GMAW process, however, the results were not statistically significant...|$|R
