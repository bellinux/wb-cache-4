He did {{correspond}} with Gregory Newton, and thus received tidings of the parish, of the church, of the horses,--and even of the foxes; but of the heir's matrimonial intentions he heard nothing. Gregory did write of his own visits to the metropolis, past and future, and Ralph knew that the young parson would again singe his wings in the flames that were burning at Popham Villa; but nothing was said of the heir. Through March and April that trouble respecting Polly Neefit was continued, and Gregory in his letter of course did not speak of the Neefits. At last May was come, and Ralph from Beamingham {{made up his mind}} that he also would go up to London. He had been hard at work during the last four months doing all those wonderfully attractive things with his new property which a man can do when he has money in his pocket,--knocking down hedges, planting young trees or preparing for the planting of them, buying <b>stock,</b> <b>building</b> or preparing to build sheds,--and the rest of it. There is hardly a pleasure in life equal to that of laying out money with a conviction that it will come back again. The conviction, alas, is so often ill founded,--but the pleasure is the same. In regard to the house itself he would do nothing, not even form a plan--as yet. It might be possible that some taste other than his own should be consulted.|$|E

5000|$|One key {{indicator}} {{of the success of}} production scheduling based on demand, pushing, is the ability of the demand-forecast to create such a push. Kanban, by contrast, is part of an approach where the [...] "pull" [...] comes from demand. Re-supply or production is determined according to the actual demand of the customer. In contexts where supply time is lengthy and demand is difficult to forecast, often, the best one can do is to respond quickly to observed demand. This situation is exactly what a kanban system accomplishes, in that it is used as a demand signal that immediately travels through the supply chain. This ensures that intermediate stock held in the supply chain are better managed, and are usually smaller. Where the supply response is not quick enough to meet actual demand fluctuations, thereby causing potential lost sales, <b>stock</b> <b>building</b> may be deemed more appropriate, and is achieved by placing more kanban in the system.|$|E

A previous geophysical survey of the site had identified a substantial D-shaped enclosure immediately to the west of the main area reduction for the new <b>stock</b> <b>building.</b> Other weak linear and discrete anomalies were also identified. Works comprised the removal of overburden to expose natural subsoil within the area of the new <b>stock</b> <b>building,</b> excavation of a service trench to the west and southwest of the new <b>stock</b> <b>building</b> and removal of topsoil along the route of a new farm access track through fields approximately 0. 5 km to the north of Colaton Raleigh. Parts of the D-shaped enclosure, identified by geophysical survey, was exposed in a service trench to the west of the main area and recorded as a substantial ditch c. 3. 5 m wide and 2 m deep, possibly dated to the Middle Bronze Age by pottery recovered from the fill. Three internal features were also exposed and recorded.

For accurately modelling the energy use and estimate potential contributions of energy-conservation technologies, classification of the <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> is crucial as it homogenizes the stock group.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to tackle}} a demand {{seasonality}} problem by building either work-in-process inventory or finished goods inventory before the peak season. A linear programming algorithm is developed {{to determine the}} optimal way for <b>stock</b> <b>building</b> {{in order to satisfy}} the demand with minimum inventory holding cost. An optimization software ILOG OPL Studio 5. 1 is used to solve the LP model to optimality within several seconds. The purpose of the analysis is three fold: (1) to identify the bottleneck processes where the capacities fall short of demand; (2) to generate the optimal <b>stock</b> <b>building</b> policy that minimizes the inventory holding cost; (3) to derive a cost-efficient executable production plan with consideration of the operating labor cost. The strategy outlined can be applied easily in actual manufacturing. This efficient and robust model can be used to obtain optimal <b>stock</b> <b>building</b> policy with various demand and capacity scenarios. It can be a useful tool for the company to develop <b>stock</b> <b>building</b> strategy for future demand with improved installed capacity.

Factors working against recovery included public expenditure cuts, and stagnating consumer spending as real incomes fell.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the development of}} a bottom-up <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> energy model (BuilS) for identification of the <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> renovation potential by considering energy performance of individual buildings through cross-linked data from various public available databases. The model enables integration of various EE and RES measures on the <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> to demonstrate long-term economic and environmental effects of different <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> refurbishment strategies. In the presented case study, the BuilS model was applied in the Kočevje city area and validated using the measured energy consumption of the buildings connected to the city district heating system. Three strategies for improving the <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> in Kočevje towards a more sustainable one are presented with their impact on energy use and CO 2 emission projections up to 2030. It is demonstrated that the BuilS bottom-up model enables the setting of a correct baseline regarding energy use of the existing <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> and that such a model is a powerful tool for design and validation of the <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> renovation strategies. It is also shown that the accuracy of the model depends on available information on local resources and local needs, therefore acceleration of the <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> monitoring on the level of each building and continually upgrading of databases with building renovation information is of the utmost importance...|$|R
