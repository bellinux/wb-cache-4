40|$|The {{presence}} of methane-bearing shallow sediments in the Adriatic Sea {{has been known}} since the fifties, but {{little is known about}} the benthic foraminiferal assemblages associated with them. One seep and two control cores were collected in the Bonaccia field (central Adriatic Sea) at a water depth of 80 m to investigate the possible influence of the release of gas from marine reservoirs on these foraminiferal assemblages. The seep core was drilled inside a pockmark in the vicinity of an active mud-volcano. Two control cores were collected in nearby areas unaffected by {{presence of}} methane. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages from the seep core are comparable to those from the seep-free cores and are composed of species common in the central Adriatic Sea. However, foraminiferal density in the seep-core is remarkably lower than in the control ones cores. Besides, calcitic foraminiferal tests from the seep core revealed unusual trends in stable carbon isotope composition. Even though not within the same range, a similar trend was observed throughout the seep core for the ä 13 C values of Gavelinopsis lobatulus, Cassidulina carinata, and Bulimina marinata. In particular, negative carbon isotope values were recorded for Gavelinopsis lobatulus at the top of the core where methane seeps were detected and deep inside the core sediments (50 cm). These findings seem to point to temporal variations in seep activity, proving that the ä 13 C values of foraminiferal tests reflect hydrocarbon release and may hence be used to reconstruct seep activity history.

50|$|Another {{sound card}} popular on the PC tracker scene was the Gravis Ultrasound, which {{continued}} the hardware mixing tradition, with 32 internal channels and onboard memory for sample storage. For a time, it offered unparalleled sound quality {{and became the}} choice of discerning tracker musicians. Understanding that the support of tracker music would benefit sales, Gravis gave away some 6000 GUS cards to participants. Coupled with excellent developer documentation, this gesture quickly prompted the GUS to become an integral component of many tracking programs and software. Inevitably, the balance was largely redressed {{with the introduction of}} the Sound Blaster AWE32 and its successors, which also featured on-board RAM and wavetable (or <b>sample</b> <b>table)</b> mixing.The responsibility for audio mixing passed from hardware to software (the main CPU), which gradually enabled the use of more and more channels. From the typical 4 MOD channels of the Amiga, the limit had moved to 7 with TFMX players and 8, first with Oktalyzer and later with the vastly more popular OctaMED (all Amiga programs), then 32 with ScreamTracker 3 and FastTracker 2 on the PC and on to 64 with Impulse Tracker (PC) and MED SoundStudio (Amiga and later PC).

40|$|We {{describe}} an efficient sequential Monte Carlo method for <b>sampling</b> multiway <b>tables</b> with given constraints, {{which can be}} used to approximate exact conditional inference on contingency tables. An essential feature of our new method is that it <b>samples</b> <b>table</b> entries sequentially according to an appropriate proposal distribution. The sequential sampling approach ”divides and conquers ” the difficult task of finding an appropriate proposal distribution for a multiway table with complex constraints. Computational commutative algebra is used to provide conditions that guarantee that our method has certain good properties. In particular, we establish a theory that relates sampling values at each step to properties of the associated toric ideal. The property of interval cell counts at each step is related to exponents on lead indeterminates of a lexicographic Gröbner basis. The approximation of integer programming by linear programming for sampling is related to initial terms of a toric ideal. We apply our method to a range of examples from social and medical sciences to demonstrate its efficiency in real problems...|$|R
