40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{liquidity}} regulation in jurisdictions with a limited supply of highquality liquid assets, using a model based on Bech and Keister (2013). We show how introducing a liquidity coverage ratio in such settings can have significant side effects, leading to a large liquidity premium and pushing the risk-free rate {{to the floor of the}} central bank’s interest rate corridor. Adding a committed liquidity facility allows the central bank mitigate these effects, regardless of whether it is implemented as a fixed-price <b>standing</b> <b>facility</b> or using a fixed-quantity auction format. By pricing committed liquidity appropriately, the central bank can control either the equilibrium liquidity premium or the quantity of liquid assets held by banks, but not both. We argue that the optimal pricing arrangement likely aims to balance these two considerations and will depend on local market conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we compare two {{mechanisms}} for implementing monetary policy: <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> and open market operations. We show that any equilibrium allocation {{that can be}} attained with open market operations can be replicated with <b>standing</b> <b>facilities,</b> but that the converse is not true. Furthermore, the set of equilibrium allocations that can be attained with <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> is weakly dominated in terms of welfare by the set of equilibrium allocations that can be attained with open market operations. However, if the central bank chooses the optimal policy for each mechanism, the allocations are equivalent.

40|$|Standing {{facilities}} {{are designed to}} place an upper bound on the rates at which financial institutions lend to one another overnight, reducing the volatility of the overnight interest rate, typically the rate targeted by central banks. However, improper design of the facility might decrease a bank’s incentive to participate actively in the interbank market. Thus, the mere availability of central bank provided credit may lead to its use being more than what would be expected based {{on the characteristics of}} the interbank market.; By contrast, however, banks may perceive a stigma from using such facilities, and thus borrow less than what one might expect, thereby reducing the facilities’ effectiveness at reducing interest rate volatility. We develop a model demonstrating these two alternative implications of a <b>standing</b> <b>facility.</b> Empirical predictions of the model are then tested using data from the Federal Reserve’s new primary credit facility and the US federal funds market. A comparison of data from before and after recent changes to the discount window suggests continued reluctance to borrow from the Fed. Discount window; Federal funds market (United States) ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} recognised that the operational {{framework for the}} monetary policy of the Eurosystem 1 has been functioning well since {{the launch of the}} euro in 1999. There has been little need to conduct fine-tuning operations, because of the averaging provision of the minimum reserve system {{and the quality of the}} Eurosystem’s liquidity forecasts. Also, credit institutions have had only limited recourse to the standing facilities, which shows that the money market has been working efficiently. And the small and fairly stable spread between the ECB’s fixed or minimum bid rate on its main refinancing operations and the short-term money market rates displays the ability of the ECB to influence short-term interest rates. Despite th{{is generally}} positive assessment, some possible measures have been examined with the aim of further improving the efficiency of the operational framework. There are three changes to be considered: (1) changing the timing of the reserve maintenance period, so that it would always start on the settlement day of the main refinancing operation following the Governing Council meeting at which the discussion of monetary policy is pre-scheduled, so that – as a rule – the implementation of changes to the <b>standing</b> <b>facility</b> rates would be aligned with the start of a new reserve maintenance period...|$|E

This should not fundamentally impair the ability of central banks to achieve their stabilization objectives, though it may require a new approach to the implementation of monetary policy.

40|$|Monetary {{operations}} typically aim {{to achieve}} monetary stability; but, under this broad umbrella, the monetary authorities {{need to decide}} which specific targets to aim at, and which policy instruments should be used. For most countries the final long-term monetary target of the central bank is low and stable inflation. For operational purposes, however, the day-to-day target is usually to achieve a particular level of interest rates, commercial banks’ reserves or the exchange rate. In market economies it is widely held {{that in the long}} run the most efficient instruments of monetary policy are those which best complement the workings of a market system. This is why indirect and market-based instruments are preferred to administrative controls. The latter may work for a while, but tend to distort markets and are open to evasion. This handbook examines the various different indirect instruments - i. reserve requirements, which have some of the characteristics of administrative controls; ii. open market operations; and iii. <b>standing</b> <b>facilities.</b> The last two types of instruments are market-based (voluntary) transactions. Open market operations are undertaken at the initiative of the central bank whereas <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> are used at the initiative of the commercial banks.

A certain amount of detail is given about current practice in the United Kingdom (UK) and in other countries, not to be prescriptive but to give some impression of the varying balance of instruments in the monetary policy framework of different countries. Since monetary operations are continuously evolving, some of the detail described herein as current practice may become out-of-date, but the general principles and analysis should remain valid.

40|$|Based on {{the survey}} of 12 SEACEN members, a number of common and general trends can be {{detected}} {{in relation to the}} operational framework of monetary policy in the SEACEN countries. Firstly, it was found that price stability is the most important objective of monetary policy and many central banks focus more on interest rates rather than bank reserves, due to the increased importance and flexibility of the price mechanism. Many central banks are increasingly concentrating more on the short-term interest rate, through which central banks can now have greater impact, given payment and settlement arrangements. Secondly, SEACEN countries have increased the market orientation of their instruments. In most cases, a higher proportion of reserves aew now supplied through operations in open markets, with the use of <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> limited to providing marginal accommodation or serving as an emergency finance. Consequently, the use of reserve requirements and <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> are now rather limited in many SEACEN countries. Thirdly, domestic repos are used in a major way for day-to-day management of liquidity, and the diversity and variety of instruments used in many SEACEN countries have grown tremendously. The structural VAR with the Fisher relation can provide timely estimates of expected inflation and the corresponding ex-ante real rates for the SEACEN countries, and can also give a proper measure of monetary policy stance. The estimates were done for the purpose of a comparative analysis. However, {{it should also be noted}} that applying this approach to each country needs further prior studies and investigation such as a time-series analysis on the interest rate movement to find out whether actual nominal interest rate is closely consistent with the Fisher relation. The practical use of the measures may also be determined on country basis by the monetary policy framework, and other indicators of information set currently used. ...|$|R
