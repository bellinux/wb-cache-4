40|$|Cobalt hexammine [Co(NH 3) 6 (3 +) ] is an {{efficient}} DNA complexing agent which significantly perturbs nucleic acid secondary structure. We have employed red excitation (647. 1 nm) from a krypton laser to obtain Raman spectra {{of the highly}} colored complexes formed between cobalt hexammine and crystals of the DNA oligomers, <b>d(5</b> BrCGAT <b>5</b> BrCG) and d(CGCGATCGCG), both of which incorporate out-of-alternation pyrimidine/purine sequences. The Co(NH 3) 6 (3 +) complex of <b>d(5</b> BrCGAT <b>5</b> BrCG) exhibits a typical Z-form Raman signature, similar to that reported previously for the alternating d(CGCGCG) sequence. Comparison of the Raman bands of <b>d(5</b> BrCGAT <b>5</b> BrCG) {{with those of other}} oligonucleotide and polynucleotide structures suggests that C 3 '-endo/syn and C 3 '-endo/anti thymidines may exhibit distinctive nucleoside conformation markers, and tentative assignments are proposed. The Raman markers for C 2 '-endo/anti adenosine in this Z-DNA are consistent with those reported previously for B-DNA crystals containing C 2 '-endo/anti dA. Raman bands of the cobalt hexammine complex of d(CGCGATCGCG) are those of B-DNA, but with significant differences from the previously characterized B-DNA dodecamer, d(CGCAAATTTGCG). The observed differences suggest an unusual deoxyguanosine conformer, possibly related to a previously characterized structural intermediate in the B [...] >Z transition. The present results show that crystallization of d(CGCGATCGCG) in the presence of cobalt hexammine is not alone sufficient to induce the left-handed Z-DNA conformation. This investigation represents the first application of off-resonance Raman spectroscopy for characterization of highly chromophoric DNA and illustrates the feasibility of the Raman method for investigating other structurally perturbed states of DNA-cobalt hexammine complexes...|$|R

The survey resulted in an assessment of four additional lines in the longer (4294. 61, 4886. 90, 4982. 59 and 5053. 28 angstrom) and two in the shorter wavelength range (2551. 35 and 2681. 42 angstrom).

The effect of the ground state level population as well as cascading from higher levels is included in the calculation of the relative line intensities and of the respective S/X B-values, the conversion factor for photon into particle fluxes.

40|$|International audiencePolycrystalline {{samples of}} Mn 1 -xCuxWO 4 (x ≤ 0. 5) have been {{prepared}} by a solid-state synthesis {{as well as from}} a citrate synthesis at moderate temperature (850 °C). The goal is to study changes in the structural, magnetic, and dielectric properties of magnetoelectric type-II multiferroic MnWO 4 caused by replacing Jahn-Teller-inactive Mn(2 +) (<b>d(5),</b> S = <b>5</b> / 2) ions with Jahn-Teller-active Cu(2 +) (d(9), S = 1 / 2) ions. Combination of techniques including scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray and neutron diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the polycrystalline samples with low copper content 0 ≤ x ≤ 0. 25 are solid solution that forms in the monoclinic P 2 /c space group. Rietveld analyses indicate that Cu atoms substitutes for Mn atoms at the Mn crystallographic site of the MnWO 4 structure and suggest random distributions of Jahn-Teller-distorted CuO 6 octahedra in the solid solution. Magnetic susceptibility reveals that only 5 % of Cu substitution suppresses the nonpolar collinear AF 1 antiferromagnetic structure observed in pure MnWO 4. Type-II multiferroicity survives a weak Cu substitution rate (x < 0. 15). Multiferroic transition temperature and Néel temperature increase as the amount of Cu increases. New trends in some of the magnetic properties and in dielectric behaviors are observed for x = 0. 20 and 0. 25. Careful analysis of the magnetic susceptibility reveals that the incorporation of Cu into MnWO 4 strengthens the overall antiferromagnetic interaction and reduces the magnetic frustration...|$|R

40|$|The {{transfer}} of alien genes to crop plants using chromosome engineering has been attempted infrequently in tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum). Here, we report a highly efficient approach for the {{transfer of}} two genes conferring resistance to stem rust race Pgt-TTKSK (Ug 99) from goatgrass (Aegilops speltoides) to tetraploid wheat. The durum line DAS 15, carrying the stem rust resistance gene Sr 47 derived from Ae. speltoides, was crossed, and backcrossed, to durum <b>5</b> <b>D(5</b> B) aneuploids to induce homeologous pairing. After a final cross to ‘Rusty’ durum, allosyndetic recombinants were recovered. The Ae. speltoides chromosomal segment carrying Sr 47 {{was found to have}} two stem rust resistance genes. One gene conditioning an infection type (IT) 2 was located in the same chromosomal region of 2 BS as Sr 39 and was assigned the temporary gene symbol SrAes 7 t. Based on ITs observed on a diverse set of rust races, SrAes 7 t may be the same as Sr 39. The second gene conditioned an IT 0; and was located on chromosome arm 2 BL. This gene retained the symbol Sr 47 because it had a different IT and map location from other stem rust resistance genes derived from Ae. speltoides. Allosyndetic recombinant lines carrying each gene on minimal alien chromosomal segments were identified as were molecular markers distinguishing each alien segment. This study demonstrated that chromosome engineering of Ae. speltoides segments is feasible in tetraploid wheat. The Sr 47 gene confers high-level and broad spectrum resistance to stem rust and should be very useful in efforts to control TTKSK...|$|R
