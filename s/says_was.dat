The king wants Jack to guide an {{expedition}} to the Fountain of Youth before King Ferdinand and the Spanish Navy can locate it. Jack's old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer in service to the British Navy after losing his leg and ship, the Black Pearl, which he <b>says</b> <b>was</b> sunk, is heading the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{animated}} in a stylized way, which Tartakovsky <b>says</b> <b>was</b> {{influenced by the}} Merrie Melodies cartoon The Dover Boys at Pimento University. Dexter's Laboratory, however, was staged in a cinematic way, rather than flat {{and close to the}} screen, to leave space and depth for the action and gags. Tartakovsky was also influenced by other Warner Bros. cartoons, Hanna-Barbera, Japanese mecha anime, and the UPA shorts.|$|E
50|$|Marie <b>Say</b> <b>was</b> born on August 25, 1857 in Verrières-le-Buisson near Paris.

Her father, Constant André Say, ran the family business, which sold sugar made from beetroot. Her uncle, Jean-Baptiste <b>Say,</b> <b>was</b> an economist and formulator of Say's law.|$|R

5|$|Alexander, the {{previous}} MacDonald leader, had made land grants to the eldest and youngest sons of Lachlan MacLean, grandson of Alexander's aunt. John Garbh (the youngest son) now obtained Rùm (possibly, Alexander had quitclaimed it to him); like Hugh's gains, Clan Ranald objected to this transfer. Traditional accounts claim that John Garbh purchased a quitclaim of Clan Ranald rights from their leader, Allan, {{by giving them}} a galley; though the galley looked in good quality, the interior (so the legend <b>says)</b> <b>was</b> rotten, hence explaining Clan Ranald's refusal to accept John Garbh's ownership of Rùm. John Garbh subsequently seized Allan, and held him prisoner on Coll for 9 months; presumably Allan was only released once he had agreed to acknowledge the exchange.|$|E
5|$|The Prince Consort's and Queen Victoria's {{rooms in}} the keep are named after their use during the royal visit of 1842, {{although}} their decoration today dates from the interwar period. The Dining Room, Drawing Room and Ante Room, which overlook the northern bastion, date from the 1730s, when the Duke of Dorset constructed them to form a private set of chambers. These rooms feature a range of pink and purple window glass, which tradition <b>says</b> <b>was</b> installed by the Earl of Liverpool to protect his wife's eyesight; recent analysis shows {{that some of the}} pink-tinted glass dates from the 1730s, and discoloured naturally over time, while other panes were intentionally purchased around 1800 in these hues, but probably as status symbols and not for any medical purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Whitepages was {{conceived}} by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard {{was searching for}} a friend's contact information and the phone company gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier to way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he <b>says</b> <b>was</b> all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job {{to focus on the}} website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Turner {{writes that}} the two most {{prominent}} opponents of military integration (brassage) were Colonel Jules Mutebusi, a Munyamulenge from South Kivu, and Laurent Nkunda, a Rwandaphone Tutsi who Turner <b>says</b> <b>was</b> allegedly from Rutshuru in North Kivu. In May–June 2004 Mutebusi led a revolt against his superiors from Kinshasa in South Kivu. Nkunda began his long series of revolts against central authority by helping Mutebusi in May–June 2004. In November 2004 a Rwandan government force entered North Kivu to attack the FDLR, and, it seems, reinforced and resupplied RCD-Goma (ANC) at the same time. Kabila despatched 10,000 government troops to the east in response, launching an attack which was called 'Operation Bima.' In {{the midst of this}} tension, Nkunda's men launched attacks in North Kivu in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} the whole {{population}} of Florence—men, women, and children—in reference to the years 1336 to 1338, {{was estimated to be}} 90,000 due to the amount of bread needed daily. Villani recorded an exact figure of 94,000 residents (which he <b>says</b> <b>was</b> very reliable data that included even the poor) in April 1347, a year before the Black Death. A black bean was deposited for every male child baptized and a white bean deposited for every female child baptized in the Florence Baptistry—from these baptisms the average annual birth rate was figured at 5,500 to 6,000. Villani pointed out that the newborn males often outnumbered the newborn females by 300 to 500 on each count. He noted that in his day the adult, male citizen population of the city was about 25,000 (those between the age of fifteen and seventy who could bear arms); 1,500 of these were noble and upper class citizens. Giovanni Villani stated that at all times there were about 1,500 foreigners, transients, and soldiers in the city.|$|E
5|$|What {{happened}} next is uncertain. Legend says that Vienne and Perez promised a mass would {{be said for}} the riders in a chapel 200m from the start, in the boulevard Maillot. This story is repeated by Pascal Sergent, the historian of the race, and by Pierre Chany, historian of the sport in general. Sergent goes as far as saying that Victor Breyer, who he <b>says</b> <b>was</b> there, said the service, scheduled for 4am, was cancelled because it was too early. Neither Chany nor Sergent mentions if the date of the race was subsequently changed, however the first Paris–Roubaix (according to Sergent) was held on 19 April 1896, whereas Easter Sunday in 1896 occurred two weeks earlier, on the 5 April.|$|E

5|$|Once {{satisfied}} with his reorganisation of Thessaly, Philip marched south to the pass of Thermopylae, the gateway to central Greece. He probably intended to follow up his victory over the Phocians by invading Phocis itself, a prospect which greatly alarmed the Athenians, since once he had passed Thermopylae, he could also march on Athens. The Athenians therefore dispatched a force to Thermopylae and occupied the pass; there is some debate as to whether other contingents may have joined the Athenians at Thermopylae. The Athenians were certainly there, since the Athenian orator Demosthenes celebrated the defence of the pass {{in one of his}} speeches. Cawkwell suggests that the Athenian force was the one that Diodorus <b>says</b> <b>was</b> dispatched under Nausicles consisting of 5000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and that they were joined by the remnants of the Phocians and the Pheraean mercenaries. However, Buckler argues that Diodorus never mentions Thermopylae, and the force under Nausicles was sent to help the Phocians the following year; instead, he believes that another Athenian force held the pass unassisted. Although it might have proved possible to force the pass, Philip did not attempt to do so, preferring not to risk a defeat after his great successes in Thessaly.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas Fowler (1869) {{states the}} paradox as follows: [...] "Epimenides the Cretan says, 'that all the Cretans are liars,' but Epimenides is himself a Cretan; {{therefore}} he is himself a liar. But if he be a liar, what he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> untrue, and consequently the Cretans are veracious; but Epimenides is a Cretan, and therefore what he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> true; <b>saying</b> the Cretans <b>are</b> liars, Epimenides is himself a liar, {{and what he}} <b>says</b> <b>is</b> untrue. Thus we may go on alternately proving that Epimenides and the Cretans are truthful and untruthful." ...|$|R
