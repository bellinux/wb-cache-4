40|$|The {{nucleation}} of dehydration {{figure has}} been observed under the optical microscope in dry air at elevated temperature. The star-like dehydration figures are produced preferentially at and around pockmarks, subboundaries and scratches. The <b>scratch</b> <b>furrow</b> and the microcracks in the neighbourhood of the scratch are most probable positions to be nuclei of the dehydration figures. It is {{pointed out that there}} are not merely high surface energy but also high strain energy in the positions to be nuclei of the dehydration figures...|$|E

His wound was but a slight <b>scratch,</b> which had <b>furrowed</b> the flesh across his temple. It had stopped bleeding, but the dried and clotted blood smeared his face and clothing. He had said no word since he {{had fallen into the}} hands of these Arabs, nor had they addressed him other than to issue a few brief commands to him when the horses had been reached.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mid-19th century}} {{was a period}} of {{significant}} debate within the geological community about the nature of markings found in northern New England similar to those found here. A common belief was that they were caused by drifting icebergs during the Flood of Noah, as recounted in the Bible. The first hypothesis involving a massive glacier was proposed in 1859 by John DeLaski, an amateur geologist from Rockland, Maine, which did not receive significant scientific press until 1864. That summer, Louis Agassiz, then a professor at Harvard, vacationed in Maine, and examined a variety of bedrock locations from the coast as far inland as Mount Katahdin. His 1867 paper, Glacial Phenomena in Maine, described his findings from this trip, and proposed that North America, like much of northern Europe, had been covered by ice sheets. He specifically mentioned the [...] "splendid polished surfaces" [...] found at Ellsworth Falls, [...] "with <b>scratches</b> and <b>furrows</b> pointing due north" [...] as one piece of evidence in support of his argument.|$|R
30|$|Despite its advantages, enamel {{reduction}} {{has attracted}} {{the concern of}} investigators, owing to enamel tissue removal. In operative dentistry, {{it is crucial to}} maintain contact points in the posterior teeth to allow for proper self-cleaning and avoid the retention of plaque, although in orthodontic treatment, the interdental tooth enamel is ground down therapeutically. Adequate polishing of the stripped teeth is essential for a good long-term prognosis, since <b>scratches</b> and <b>furrows</b> remaining on the enamel surface facilitate plaque accumulation and possibly caries development [11 - 13]. A number of researches have focused not only on the orthodontic aspects but also on the cariogenic and periodontal implications associated with this procedure since {{it has been shown that}} changes in enamel integrity may be considered as a predisposing factor for caries and periodontal disease [11, 12]. After grinding, the tooth surface seems to become rougher, with a significantly greater plaque accumulation capacity [3, 12, 14,]. Although the results of a recent systematic review [15] were inconclusive regarding enamel roughness after interdental stripping in vitro, the meta-analysis of the in vivo results did not find that interdental enamel reduction was a predisposing factor for caries development.|$|R
60|$|To {{find your}} Store again, {{you should have}} ascertained the {{distance}} and bearing, by compass, of the hole from some marked place--as a tree--about which you are sure not to be mistaken; or from {{the centre of the}} place where your fire was made, which is a mark that years will not entirely efface. If there be anything in the ground itself to indicate the position of the hole, you have made a clumsy cache. It is not a bad plan, after the things are buried, and before the tent is removed, to <b>scratch</b> a <b>furrow</b> a couple of inches deep, and three or four feet long, and picking up any bits of stick, reeds, or straw, that may be found at hand lying upon the ground, to place them end to end in it. These will be easy enough to find again by making a cross furrow, and when found will lead you straight above the depot. They would never excite suspicion, even if a native got hold of them; for they would appear to have been dropped or blown on the ground by chance, not seen and trampled in. Mr. Atkinson mentions an ingenious way by which the boundaries of valuable mining property are marked in the Ural, a modification of which might serve for indicating caches. A trench is dug and filled with charcoal beat small, and then covered over. The charcoal lasts for ever, and cannot be tampered with without leaving an unmistakable mark.|$|R
60|$|Preparations for a Storm.--Before a storm, dig a ditch {{as deep as}} you can {{round the}} outside of the tent, to divert the coming sheet of surface-water, and see that the ditch has a good out-fall. The ditch will also drain the floor of the tent, if the rain should soak in. Even a <b>furrow</b> <b>scratched</b> with a tent-peg, is better than no ditch at all. Fasten guy-ropes to the spike of the tent-pole; and be careful that the tent is not too much on the strain, else the further {{shrinking}} of the materials, {{under the influence of the}} wet, will certainly tear up the pegs. Earth, banked up round the bottom of the tent, will prevent gusts of wind from finding their way beneath. It is also a good plan to prepare a small hole near the foot of the tent-pole, with a stone firmly rammed into the bottom, into which the tent-pole may be shifted, as soon as the strain of the tent, under the influence of the wet, becomes dangerous to its safety.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Contact {{surface of}} {{nanoscale}} sliding friction represent some new {{features that are}} different from the macro scale sliding friction, which need to seek new analysis methods. Molecular dynamics simulation is an effective method to describe microscopic phenomena. Therefore, Molecular dynamics method was used to study mechanical behavior of contact surface of nanoscale sliding friction. A molecular dynamics model of hemisphere sphere sliding on rectangular solid plane was built. State change of the micro contact area and friction force variation in the process of sliding friction were observed and analyzed after solution and simulation. The results show that, at the beginning position of the sliding, with different contact depth, contact action region of hemisphere and plane generated the atoms displacement, re-arranged and close-packed accumulation is also different. The deeper the contact depth is, the greater the atoms close-packed accumulation is, and the greater the contact deformation is. In the process of sliding friction, the contact surface of the basal body has produced lattice destruction, surface upheaval and silicon atoms close-packed accumulation, and then formed <b>furrow</b> <b>scratches.</b> At the same time the silicon atoms of the hemisphere generated atomic migration obviously and adhered on the basal body surface. The top of the hemisphere was torn and peeled, which resulted in wear. The deeper contact depth is, the more loss of the material o...|$|R
60|$|Now for {{the drawing}} this second Figure[3] (which {{represents}} {{a part of}} the Edge about half a quarter of an inch long of a Razor well set) I so plac'd it between the Object-glass & the light, that there appear'd a reflection from the very Edge, represented by the white line abcdef. In which you may perceive it to be somewhat sharper then elsewhere about d, to be indented or pitted about b, to be broader and thicker about c, and unequal and rugged about e, and pretty even between ab and ef. Nor was that part of the Edge ghik so smooth as one would imagine so smooth bodies as a Hone and Oyl should leave it; for besides those multitudes of scratches, which appear to have raz'd the surface ghik, and to cross each other every way which are not half of them exprest in the Figure, there were several great and deep <b>scratches,</b> or <b>furrows,</b> such as gh and ik, which made the surface yet more rugged, caus'd perhaps by some small Dust casually falling on the Hone, or some harder or more flinty part of the Hone it self. The other part of the Razor ll, which is polish'd on a grinding-stone, appear'd much rougher then the other, looking almost like a plow'd field, with many parallels, ridges, and furrows, and a cloddy, as 'twere, or an uneven surface: nor shall we wonder at the roughnesses of those surfaces, since even in the most curious wrought Glasses for Microscopes, and other Optical uses, I have, when the Sun has shone well on them, discover'd their surface to be variously raz'd or scratched, and to consist of an infinite of small broken surfaces, which reflect the light of very various and differing colours. And indeed it seems impossible by Art to cut the surface of any hard and brittle body smooth, since Putte, or even the most curious Powder that can be made use of, to polish such a body, must consist of little hard rough particles, and each of them must cut its way, and consequently leave some kind of gutter or furrow behind it. And though Nature does seem to do it very readily in all kinds of fluid bodies, yet perhaps future observators may discover even these also rugged; it being very probable, as I elsewhere shew, that fluid bodies are made up of small solid particles variously and strongly mov'd, and may find reason to think there is scarce a surface in rerum natur√¢ perfectly smooth. The black spot mn, I ghess to be some small speck of rust, for that I have oft observ'd to be the manner of the working of Corrosive Juyces. To conclude, this Edge and piece of a Razor, if it had been really such as it appear'd through the Microscope, would scarcely have serv'd to cleave wood, much less to have cut off the hair of beards, unless it were after the manner that Lucian merrily relates Charon to have made use of, when with a Carpenters Axe he chop'd off the beard of a sage Philosopher, whose gravity he very cautiously fear'd would indanger the oversetting of his Wherry.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was carried}} out at the Life Testing Department of the SKF Engineering & Research Centre located in Nieuwegein (NL) and deals with roller bearings testing. The aims of the work are to study some early signs of micropitting damage on the rolling surfaces and {{to determine whether they}} can be detected by a condition monitoring system. First of all, the literature about rolling contact fatigue was reviewed, with a focus on micropitting damage. It was found that micropitted areas usually develop around geometric features like <b>furrows,</b> <b>scratches</b> or indentations. A previously tested roller bearing showing this kind of damage was selected and a failure analysis was done with the aid of microscopy. The characteristics of the micropitted areas were investigated, in terms of appearance and size. Moreover, two basic engineering models were implemented to evaluate the risk of micropitting and their applicability to bearings testing was investigated. An experimental activity {{was carried out}} to monitor the development of a micropitted spot, both in terms of size and effects on the vibration signal. The micropitted bearing was run under conventional operating conditions and periodically dismounted to see how the damage was proceeding. Its vibration signal was acquired with the condition monitoring system currently in use in the Life Testing Department and also with a pilot system developed in parallel with this dissertation, both of them implementing the enveloping technique. Enveloped vibration data were then processed looking for any evidence of this early damage. Finally, signals from more than 30 undamaged bearings were acquired to determine a baseline behavior to be compared with the micropitted bearing. On the basis of the results of this research, a growth rate for the micropitted spots was estimated and an initiation and development mechanism proposed. Both basic micropitting models were found representative of a widespread damage distribution, whereas local micropitting around geometric features can be simulated only with advanced models taking into account their exact shape. Finally, it was found that a time domain analysis of the enveloped vibration signal is not suitable for the detection of early signs of micropitting, mainly because those thought to be evidences of the damage were found in undamaged bearings as well...|$|R
