5|$|The {{precepts of}} Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with <b>sincere</b> and truthful dialogue. Force {{must be the}} last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its {{objective}} to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, <b>sincere</b> dialogue for peace must continue.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{considerable}} amount of scholarship on Jinnah which stems from Pakistan; according to Akbar S. Ahmed, it is not widely read outside the country and usually avoids even the slightest criticism of Jinnah. According to Ahmed, some books published about Jinnah outside Pakistan mention that he consumed alcohol, but this is omitted from books published inside Pakistan. Ahmed suggests that depicting the Quaid drinking would weaken Jinnah's Islamic identity, and by extension, Pakistan's. Some sources allege he gave up alcohol {{near the end of his}} life. Yahya Bakhtiar, who observed Jinnah from close quarters, concluded that Jinnah was a very <b>sincere,</b> deeply committed and dedicated Mussalman.|$|E
