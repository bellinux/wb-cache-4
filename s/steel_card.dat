50|$|After World War II, the Home-O-Nize Company was {{established}} in Muscatine, Iowa to provide returning veterans with jobs. Founded to produce steel kitchen cabinets, the company soon encountered {{the reality of the}} limited availability of steel. So the company began to make products for others. Finally a small amount of steel was secured and the company started manufacturing <b>steel</b> index <b>card</b> boxes. Soon after, larger cabinets began to be produced including filing cabinets. By designing to minimize the amount of steel, the product was an extremely cost-effective design and had huge commercial success. Home-O-Nize never did make kitchen cabinets and in 1961, the company name was changed to HON. Today, The HON Company, a division of HNI Corporation is the predominant North American manufacturer and marketer of filing cabinets.|$|R
