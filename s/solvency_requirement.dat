40|$|Abstract: A {{big concern}} of European {{insurance}} companies and pension funds which will be regulated {{under the guidance of}} Solvency II is that they will be forced to invest very conservatively {{in order to meet the}} <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement</b> of Solvency II. The analysis provided in this article shows that the insurer might sometimes be forced (by the regulator) to switch to a less risky strategy, but it is very temporary.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the capital structure of 350 Dutch insurers {{during the period}} 1995 - 2005.

40|$|Developed {{countries}} apply different security {{mechanisms in}} regulation to protect defined pension benefits: <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements,</b> a pension guarantee fund, and sponsor support. We test {{the performance of}} these mechanisms {{in terms of the}} protection offered to pension benefits in relation to the costs. For this, we calculate the expected log-return for the beneficiaries and the shortfall probability, i. e. the likelihood of the pension payment falling below the promised level. We show {{that it is possible to}} compare different pension security mechanisms using appropriate finance tools. Compared to a system based on <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements</b> alone, support by a pension guarantee fund or by the sponsor offers better downside protection for pension funds pursuing an aggressive investment policy.

40|$|The {{main reasons}} for giving {{insurance}} companies the option to apply internal models for calculating the <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement</b> within the Solvency II framework is to enhance better risk management and to allow a more accurate risk oriented capital requirement than the standard Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) would provide. The possibility to use internal models within Pillar I basically means freedom to calculate the <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement</b> using some other formulae and even principles than those given by the standard formula. In our view within Pillar I, contrary to Pillar II, {{there is a clear}} need both for insurance supervisors and for those developing internal models in practise to have a common guideline among EU member states on how to validate and approve internal models. The tentative advice from The Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) to the European Commission roughly follows the same approach. However, we believe that a broader scope of models and a more detailed approach to the validation will be needed for the final standard. This standard should give principles for the design of internal models and highlight areas that will be of greatest importance in the process of using internal models for calculating the SCR. This paper gives a brief background review of the Solvency II project, deals with different aspects on internal models within Pillar I, and finally illustrates a rather detailed guideline that could be included in the standard for approving internal models. The main focus is on life insurance, but several issues concern equally well non-life insurance...|$|E
40|$|Contrary to the {{prediction}} of standard portfolio diversification theory, many investors place a large fraction of their stock investment in a small number of stocks. We show that underdiversification may be a result of the <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement.</b> The key assumption is that investors must remain solvent after certain committed consumption at which the marginal utility is finite. We show that investors underdiversify when wealth is low and that even wealthy investors may underdiversify. In addition, variance and higher moments do not affect stock selection and a less diversified stock portfolio has a higher expected return, a higher volatility, a higher skewness, and maybe a lower Sharpe ratio. Underdiversification in equilibrium implies that idiosyncratic risks are priced. All of these theoretical predictions are consistent with empirical findings...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether insurers base their solvency margins on risk factors even when operating under a supervisory regime where minimum <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements</b> {{do not fully}} take such risk factors into account. To do this, we use a dataset of about 350 Dutch insurers from all major lines of business during the pre-Solvency II period 1995 - 2005. We find that the levels of insurers' actual solvency margins are related to their risk characteristics and not to regulatory <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements.</b> Consequently, {{the vast majority of}} insurers hold much more capital than required, i. e. non-risk based capital requirements generally are not binding. Requirements are found to affect solvency adjustment behaviour, though. More specifically, below-target capital ratios are raised most rapidly by those insurers whose targets are relatively close to the regulatory minimum. One implication from our results is that, because insurers already follow a risk-based approach, the transition to the new European regulatory framework, Solvency II, is likely to be smooth.

40|$|We develop {{portfolio}} optimization {{problems for}} a nonlife insurance company seeking {{to find the}} minimum capital required that simultaneously satisfies solvency and portfolio performance constraints. Motivated by standard insurance regulations, we consider solvency capital requirements based on three criteria: ruin probability, conditional Value-at-Risk, and expected policyholder deficit ratio. We propose a novel semiparametric formulation for each problem and explore the advantages of implementing this methodology over other potential approaches. When liabilities follow a Lognormal distribution, we provide sufficient conditions for convexity for each problem. Using different expected return on capital target levels, we construct efficient frontiers when portfolio assets are modeled with a special class of multivariate GARCH models. We find that the correlation between asset returns {{plays an important role}} in the behavior of the optimal capital required and the portfolio structure.

40|$|Many {{statutory}} <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements,</b> e. g. {{the system}} prescribed by the EU, {{do not take}} into account the distribution of the investments.

In this, only the margin depending on the company’s investments is dealt with and the margin for the insurance risk is not included. First, the paper describes the use of an asset liability simulation model for the calcula-tion for the solvency margin. Then some formulas are developed for approximating the simulation results. These formulas depend on the means, standard deviations and cor-relation coefficients of the investment yields, as well as on the chosen risk level.

40|$|The {{main pillars}} of the {{insurance}} management are market share, financial strength and return for stockholders ’ capital.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to investigate, whether it is {{possible}} to enhance the performance of the Danish pension fund sector. It will be investigated whether the pension contributors could achieve a lager benefit if the pension funds ’ investment strategy was changed. Offering the defined benefit products, the Danish pension fund sector is responsible of carrying out the investments of retirement savings and holds the risk by setting a guaranteed return. To ensure a proper conduct with regards to portfolio management in the pension contributors’ interest, legislation, both Danish and European, highly restrict the investment strategy. The day-to-day <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement</b> and the risk-based focus on investments themselves force the pension funds to act rather short term in their investments. According to theory equity outperforms risk-free assets over time. Further, volatility decreases with time since annual returns on assets are mean-reverting. This combined with the fact, that the Danish pension funds are long term investors facing an infinite investment horizon supports that holding risky assets on a long term basis increases probability in achieving higher returns, benefitting the pension contributors to a higher extent. From a comparison of the derived theoretical optimal portfolios and the estimated actual portfoli...|$|E
40|$|Deterministic {{control theory}} {{is used to}} find the optimal premium {{strategy}} for an insurer in order to maximise a given objective. The optimal strategy can be loss-leading depending on the model parameters, which may result in negative premium values. In such circumstances, it is optimal to capture {{as much of the}} market as possible before making a profit {{towards the end of the}} time horizon. In reality, the amount by which an insurer can lower premiums is constrained by borrowing restrictions and the risk inherent in building up a large exposure. Consequently, the effect of constraining the pricing problem is analysed with two forms of constraint: a bounded premium and a <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement.</b> If a lower bound is placed on the premium then an analytical solution can be found, which is not necessarily a smooth function of time. The optimal premium strategy is described in qualitative terms, without recourse to specifying particular parameter values, by considering the value of the terminal optimal premium. Solvency constraints lead to an optimisation problem which is coupled to the state equations and so there is no analytical solution. Numerical results are presented for a subset of the parameter space using control parameterisation, which turns the optimisation problem into a nonlinear programming problem...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{equilibrium}} model to investigate the adverse effects of liquidity risk on price discovery and to examine the interaction of (externally or internally imposed) <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements</b> for financial institutions with the accounting measurement for financial assets in markets under stress. The model develops liquidity demand and supply curves generating two types of general equilibria: liquid and illiquid. We then investigate the adverse feedback effects in the illiquid equilibrium in response to banks selling risky assets to satisfy <b>solvency</b> <b>requirements.</b> Our model captures negative externalities of other banks responding to a liquidity shock with precautionary hoarding and predicts that the potential of bank runs reduces the motivation to hoard. Model results further suggest that applying mark-to-market accounting in the illiquid equilibrium can lead to loss spirals transforming a bank’s illiquidity problem to one of insolvency. We discuss several policy implications {{for the role of}} fair value accounting in linking liquidity and solvency problems of banks during times of market stress...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} a very stylized {{model of}} crises and demonstrates how {{the degree of}} strategic complementarity in the actions of investors is a critical determinant of fragility. It is shown how the balance sheet composition of a financial intermediary, parameters of the information structure (precisions {{of public and private}} information), and the level of stress indicators in the market impinge on the degree of strategic complementarity. The model distinguishes between solvency and liquidity risk and characterizes them. Both a solvency (leverage) and a liquidity ratio are required to control the probabilities of insolvency and illiquidity. It is found that in a more competitive environment (with higher return on short-term debt) the <b>solvency</b> <b>requirement</b> has to be strengthened, and in an environment where the fire sales penalty is higher and fund managers are more conservative the liquidity requirement has to be strengthened while the solvency one relaxed. Higher disclosure or introducing a derivatives market may backfire, aggravating fragility (in particular when the asset side of a financial intermediary is opaque) and, correspondingly, liquidity requirements should be tightened. The model is applied to interpret the 2007 run on SIV and ABCP conduits. stress; crises; illiquidity risk; insolvency risk; leverage ratio; liquidity ratio; derivatives market; disclosure;...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} asset {{allocation}} decisions of life insurance companies in emerging markets. Mature market insurers allocate {{only a small}} fraction of their assets to emerging markets because of regulatory constraints, rating pressures, and currency risk. However, global insurers invest directly in emerging markets by setting up subsidiaries rather than through portfolio investment, and this trend is increasing. Local insurers largely remain captive investors of local instruments and provide stability to the domestic securities market. The regulatory regime and the liquidity and depth of local markets play an important role in asset allocation decisions of insurers. Insurance companies are increasingly adopting asset liability management and risk control measures. However, insufficiently developed local markets and regulatory interventions on the liabilities side often limit optimal asset allocation.
