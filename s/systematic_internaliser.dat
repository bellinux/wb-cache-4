50|$|Systematic Internaliser: A <b>Systematic</b> <b>Internaliser</b> is a {{firm that}} executes orders from its clients against its own book or against orders from other clients. MiFID will treat Systematic Internalisers as mini-exchanges, hence, for example, they {{will be subject to}} pre-trade and post-trade {{transparency}} requirements (see above).|$|E
40|$|As discussions {{around the}} {{revision}} of MiFID are heating up, this paper tries {{to set a}} new regulatory and institutional framework for multilateral and bilateral execution mechanisms of complex financial instruments, such as over-the-counter derivatives and fixed income products. The author argues that the current MiFID framework is equipped to capture {{a great deal of}} multilateral derivatives and fixed income trading, but the Directive fails to provide a complete definition of bilateral execution mechanisms and has narrowed it to mainly own account trading (e. g. <b>systematic</b> <b>internaliser).</b> A key proposal {{of this paper is to}} consider own account trading, agency trades (discretionary matching) and principal trading as pure bilateral execution services to be classified under a broader definition of <b>systematic</b> <b>internaliser</b> (with revised obligations), subject then to the application of conduct of business rules (e. g. conflicts of interests management procedures) and a best execution regime. MTF would then be adapted to explicitly state that multilateral systems are not just those bringing together multiple interests from third parties, but those systems bringing together interests through ‘non-discretionary ’ services, vis-à-vis membership, admission of products to trading, and matching of interests. Finally, despite the claim that OTF and SEF would be equivalent categories, US and EU regulators are defining diverging regulations for these venues. There are at least four important areas in which the SEF definitions do not match the proposed EU rules for OTFs...|$|E
50|$|Although MiFID was {{intended}} to increase transparency for prices, the fragmentation of trading venues has had an unanticipated effect. Where once a financial institution {{was able to see}} information from just one or two exchanges, they now have the possibility (and in some cases the obligation) to collect information from a multitude of multilateral trading facilities, <b>Systematic</b> <b>Internalisers</b> and other exchanges from around the European Economic Area (EEA). This results in an additional amount of work to benefit from the transparency that MiFID has introduced.|$|R
40|$|The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which {{entered into}} force on 1 November 2007, implies the {{abolition}} of the concentration rule regarding equity transactions so far in force in France. This rule, which was applied to varying degrees across Europe, resulted {{in the vast majority of}} order flow being concentrated in regulated markets, and notably in Euronext Paris for shares listed on the French stock exchange. Over the coming years, order flow will become fragmented de facto as a result of being able to execute client orders on regulated markets as well as on multilateral trading facilities (MTFs), and by use of <b>systematic</b> <b>internalisers</b> (SIs), which act as counterparties for transactions in the same way as market makers on price-driven markets such as the London Stock Exchange (LSE) or Nasdaq. The competition between trading venues, which will be enhanced at the European level, has steadily been increasing since the 1970 s. Since then, alternating series of regulations and technological progress have gradually weakened the monopolistic position of national regulated markets. The impact of this phenomenon has been a continuous fall in transaction costs, benefi ting investors and issuers of securities through a drop in the cost of capital. However, the fragmentation of order fl ow stemming from a proliferation of trading venues may raise concern about a reduction in market liquidity and a slowdown in the decline in transaction costs, which would run counter to the competitive effect between systems sought by the European regulatory authorities. Although the most conservative medium-term scenarios point to continued dominance by regulated markets, we estimate that in the case of France, a very signifi cant share of order fl ow may rapidly be executed on alternative trading systems. Here, we focus on the impact on “wholesale” transactions, i. e. transactions of at least EUR 50, 000, which we attribute to institutional investors. In particular, we identify the portion of these trades currently executed outside the order book. According to our estimates, these transactions constitute roughly 10 % of the traded volume on CAC 40 shares and that may be lost to the regulated market each year. This volume, which would more or less equally be distributed between SIs and MTFs operating crossing systems, only constitutes a fraction of the total volume of the wholesale market. ...|$|R
