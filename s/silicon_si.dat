25|$|<b>Silicon</b> (<b>Si)</b> is {{the second}} most common element in the Earth's crust (oxygen is the most common). The {{compound}} silica, also known as silicon dioxide (SiO2), is formed from silicon and oxygen atoms. Since oxygen and silicon make up about 75% of the Earth's crust, the compound silica is quite common. It is found in many rocks, such as granite, sandstone, gneiss and slate, and in some metallic ores. Silica can be a main component of sand. It can also be in soil, mortar, plaster, and shingles. The cutting, breaking, crushing, drilling, grinding, or abrasive blasting of these materials may produce fine to ultra fine airborne silica dust.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used catalysts for this process are metal halides, particularly aluminium chloride. This {{is referred to as}} a redistribution reaction, which is a double displacement involving the same central element. It may also {{be thought of as a}} disproportionation reaction even though there is no change in the oxidation number for <b>silicon</b> (<b>Si</b> has a nominal oxidation number IV in all three species). However, the utility of the oxidation number concept for a covalent molecule, even a polar covalent molecule, is ambiguous. The silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in SiCl4 and the lowest formal oxidation state in SiH4 since Cl is far more electronegative than is H.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), <b>silicon</b> (<b>Si),</b> and iron (Fe) may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as enstatite, corundum and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available, scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.|$|E
500|$|A new {{technology}} emerging in mechanical filtering is microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). [...] MEMS {{are very small}} micromachines with component sizes measured in micrometres (μm), but not as small as nanomachines. [...] These filters can be designed to operate at much higher frequencies than can be achieved with traditional mechanical filters. [...] These systems are mostly fabricated from <b>silicon</b> (<b>Si),</b> silicon nitride (Si3N4), or polymers. A common component used for radio frequency filtering (and MEMS applications generally), is the cantilever resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, photolithography and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip.|$|E

Upon HPT, the a Si H hydrogen density increases, leading to a valence band offset increase at the heterojunction. However, the film disorder is not increased. Thus, HPT allow for a Si H band gap and a Si H c Si band offset engineering.

40|$|Electronic {{structure}} and capturing properties of three-fold coordinated <b>silicon</b> atom (<b>Si)</b> and the Si{Si bond in <b>silicon</b> nitride (<b>Si</b> 3 N 4) were studied using the ab initio density functional theory. The {{results show that}} the previously proposed negative correlation energy (NCE) model is not applicable to Si 3 N 4. The NCE model was proposed for interpreting the absence of the ESR signal for three-fold coordinated silicon defects and suggested that an electron can transfer between two silicon defects. We proposed that the absence of this ESR signal is due to the creation of neutral diamagnetic Si{Si defects in Si 3 N 4. This model offers the most fundamental theory for explaining the hole localization (memory) effect in silicon nitride. This work is partially supported by research project N 7001134 of City U.

The Si- 29 spectrum for the dry-crystallised material (which is cubic) consists of a single broad line, suggesting {{a high degree of}} disorder. The hydrothermally crystallised material (which is probably monoclinic, with a distorted leucite lattice) has a Si- 29 spectrum which consists of ten lines of equal intensity, two of which have small chemical shift anisotropies and are therefore assigned to Q 4 (4 Si) sites. These data have been interpreted in terms of a structure with 12 distinct tetrahedral sites over which 2 Mg atoms and 10 Si atoms are fully ordered. A 2 -dimensional COSY spectrum shows correlations between some Q 4 (3 <b>Si)</b> <b>silicon</b> atoms and two other Q 4 (3 <b>Si)</b> <b>silicon</b> atoms. This fully constrains the topology of the unit cell. Two schemes of Si/Mg ordering over the unit cell can give good fits to the COSY spectrum.
