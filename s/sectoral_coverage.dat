40|$|This paper {{provides}} a summary and a critical {{survey of the}} methodologies and results {{of the literature on}} the economics of adaptation. We divide the literature into two broad areas of research. First, we examine the studies that analyse adaptation from a bottom-up perspective. Second, we introduce the studies that examine adaptation using a top-down approach. The first group of studies investigates cost and benefits of adaptation at the sectoral, regional and global level. The second group includes theoretical literature on the relationship between mitigation and adaptation as well as emerging insights from some global Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which have recently been extended to include adaptation as an alternative and complementary policy option to mitigation. This latter development has raised issues that represent new challenges for the research community. In particular, understanding how to integrate the vast amount of information provided by the bottom-up literature on climate change impacts and adaptation into global models is paramount. Another challenge is to improve the <b>sectoral</b> and regional <b>coverage</b> of information on adaptation costs and benefits. Currently, much of the information is limited to specific sectors and drawn primarily from developed country contexts. In addition, uncertainty and irreversibility are very marginally tackled by adaptation studies.

U. suggestion, since {{the first quarter of}} 1998, the survey has been based on an updated sample, so as to enlarge the <b>sectoral</b> and information <b>coverage.</b> Starting from January 2003, the survey has been deeply revised and enlarged according to the Commission recommendations so as to cover the whole Market Service sector (Nace Rev. 1. 1 Sections H, I, J, K, part of O, with different degrees of detail). The survey is now based a sample of over 2, 100 firms, stratified both by sector of activity (like already done since 1998) and geographic partitions; the units’ allocation to strata is optimal in the Neyman sense, with some integrations to deal with the pre-exiting panel and in order to include the most important Italian firms belonging to the target sectors. The aim of this paper is discussing the quality of the survey in terms of transparency and reliability. The methodological upgrading of the sampling design is hereafter discussed as well as each step of the new procedure. To begin with, the analysis of the Italian service sector is presented, which enables to set the necessary assumption in determining the survey frame, the selection of sampling units and the weighting system. The theoretical sampling design is thus explained with reference to sampling unit, stratification variables, units’ allocation to strata, as well as the various step of the whole procedure in terms of statistical treatment of non responses, weighting, aggregation steps sampling and non-sampling errors. Furthermore, using the first year of information collected, the remarkable gain in precision of the new sample is analysed, together with its reliability in terms of accuracy of estimates. The analyses of the design effect shows that, also when dealing with qualitative series, the Neyman allocation to strata considerably improves the precision of estimates in comparison both to the stratified proportional design and to the simple random one.

40|$|Subglobal climate {{policies}} {{will be the}} norm for some years to come. However, several options exist for improving the efficiency of domestic emissions regulation. A prominent but contentious policy option for improving the external efficiency is the implementation of carbon tariffs on non-regulating regions. This is thought to reduce carbon leakage and increase domestic production, albeit {{at the cost of}} non-regulating countries. In contrast, internal efficiency improvements can be more collaborative in type. Among others, they include extending and linking of domestic emissions-trading systems. This study compares the relative economic impacts of those policy options if Annex I countries would follow one or the other. The study uses a computable-general-equilibrium model of the global world economy and develops a set of emissions-trading and carbon-tariff scenarios with various degrees of sectoral and regional coverage. For a globally effective Annex I emissions-reduction target of 20 %, the results indicate that linking Annex I countries' domestic emissions-trading systems and expanding their <b>sectoral</b> <b>coverage</b> could yield greater global welfare improvements than implementing carbon tariffs on energy-intensive goods imported from non-Annex I countries. While non-Annex I countries would be significantly better off without facing carbon tariffs on their exports, Annex I countries could gain from either policy. The relative gains from linking and extending the <b>sectoral</b> <b>coverage</b> of domestic emissions-trading systems are greater for early policy implementation within a large Annex I coalition of climate-regulating countries, while late implementation within a small coalition would yield greater relative welfare gains from imposing carbon tariffs. The results suggest that, in addition to the political benefits, there exists an economic rationale for substituting the external efficiency improvements associated with implementing carbon tariffs with internal ones associated with extending Annex I countries' emissions-trading systems. © 2012 Elsevier B.

The effect is identified via a large panel of individual administrative records utilising the differences in speed, timing and <b>sectoral</b> <b>coverage</b> of the implementation of the reform in the period 1997 to 2005. Little substitutability was found between current mandatory labour market pension savings and private voluntary savings.

This low rate of substitution is only, to a minor extent, explained by liquidity constraints. The results point to mandatory pension savings having a large effect on total household savings. Thus, pension reforms that introduce mandatory savings have macroeconomic implications. JEL classification: D 01, D 91, H 3...|$|E

40|$|The Climate Institute {{requested}} SKM MMA and Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) {{to undertake}} {{an assessment of}} alternative policy options to achieve a given carbon emission target in Australia. The focus {{of the study was}} to compare outcomes under a suite of subsidy based policies to the outcomes under an emission trading scheme. The outcomes of the study are presented in this report. There are several market based approaches that could be used to achieve a carbon emission target. Which approach is more or less effective in achieving the target will depend on any restriction placed on the measure, the ability of each approach to manage the uncertainties on the cost and future scale of abating carbon emissions, the long term behavioural signals provided and the relative impacts on the broader economy. In principle, a subsidy scheme, such as the proposed Emission Reduction Fund (ERF), could achieve the same level of abatement at a similar cost to an emission trading scheme provided the <b>sectoral</b> <b>coverage</b> was the same and the eligible abatement options were the same. Any difference in effectiveness and cost may be due to other factors such as a limit on the budget available to be spent through the subsidy scheme and differences in <b>sectoral</b> <b>coverage.</b> Whether projects receiving funding under the subsidy scheme will proceed or go under either before they are built or after a few years of operation, as has happened under other subsidy scheme, is also important to the effectiveness of the scheme. SKM MMA used a marginal abatement cost approach to assess the options chosen under the subsidy fund. The approach was used to assess a range of emissions abatement opportunities in a range of sectors covering energy, transport, agriculture and land use change, industrial processes, fugitive emissions, and waste. The approach involved the assessment of the cost and potential emission abatement of the eligible options. The assumption was that the lowest cost combination of options is selected under the fund to meet the abatement cap up to any budget or other declared constraints. Only options that are additional (i. e. would not have proceeded in absence of the fund or carbon abatement incentive) were considered. The estimated level of abatement by options and their cost are input into CoPS’s Monash Multi Regional Forecasting Model (MMRF) to determine broader economic impacts. This report outlines the assumptions and method used and discusses the result of the modelling. Limitations and uncertainties in the approach are also outlined.

40|$|Using a multi-region, {{multi-sector}} {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) model, {{this paper}} compares the efficiency, distributional and emission leakage effects of border tax adjustments (BTAs) as part of unilateral climate policies {{that are based on}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) -only versus those based on all greenhouse gases (GHGs). Simulation results suggest that the broad-based GHG policies in general have lower efficiency costs and result in less re-distributive effects. BTAs bring modest efficiency gains with adverse distributional consequences. The distributional impacts are smaller under broad-based GHG policies compared to that based on CO 2 only. However, these are due to a wider variety of abatement options under multi-gas policies rather than the BTAs per se. The main difference between the two policies is distributional effects. First, CO 2 -only based policies have worse impacts on fossil fuel exporters such as Russia and relatively better outcomes for oil importers such as India and China among the non-abating countries compared to that of multi-gas policies particularly when it involves large global emissions reduction. Second, <b>sectoral</b> <b>coverage</b> under BTAs also influences the differential outcomes. For example, Brazil is worse impacted under GHG-based policies if agriculture is brought under BTAs as most of its emissions are non-CO 2 based and agriculture is the primary source of these emissions...|$|E
