40|$|A novel {{approach}} for relating suspension batch <b>settling</b> data (<b>settling</b> height vs time) to model <b>settling</b> flux functions is presented. The approach exploits a new closed-form solution relating <b>settling</b> height {{and time for}} a very simple functional form of the <b>settling</b> flux. The simple form in question employs a so-called hindered <b>settling</b> factor (a key material property in suspension rheology) that is taken to be a straight-line function of the solids fraction. The closed-form solution for <b>settling</b> height and time has a parametric dependence on the slope and intercept of the above-mentioned (straight line) hindered <b>settling</b> property: thus a functional relationship between batch <b>settling</b> height and suspension material property parameters is established. Moreover by adjusting the slope and intercept parameters, the closed-form solutions for <b>settling</b> height vs time can be matched to batch <b>settling</b> experimental data, and thereby the <b>settling</b> flux can be directly obtained. Unlike classical approaches for determining <b>settling</b> flux functions from batch <b>settling</b> data (i. e. Kynch theory), nowhere does the new approach require data for <b>settling</b> velocity: this gives it an in-built robustness to experimental noise compared to any approach that obtains experimental <b>settling</b> velocities via finite differences of <b>settling</b> heights, since such velocities tend {{to be far more}} noisy than the <b>settling</b> heights themselves. In a typical physical system, a straight-line relationship between hindered <b>settling</b> factor and solids volume fraction will only be a reasonable approximation over a very restricted domain of solids fraction. However, over a wider domain, it is possible to approximate the hindered <b>settling</b> factor vs solids fraction dependence via a sequence of straight-line relations, each taken over a narrow interval of solids fraction. A functional form for <b>settling</b> flux is thereby obtained, useful for suspension dewatering calculations and engineering equipment design for suspension/sludge processing. The novel {{approach for}} determining <b>settling</b> flux has been applied both to experimental and synthetic batch <b>settling</b> data, and has performed robustly...|$|R

The {{ultimate goal is to}} describe in a unified way the processes taking place both in primary <b>settling</b> tanks (PSTs) and secondary <b>settling</b> tanks (SSTs) for a more detailed operation and control. First, experimental evidence is provided, pointing out distributed particle properties (such as size, shape, density, porosity, and flocculation state) as an important common source of distributed <b>settling</b> behaviour in different <b>settling</b> unit processes and throughout different <b>settling</b> regimes (discrete, hindered and compression <b>settling).</b> Subsequently, a unified model framework that considers several particle classes is proposed in order to describe distributions in <b>settling</b> behaviour as well as the effect of variations in particle properties on the <b>settling</b> process. The result is a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that are valid from dilute concentrations, where they correspond to discrete <b>settling,</b> to concentrated suspensions, where they correspond to compression <b>settling.</b> Consequently, these PDEs model both PSTs and SSTs...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{models for}} the {{prediction}} of turbulent flow field and suspended solid distribution in sedimentation tanks are characterized by refined modeling of hydrodynamics, but apparently weak modeling of <b>settling</b> properties of suspensions. It is known that sedimentation tanks typically treat highly heterodisperse suspensions, whose concentrations range from relatively high to low values. However, <b>settling</b> is modeled either by considering one or more particle classes of different <b>settling</b> velocity, without accounting for hindered <b>settling</b> conditions, or by treating the suspension as monodisperse, even in regions of low concentration. A new generalized <b>settling</b> model is proposed to account for both discrete <b>settling</b> conditions in low concentration regions of the tanks and hindered <b>settling</b> conditions in high concentration regions. <b>Settling</b> velocities of heterodisperse suspensions are then determined {{as a function of}} particle velocities in isolation and their total concentration. The <b>settling</b> model is used in the framework of a transport model for the simulation of hydrodynamics and solid distribution in a rectangular sedimentation tank. Results show that solid distribution is mainly affected by particle interactions in the inlet region and by <b>settling</b> properties of individual particles in the outlet region.

5000|$|Translation of {{required}} <b>settling</b> time surface area to <b>settling</b> basin geometry requires consideration of short circuiting and turbulence induced by wind, bottom scour, or inlet and overflow design. <b>Settling</b> basin geometry {{is important because}} effective time of <b>settling</b> within the basin will be the time a volume of water spends in non-turbulent conditions before reaching the <b>settling</b> basin overflow. Median time is always less than the mean time calculated by dividing available volume by anticipated flow.

40|$|<b>Settling</b> {{properties}} of activated sludge or {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} (MLSS) {{have been studied}} for more than 75 years at wastewater treatment plants. Temperature, together with MLSS concentration, has been acknowledged as important contributors to MLSS <b>settling</b> variations. Batch MLSS <b>settling</b> tests are performed on a regular basis at most of the plants. The majority of these MLSS <b>settling</b> test reports reflect the complete absence of any form of temperature compensation or even MLSS sample temperature (Ts) recordings. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effects of short-term temperature variations on MLSS <b>settling</b> parameters. This is done by means of simplified theoretical calculations, followed by operational reactor temperature (Tr) observations, and batch MLSS <b>settling</b> tests. The experimental work concludes with the implementation of an on-line MLSS <b>settling</b> test procedure at a full-scale plant reactor to develop <b>settling</b> models based on diurnal Tr fluctuations. These <b>settling</b> models illustrate that parameter correlations improve when Tr is included in on-line MLSS concentration-based <b>settling</b> models. The unhindered <b>settling</b> velocity of a single solid biofloc in water is considered in a simplified calculation to estimate the effect of temperature variations on MLSS <b>settling.</b> Over a Ts increase of 20 ¬∞C, water density and viscosity reductions result in a calculated biofloc <b>settling</b> velocity increase of less than 0. 5 m/hr. Similarly, biofloc density, shape, and size changes result in calculated biofloc <b>settling</b> velocity increases of about 11, 10, and 2 m/hr respectively over the 20 ¬∞C Ts range. Plant temperature recordings show significant short- to long-term variations. Ambient temperature (Ta) and Tr fluctuate about 20 ¬∞C and 1. 8 ¬∞C respectively per day, and Tr changes by about 4 ¬∞C within a week, as measured on-line at local plants during the test period in winter. The aeration method can have a significant impact on Tr. Differences in Tr in adjacent surface and bubble aeration reactors in the same plant were about 5 ¬∞C. Large enough Tr and Ta variations exist at these local plants to affect MLSS <b>settling</b> test results. The MLSS <b>settling</b> test cylinder environment and meteorological conditions have a direct influence on Ts during batch <b>settling</b> tests. Direct solar radiation increases the average Ts by 4. 3 ¬∞C, or by 0. 15 ¬∞C per minute, during a 30 -minute MLSS <b>settling</b> test duration. This Ts change leads to a sludge volume index (SVI) change of 63 m‚Ñì/g, at an average SVI decrease of 14. 8 m‚Ñì/g per 1 ¬∞C Ts increase. Changes to other parameters include an initial <b>settling</b> velocity (ISV) increase of about 0. 12 m/hr for every 1 ¬∞C Ts increase, together with a clarified supernatant turbidity increase of about 1. 4 formazine nephelometric unit (FNU) for every 1 ¬∞C Ts increase. Ts adjusts towards Ta before and during a batch MLSS <b>settling</b> test, thereby influencing MLSS <b>settling</b> results. Compensation for Ts variations during routine MLSS <b>settling</b> tests is nevertheless not reported as a common practice. To some extent, this is due to a lack of temperature-controlled MLSS <b>settling</b> test equipment. An automated MLSS <b>settling</b> meter demonstrates a semi-continuous on-line method to determine <b>settling</b> parameters in situ at the operational Tr of a full-scale plant. A basic polynomial fits 11 MLSS <b>settling</b> parameters that indicate in most instances improved MLSS <b>settling</b> at increased Tr. The average SVI decreases by 14. 8 m‚Ñì/g for every 1 ¬∞C Tr increase. Similarly, for every 1 ¬∞C Tr increase, the maximum <b>settling</b> velocity (u_max) increase is 0. 1 m/hr, and the time to reach maximum <b>settling</b> velocity (t_umax) decreases by 2. 4 minutes. The incremental 5 -minute duration average <b>settling</b> velocities increase over the first 15 minutes of a MLSS <b>settling</b> test, as the MLSS concentration decreases and the Tr increases. This direct incremental <b>settling</b> velocity trend with Tr is reversed between 15 and 30 minutes, as the average 5 -minute MLSS <b>settling</b> velocity increases at a reduced Tr. The inclusion of Tr in MLSS concentration-based <b>settling</b> best-fit correlations with SVI, u_max, and t_umax improves the coefficient of multiple determinations (R 2) by an average of 0. 32. Best-fit SVI models with u_max and t_umax have R 2 -values of 0. 90 and 0. 95 respectively. The developed models are only valid for the individual reactor MLSS conditions within the experimental parameter ranges. The main contribution of this study is to present temperature-based MLSS <b>settling</b> models. These models illustrate that an automated on-line MLSS <b>settling</b> meter is suitable to identify and model temperature related MLSS <b>settling</b> data with minimal experimental effort. A suitable approach is provided to improve the reliability of MLSS <b>settling</b> data, as effects of short-term temperature variations can be practically eliminated from <b>settling</b> test.

The analysis shows that the exponential hindered <b>settling</b> forms, which are most commonly used in traditional SST models, not only account for hindered <b>settling</b> but partly lump other phenomena (compression) as well.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Settling</b> of attic loose-fill thermal {{insulation}} {{is a long-term}} process. <b>Settling</b> depends {{on the quality of}} the loose-fill insulation and the attic conditions during the service life. The main factors affecting <b>settling</b> of attic loose-fill insulation are density (mass), climate of the attic, and vibrations of the building structure. Analytical models for <b>settling</b> of attic loose-fill {{thermal insulation}} can be helpful for both interpretation and prediction of observed <b>settling</b> behaviour. The prediction of the <b>settling</b> process of loose-fill thermal insulation in a model is valuable when estimating the thermal properties of the loose-fill insulation after a certain lifetime.
