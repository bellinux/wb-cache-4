5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the {{internal}} {{toroidal magnetic field}} to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycle,</b> differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycle</b> corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|An 11-year <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycle</b> is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E

40|$|We {{live under}} the {{influence}} of natural cycles caused by the rotation of our planet and its revolution around the sun. The nature of our nearest star is also subject to cyclical change. This article presents a study of a correlation between <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycles</b> and foreign tourists arrivals in Slovenia, based on historical data between <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycles</b> and sea salt production in Slovenia's Municipality of Piran during the Maunder Minimum period (1645 - 1715). The production of salt by the solar evaporation of brine in salt pans and tourist industry are seasonal economic activities that are affected by changes to the weather. The paper looks at sea salt production in Piran during a particular period in the past. The repetition of the sea salt production in the past is not possible. For this reason, the study uses mathematical tools and an additional case study, which analyses arrivals of foreign tourists to Slovenia over the past 65 years (1948 - 2012). The study has two purposes: to identify a linear correlation coefficient, which provides evidence of a correlation between arrivals of foreign tourists to Slovenia and <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycles</b> and to develop a causal loop diagram (CLD) or so called qualitative model of a complex tourism system, which shows the interdependency of <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycles,</b> tourism system, and quality of life...|$|R

25|$|Ionization depends {{primarily}} on the Sun and its activity. The amount of ionization in the ionosphere varies greatly {{with the amount of}} radiation received from the Sun. Thus there is a diurnal (time of day) effect and a seasonal effect. The local winter hemisphere is tipped away from the Sun, thus there is less received solar radiation. The activity of the Sun is associated with the <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycle,</b> with more radiation occurring with more sunspots. Radiation received also varies with geographical location (polar, auroral zones, mid-latitudes, and equatorial regions). There are also mechanisms that disturb the ionosphere and decrease the ionization. There are disturbances such as solar flares and the associated release of charged particles into the solar wind which reaches the Earth and interacts with its geomagnetic field.|$|E
500|$|Using the {{measurements}} from the Toronto and Hobart sites, Sabine noticed both short-term fluctuations in magnetic declination {{over a period}} of hours, and longer-term variations over months. [...] He quickly concluded that the short term variations were due to the day/night cycle, while the longer term ones were due to the number of visible sunspots. He published two introductory papers on the topic in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. [...] The first, in 1851, was a collection of early measurements; the second in 1852 correlated with Heinrich Schwabe's sunspot measurements, which had been made widely available in Alexander von Humboldt's Cosmos, also published in 1851. [...] With further data collected from the Toronto site, Sabine was able to demonstrate conclusively that the eleven-year <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycle</b> caused a similarly periodic variation in the Earth's magnetic field.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{establishes}} in {{a general}} way the existence of a connection between the stationary equilibria of an infinite horizon economy and the equilibria of a naturally related finite economy. More specifically, the connection is established first between the cycles of a stationary overlapping generations economy and the equilibria of a related finite economy with a cyclical structure. Then the connection is shown to hold also when extrinsic uncertainty (a sunspot) is introduced in the models. The connection holds in this case between a kind of sunspot equilibria called here <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycles,</b> and the correlated equilibria of the finite economy when there is asymmetric information about the extrinsic uncertainty. Incidentally, the <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycles</b> constitute a class of sunspot equilibria that are able to generate time series fluctuating in the recurrent but irregular way characteristic to some economic time series. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Radio waves {{passing through}} the Earth's {{ionosphere}} are likewise subject to the Faraday effect. The ionosphere consists of a plasma containing free electrons which contribute to Faraday rotation {{according to the above}} equation, whereas the positive ions are relatively massive and have little influence. In conjunction with the earth's magnetic field, rotation of the polarization of radio waves thus occurs. Since the density of electrons in the ionosphere varies greatly on a daily basis, as well as over the <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycle,</b> the magnitude of the effect varies. However the effect is always proportional to the square of the wavelength, so even at the UHF television frequency of 500MHz (λ = 60cm), there can be more than a complete rotation of the axis of polarization. [...] A consequence is that although most radio transmitting antennas are either vertically or horizontally polarized, the polarization of a medium or short wave signal after reflection by the ionosphere is rather unpredictable. However the Faraday effect due to free electrons diminishes rapidly at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) so that at microwave frequencies, used by satellite communications, the transmitted polarization is maintained between the satellite and the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Skywave propagation, also {{referred}} to as skip, is any of the modes that rely on reflection (actually refraction) of radio waves from the ionosphere. [...] The ionosphere is [...] a region of the atmosphere from about 60km (37mi) to 500km (310mi) that contains layers of charged particles (ions) which can refract a radio wave back toward the Earth. [...] A radio wave directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth beyond the horizon by these layers, allowing long distance radio transmission. The F2 layer is the most important ionospheric layer for long-distance, multiple-hop HF propagation, though F1, E, and D-layers also play significant roles. The D-layer, when present during sunlight periods, causes significant amount of signal loss, as does the E-layer whose maximum usable frequency can rise to 4MHz and above and thus block higher frequency signals from reaching the F2-layer. The layers, or more appropriately [...] "regions", are directly affected by the sun on a daily diurnal cycle, a seasonal cycle and the 11-year <b>sunspot</b> <b>cycle</b> and determine the utility of these modes. During solar maxima, or sunspot highs and peaks, the whole HF range up to 30MHz can be used usually around the clock and F2 propagation up to 50MHz is observed frequently depending upon daily solar flux 10.7cm radiation values. During solar minima, or minimum sunspot counts down to zero, propagation of frequencies above 15MHz is generally unavailable.|$|E
