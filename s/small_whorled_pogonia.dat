50|$|Bauneg Beg Mountain is {{the only}} {{mountain}} in southern Maine {{that does not have}} a radio tower on it. It is home to the <b>small</b> <b>whorled</b> <b>pogonia</b> (Isotria medeoloides), one of the rarest orchids in the Eastern United States as well as the rare swamp saxifrage (Saxifraga pensylvanica) and Blanding's turtle (Emys blandingii).|$|E
5000|$|Virtually {{the entire}} 3000 acre Crow's Nest Peninsula is forested with mature stands of mixed hardwoods. In {{the words of}} Gary Fleming, Natural Heritage Program ecologist, [...] "Overall, Crow's Nest {{supports}} one of the finest—if not the finest—upland hardwood forests remaining in the Virginia Coastal Plain." [...] Surveys documented two state-listed species and the potential habitat for two other federal listed species and several state-listed species. Several Stafford County records for plants and two state-listed endangered plant species were found, including ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) in rich ravines and river bulrush (Scirpus fluviatilis) in adjacent tidal marshes. Suitable habitat was found for <b>small</b> <b>whorled</b> <b>pogonia</b> (Isotria medeoloides), although it does not grow there.|$|E
50|$|Isotria verticillata, {{commonly}} known as the large <b>whorled</b> <b>pogonia</b> and purple fiveleaf orchid, is an orchid species native to eastern North America.|$|R
40|$|HABIT: Creeping, {{perennial}} subterranean rhizome with herbaceous stems 0. 5 - 3 dm. high; flowering May-July; fruiting July-October. SIMILAR SPECIES: Cornus canadensis is not {{similar to}} any other member of the genus in Ohio. However, in a vegetative state its clusters of whorled leaves might be confused with non-flowering material of Indian Cucumber, (Medeola virginiana), or <b>Whorled</b> <b>Pogonia</b> (Isotria verticillata) ...|$|R
50|$|The Pocumtuck Range hosts a {{combination}} of microclimate ecosystems unusual to the region. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend {{to be similar to}} the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby Berkshires, containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest ecosystem types. Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in the region. Miles of cliffs make ideal raptor habitat, and the range is an important seasonal raptor migration corridor. Thirty-seven species of fern {{can be found on the}} range, making it one of the richest ecosystems of fern diversity in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The range also supports extensive populations of <b>whorled</b> <b>pogonia,</b> a plant on the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency's watch list.|$|R

40|$|Equisetaceae A. P. DC. in Lam. & DC., Fl. Franç., ed. 3, 2 (1805) 580. Terrestrial herbs, usually of wet places, {{sometimes}} as agricultural weeds. Stems elongate, articulate, usually hollow, originating from a subterranean rhizome, monomorphic or dimorphic; branches absent, solitary, opposite or in whorls, ribbed or striate, usually with hollow internodes, originating from base of foliar sheath. Leaves <b>small,</b> <b>whorled,</b> laterally connected into a toothed, tubular to funnel-form sheath. Sporangiophores peltate, scale-like, forming terminal strobili, these borne on vegetative stems or on achlorophyllous fertile stems (not in Malesia), each sporangiophore bearing 6 — 9 sporangia {{in a single}} row along {{the underside of the}} margin. Spores homosporous, globose, bearing 4 long, filiform, cruciately arranged, apically clavate hygroscopic appendages (elaters) ...|$|R
50|$|These are {{succulent}} subshrubs {{growing from}} {{a system of}} fibrous, often fleshy roots. The stems lie prostrate {{on the ground or}} may climb. The stem bases are woody, and the stems are green. The leaves are mostly oppositely arranged, but those near the inflorescences may be alternate. The leaf blades are flat, hairless, sometimes waxy, and usually heart-shaped, or occasionally lance-shaped. Flowers are solitary or grow in <b>small,</b> <b>whorled</b> clusters, usually in the leaf axils along the stem. The flower is about a centimeter wide. There are two large sepals and two smaller. The corolla contains many narrow petals in shades of pink, purple, yellow, or white, and several staminodes that look very much like the petals. The many fertile stamens at the center are white or yellow. The fruit is a capsule with four valves.|$|R
