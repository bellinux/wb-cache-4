60|$|An {{heritage}} of Moordom is the Spanish {{love for the}} improvisation of well-turned couplets; in olden days a skilful verse might procure the poet a dress of cloth-of-gold, and it did on one occasion actually raise a beggar-maid to a royal throne: even now it has power to secure the lover his lady's most tender smiles, or at the worst a glass of Manzanilla. The richness of the language helps him with his rhymes, and his southern imagination gives him manifold subjects. But, being the result of improvisation--no lady fair would consider the suit of a gallant who could not address her in couplets of his own devising--the Spanish song has a peculiar character. The various stanzas have no bearing upon one another; they consist of four or seven lines, but in either case each contains its definite sentiment; so that one verse may be a complete song, or the singer may continue {{as long as the}} muse prompts and his subject's charms occasion. The Spanish song is like a barbaric necklace in which all manner of different stones are strung upon a <b>single</b> <b>cord,</b> without thought for their mutual congruity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cord-rubber {{composites}} {{are different}} from the general rigid-matrix composites because of the twisted nature of cords and the large, nonlinear deformation of rubber material. The study of the effect of cord construction on their mechanical properties is essential to the improvement of the performance characteristics of rubber products. However, little work was concerned with the influence of the number of strands of cord. The present work demonstrated that influence by using nonlinear finite element analyses. The calculated results show that the effective moduli of the twisted cord reinforced composites tend to be closer to that of a <b>single</b> strand of <b>cord</b> reinforced composites when increasing the number of strands with a constant cord volume fraction. For three types of reinforcing cords, the shear stresses have a symmetric distribution and an anti-symmetric distribution in the condition of in-plane shearing and axial loading, respectively. It is also found that the minimum MISS (maximum interfacial shear stress) occurs {{in the case of a}} <b>single</b> strand of <b>cord</b> in comparison with the cases of the twisted cords, and the maximum MISS is related to the loading conditions and the number of strands...|$|R

50|$|A Lupita doll {{is a kind}} of papier-mâché doll {{which was}} made {{primarily}} by the poor along with those from straw, wood and rags. The papier-mâché technique is properly called cartonería, making a very hard surface when dry. This technique has been used to make a number of crafts up to this day, most notably to make alebrijes and skeletal and other figures for Day of the Dead. The dolls are usually created with the help of molds, one for the head and torso and others for the arms and legs, with the strips of paper and paste layered on thickly. When the five pieces are dry, holes are bored into them in order to connect the arms and legs. The two arms are connected to the body with a <b>single</b> <b>cord</b> that extends from one upper arm, through the torso, to the other upper arm, with knots visible on the upper arms. The legs are attached similarly. This allows the arms and legs to be moved from the shoulders and hips respectively. Traditional Lupitas are painted in various flesh tones and with other colors to simulate clothing or underwear. On traditional dolls, flower designs of Otomi origin are also painted. Those painted with underwear are then dressed in some kind of costume.|$|E
