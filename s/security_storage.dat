The designs called for a self-sufficient [...] "maximum <b>security</b> <b>storage</b> area for the most advanced weapons of mankind". The mission of the facility would be the protection and maintenance of the weapons used by SAC. The facility was in the northeast comer of the base, and construction began on 4 August 1951. In addition to 28 storage igloos and other weapons storage structures, the facility included weapons maintenance buildings, barracks, recreational facilities, a warehouse, and offices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the Big Data era, users {{increasingly}} {{prefer to}} take clouds as major locations for data storage. With {{the presence of}} cloud computing, vast amounts of data bring huge social and economic benefits to all of us. But this also poses daunting challenges to the data <b>storage</b> <b>security.</b> The existing security measures can no longer {{meet the requirements of}} large data <b>storage</b> <b>security.</b> These threats will emerge as the new bottleneck of information security. As such, this paper classifies the major threats to cloud storage based on analysis on the defining features of Big Data. We also propose protective strategies for big data <b>storage</b> <b>security</b> from the prospective of key <b>storage</b> <b>security</b> technology, management and relevant policy-measures...|$|R
