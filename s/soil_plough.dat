The erosion and deposition rates were estimated using the proportional and the simplified mass balance models (Walling and He, 1997).

[...] Man {{and soil}} at the thrird {{millennium}} : Proceedings of the International Congress, Valencia (España), 28 March- 1 April, (2000) The breaching of the pyrite-mining, tailing dam of Aznalcollar mine (25 April 1998) caused a spill {{of water and}} sludge (ca. 5 million m 3) ¡ which affected a total of 4286 ha (2557 ha. of Croplands). A remediation procedure of the affected soils, consisting in {{the removal of the}} superficial ltop layer of deposited sludge, started immediately. Despite these cleaning works, <b>soil</b> (<b>plough</b> layer) in many points remained contaminated, with a heavy metal concentration even greater than that before the cleaning works. We have analyzed the nutritional status and heavy metal concentrations of sunflower seedlings ('Mastin, HS') and sorghum (bicolor, 'Grazer' X sudanese) regrowths collected after the cleaning works al the 'Soberbina' farm (37 º 27 ' N, 6 º 12 ' O, left bank of the Guadiamar river, ca. 4, 5 km from the mine). Although both crops fields (as all crops other affected area) were abandoned, sunflower seeds attained to germinate, and sorghum resprouted, after the cleaning works. Concentration of heavy metals were greater in sunflower seedlings (3 / 4 pairs of leaves) collected in the affected, 'cleaned' soil than those collected in an adjacent, non-affected soil. However, plant growth (9 / 10 pairs of leaves) can seed a 'dilution' of the heavy metal concentrations, especially noticeable for Cd. For the 2 -months old sorghum regrowths a significant increase was detected only in Pb concentration. None of the heavy metals studied in both crops reached either phytoloxic or toxic levels for human and livestock (eg. A maximum of 10 mg Pb kg" in sunflower seedlings, below the toxic level of 30 mg kg"). This circumstance contrasts with the levels reached by some wild plant species in the affected zone (eg., 46 and 74 mg Pb kg" in mandrake leaves and bermuda grass shools, respectively).

40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to estimate metal pollutant element (TE) contents at unsampled locations in a 15 -ha contaminated site located in the plain of Pierrelaye–Bessancourt (about 24 km Northwest of Paris). 87 samples of <b>soil</b> <b>plough</b> layer were randomly sampled at each mesh of a regular square grid over the whole study area and the total contents of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn were measured. A first set of 50 measurements, randomly selected from the 87 samples, was used for the prediction and another set of 37 measurements was kept for the validation. Topsoil organic carbon contents (SOC) were measured at 75 sites with 50 measurements sharing the same locations as TE. An aerial photography of the study area showing bare soils was selected for relating brightness intensities and SOC. Mapping procedures used were ordinary kriging (OK), cokriging (COK), collocated cokriging (CC), and kriging with external drift (KED). SOC maps used as exhaustively sampled information in KED and CC of TE were obtained by KED and CC procedures, respectively, accounting for 75 SOC measurements and the brightness intensities of numerical counts provided by the visible bands of the aerial photograph bare soils. Consequently, for each TE, four maps were generated: two maps resulting from KED and CC procedures (KED-SOC 75 P, CC-SOC 75 P), another one provided by standard cokriging (COK-TE 50 SOC 75) accounting for TE prediction set plus 75 SOC measurements, and the last one corresponding to that estimated by ordinary kriging from only prediction set measurements (OK 50). Three indices: (1) the mean prediction error (ME) and the mean absolute prediction error (|ME|); (2) the root mean square error (RMSE); and (3) the relative improvement (RI) of accuracy, as well as residuals analysis, were computed from the validation set (observed data) and predicted values. On the 37 test data, the results showed that the more accurate predictions were systematically those obtained by kriging accounting for SOC map predicted by KED from 75 SOC measurements and brightness values of the aerial photo (KED-SOC 75 P) followed closely by CC-SOC 75 P procedure, except for Cu and Zn where CC-SOC 75 P appeared to be slightly more accurate than KED-SOC 75 P. In regard to the RI of accuracy between prediction methods, the results confirmed once for all the benefit of accounting for SOC data set plus the exhaustively sampled information provided by the aerial photography regardless of the considered TE. Nevertheless, for Cd, Pb, and Zn, the RI of accuracy was less than 20 % between the two most accurate methods (KED-SOC 75 P and CC-SOC 75 P) and standard cokriging in which the information provided by the aerial photography is ignored when mapping. The sensitivity of KED-SOC 75 P and CC-SOC 75 P approaches to the sampling density of the target variables (TE) was assessed using 10 random subsets of different sizes (25 and 33 observations) drawn from a prediction set that includes 50 data. Results have shown that the TE estimates by KED-SOC 75 P and CC-SOC 75 P approaches using only 25 TE samples were much more accurate than the estimates performed by OK 50 and COK-TE 50 SOC 75 approaches that use the whole samples of the prediction set. Moreover, the RI of accuracy was reduced by less than 15 % if the original sampling density was reduced by a third. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Results obtained from the soil monitoring carried out before and after tillage showed high values of soil strength in terms of Penetration resistance and shear strength particularly in deeper soil layers at lower water content.

The results indicated that the periodic emissions from farmers' activities made a significant contribution to the atmospheric WSIs in Beijing. The relatively high concentration of K C in winter and autumn at the two sampling sites confirmed that crop straw burning contributed to atmospheric K C in Beijing. The remarkable elevation of Cl at the two sampling sites as well as the evident increase of the Cl = K C ratio and the Cl proportion in WSIs during the winter in Beijing could be ascribed to coal combustion for heating by farmers. The unusually high ratio of Cl to Na C in summer, the obviously high concentrations of Cl in the rural sampling site and the elevation of Cl proportion in WSIs in Beijing during the maize fertilization could be explained by the use of the prevailing fertilizer of NH 4 Cl in the vast area of NCP. The abnormally high concentrations of Ca- 2 + at the two sampling sites and the elevation of Ca- 2 C proportion during the period of the maize harvest and <b>soil</b> <b>ploughing</b> in Beijing provided convincing evidence that the intensive agricultural activities in autumn contributed to the regional mineral dust.

In addition, the values of nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) and the sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) were found to be much greater under haze days than under non-haze days, implying that formation of sulfate and nitrate was greatly accelerated through heterogeneous or multiphase reactions of NO 2 and SO 2 on PM 2. 5...|$|R

The J. thurifera trees that were declining experienced significantly lower soil nutrient and water availability, which resulted in lower leaf nutrient concentrations, lower photosynthetic rates, higher water stress, and arrested growth and reproduction. We confirmed that competition release increased nutrient availability and acquisition, reduced water deficit, improved photosynthetic rates, and abruptly stopped defoliation. Competition plays an increasingly critical role in forest conservation, particularly with the reported increase in the number of species colonizing previously unfeasible habitats due to global change and the absence of traditional activities that used to buffer competition. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

The cereal crop also improves the soil cover, suppressing weeds. Growing two crops at the same time reduces the risk of yield loss. 	 •	The seed bed should be not too fine-grained after cultivation or reduced tillage (advantage: better channel flow from deeper soil layers during drought periods). A further possibility is mulch-till, whilst on heavy <b>soils</b> a <b>plough</b> with subsoiler might be needed.
