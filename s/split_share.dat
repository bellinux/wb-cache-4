50|$|As of April 2013 {{there are}} 34 <b>split</b> <b>share</b> {{corporations}} on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Back in March 2008 there were 63 <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preferred}} {{and capital}} shares of a <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation are independently tradeable securities, and hence their value {{is subject to}} market forces. If the volume of traded shares is relatively small, then the price of <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporations can be volatile as with any other thinly traded security. Close to the expiration date, however, {{the value of the}} preferred shares will tend to converge on the initial issue price if the <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation is judged by the market to have sufficient equity to fully pay back the preferred shareholders.|$|E
50|$|A <b>split</b> <b>share</b> {{corporation}} is a corporation that exists for a defined {{period of time}} to transform the risk and investment return (capital gains, dividends, and possibly also profits from the writing of covered options) of a basket of shares of conventional dividend-paying corporations into the risk and return of the two or more classes of publicly traded shares in the <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation. Most commonly a <b>split</b> <b>share</b> {{corporation is}}sues equal numbers of shares from a class of preferred shares and a class of capital or class A shares. The proceeds of the share offering are invested in conventional dividend-paying shares according to the regulations of the <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation. The preferred shares typically offer relatively high and secure dividend yield at a fixed coupon rate but with no expectation of capital gain by the time that the <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation is wound up. The capital shares often (but not in every corporation) pay a dividend like the preferred shares; in addition, the capital shares offer participation in the leveraged capital gains (or losses) of the underlying basket of conventional shares.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>split</b> <b>share</b> {{corporations}} {{provide an}} exchange mechanism, in which {{units of the}} <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation can be converted into shares of the underlying basket of shares, and vice versa. This mechanism would allow arbitrage trading to keep the aggregate value of the units close {{to the value of}} the underlying basket of shares, hence reducing the tracking error between the market value of the underlying shares and the risk-adjusted present value of the preferred and capital shares.|$|E

50|$|The {{dividend}} {{income from the}} underlying shares may be insufficient to pay out the {{dividend income}} for both the preferred and capital shares. In order to produce more income, <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporations will sometimes employ covered call writing and cash-covered put writing.|$|E

The transformation strategy works "without eureka". We can prove that there are infinitely many nontrivial primitive recursive program schemes for which the resulting recursive program scheme is strictly more efficient than the original one...|$|R

50|$|The {{preferred}} shares of a <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation {{are intended to}} provide an investment vehicle for more conservative investors, one that provides a relatively high income stream and safety in the original investment that is secured by {{the value of the}} underlying basket of shares. Greater safety is provided since the {{preferred shares}} are given priority over the capital shares both when income is paid out and when the corporation is wrapped up. The income from the preferred shares is usually declared as dividend income, which in some jurisdictions (e.g. Canada) has favorable tax rates compared to the tax rates that apply to the interest income that is produced by bonds or commercial paper. The preferred shares of a <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation can offer greater diversification than the preferred shares of a single conventional corporation.|$|E
50|$|The {{total market}} value of the shares of the <b>split</b> <b>share</b> {{corporation}} is backed by the value of the underlying basket of shares. The value of the preferred shares is further reinforced by the priority given to those shares over the capital shares in the payment of dividend income and in the eventual return of the full initial price of the preferred shares.|$|E
50|$|Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd {{was founded}} in 1994 as a {{subsidiary}} of the Sany Group. Sany Heavy Industry went public on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on July 3, 2003. In June 17, 2005, the company conducted the <b>split</b> <b>share</b> structure reform and realized full circulation of its shares. After this event, its market cap started growing at a very fast rate, jumping from a total of RMB 4 million yuan in 2005 up to a total of RMB 137 million yuan in June 2011.|$|E

50|$|In December 2006, WSI {{conducted}} a 15-for-one reverse stock split, further reducing to about 50 remaining shareholders {{in order to}} provide a tax advantage as a Subchapter S corporation. Again, all shareholders without enough shares to exchange for a post <b>split</b> <b>share</b> were required to cash-out their stock. WSI's handling of the reverse split was criticized and resulted in animosity within the local community, where there were objections to the timing of the related announcements and the loss of a community connection to the resort by the local residents.|$|E
50|$|Preferred shares {{represent}} {{a significant portion}} of Canadian capital markets, with over C$11.2 billion in new preferred shares issued in 2016. Many Canadian issuers are financial organizations which may count capital raised in the preferred-share market as Tier 1 capital (provided that the shares issued are perpetual). Another class of issuer includes <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporations. Investors in Canadian preferred shares are generally those who wish to hold fixed-income investments in a taxable portfolio. Preferential tax treatment of dividend income (as opposed to interest income) may, in many cases, result in a greater after-tax return than might be achieved with bonds.|$|E
50|$|Toronto Stock Exchange (often {{abbreviated}} as TSX) {{is one of}} the world's largest stock exchanges. It is {{the ninth}} largest exchange in the world by market capitalization. Based in Toronto, it is owned by and operated as a subsidiary of the TMX Group for the trading of senior equities. A broad range of businesses from Canada and abroad are represented on the exchange. In addition to conventional securities, the exchange lists various exchange-traded funds, <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporations, income trusts and investment funds. More mining and oil and gas companies are listed on Toronto Stock Exchange than any other stock exchange.|$|E
50|$|In November 2015, Nike {{announced}} it would initiate a $12 billion share buyback, {{as well as a}} two-for-one stock <b>split,</b> with <b>shares</b> to begin trading at the decreased price on December 24. The split will be the seventh in company history.|$|R
5000|$|From time to time, {{companies}} will issue a reverse split concurrently with a forward split, making a reverse/forward split. [...] Note that in reverse/forward splits, the shareholder's old shares are erased, as they receive {{a number of}} new shares in proportion to their original holdings. By contrast, in a simple stock <b>split,</b> the original <b>shares</b> remain on the exchange as shareholders receive additional shares based on their existing holdings. In both stock splits and reverse <b>splits,</b> the <b>share</b> price is adjusted in proportion to the increase in shares to maintain equal value.|$|R
40|$|Practically all {{programming}} languages used {{in software}} engineering allow to split a program into several modules. For fully declarative and nonmonotonic logic programming languages, however, the modular structure of programs {{is hard to}} realise, since the output of an entire program cannot in general be composed from the output of its component programs in a direct manner. In this paper, we consider these aspects for the stable-model semantics of disjunctive logic programs (DLPs). We define {{the notion of a}} DLP-function, where a welldefined input/output interface is provided, and establish a novel module theorem enabling a suitable compositional semantics for modules. The module theorem extends the well-known splitting-set theorem and allows also a generalisation of a shifting technique for <b>splitting</b> <b>shared</b> disjunctive rules among components...|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} {{basket of}} shares may include shares from only one conventional corporation (e.g. one large-cap bank or insurance company); however, greater diversification, and usually lowered risk, is afforded if the basket contains shares from many corporations {{in the same}} sector (e.g. financial services) or across different sectors. The composition of the underlying basket of shares could be relatively fixed, that is, managed passively as in an exchange-traded fund; however, {{it is usually the}} case that the managers of the <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporation have some flexibility to actively manage the relative proportions of the holdings within the basket in an attempt to increase the return.|$|E
50|$|With their fixed {{maturity}} date, fixed dividend rate and seniority over common stock, the preferred shares {{have many of}} the characteristics of a bond, and thus one might expect their value on the secondary market to vary inversely with the prevailing interest rates, just like a bond. Historically, however, the values of the preferred shares of financially sound <b>split</b> <b>share</b> corporations have tended to keep relatively close to their respective wind-up values. In practice credit risk appears to be a greater factor in the valuation of the relatively thinly traded preferred shares as opposed to the value of alternative (and more efficiently traded) conventional fixed-income instruments like bonds.|$|E
50|$|The {{capital shares}} of a <b>split</b> <b>share</b> {{corporation}} {{are intended to}} be a more aggressive investment vehicle, one that can provide both high income and the promise of amplified capital gains compared to the capital gains of the underlying basket of shares. In effect, the holders of capital shares are borrowing money from the holders of the preferred shares at the dividend rate of the preferred shares, and investing that money in a greater number of shares in the underlying basket of shares. Capital gains (or losses) are amplified in the capital shares because the value of the preferred shares is held relatively constant, and the resulting increased volatility of the equity in the underlying basket of shares is borne mostly by the capital shares. Holders of the capital shares take on their obligation to guarantee dividend payments to the holders of the preferred shares in exchange for amplified returns. In addition, the income from the capital shares can be structured to be treatable, for tax purposes, as mostly or even entirely capital gain. In many jurisdictions, such as Canada, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than either dividend income or interest income.|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} two of the three Lewis {{structures}} appears reasonable {{in the light of the}} rule, expressed by many authors, that stable electronic structures tend to leave atoms neutral or with small charges on assigning electrons to nuclei by <b>splitting</b> <b>shared</b> electron pairs. The central nitrogen atom in all three structures is N+, this being required in order for it to form four covalent bonds. The first two structures, N -N + 0 and N N+O-, involve only single charges, and are essentially equivalent, contributing equally to the normal state, while the third, N [...] N+O+, with a doubly-charged ion at one end, and two positive ions in juxtaposition, is less stable, and is not appreciably involved in the normal molecule...|$|R
