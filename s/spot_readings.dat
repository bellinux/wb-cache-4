40|$|We analyse {{geomagnetic}} recordings at four subauroral and midlatitude Russian observatories in 1850 – 1862. The data {{consist of}} <b>spot</b> <b>readings</b> made once in {{hour of the}} north and east components of the magnetic field. We use the hourly change of the horizontal field vector as the measure of activity. We compare these values to data from modern observatories at corresponding magnetic latitudes (Nurmijärvi, Finland, magnetic latitude ~ 57  N; Tartu, Estonia, ~ 54. 5  N; Dourbes, Belgium, ~ 46  N) by reducing their data to the 1 -h format. The largest variations at the Russian observatories occurred during the Carrington storm in September 1859 and they reached about 1000  nT/h, which was the instrumental off-scale limit. When the time stamp for the <b>spot</b> <b>readings</b> happens to be optimal, the top variation in the Nurmijärvi data is about 3700  nT/h (July 1982), and at Tartu the maximum is about 1600  nT/h (November 2004). At a midlatitude site Nertchinsk in Russia (magnetic latitude ~ 45  N), the variation during the Carrington storm was at the off-scale limit, and exceeded the value observed at Dourbes during the Halloween storm in October 2003. At Nertchinsk, the Carrington event was at least four times larger than any other storm in 1850 – 1862. Despite the limitations of the old recordings and in using only hourly <b>spot</b> <b>readings,</b> the Carrington storm was definitely a very large event at midlatitudes.

Day-to-day variations of the mean Tdp and amplitude were large but, in general, values tended to remain fairly constant through the night, and started to decrease 1 – 2 h after sunrise to a minimum at 15 : 00 – 16 : 00 h.

The pdf pictures for digitization were taken by a normal digital camera. The database obtained consists of about 900 000 single data points. The time series of hourly magnetic values reveal slow secular variations (declination only) as well as transient and regular geomagnetic variations of external origin. The quality and homogeneity of the data is satisfactory. Daily Ak-indices were calculated using the index algorithm that has been earlier applied to 19 th century data from Helsinki (Finland) as well as modern magnetic observatory recordings. The activity index series derived from the Russian data is consistent with earlier activity index series for 1850 – 1862. The digitized index data series derived {{in this study was}} extended back to 1841 by including magnetic C 9 activity index data available from a Russian observatory (St. Petersburg).

5000|$|The Olympus OM-3 is {{a manual}} camera without {{automatic}} exposure modes, and an entirely mechanical shutter. Introduced in 1983, the OM-3 {{was the first}} of a new series of professional camera bodies designed to update the OM-1 and OM-2. These new bodies, which continued with the more popular OM-4, included a number of refinements over their predecessors. Perhaps the most significant changes made were to the metering system. The OM-3 and OM-4 featured multi-spot metering in place of the centre-weighted metering on the earlier bodies. This allowed the user to take a number of <b>spot</b> meter <b>readings,</b> all of which were used by the camera to calculate the correct exposure. The system also featured [...] "highlight" [...] and [...] "shadow" [...] buttons which allowed the photographer to identify parts of a scene that should be exposed as white or black respectively.

40|$|Many pre- to late-nineteenth century brick masonry {{structures}} {{encountered by}} conservation professionals are constructed with hygroscopic, porous brick {{that has been}} attacked by the combination of moisture and salt. The presence of these enabling factors of deterioration accelerates damage to a brick. Professionals need an affordable nondestructive tool that does not require extensive calibrations to highlight dangerous levels of moisture {{in the presence of}} soluble salts at a macroscopic scale prior to evident material loss. The infrared camera has been proven to display a visual image of moisture anomalies in a brick wall, but quantification requires <b>spot</b> <b>readings</b> with a moisture meter and accurate quantification requires sampling and laboratory testing. This paper investigates whether an infrared camera can be used to quantitatively determine in situ moisture content of a porous brick wall. In achieving this, a testing procedure was developed and performed on thirty-two hand-molded colonial face brick cuboid samples conditioned to four equilibrium moisture contents. The results of this test concluded that infrared thermography can distinguish different levels of moisture content with the thermal images. Secondly, there exists a linear relationship between ∆T surface center point and measured moisture content as well as a similar relationship between ∆T average surface and measured moisture content when room %RH is lower than equilibrium %RH for the sample. The linear relationship of measured moisture content and ∆T may be consulted for determining moisture content readings in different ambient conditions; however, nearly saturated samples require further study...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of instruments and technics {{in recent years}} has made possible considerable increase in our information concerning electrical phenomena associated with living organisms. Though still little studied, this is true of those bioelectric phenomena, noted by DuBois-Reymond in the frog skin in 1843, which maintain a relatively steady state and change only slowly, as well as of those better known phenomena, commonly called action currents, which are defined by the instruments used to detect them as rapidly changing states. Steady state differences of electrical potential (p. d.) have been found in virtually every living membrane, cell, tissue, and organism which has been explored, although some p. d. 's are at the lower limit of the sensitivity of available instruments. One of the earliest objects of study after the design of the Burr-Lane-Nims microvoltmeter 4 which made possible dependable and reproducible determinations at high sensitivity, was the developing embryo. 2 ' 8 A notable feature of the results of these exploratory investigations was the wide scatter of points and the necessity of statistical treatment. Since these determinations represented <b>spot</b> <b>readings</b> of a galvanometer, a natural development was the application of continuous recording, for significant changes in potentials with alterations {{in the state of the}} organism may well pass unnoticed in discontinuous data. However, such methods have not yet been applied, so far as is known, to the problem of embryology. And yet a very considerable interest would obviously attach to a continuous record of the electrical output of the developing organism. Information on the course of steady state potentials through the mitotic bursts of cleavage, the determination of axial organs, movements of materials and differentiation of cells, should bear importantly on the question of the origin, nature, and influence of this type of bioelectricity...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five {{samples from}} four bands of Ordovician {{ignimbrite}} exposed near Killary Harbour, Eire, were studied in detail, yielding strong evidence for magnetic stability: (1) At two collection sites, the natural remanent magnetization was significantly misaligned {{with the present}} field. At all three sites its direction was substantially stable against (2) a. c. demagnetizing fields up to 795 oe (peak), and (3) heating to 400 - 550 °C; both treatments tended to reduce directional scatter. (4) A positive fold test suggests that the stable magnetization is primary. Assuming a "reversed" axial dipole field, a geographic north pole in the Pacific Ocean (9 °N, 146 °W; dp = 12 °, dm = 22 °) was calculated from the resultant of the four band mean directions relative to bedding planes, after a. c. treatment of all samples to 540 oe. Allowing for possible incomplete averaging of the secular variation, this result {{is compatible with the}} few published Ordovician poles relative to Europe. [...] An oven for stepwise demagnetization, used in the present study, was calibrated. Various tests showed that field-nulling errors would be within 50 - 100 γ during runs. Systematic directional errors from this cause can be greatly reduced by random specimen grouping. [...] Basalts from three Lower or Middle Paleozoic single flows in southern Labrador (Henley Harbour, Table Head), and at Cloud Mountain in northern Newfoundland, were thermally tested for stability. Like the Irish ignimbrites, these rocks tend to be highly oxidized, with hematite partly replacing the primary titanomagnetite. The three lavas showed comparable thermomagnetic behaviour, with blocking temperatures mostly in a 100 - 200 °C range below 450 °C. Treatment to 350 - 450 °C destroyed some secondary components, yielding new mean directions that were similar at the three sites, though with poor vector grouping. Being <b>spot</b> <b>readings</b> of the ancient field, these directions agree broadly with published directions from Lower Paleozoic rocks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Designing a {{localization}} {{system for}} a low-cost robotic consumer product poses a major challenge. In previous work, we introduced Vector Field SLAM [5], a system for simultaneously estimating robot pose and a vector field induced by stationary signal sources present in the environment.

By restricting the set of active features to the 4 nodes of the current cell, {{the size of the}} map becomes linear in the area explored by the robot while the time for updating the state can be held constant under certain approximations.

The UK Food Standards Agency initiated a campaign {{at the end of}} 2004 to reduce salt intake in the population.

We provide fresh evidence on the impact of the campaign, by using data on <b>spot</b> urinary sodium <b>readings</b> and socio-demographic variables from the Health Survey for England over 2003 – 2007 and combining it with food price information from the Expenditure and Food Survey. Aggregating the data into a pseudo-panel, we estimate fixed effects models to examine the trend in salt intake over the period and to deduce the heterogeneous effects of the policy on the intake of socio-demographic groups. Our results are consistent with a previous hypothesis that the campaign reduced salt intakes by approximately 10 %. The impact is shown to be stronger among women than among men. Older cohorts of men show a larger response to the salt campaign compared to younger cohorts, while among women, younger cohorts respond more strongly than older cohorts...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{focus in}} caries {{management}} {{has shifted to}} early detection of caries lesions and targeted noninvasive management of incipient lesions using novel remineralizing agents. Aim: This study aimed to compare and evaluate the remineralization potential of commercially available agents containing nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HA), casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate fluoride (CPP-ACPF), and Tricalcium phosphate (TCP) on artificially induced white spot lesions in primary teeth. Settings and Design: This is an in vitro double-blind randomized study. Materials and Methods: Forty extracted or exfoliated primary teeth were selected and randomized as follows: Group I: FTCP, Group II: fluoridated dentifrice, Group III: CPP-ACPF, and Group IV: Nano-HA. DIAGNOdent readings and scanning electron microscope (SEM) energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis were carried out at baseline.

All men found to be G 6 PD deficient were tested with a quantitative spectrophotometric UV method. Results: Of the 302 tested blood samples, 36 (11. 9 %) samples showed weak fluorescence or no fluorescence spots. Spectrophotometric UV test showed that 18 (5. 96 %) men were G 6 PD deficient. The prevalence of G 6 PD deficiency in the population of Komiža is significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than the prevalence in the whole population of Dalmatia in the south of Croatia (0. 75 % in men). Conclusion: On the basis of these findings, we recommend including the newborns from the island of Vis into a screening program for G 6 PD deficiency. Our results indicate that G 6 PD deficiency should be determined for all the island isolates in the Mediterranean basin and they warrant further studies...|$|R
