40|$|Workers with {{difficult}} working conditions {{can be expected}} to be com-pensated by higher wages. They may, for example, choose shift work because of compensating wages but {{it is also possible that}} they prefer shift work. The previous empirical evidence is mixed. We study if there are compensating wages for shift work by estimating a switching regression model with endogenous switching using French matched employer–employee data for male full time blue collar workers. It is crucial to adjust for selectivity and not to pool data for shift and day workers. A main result is that there is a significant <b>shift</b> <b>premium,</b> the wage rate for shift workers is 16 percent higher than for day workers. A second main result is that the <b>shift</b> <b>premium</b> is significant for shift work choice. This premium compensates workers who do not self–select into shift work. A 1 percentage point increase in the premium increases the shift work probability by 0. 87 percentage points. shift work premium; compensating wage differentials; switching regression model with endogenous switching...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} there are two major {{explanations}} to why Swedish forward interest rates have been high and volatile: (i) Investors' fears that the economy will switch to a high inflation regime give rise to a regime <b>shift</b> <b>premium.</b> (ii) Expectations of monetary policy actions amplify the effect on forward interest rates originating from fluctuations in inflation expectations. In an empirical investigation the quantitative importance of adjusting forward interest rates for regime shift premia is demonstrated. In a second step it is shown that an one percentage point increase of the one year forward interest rate (adjusted for the regime <b>shift</b> <b>premium)</b> only corresponds to an increase of investors' inflation expectations (obtained from surveys) by approximately 0. 2 percentage points, suggesting {{that the rest of the}} forward interest rate movement reflects expectations of future increases of the future real short term interest rate, i. e. a tightening of monetary policy. Finally, there is evidence that investors' inflation expectations from 4 to 2 percent mainly is due to a decrease of the regime shift premiu...|$|E
40|$|When {{entering}} {{the job market}} registered nurses (RNs) face job alternatives with differences in wages and other job attributes. Previous studies of the nursing labor market have shown large earnings differences between similar hospital and non-hospital RNs. Corresponding differences are found {{in some of the}} analyses of shift and regular daytime workers. In {{the first part of this}} paper I analyze the wage differentials in the Norwegian public health sector, applying a switching regression model. I find no hospital premium for the shift RNs and a slightly negative hospital premium for the daytime RNs, but it is not significant for the hospital job choice. I find a positive <b>shift</b> <b>premium.</b> The wage rate is 19 % higher for the shift working hospital RNs and 18 % for the sample of primary care workers. The <b>shift</b> <b>premium</b> is only weakly significant for the shift work choice for the sample of hospital RNs, and not for the primary care RNs. I identify some selection effects. In the second part of the paper I focus on the shift compensation only, and present a structural labor supply model with a random utility function. This is done to identify the expected compensating variation necessary for the nurses to remain on the same utility level when they are “forced” from a day job to a shift job. The expected compensating variations are derived by Monte Carlo simulations and presented for different categories of hours. I find that on average the offered combination of higher wages, shorter working hours and increased flexibility overcompensates for the health and social strains related to shift work.

40|$|We {{explore the}} causes of the {{dramatic}} rise in employee contributions to health insurance over the past two decades. In 1982, 44 % of those who were covered by their employer-provided health insurance had their costs fully financed by their employer, but by 1998 this had fallen to 28 %. We discuss the theory of why employers might <b>shift</b> <b>premiums</b> to their employees, and empirically model the role of four factors suggested by the theory. We find that there was a large impact of falling tax rates, rising eligibility for insurance through the Medicaid system, rising medical costs, and increased managed care penetration. Overall, this set of factors can explain more than one-half of the rise in employee premiums over the 1982 – 1996 period...|$|R
40|$|We hypothesize that, {{in their}} annual {{accounting}} reports, insurers allocate premiums and losses from multistate policies to reduce total state taxes. To test this prediction, we examine firm-level data, {{collected from the}} publicly-available statutory reports used to compute tax bases and filed with each state government. If insurers manage allocations to avoid taxes, we anticipate an inverse relation between the tax rate and the premium-to-loss ratio, which is the industry's standard measure {{of the price of}} a unit of coverage. Firm-specific prices are computed using premium and loss information from the annual regulatory reports filed with each state in which an insurer underwrites. Primary analysis is conducted on 12, 573 insurer-state observations from 1993. We find the premium-to-loss ratio is decreasing in state tax rates, consistent with multistate insurers managing their annual accounting reports to <b>shift</b> <b>premiums</b> (losses) to more (less) favorably taxed states. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we derive and {{estimate}} relationships governing variable {{utilization of}} capital and labor for a firm solving a dynamic cost-minimization problem. Our method allows for (i) imperfect competition, (ii) increasing returns to scale, (iii) unobserved changes in utilization, (iv) unobserved changes in technology, (v) unobserved fluctuations in the factor prices {{of capital and}} labor, (vi) unobserved fluctuations in the shadow price of output, and (vii) the non-existence of a value-added production function. We can estimate the parameters of interest without imposing specific functional forms or using restrictions from assuming {{the existence of a}} representative consumer. We find that variable capital and labor utilization explain 40 - 60 percent of the cyclicality of the Solow residual in U. S. manufacturing, so true technology shocks have a lower correlation with output than the RBC literature assumes. Controlling for variable utilization also eliminates the evidence for increasing returns to scale. We show that our model-based proxies for variable utilization are valid even when extending the workweek of capital potentially has two costs: a <b>shift</b> <b>premium</b> paid to workers, as well as a higher rate of depreciation. Thus, these proxies can be used under very general conditions {{in a wide range of}} empirical work. ...|$|E

40|$|Average {{variable}} costs {{are not directly}} defined for multiple products produced in complex production settings. An activity analysis model {{can be used for}} basic cost measurement and for building a linear programming model of manufacturing operations. The model can then be used not only to compute the optimal production plan and associated marginal costs but also to assign average costs to final products. The activity analysis framework enables many overhead costs, such as maintenance, overtime, <b>shift</b> <b>premiums,</b> and indirect labor and materials, to be treated within the model. Thus, they are absorbed directly into the cost of final products rather than allocated indirectly through an overhead charge. Three average costing methods based on sacrifice value (marginal costs) and benefit value (marginal revenue) of products are considered. The method based entirely on the market value of products has less desirable properties than allocation methods which use the dual variables (marginal costs) from the programming model. Another benefit is that various cost allocation methods using input-output analysis can be considered as special cases of average costing methods presented in this paper. accounting, costing, programming: linear, applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{compensating}} differentials asserts that night shift workers should receive compensating wage differentials due to undesirable work conditions. In weak local economies, workers {{may have difficulty}} finding jobs; thus, these workers might {{be more likely to}} accept night shift work and be less concerned with the size of the compensating differential for night shifts. Using CPS data from 2001, this paper employs maximum likelihood estimation of an endogenous switching regression model to analyze wages of day and night shift workers and shift choice. The findings indicate the presence of selection bias, thus emphasizing the importance of correcting for self-selection into night shifts. The average of the estimated wage differentials for night shift work is negative for the overall sample, with differentials varying by worker characteristics. The shift differential is found to be a statistically significant predictor of shift choice, indicating that <b>shift</b> <b>premiums</b> {{play an important role in}} motivating individuals to select night shift work. Using two measures of local economic conditions and a new method of analyzing interaction effects in the context of an endogenous switching regression model, this paper finds limited evidence that weak local economic conditions lessen the impact of compensating differentials on shift choice...|$|R

The index also has use in the evaluation of financial stability. For instance, there is a tendency for the risk index to have more extreme tops than troughs, which indicates an asymmetry in investors' returns.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to exemplify, by means of a Belgian case study, the {{transition}} of multiple certification schemes currently employed in the food sector towards a single retail driven higher end spot market. Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained by means of focus group sessions, a survey, in depth inter-views and a literature review. The theoretical framework builds upon institutional economics, the competitive forces as identified by Porter, and the theory of system innovations. The article illustrates the current institutional setting of certification, the drive towards a premium spot market and the consequences for the participants in the schemes. Findings - This paper illustrates that a <b>shift</b> towards a <b>premium</b> spot market is indeed apparent. The paper furthermore argues that the dynamics of certification schemes are characterized by processes of contraction (mergers) followed by relaxation (diversification). The paper concludes that the retail sector is the primary beneficiary of the shift towards a single premium spot market. For the remainder of the food chain members, it is less clear whether the overall effect is positive. Originality/value - The question of multiple certification schemes merging into a single retail driven scheme is approached from different stakeholders' point of views. Furthermore, the different factors steering this transition are elucidated and empirically confirmed.

The New Earnings Survey is almost certainly the most detailed and comprehensive earnings series anywhere in the world. It is a one in a hundred sample survey of employees in Britain, giving information on aspects of earnings and employment based on a week in April each year. The NES enquiry is conducted by the Department of Employment under {{the provisions of the}} Statistics of Trade Act (1947). Under the terms of this Act, data so obtained and relating solely to any individual may not be released into the public domain. All the data described here are in a form that ensures that there is no disclosure of individual information. They have been processed into a minimally aggregated form approved by the Department of Employment: any data record released relates to an aggregate of not less than three individuals. Main Topics : The dataset consists of fourteen separate extract data files from the original New Earnings Survey files held by the Department of Employment. Each extract file had been constructed to allow investigation of a particular aspect of the data contained in the Survey, as follows: AGG 01 National Collective Agreements AGG 02 Manual Skill Differentials AGG 03 Regional Implications AGG 04 Age implications AGG 05 Dispersion of Pay within Occupations AGG 06 Shiftwork AGG 07 Pay in relation to hours worked AGG 08 Public/Private Sector Pay Movements AGG 09 White Collar Pay Movements AGG 10 Sex Differentials AGG 11 Incentive Pay and Payment Schemes AGG 12 Incentive Payment Schemes and Age AGG 14 Pay in Relation to Size of Company and Plant AGG 15 Pay in Relation to Company Size and Region Eight of the aggregate files (numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10) relate to dimensions recorded in the Survey in each year and comprise 13 annual files, one for each year 1970 - 1982.
