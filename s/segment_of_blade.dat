Extraction of energy from wind depends on the design <b>of</b> <b>blade.</b> In this work a <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> length 38. 95 m for V 821. 65 MW horizontal axis wind turbine (supplied by Vestas) is designed by Glauert's optimal rotor theory. A computer program is developed for getting the dimension (Twist, chord and thickness). The airfoil taken for the blade is NACA 634 – 221. The airfoil taken is same from root to tip. The analysis <b>of</b> designed <b>blade</b> is done in flapwise loading. The spar taken in this work is of square crosssection from root to tip <b>of</b> the <b>blade.</b> The blade and spar are of same composite material.

40|$|The human {{adenovirus}} E 4 orf 4 {{protein is}} toxic in both human tumor cells and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous studies indicated {{that most of}} this toxicity is dependent on an interaction of E 4 orf 4 protein with the B 55 class of regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) and in yeast with the B 55 homolog Cdc 55. We have found previously that E 4 orf 4 inhibits PP 2 A activity against at least some substrates. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we used a genetic approach to identify residues in the seven-bladed β-propeller proteins B 55 α and Cdc 55 required for E 4 orf 4 binding. In both cases, amino-terminal polypeptides composed only <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> 1 and at least part <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> 2 were found to bind E 4 orf 4 and overexpression blocked E 4 orf 4 toxicity in yeast. Furthermore, certain amino acid substitutions in blades 1 and 2 within full-length B 55 α and Cdc 55 resulted in loss of E 4 orf 4 binding. Recent mutational analysis has suggested that <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> 1 and 2 present on the top face of B 55 α form part of the “substrate-binding groove. ” Additionally, these segments are {{in close proximity to}} the catalytic C subunit of the PP 2 A holoenzyme. Thus, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that E 4 orf 4 binding could affect the access of substrates, resulting in the failure to dephosphorylate some PP 2 A substrates...|$|R

The T-bolt connection is chosen for blade root joint for its simplicity compared to other joints and its effectiveness to improve fatigue life of the bolt. A design preload of 120 kN and an external load of 88 kN corresponding to class III gust wind load case, as defined by Germanischer Lloyd (GL), were considered to test the joint.

Two disbond type defects having diameters of 15 mm and 25 mm were artificially constructed on its trailing edge. The experiment has been performed using the low-frequency ultrasonic system developed at the Ultrasound Institute of Kaunas University of Technology and only one side of the sample was accessed. A special configuration of the transmitting and receiving transducers fixed on a movable panel with a separation distance of 50 mm was proposed for recording the ultrasonic guided wave signals at each one-millimeter step along the scanning distance up to 500 mm. Finally, the hybrid signal processing technique comprising the valuable features of the three most promising signal processing techniques: cross-correlation, wavelet transform, and Hilbert–Huang transform has been applied to the received signals for the extraction of defects information from a single B-scan image. The wavelet transform and cross-correlation techniques have been combined in order to extract the approximated size and location of the defects and measurements of time delays. Thereafter, Hilbert–Huang transform has been applied to the wavelet transformed signal to compare the variation of instantaneous frequencies and instantaneous amplitudes of the defect-free and defective signals...|$|R
