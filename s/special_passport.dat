25|$|During {{the first}} two years of World War II, {{although}} he prepared his documents and received a <b>special</b> <b>passport,</b> Janco was still undecided. He was still in Romania when the Iron Guard established its National Legionary State. He was receiving and helping Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe, and hearing from them about the concentration camp system, but refused offers to emigrate into a neutral or Allied country. His mind was made up in January 1941, when the Iron Guard's struggle for maintaining power resulted in the Bucharest Pogrom. Janco himself was a personal witness to the violent events, noting for instance that the Nazi German bystanders would declare themselves impressed by the Guard's murderous efficiency, or how the thugs made an example of the Jews trapped in the Choral Temple. The Străulești Abbatoir murders and the stories of Jewish survivors also inspired several of Janco's drawings. One of the victims of the Abbatoir massacre was Costin's brother Michael Goldschlager. He was kidnapped from his house by Guardsmen, and his corpse was among those found hanging on hooks, mutilated in such way as to mock the Jewish kashrut ritual.|$|E

Inhabitants within this 25km wide strip of land were forbidden to drive cars, own land bigger than 60 m2 and had to travel within the area with a <b>special</b> <b>passport</b> issued by Greek military authorities. Additionally, the Greek state used this area to encapsulate and monitor a non-Greek ethnic minority, the Pomaks, a Muslim and Bulgarian-speaking minority which was regarded as hostile to the interests of the Greek state during the Cold War because of its familiarity with their fellow Pomaks living {{on the other side of}} the Iron Curtain.|$|E
2500|$|According to Quisling, she and Vidkun {{were married}} at the Norwegian {{legation}} in Moscow on 10 September 1923. Historians believe this is wrong as Norway did not formally recognize the new Soviet authorities before 1924. The representative at the Norwegian Commerce office {{did not have the}} right to perform marriages and he was not in Moscow on 10 September. The couple might have had a civil marriage in Kharkov, though there has never been any documentation for it. Historian Hans Fredrik Dahl believe some kind of marriage took place in Kharkov that day, but that he is unsure whether it happened in formally correct ways or was an informal ceremony. The same day as the marriage allegedly took place, Maria got a <b>special</b> <b>passport</b> for employees of Nansen Action. It was issued to [...] "Mary Quisling".|$|E

Turner and his cohorts take their organization underground to engage in a guerrilla war against the System, depicted as dominated by Jewish control. The [...] "System" [...] begins by implementing numerous repressive laws on various forms of hate by repealing laws against rape (as rape laws are often viewed as [...] "racist"), by implying that gender exists on a biological level, by making it a [...] "hate crime" [...] for white people to defend themselves from crime by non-whites even after all weapons are confiscated, and by pushing for new surveillance measures in order to monitor its citizens, such as a <b>special</b> <b>passport</b> required at all times and in all places to permanently monitor where individuals are. The [...] "Organization" [...] starts its campaigns by committing acts such as the bombing of FBI headquarters, then executing an ongoing, low-level campaign of terrorism, assassination, and economic sabotage throughout the United States.|$|E

60|$|The King {{threw his}} arms round Malcolm, who felt, and unconsciously manifested, a strange bliss in that embrace, even while fixed in his {{determination}} that nothing should make him swerve from his chosen path, nor render him false to {{his promise to}} Patrick and Lilias. It was a strange change, from being despised and down-trodden by fierce cousins, or only fondled, pitied, and treated with consideration by his own nearest and dearest friends, to be the chosen companion of a king, and such a king. Nor could it be a wile of Satan, thought Malcolm, since James still promised him liberty of choice. He would ask counsel of a priest next time he went to confession; and in the meantime, in the full tide of gratitude, admiration, and affection, he gave himself up to the enjoyment of his new situation, and of time King's kindness and solicitude. This was indeed absolutely that of an elder brother; for, observing that Malcolm's dress and equipments, the work of Glenuskie looms, supplemented by a few Edinburgh purchases, was uncouth enough to attract some scornful glances from the crowd who came out to welcome the royal entrance into York the next day, he instantly sent Brewster {{in search of the}} best tailor and lorimer in the city, and provided so handsomely for the appearance of young Glenuskie, his horse, and his attendants, that the whole floor of their quarters was strewn with doublets, boots, chaperons, and gloves, saddles, bridles, and spurs, when the Duke of Bedford loitered into the room, and began to banter James for thus (as he supposed) pranking himself out to meet the lady of his love; and then bemoaned the fripperies that had become the rage in their once bachelor court, vowing, between sport and earnest, that Hal was so enamoured of his fair bride, that anon the conquest of France would be left to himself and his brother, Tom of Clarence; while James retorted by thrusts at Bedford's own rusticity of garb, and by endeavouring to force on him a pair of shoes with points like ram's horns, as a <b>special</b> <b>passport</b> to the favour of Dame Jac--a lady who seemed to be the object of Duke John's great distaste.|$|E
