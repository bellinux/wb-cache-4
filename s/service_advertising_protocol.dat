40|$|International audienceThe {{emergence}} of handheld devices associated with wireless technologies has introduced new challenges for middleware. First, mobility {{is becoming a}} key characteristic; mobile devices may move around different areas and have to interact with different types of networks and services, and may be exposed to new communication paradigms. Second, the increasing number and diversity of devices, as in particular witnessed in the home environment, lead to the advertisement of supported services according to different service discovery protocols as they come from various manufacturers. Thus, if networked <b>services</b> are <b>advertised</b> with <b>protocols</b> different than those supported by client devices, the latter are unable to discover their environment and are consequently isolated. This paper presents a system based on event-based parsing techniques to provide full service discovery interoperability to any existing middleware. Our system is transparent to applications, which {{are not aware of}} the existence of our interoperable system that adapts itself to both its environment across time and its host to offer interoperability anytime anywhere. A prototype implementation of our system is further presented, enabling us to demonstrate that our approach is both lightweight in terms of resource usage and efficient in terms of response time...|$|R

40|$|Online {{advertising}} {{has become}} increasingly popular among SMEs in service industries, and thousands of service advertisements are published on the Internet every day. However, {{there is a huge}} barrier between service-provider-oriented service information publishing and service-customer-oriented service information discovery, which causes that service consumers hardly retrieve the published <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> information from the Internet. This issue is partly resulted from the ubiquitous, heterogeneous, and ambiguous <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> information and the open and shoreless Web environment. The existing research, nevertheless, rarely focuses on this research problem. In this paper, we propose an ontology-learning-based focused crawling approach, enabling Web-crawler-based online <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> information discovery and classiﬁcation in the Web environment, by taking into account the characteristics of <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> information.

This statement implies that sellers of commodities such as soap are generally effective, while "sellers" of social causes are generally ineffective. Afterwards the four social campaigns to determine what conditions or characteristics accounted for their relative success or lack of success were examined. They found that more {{the conditions of the}} social campaign resembled those of a product campaign, the more successful the social campaign are. However, because many social campaigns are conducted under quite un-market-like circumstances, that’s why the clear limitations in the practice of social marketing was also noted. As a part of social marketing, public <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> needs to be mentioned as social awareness advertising, which is mainly focused on social issues like national integration, pollution, family planning, care and concern for aged and disabled, awareness campaigns against smoking, drugs, alcohol, etc. The primary purpose of this type of public <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> is to educate the masses through hard hitting educational messages. Therefore, Public <b>Service</b> <b>advertising</b> is considered as an instrument to promote ideas important to society or to specific groups and shaping the desired attitudes and behavior.

The objective of PSA is to raise awareness, influence and change public attitudes and behavior towards a social issue.

The goal of the investigation was to establish basic tones for an English-speaking public <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> slogan, test their acoustic measures and describe the role they play in pragmatic function realization. The work is based on the material of 75 English language public <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> videos. The PSA slogans were selected, manipulated and tested. The perceptual analysis revealed the most productive (high fall, low fall, low rise) and less productive (fall-rise and rise-fall) nuclear tones of advertising slogans.

A review of the <b>services</b> <b>advertising</b> and the general advertising literature revealed discrepancies between not only the <b>services</b> <b>advertising</b> theory and generic advertising theory but also between <b>services</b> <b>advertising</b> theory and <b>services</b> <b>advertising</b> practice. Exploratory research and a further literature review were undertaken to investigate the rationale and any justification for these inconsistencies. The programme of research culminated into a services consumer behaviour and advertising framework that was tested and verified. Phase one of the empirical research consisted of two pieces of exploratory analysis, which examined the UK advertising industry from different angles to establish how consumer <b>services</b> are <b>advertised.</b> Firstly, a content analysis of 270 service and goods advertisements was performed to compare the amount and type of information they contained. Secondly, nine in-depth personal interviews with advertising practitioners were conducted to explore their views on how <b>services</b> should be <b>advertised.</b> A discussion of the findings from the exploratory research and a further literature review led to the development of fourteen hypotheses. Phase two also comprised of two pieces of empirical research. Firstly, the hypotheses were tested by undertaking a questionnaire survey, which explored the buying behaviour of 400 consumers who had recently purchased a variety of different consumer services. The results from the survey were then utilised, alongside further advertising literature, to create advertising guidelines which were compared with the executional tools utilised in a selection of award winning, successful service advertisements. The final framework classifies services into four groups: high involvement utilitarian, high involvement experiential, low involvement utilitarian and low involvement experiential. The buying behaviour relevant to each category in terms of information search and evaluation is provided. In addition, the influences of motivation and opportunity as well as the involvement dimensions i. e. importance and interest, are included.

40|$|Background: Public <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> in China {{just has}} two decades {{years of history}} and media used for public <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> mainly focus on print advertising. Compared to {{commercial}} <b>advertising,</b> public <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> is not mature in China whatever in the forms, content variety or media. Chinese internet users have increased rapidly in recent years, so in this situation, the development of online PSAs is especially important. While many researches focus on print media, few are about PSAs on internet. The money of charity organization spent on PSAs is rare, because the donators want their donation spent on important place. So the quality of PSAs is important to attract people’s attention. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the factors influencing college students’ attitude toward online public <b>service</b> <b>advertising</b> for recruiting volunteers. Method: A quantitative method is taken in this thesis. The primary data are collected through questionnaire and the sample is college students in university in Shanghai for science and technology. The secondary data come from mainly E-library, E-journal and books. To analyze the data, hypothesis testing method is used and SPSS is used as statistical analysis tool. Conclusions: Entertainment, informativeness, irritation, credibility and advertising value these factors from Ducoffe’s model are applied to the research on attitude toward PSAs. The result shows that factors of entertainment, informativeness and advertising value have positive influence on college students’ attitude, while factors of irritation and credibility don’t have influence on college students’ attitude toward volunteer recruitment PSAs, thus they have a nearly neutral attitude. Entertainment and informativeness have significant correlation with advertising value separately, and this situation can also be applied to attitude toward PSAs. Advertising value has significant correlation with attitude toward PSAs. So the Ducoffe’s model is not totally appropriate for the research on attitude toward PSAs...|$|R
