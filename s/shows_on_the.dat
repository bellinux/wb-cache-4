5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated {{and not at}} all stages certain.

Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, <b>shows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> title page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E
