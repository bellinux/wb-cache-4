25|$|As an aside, it may {{be noted}} that {{real-world}} departures from this linear two-pole model occur due to two major complications: first, real amplifiers have more than two poles, as well as zeros; and second, real amplifiers are nonlinear, so their step response changes with <b>signal</b> <b>amplitude.</b>|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{gain control}} {{circuits}} require an amplifier's gain {{be controlled by}} the time-averaged amplitude so that the output amplitude varies little when weak stations are being received.

25|$|The GLM model {{does not}} take into account the {{contribution}} of relationships between multiple voxels. Whereas GLM analysis methods assess whether a voxel or region's <b>signal</b> <b>amplitude</b> is higher or lower for one condition than another, newer statistical models such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), utilize the unique contributions of multiple voxels within a voxel-population. In a typical implementation, a classifier or more basic algorithm is trained to distinguish trials for different conditions within a subset of the data. The trained model is then tested by predicting the conditions of the remaining (independent) data. This approach is most typically achieved by training and testing on different scanner sessions or runs. If the classifier is linear, then the training model is a set of weights used to scale the value in each voxel before summing them to generate a single number that determines the condition for each testing set trial. More information on training and testing classifiers is at statistical classification.|$|E
