5|$|This unusual triad occurs only in one {{superfamily}} of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise {{the middle}} <b>serine.</b> The middle <b>serine</b> then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic <b>serine</b> to activate it (one {{with the side}} chain hydroxyl {{and the other with}} the backbone amide). The middle <b>serine</b> is held in an unusual cis orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and cis-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic <b>serine,</b> but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.|$|E
5|$|Most serpins are {{protease}} inhibitors, targeting extracellular, chymotrypsin-like <b>serine</b> proteases.

Change {{of any one}} {{of these}} <b>serines</b> to either alanine or aspartic acid did not alter p 53 suppression of transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts by activated ras and EIA. Change of any two of these <b>serines</b> to alanines, however, led to a signifi cant decrease in suppressor function. Substitution of alanines for all three <b>serines</b> caused the most severe loss of suppression and also reduced transactivation functions. The triple substitution had no apparent effects on intracellular accumulation or localization of p 53, oligomerization, DNA binding, or interaction with the II 1 III) TATA-binding protein. In con trast, triple substitution of aspartic acid for <b>serines</b> 9, 18, and 37 had minimal effects on suppression and transactivation by p 53. These results argue strongly that phosphorylation of <b>serines</b> 9, 18, and 37 facilitates the suppression and transactivation functions of p 53...|$|R

5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, <b>serine</b> dehydratase converts <b>serine</b> to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E
5|$|Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of {{mammalian}} chymotrypsin-like <b>serine</b> proteases in vitro, the best-studied example being barley serpin Zx (BSZx), {{which is}} able to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin {{as well as several}} blood coagulation factors. However, close relatives of chymotrypsin-like <b>serine</b> proteases are absent in plants. The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly-Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the prolamin storage proteins of the endosperm. It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function to inhibit proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest grain storage proteins. In support of this hypothesis, specific plant serpins have been identified in the phloem sap of pumpkin (CmPS-1) and cucumber plants. Although an inverse correlation between up-regulation of CmPS-1 expression and aphid survival was observed, in vitro feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS-1 did not appear to affect insect survival.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe N-terminal 17 {{amino acids}} of {{huntingtin}} (NT 17) can be phosphorylated on <b>serines</b> 13 and 16; however, {{the significance of}} these modifications in Huntington's disease pathogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we developed BAC transgenic mice expressing full-length mutant huntingtin (fl-mhtt) with <b>serines</b> 13 and 16 mutated to either aspartate (phosphomimetic or SD) or alanine (phosphoresistant or SA). Both mutant proteins preserve the essential function of huntingtin in rescuing knockout mouse phenotypes. However, fl-mhtt-induced disease pathogenesis, including motor and psychiatric-like behavioral deficits, mhtt aggregation, and selective neurodegeneration are abolished in SD but preserved in SA mice. Moreover, modification of these <b>serines</b> in expanded repeat huntingtin peptides modulates aggregation and amyloid fibril formation in vitro. Together, our findings demonstrate that <b>serines</b> 13 and 16 are critical determinants of fl-mhtt-induced disease pathogenesis in vivo, supporting the targeting of huntingtin NT 17 domain and its modifications in HD therapy...|$|R
40|$|The 86 -kDa major immediate-early protein (IE 2 /IEP 86) {{of human}} {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) contains a serine-rich region (amino acids 258 to 275) with several consensus casein kinase II (CKII) sites. We performed extensive mutational {{analysis of this}} region, changing <b>serines</b> to alternating alanines and glycines. Mutation of the <b>serines</b> between amino acids 266 and 275 eliminated in vitro phosphorylation by CKII. In vitro CKII phosphorylation of the <b>serines</b> between amino acids 266 and 269 or between amino acids 271 and 275 inhibited the ability of IE 2 /IEP 86 to bind to TATA-binding protein. Correspondingly, nonphosphorylatable mutants in these regions showed increased activation of specific HCMV gene promoters in transfection studies. Viruses containing mutations of the <b>serines</b> throughout the entire region (amino acids 258 to 275) or the second half (amino acids 266 to 275) of the region showed delayed expression of all viral proteins tested and, correspondingly, delayed growth compared to wild-type HCMV. Mutation of the <b>serines</b> {{in the first half}} of the serine-rich region (amino acids 258 to 264) or between amino acids 266 and 269 propagated very slowly and has not been further studied. In contrast, mutation of the <b>serines</b> between amino acids 271 and 275 resulted in accelerated virus growth and accelerated temporal expression of viral proteins. These results suggest that the serine-rich region is structurally complex, possibly affecting multiple functions of IE 2 /IEP 86. The data show that the phosphorylation state of the serine-rich region, particularly between amino acids 271 and 275, modulates the temporal expression of viral genes...|$|R
5|$|<b>Serine</b> and {{cysteine}} proteases {{use different}} amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a nucleophile. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad.

5|$|Serpins are a {{superfamily}} {{of proteins}} with similar structures that were first identified for their protease inhibition activity and {{are found in}} all kingdoms of life. The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like <b>serine</b> proteases (<b>serine</b> protease inhibitors). They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action, in which they irreversibly inhibit their target protease by undergoing a large conformational change to disrupt its active site. This contrasts with the more common competitive mechanism for protease inhibitors that bind to and block access to the protease active site.|$|E
5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model <b>serine</b> protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the <b>serine</b> nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The nuclear lamina is a karyoskeletal {{structure}} at the nucleoplasmic {{surface of}} the inner nuclear membrane.

Strong evidence has been obtained for a causal link between phosphorylation of lamins by the p 34 "k 2 protein kinase and disassembly of the nuclear lamina during mitosis. In contrast, no information is currently available {{on the role of}} lamin phosphorylation during interphase of the cell cycle. Here, we have identified four protein kinase C phosphorylation sites in purified chicken lamin B 2 as <b>serines</b> 400, 404, 410, and 411.

5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). <b>Serine</b> is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires <b>serine</b> to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to <b>serine</b> can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E
5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor in the figure above right. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the <b>serine</b> in the active site, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and {{inhibition}} {{can therefore}} not be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional {{groups such as}} nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts. The residues modified are those with side chains containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; these include the amino acids <b>serine</b> (as in DFP, right), cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.|$|E

40|$|Chk 1 is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved {{protein kinase}} that regulates cell cycle progression {{in response to}} checkpoint activation. In this study, we demonstrated that agents that block DNA replication or cause certain forms of DNA damage induce the phosphorylation of human Chk 1. The phosphorylated form of Chk 1 possessed higher intrinsic protein kinase activity and eluted more quickly on gel filtration columns. <b>Serines</b> 317 and 345 were identified as sites of phosphorylation in vivo, and ATR (the ATM- and Rad 3 -related protein kinase) phosphorylated both of these sites in vitro. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Chk 1 on <b>serines</b> 317 and 345 in vivo was ATR dependent. Mutants of Chk 1 containing alanine in place of <b>serines</b> 317 and 345 were poorly activated in response to replication blocks or genotoxic stress in vivo, were poorly phosphorylated by ATR in vitro, and were not found in faster-eluting fractions by gel filtration. These findings demonstrate that the activation of Chk 1 in response to replication blocks and certain forms of genotoxic stress involves phosphorylation of <b>serines</b> 317 and 345. In addition, this study implicates ATR as a direct upstream activator of Chk 1 in human cells...|$|R

40|$|Pleiotrophin (PTN) {{was found}} to {{regulate}} tyrosine phosphorylation of β-adducin through the PTN/receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) β/ζ signaling pathway. We now demonstrate that PTN stimulates the phosphorylation of <b>serines</b> 713 and 726 in the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase (PK) C substrate domain of β-adducin through activation of either PKC α or β. We also demonstrate that PTN stimulates translocation of phosphoserine 713 and 726 β-adducin either to nuclei, where it associates with nuclear chromatin and with centrioles of dividing cells, or to a membrane-associated site, depending on the phase of cell growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PTN stimulates the degradation of β-adducin in PTN-stimulated cells. Phosphorylation of <b>serines</b> 713 and 726 in β-adducin is known to markedly reduce the affinity of β-adducin for spectrin and actin and to uncouple actin/spectrin/β-adducin multimeric complexes needed for cytoskeletal stability. The data thus suggest that the PTN-stimulated phosphorylation of <b>serines</b> 713 and 726 in β-adducin disrupts cytoskeletal protein complexes and integrity, features demonstrated in both PTN-stimulated cells and of highly malignant cells that constitutively express the endogenous Ptn gene. The data also support the important conclusion that PTN determines the cellular location of β-adducin phosphorylated in <b>serines</b> 713 and 726 and raise the possibility that β-adducin functions in support of structure of heterochromatin and centrioles during mitosis...|$|R
