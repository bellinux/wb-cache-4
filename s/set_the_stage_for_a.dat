5|$|The rains from Juan {{and the low}} it spawned in the Mid-Atlantic {{moistened}} grounds {{across the}} region. The hurricane's track helped bring a plume of moisture into the Mid-Atlantic, which <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major flooding event when a low pressure area stalled on November5 west of Washington, D.C. Major flooding occurred in Virginia and West Virginia, causing $1.4billion in damage and 62deaths.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} leg in Lyon, Barcelona fell behind to a seventh-minute free kick from Juninho, only for Thierry Henry to equalise halfway through the second half, giving Barcelona an away goal to take back to the Camp Nou. They needed a win or a no-score draw to {{guarantee}} passage, but a 4–1 half-time lead <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> convincing 5–2 win. Two first-half goals from Henry and one each from Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o were followed by goals from Jean Makoun and Juninho {{either side of the}} interval to reduce Lyon's deficit. However, a goal from Seydou Keita in the fifthminute of injury time secured a 6–3 aggregate win and passage to the next round.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{possession}} of the second half, the Terrapins were forced to punt after a run attempt for loss, a false start penalty, and two incomplete passes. The Maryland defense took the field and stopped a Clemson drive. On the first play of their second series, wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey executed a reverse to gain 76yards before being stopped at the Clemson four-yard line. This set up a short Chris Turner touchdown pass to receiver Torrey Smith, and shifted the game's momentum in favor of Maryland. In the fourth quarter, three completions to Danny Oquendo <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> one-yard rush into the endzone by Da'Rel Scott. In the second half, the Maryland defense allowed Clemson just 31rushing yards and zeropoints, compared with 204rushing yards and 17points in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Pixar and Disney had {{disagreements}} {{after the}} production of Toy Story 2 (1999). Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights {{was perhaps the most}} onerous aspect to Pixar and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> contentious relationship.|$|E
5|$|John's {{situation}} {{began to}} deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin {{authority in the}} south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sudden collapse of Angevin power. John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders {{for the establishment of}} a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance. By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well. John's only remaining possession on the Continent was now the Duchy of Aquitaine.|$|E

The revised party declared loyalty to the Empire, called for comprehensive health care and pension programs, and sought more provincial autonomy.

25|$|Cathay (1915) is a {{collection}} of classical Chinese poetry translated into English by modernist poet Ezra Pound based on Ernest Fenollosa's notes that came into Pound's possession in 1913. At first Pound used the notes to translate Noh plays and then to translate Chinese poetry to English, despite a complete lack of knowledge of the Chinese language. The volume's 15 poems are seen less as strict translations and more as new pieces in their own right; and, in his bold translations of works from a language he was unfamiliar with, Pound <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> modernist translations.|$|E

He worked for the Foundation until 1918, forming a close working association and friendship with Rockefeller, advising him through the turbulent period of the 1914 strike and Ludlow massacre at a family-owned coal company in Colorado, which subsequently <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new era in labor management in America.

25|$|Historian Bernard Bailyn {{argues that}} the evangelicalism of the era {{challenged}} traditional notions of natural hierarchy by preaching that the Bible teaches {{that all men are}} equal, so that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not in his class. Kidd argues that religious disestablishment, belief in a God as the source of human rights, and shared convictions about sin, virtue, and divine providence worked together to unite rationalists and evangelicals and thus encouraged American defiance of the Empire. Bailyn, on the other hand, denies that religion played such a critical role. Alan Heimert argues that New Light antiauthoritarianism was essential to furthering democracy in colonial American society and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> confrontation with British monarchical and aristocratic rule.|$|E
25|$|McMillan did {{enough to}} earn {{selection}} for the Commonwealth Bank ODI series in Australia. On 21 January 2007 he made 89 against Australia.
