5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1945–1946, Slotin shocked <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> with a bold action. He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose {{was estimated to be}} at least 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues,</b> including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the war he}} was {{included}} in an Australian Imperial Forces cricket team, touring England in 1919. Charles Kelleway, an officer, was {{the captain of the}} team for the first six matches. Despite Collins's rank Field Marshal Birdwood, the former commander of the Australian Corps, asked him to take over the captaincy {{for the remainder of the}} tour. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> were officers such as Jack Gregory and Nip Pellew. Collins proved a capable and popular skipper with the team losing only four of twenty eight matches during the tour. He scored 1,615 runs including five centuries at an average of 38.45 and took 106 wickets at 16.55 apiece.|$|E
50|$|Sullivan was a {{guest at}} the August 1998 Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, where he was reunited with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former <b>colleagues.</b> He died six months later.|$|R
50|$|The MDC {{split in}} October 2005, {{a result of}} {{escalating}} internal tensions which saw Tsvangirai differ sharply with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> senior <b>colleagues</b> on various policy issues, including election participation.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{before his}} death he became penniless {{stemming}} from developing a form of dementia which disabled him to take care <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affairs. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> theatrical <b>colleagues</b> looked after him.|$|R
5|$|Using the {{pseudonym}} Joseph Atterley, in 1827 {{he wrote}} the satire A Voyage to the Moon: With Some Account of the Manners and Customs, Science and Philosophy, of the People of Morosofia, and Other Lunarians. It {{is one of the}} earliest American works of science fiction, and was relatively successful, earning Tucker $100 from the sale of 1000 copies. It received positive reviews from the American Quarterly Review and the Western Monthly Review. Tucker uses The Voyage to ridicule the social manners, religion and professions of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues,</b> and to criticize some erroneous scientific methods and results apparent to him at the time.|$|E
5|$|Barkley and {{his wife}} Dorothy took a {{vacation}} after the convention, returning to Kentucky in August 1928 to find that, in his absence, Barkley had been chosen state chairman of Smith's campaign. He campaigned for Smith, but Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory. After the election, Barkley led a coalition of liberal Democrats and Republicans that opposed Hoover's use of protective tariffs, a debate that took particular urgency following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Barkley opposed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, claiming it would cost Americans both jobs and exports, but Congress approved it, and Hoover signed it on June 17, 1930. When Congress adjourned, Barkley accompanied Sherwood Eddy and fellow senators Burton K. Wheeler and Bronson M. Cutting to the Soviet Union in August 1930. He {{was impressed by the}} industrial development brought about by Joseph Stalin's first five-year plan but did not advocate closer diplomatic ties with the Communist nation, as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> did.|$|E
5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake {{the construction of the}} railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He offered <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, {{through an}} {{acquaintance}} with Geoffrey Bone, {{the son of}} Victor Bone, {{he went to work}} for Ruston & Hornsby in Lincoln. He recruited <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former <b>colleagues</b> at Power Jets.|$|R
50|$|Besides <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{parliamentary}} <b>colleagues,</b> <b>his</b> funeral, {{which was}} held the next day, was a private affair. It proceeded from the funeral parlour of K.M. Smith in South Brisbane to the Mt Thompson Crematorium.|$|R
50|$|In Taylor Branch's history, Parting the Waters, Branch {{notes that}} Cox hosted a dinner at which Martin Luther King, Jr. was {{introduced}} to people who would become <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> closest <b>colleagues</b> and advisors as a civil rights activist.|$|R
25|$|The {{body was}} soon found, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> arrested, but Nechayev eluded capture, {{and left for}} Saint Petersburg in late November where he tried to {{continue}} his activities to create a clandestine society. On December 15, 1869, he fled the country, heading back to Geneva.|$|E
25|$|Contempt for the {{mainstream}} liberal establishment, in particular for public figures who, in his view, gain mainstream respectability by criticizing those to their left; targets have included The New York Times, President Barack Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders, the late academic Irving Howe, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> at The Nation, including Marc Cooper, David Corn and Eric Alterman. Cockburn was also {{highly critical of}} his former friend and colleague, Christopher Hitchens.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the term}} civil {{engineering}} was coined to incorporate all things civilian {{as opposed to}} military engineering. The first self-proclaimed civil engineer was John Smeaton, who constructed the Eddystone Lighthouse. In 1771 Smeaton and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> formed the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, a group of leaders of the profession who met informally over dinner. Though there was evidence of some technical meetings, it {{was little more than}} a social society.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, Burr criticized <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Republican <b>colleagues</b> in the Senate, {{who were}} {{filibustering}} {{the passage of}} the fiscal year 2014 federal budget in an effort to defund the Affordable Care Act. In a tweet, he called their strategy [...] "the height of hypocrisy".|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the {{leadership}} of the UFW was wracked by a series of conflicts, as differences emerged between Chavez and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former <b>colleagues.</b> In 1977, the Teamsters signed an agreement with the UFW promising to end their efforts to represent farm workers.|$|R
50|$|Ahmad Bashir {{went back}} to the Philippines after {{completing}} his studies. At first, he taught at an Islamic School in Marawi City. He helped created <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the schools in various communities with complete and organized conjunctions with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> peers, <b>colleagues</b> throughout the years till 1955.|$|R
25|$|Promoted to full admiral on 20 June 1891, Hoskins became First Naval Lord in September 1891. As First Naval Lord he took {{a relaxed}} view {{of the size of}} the Fleet and did not see the need for a large {{shipbuilding}} effort on the scale envisaged by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> such as Admiral Sir Frederick Richards and Admiral Sir John Fisher who were concerned about French and German naval expansion. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on his retirement on 17 November 1893.|$|E
25|$|At first Gambetta {{was opposed}} to the war with Prussia. He did not, like <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues,</b> refuse to vote for funds for the army, but took a {{patriotic}} line and accepted that the war had been forced on France. When {{the news of the}} disaster at Sedan reached Paris, Gambetta called for strong measures. He proclaimed the deposition of the emperor at the corps législatif, and the establishment of a republic at the Hôtel de Ville. He {{was one of the first}} members of the new Government of National Defense, becoming Minister of the Interior. He advised his colleagues to leave Paris and run the government from some provincial city.|$|E
25|$|Brown and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> to the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to {{work with}} the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Clinton Engineer Works, where he became the {{assistant}} director of chemistry. Working with the reactor there, they developed the separation processes for producing kilogram quantities of plutonium. The techniques discovered by the team proved to be the groundwork for those used at the Hanford Site which provided the plutonium for the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. Just four months later he completed Must Destruction Be Our Destiny? (1945), a book detailing the dangers of nuclear weapons. He gave 102 lectures to promote the book, donating the royalties from the book to an organisation that later became part of the Federation of American Scientists.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was one of}} the scriptwriters for the 1984 TV mini-series, Teresa de Jesús, and had a cameo role in one episode, {{playing the}} Archbishop of Seville, who blesses Teresa (while <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> University <b>colleagues</b> hold a canopy over them). In 1987, he became manager of the {{literary}} magazine Ínsula ...|$|R
5000|$|Wheeler-Bennett's {{views on}} Germany and the German Resistance caused unease to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wartime <b>colleagues,</b> and an {{internal}} paper <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>of</b> February 1944 was condemned by Professor Thomas Marshall, of the Foreign Office Research Department, as a [...] "vitriolic little paper" [...] and [...] "hardly worthy of its distinguished author." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{journalist}} Henry Guldemont, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Swiss <b>colleagues</b> {{regarded the}} 1954 Belgian team as [...] "favourites {{for the world}} title" [...] after a promising 4-4 opener against England. However, {{in the second and}} last group match against Italy, Belgium was defeated 1-4 and was unable to proceed to the finals.|$|R
25|$|Details of Condell's mature life, as is {{usual for}} Renaissance actors, are few. His status within the Lord Chamberlain's and King's {{companies}} {{appears to have}} been high; in official communications he is generally listed shortly after Burbage and Heminges. Actors' wills indicate that he was close to at least <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> in the company. Shakespeare and Phillips bequeathed him money for mourning rings; Nicholas Tooley and Alexander Cooke named him as trustee for their estates. Condell prospered enough in his profession to purchase a country home at Fulham in Middlesex and other property, including an estate called Brockhampton in Snowshill, Gloucestershire. The indentures recording the latter purchase contain the only known example of Condell's signature or handwriting apart from his last will.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the prisoners}} in Kolyma were {{academics}} or intellectuals. They included Mikhail Kravchuk (Krawtschuk), a Ukrainian mathematician who by the early 1930s had received considerable acclaim in the West. After a summary trial, apparently for reluctance {{to take part in}} the accusations of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues,</b> he was sent to Kolyma where he died in 1942. Hard work in the labor camp, harsh climate and meager food, poor health as well as accusations and abandonment by most of his colleagues, took their toll. Kravchuk perished in Magadan in Eastern Siberia, about 4,000 miles (6,000km) from the place where he was born. Kravchuk's last article had appeared soon after his arrest in 1938. However, after this publication, Kravchuk's name was stricken from books and journals.|$|E
25|$|In October 1989, the group's {{negotiations}} with Tsutsumi Sakamoto, an anti-cult lawyer threatening {{a lawsuit against}} them which could potentially bankrupt the group, failed. In the same month, Sakamoto recorded an interview for a talk show on the Japanese TV station TBS. The network then had the interview secretly shown to the group without notifying Sakamoto, intentionally breaking protection of sources. The group then pressured TBS to cancel the broadcast. The following month Sakamoto, {{his wife and his}} child went missing from their home in Yokohama. The police were unable to resolve the case at the time, although <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> publicly voiced their suspicions of the group. It was not until after the 1995 Tokyo attack that they were known to have been murdered and their bodies dumped by cult members.|$|E
50|$|Unlike <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cabinet <b>colleagues,</b> Vallerand {{supported}} the Liberal Party of Canada {{at the federal}} level in the 1980s. In the 1988 Canadian federal election, he endorsed Liberal Party incumbent Marcel Prud'homme's bid for re-election. During the constitutional debates of the early 1990s, he supported greater autonomy for Quebec within Canadian federalism.|$|R
5000|$|After the war {{it became}} {{apparent}} to Dow and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> senior <b>colleagues</b> that St George's needed {{to function as a}} general hospital as well as a teaching hospital. [...] In the early 1950s he moved his firm from Hyde Park Corner to the Grove Fever Hospital in Tooting, south London.|$|R
50|$|Ajoy Mukherjee with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> closed <b>colleagues,</b> viz. Pranob Mukherjee etc., joined Indian National Congress leaving Sushil Dhara- {{his long}} term associates. He was offered ministerial post at Centre by Indira Gandhi, but Ajoy Mukherjee saying {{his age and}} health {{condition}} had pushed Pranab Mukherjee. Pranab Mukherjee became State Minister in the Indian Cabinet.|$|R
25|$|Boltzmann spent a {{great deal}} of effort in his final years {{defending}} his theories. He did not get along with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> in Vienna, particularly Ernst Mach, who became a professor of philosophy and history of sciences in 1895. That same year Georg Helm and Wilhelm Ostwald presented their position on Energetics at a meeting in Lübeck. They saw energy, and not matter, as the chief component of the universe. Boltzmann's position carried the day among other physicists who supported his atomic theories in the debate. In 1900, Boltzmann went to the University of Leipzig, on the invitation of Wilhelm Ostwald. After the retirement of Mach due to bad health, Boltzmann returned to Vienna in 1902. In 1903 he founded the Austrian Mathematical Society together with Gustav von Escherich and Emil Müller. His students included Karl Przibram, Paul Ehrenfest and Lise Meitner.|$|E
25|$|University of Douai was {{the center}} of {{religious}} debate to the political implications. Created to counter the Protestant Reformation, the court also dismissed the royal power by his fight against Bossuet and the Gallican. Its independence on the face of temporal power is due to its history on the border between the Spanish Netherlands and the Kingdom of France. The chancellors and officials of the university were advisers of the Catholic kings of Spain and France. The board of the University of Douai had relations with the courts of Louis XIV and Louis XV, including through Philip Cospéan and Bossuet, and was also related to Popes who originally contributed to the financial support of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues.</b> During the French Revolution in 1791, the clergy began university Douaisian conditions before considering to take an oath to the Civil Constitution of the clergy, following the brief quod aliquantum of March 10, 1791 and Caritas of April 13, 1791 issued by the Pope. These conditions were interpreted as a rejection of loyalty to Republican power.|$|E
500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{considered}} Rothenberg [...] "the greatest {{scholar of}} the Napoleonic era of our day." [...] His adventurous life and diverse experiences {{gave him a}} deep understanding of human nature. This made him a valuable colleague and a treasured mentor for his many graduate students.|$|E
50|$|At {{the urging}} <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former Senate <b>colleagues,</b> President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{appointed}} Cain to the Subversive Activities Control Board, {{where he served}} from 1953-1956.|$|R
5000|$|He {{studied and}} {{recorded}} several songs with Junior Kimbrough, whom he called [...] "the {{beginning and end}} <b>of</b> all music". <b>His</b> childhood influences were reflected in <b>his</b> later music <b>of</b> the 1970s and 1980s, which had an easy-paced, sometimes sinister, country-blues tempo, {{as opposed to the}} frenetic fast-paced style favored by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rockabilly <b>colleagues</b> <b>of</b> the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Tokugawa Ieyasu's Kagemusha Legend (...) is a {{myth that}} has been {{circulating}} since the Edo period. It {{is believed to have}} arisen due to historical records of Ieyasu's [...] "sudden change of behavior" [...] with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> closest <b>colleagues.</b> The idea was made more popular in modern times by the historians, Tokutomi Sohō and Yasutsugu Shigeno.|$|R
