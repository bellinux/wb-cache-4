50|$|<b>Shareholder</b> <b>loan</b> is a debt-like form of {{financing}} provided by shareholders. Usually, {{it is the}} most junior debt in the company's debt portfolio, and since this <b>loan</b> belongs to <b>shareholders</b> it should be treated as equity. Maturity of <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> is long with low or deferred interest payments. Sometimes, <b>shareholder</b> <b>loan</b> is confused with a loan from company extended to its shareholders.|$|R

40|$|Using a 1977 {{article by}} Robert Clark as the {{starting}} point, this article attempts to shed {{new light on the}} question of whether and when <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> to her company should be either equitably subordinated or, as courts have done in a few recent cases, recharacterized as equity. In its emphasis on the particular issue of <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans,</b> the article has a narrower compass than Clark’s article, which uses a four-part typology to explore the relationship among fraudulent conveyance law, equitable subordination, veil piercing and dividend restrictions. But the article also expands Clark’s analysis in several respects. The most important adjustment involves the general Nonhindrance ideal, which we use to identify a crucially important form of interference with the rights of creditors that Clark does not himself consider directly. Part 1 of the article very briefly describes the 1939 Supreme Court case that served as a well-spring for equitable subordination doctrine in general, and for subordination of <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> in particular. Part 2 then focuses on a series of recent decisions that have wrestled with the question whether <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> should be recharacterized as equity contributions. Recharacterization doctrine is closely related to equitable subordination, but most courts view it as a separate development. Part 2 suggests that much of the confusion in the cases could be eliminated by disentangling two issues, whether the status of a loan is ambiguous (which raises issues of Truth, in terms of Clark’s typology) and whether it was likely to destroy value that would otherwise go to creditors (the Nonhindrance concern); and by distinguishing bankruptcy recharacterization from the tax characterization cases that seem to have spawned the new doctrine. Part 3 then concludes by briefly considering the German and Austrian approaches to these same issues, which focus on capitalization and creditworthiness. The most important, and initially counterintuitive, implication comes in Part 2 : whereas US courts have treated security interests as a badge of legitimacy in assessing <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans,</b> secured loans are actually the most worrisome form of shareholder investment. These security interests, we argue, should be disallowed...|$|R

40|$|Although the European Insolvency Regulation {{does not}} provide {{limitations}} on comi-migration, comi-migration {{can lead to the}} application of the principle of abuse of Union law. This article provides a theoretical framework to distinguish between abusive and non-abusive comi-migration. Comi-migration which seeks to overcome common pool problems and their related tragedy of the commons is in principle allowed, as is comi-migration aimed at dealing with anticommons problems and their related hold-out behaviour. Comi-migration aimed at a different ranking is, however, not allowed. If this framework is applied to failing companies migrating to England, this leads to the following. Comi-migration aimed at benefitting from the English rules on reorganisation, such as the CVA and the Scheme of Arrangements are allowed since they deal with anticommons problems and their related hold-out behaviour. Also comi-migration aimed at benefitting from a prepack and preference law is in principle allowed as these rules deal with overcoming common pool problems and their related tragedy of the commons. Comi-migration aimed at a different ranking, e. g. German, Spanish and Italian companies migrating to England in order to prevent <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> from being <b>subordinated,</b> is not allowed. Such a comi-migration will qualify as abuse of Union law to be established by the judge of the incoming jurisdiction. Such comi-migration could therefore remain without effect, even if the comi has factually been moved. A more subtle sanction could also be applying English preference law against any upgrade of a creditor’s claim, most notably an upgrade from a <b>subordinated</b> <b>shareholder</b> claim to an ordinary claim...|$|R

40|$|LL. M. (Corporate Law) Jurisdictions employ several legal {{methods to}} {{regulate}} <b>loans</b> made by <b>shareholders</b> to companies.

German law complies fully with the UNCITRAL recommendations by providing for the automatic subordination of shareholder claims in respect of loans as well as the avoidance of repayments and security interests made and registered within a certain period of the commencement of insolvency proceedings. German law also contains avoidance provisions specific to transactions between the debtor and a shareholder that cause detriment to a third-party creditor and general avoidance provisions which provide for certain presumptions to apply in the case of transactions concluded between the company and a shareholder. In the United States the doctrine of equitable subordination is legislated and applies in the event that the debtor is thinly-capitalised and mismanaged and legislative provision is made for the avoidance of preference transactions concluded between a creditor and a debtor, which provide for a longer avoidance period {{in the case of a}} transaction concluded with a shareholder. In addition to full legislative compliance with the UNCITRAL recommendation relating to shareholder transactions, the wide powers given to the courts to uphold bankruptcy legislation is codified and led to the development of the doctrine of recharacterization, which entails <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> being treated as equity contributions in certain circumstances. The United Kingdom does not contain legal provisions relating to the subordination of shareholder claims and thus does not comply fully with the UNCITRAL recommendations relating to <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans.</b> However, it does provide specifically for a longer avoidance period in respect of preference transactions involving shareholders and certain presumptions to be applied in the case of transactions concluded between the debtor company and a shareholder...|$|R

The present analyses deals with financial balance in a static manner based on these four indicators listed. The sources of data for the analysis of financial balance are offered mainly in the financial statement. This document has been used data from a company that is engaged in the carriage of goods.
