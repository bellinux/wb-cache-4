500|$|About a {{year after}} release, Fox commented that he was {{surprised}} by how popular the game had become and though appreciative of the attention, he became stressed out over it. Fox said: [...] "It wouldn't <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> if I never made a game as successful again. That's fine with me though." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} a {{milestone}} for one coach and a millstone for another; {{it was the}} 100th win for Mack Brown at Texas; and it put more pressure on beleaguered Nebraska coach Bill Callahan. [...] Brown remarked on his victory, “A hundred is nice. [...] I knew the game {{was going to come}} down like it did. [...] It didn’t <b>surprise</b> <b>me.</b> [...] They made sure that I’ll remember it the rest of my life.” [...] Callahan was fired fiveweeks later.|$|E
500|$|Revenge was {{mentioned}} {{after the game}} by Flyers Head Coach Ken Hitchcock. During a post-game interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), he commented that [...] "someday, someone's {{going to make him}} eat his lunch. This is something, in my opinion, that the players should take care of." [...] Recchi also mentioned revenge, not specifically from the Flyers, during an interview with the CBC. [...] "It doesn't <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> coming from this guy. He's that type of player. He's done it before. It might not come from our team. But he better protect himself," [...] said Recchi.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} of only three concerts {{performed}} in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University's A Ball with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. He was onstage {{for nearly an hour}} but failed to complete half of the songs. He claimed that his poor performance was due to his left hand having fallen asleep and told the audience it felt [...] "like having stuff on your hand and you can't get it off". Smith's performance was reviewed as [...] "undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician" [...] and an [...] "excruciating [...] nightmare". A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise wrote, [...] "It would not <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2005, {{producers}} {{mentioned the}} possibility of following Extinction with a sequel entitled Afterlife, to be shot and set in Tokyo, Japan and Alaska. Despite Resident Evil: Extinction being billed on the official website and elsewhere as the final installment of the Resident Evil film series; on September 23, 2007, Rory Bruer, Sony's head of distribution explained, [...] "It absolutely would not <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> considering {{the success of the}} franchise that they find a way to come up with another. It's a real possibility." [...] Producer Jeremy Bolt also stated that while there was no intention of making a fourth film, that the third had been particularly well done and that Paul Anderson was talking with Sony about the possibility. [...] In June 2008, Anderson noted that negotiations were underway with Sony for creating the film. In December 2008, Anderson stated that he was working on the script. The following year, it was announced that Sony was aiming to release Resident Evil: Afterlife by August 27, 2010.|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Preston North End {{asked for}} {{permission}} to speak to Westley with the view to employing him as their new manager. Though the Hertfordshire club described the approach as [...] "unwelcome", permission was granted. After personal terms and a compensation package were agreed, Westley was announced as Preston's new manager on 13 January. His first game {{in charge of the}} club was a 2–0 home defeat against Leyton Orient on 21 January. After the game, it was revealed that Westley had told players the starting line-up for the game courtesy of a 2am text message {{on the day of the}} match. He picked up his first win as Preston manager in his fourth game in charge, securing a 1–0 home victory over Hartlepool United on 14 February 2012. Following Preston's 2–0 televised defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in March 2012, Westley stated that a Sheffield Wednesday player had informed him that four Preston players had leaked the Preston team and tactics to opposition players ahead of the match. Westley stated [...] "It doesn't <b>surprise</b> <b>me.</b> When you have got people in your own camp working against you it is tough". Preston won just two games out of the next 17 during the remainder of the campaign, and finished the season in 15th place. At the end of the season, Westley criticised the club's [...] "mediocre" [...] mentality, stating the squad have [...] "not got a clue what it takes to get success".|$|E

500|$|Wenger {{appointed}} Vieira as club captain following Adams' retirement, {{and made}} few additions to his double-winning squad, signing defender Pascal Cygan, midfielder Gilberto Silva and utility player Kolo Touré. He was confident his side would retain {{the league and}} told the media: [...] "Nobody will finish above us in the league. It wouldn't <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> {{if we were to}} go unbeaten for the whole of the season". Arsenal set a new top-flight record in their opening game of the 2002–03 season; a 2–0 victory against Birmingham City was their 14th league win in succession. They continued their fine start by overhauling Nottingham Forest's top-flight record of 22 away league matches without defeat and later surpassed Manchester United's Premier League total of 29 matches unbeaten. Arsenal lost to Everton in October 2002, which began a run of four matches without a win. Though Wenger's team built an eight-point lead over challengers Manchester United by March 2003, they were overhauled in the final weeks of the season. [...] The title race shifted in United's favour when Bolton Wanderers came from behind to draw 2–2 against Arsenal. Wenger showed moments of exasperation during the match by loosening his tie and bellowing orders from the touchline. Journalist Phil McNulty wrote that Wenger's demeanor [...] "spoke of someone who had the title in his grasp but now saw it slipping from his fingers". Arsenal beat Southampton 1–0 to retain the FA Cup {{at the end of the}} campaign.|$|E
500|$|Changeling {{sits with}} other late-period Eastwood films in which parenting—and {{the search for}} family—is a theme. It makes literal the parental {{struggle}} to communicate with children. It {{can also be seen}} as a variation of the Eastwood [...] "revenge movie" [...] ethic; in this case, the [...] "avenging grunt" [...] transforms into a courteous woman who only once makes a foul-mouthed outburst. Eastwood dealt with themes of child endangerment in A Perfect World(1993) and Mystic River(2003). Changeling is a thematic companion piece to Mystic River, which also depicted a community contaminated by an isolated, violent act against a child—a comparison with which Eastwood agreed. He said that showing a child in danger was [...] "about the highest form of drama you can have", as crimes against them were to him the most horrible. Eastwood explained that crimes against children represented a theft of lives and innocence. He said, [...] "When [...] comes along quite as big as this one, you question humanity. It never ceases to <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> how cruel humanity can be." [...] Samuel Blumenfeld of Le Monde said the scene featuring Northcott's execution by hanging was [...] "unbearable" [...] due to its attention to detail; he believed {{it one of the most}} convincing pleas against the death penalty imaginable. Eastwood noted that for a supporter of capital punishment, Northcott was an ideal candidate, and that in a perfect world the death penalty might be an appropriate punishment for such a crime. He said that crimes against children would be at the top of his list for justifications of capital punishment, but that whether one were pro- or anti-capital punishment, the barbarism of public executions must be recognized. Eastwood argued that in putting the guilty party before his victims' families, justice may be done, but after such a spectacle the family would find it hard to find peace. The scene's realism was deliberate: the audience hears Northcott's neck breaking, his body swings, and his feet shake. It was Eastwood's intention to make it unbearable to watch.|$|E
2500|$|.....it {{does not}} <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> much that Roman Jackiw {{said that the}} paper {{satisfied}} everything he expects from an acceptable paper—the knowledge of the jargon and some degree of original ideas.

2500|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{nationalisation}} of Bradford & Bingley's mortgage book the press suggested that merging it with Northern Rock was a possibility. In October 2008 the chairman Ron Sandler noted that there had been informal talks concerning the idea of the merger with the government, but there had been no subsequent discussion. Sandler did however add [...] "It would not <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> at some point if a closer look was taken at the method of managing loan books within government-owned banks".|$|E
2500|$|... ith hindsight, I {{can see how}} if {{somebody}} got Led Zeppelin III, which was so different from what we'd done before, and they only had a short time to review it on the record player in the office, then they missed the content. They were in a rush and {{they were looking for}} the new [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] and not actually listening to what was there. It was too fresh for them and they didn't get the plot. So, in retrospect, it doesn't <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> that the diversity and breadth of what we were doing was overlooked or under-appreciated at the time.|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 2007, Commissioner Gail Heriot testified {{about the}} agency's {{value on the}} 50th anniversary of {{the passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1957. Heriot told the Senate Committee on the Judiciary: [...] "If the value of a federal agency could be {{calculated}} on a per dollar basis, it would not <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> to find the Commission on Civil Rights to be among the best investments Congress ever made. My back-of-the-envelope calculation is that the Commission now accounts for less than 1/2000th of 1 percent of the federal budget; back in the late 1950s its size would have been roughly similar. And yet its impact has been dramatic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Forza Horizon was {{developed}} by UK-based Playground Games, which is composed of employees who formerly worked at various studios renowned for earlier racing titles and series such as Project Gotham Racing, Driver, , Colin McRae Rally, [...] and Burnout. When asked about Playground Games' involvement, Dan Greenawalt, the head of Turn 10 Studios, said, [...] "I wouldn't trust this partner as much as I do if I didn't expect them to <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> and surprise our players. I have respect {{for their ability to}} come up with great ideas. So I think yes, they are challenged by the customers the same way we are to surprise them with innovation. That's how they see themselves, that's how we see them, it's how they see us. It's really a shared goal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Merrily We Roll Along (1981), {{with a book}} by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's more {{traditional}} scores; Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, [...] "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." [...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed? I'm not sure I would put it like that. What did <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> was the feeling around the Broadway community – if you can call it that, though I guess I will {{for lack of a better}} word – that they wanted Hal and me to fail." ...|$|E

He told the Chicago Inter Ocean: [...] "I have forty detectives at work today on the theory that the criminals lived in the neighborhood of the Paroubek home. We are investigating every incident of the lives of the Paroubeks since they came to Chicago in order to trace a possible enemy. It will <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> if the criminals are not arrested within a week." [...] To the Chicago Tribune he stated, [...] "We have one or two theories, but nothing specific enough to even talk about. I intend to place more men on the case tomorrow." [...] Lt. Costello returned to investigating the anonymous letters. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Hoffman's and Paroubek's theory as fact.|$|E

2500|$|Aided by {{the signing}} of Spanish All-Star Pau Gasol, Bryant lead his team to a West best 57–25 record. The Lakers swept the Nuggets {{in the first round}} and on May 6, 2008, and Bryant was officially {{announced}} as the league MVP. He said, [...] "It's been a long ride. I'm very proud to represent this organization, to represent this city." [...] West, who was responsible for bringing Bryant to the Lakers, was on hand at the press conference to observe Bryant receive his MVP trophy from NBA commissioner David Stern. He stated, [...] "Kobe deserved it. He's had just another great season. Doesn't <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> one bit." [...] In addition to winning his MVP award, Bryant was the only unanimous selection to the All-NBA team on May 8, 2008 for the third straight season and sixth time in his career. He would then headline the NBA All-Defensive First Team with Kevin Garnett, receiving 52 points overall including 24 first-place nods, earning his eighth selection.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 19, 2015 radio {{interview}} with Hugh Hewitt, Palin {{was asked about}} the legalization of recreational marijuana in Alaska, to which Palin responded, [...] "We've got that libertarian streak in us, and I grew up in Alaska when pot was legal anyway. It was absolutely no big deal. I mean, you didn't smoke it because your parents would strangle you. And if you were a jock and you were, you know, a Christian going to youth group, you just didn't do it, right? And I still believe that. But when it comes to picking our battles, for many of us in Alaska, legalization of marijuana just was never really a bright blip on the radar screen, so it didn't <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> when the voters of Alaska went back to legalizing it. For some years there, it had not been legalized. I look on the national scene and think, 'Wow, of all things to be fighting over and battling over.' Especially when it comes to medical marijuana, I think, 'Hmm. It's just not my baby.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Glock's {{views are}} {{echoed in the}} work of Khaled Nashef, a Palestinian {{archaeologist}} at Bir Zeit and editor of the University's Journal of Palestinian Archaeology, who writes that for too long the history of Palestine has been written by Christian and Israeli [...] "biblical archaeologists", and that Palestinians must themselves re-write that history, beginning with the archaeological recovery of ancient Palestine. Such a perspective can also be seen in the practices of Hamdan Taha, the director of the Palestinian National Authority's Department of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage, responsible for overseeing preservation and excavation projects that involve both internationals and Palestinians. Gerrit van der Kooij, an archaeologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands who works with Taha, says that, [...] "It doesn't <b>surprise</b> <b>me</b> that outsiders become frustrated [...] sticks by his policy of equal partnership. That means Palestinians must be involved at every step," [...] from planning and digging to publishing. In Van der Kooij's opinion, this policy is [...] "fully justified and adds more social value to the project." ...|$|E
