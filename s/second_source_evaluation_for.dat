40|$|This work proposes an {{innovative}} approach to heat <b>sources</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>for</b> heat pump applications. The initial {{characterization of the}} suitable sources (i. e. air, ground, and water) is integrated with classical considerations about HVAC design. In particular, we aim to evaluate the operative performance of overall HP system when it is coupled with each source, separately. Then, final performances are ranked according to a proper energy/economy performance index. The paper starts dealing with the basic thermodynamic principles of heat pumps, focusing on the main effects of sources’ temperature on COP/EER values. Then, the paper illustrates the main {{pros and cons of}} typical heat sources and ground heat exchanger configurations. Finally, we show the achievable benefits of the proposed methodology through a test case...|$|R
40|$|This work proposes an {{innovative}} {{approach to the}} ground <b>source</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>for</b> heat pump systems. The initial characterization of the soil (e. g. thermo-physical properties, temperature.) is integrated with classical considerations about HVAC design. In particular, we propose to analyze the viability of a ground source project through the evaluation of its final operative performances. The achievable savings with respect to alternative technologies become the key-parameter for project viability and system design. The proposed methodology aims to investigate the best level of exploitation of the ground source according to soil thermo-physical properties, local external climate, building thermal load, and back-ups efficiency. Through a plain test case, we show how the utilization of the sole GSHP technology, even if technically feasible, {{might not be the}} best design solution: indeed, the large number of required ground heat exchangers could make the project unfavorable. On the contrary, a proper synergy among GSHP and back-up generators leads to notable energetic and economic benefits, ensuring higher energetic performances, lower installation costs, and a sustainable exploitation of the ground-source...|$|R

40|$|The current {{research}} compared {{the effectiveness of}} safe sex interventions that utilize an emotional education narrative style (Targeted Emotional Education Modules, or TEEMs) to those that utilize an imperative style. In a 2 (emotional education vs. imperative narrative style) by 2 (high vs. low normative expertise) by 2 (positive vs. negative valence) experimental design, participants were exposed to a safe sex intervention video in which two females discussed condom use or nonuse following a hookup at a party. Condom use attitudes and intentions were assessed immediately following the intervention, and actual condom use was assessed approximately one month later. While TEEMs were not necessarily more effective in promoting condom use attitudes and behaviors long-term, this study did provide support for the effectiveness of brief, cost-effective narrative video interventions. The imperative style promoted affective processing of the message, which triggered an underlying persuasive process that promoted rational processing of the message, followed by message and <b>source</b> <b>evaluation,</b> which finally impacted condom attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. Both message valence and normative expertise of the communicator exerted individual and combined effects on the persuasion process, such that message valence impacted affective processing and perceptions of normative expertise, with normative expertise positively influencing message and <b>source</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Implications <b>for</b> narrative health interventions are discussed based on these findings...|$|R

The Internet context has been implicated in making <b>source</b> <b>evaluation</b> particularly difficult <b>for</b> students, as source information presented on a search results page often looks uniform (Gerjets, Kammerer, & Werner, 2011), and certain source markers, such as publisher and author, may be obscured in favor of relevancy indicators, such as key words (Goldman, 2011). Further, any website {{can be made to}} look professional and reliable with great ease, obfuscating the difference between reliable and unreliable sources (Alexander & Tate, 1999). Given the volume of information available on the Internet and the open nature of the online publishing culture, <b>source</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{has been found to be}} an essential skill for today’s students (Brand-Gruwel & Stadtler, 2011).

40|$|Abstract. Schema {{matching}} plays {{a central}} role in many applications that require interoperability among heterogeneous data <b>sources.</b> A good <b>evaluation</b> <b>for</b> different capabilities of schema matching systems has become vital as the complexity of such systems arises. The capabilities of matching systems incorporate different (possibly conflicting) aspects among them match quality and match efficiency. The analysis of efficiency of a schema matching system, if it is done, tends to be done in a way separate from the analysis of effectiveness. In this paper, we present the trade-off between schema matching effectiveness and efficiency as a multi-objective optimization problem. This representation enables us to obtain a combined measure as a compromise between them. We combine both performance aspects in a weighted-average function to determine the cost-effectiveness of a schema matching system. We apply our proposed approach to evaluate two currently existing mainstream schema matching systems namely COMA++ and BTreeMatch. Experimental results showed that, by carefully utilizing both small-scale and large-scale schemas, it is necessary to take the response time of the matching process into account especially in large-scale schemas...|$|R

40|$|Approximately {{one third}} of the elderly (over age 65) fall each year. Falls are the {{one of the main reasons}} of injury-related cases and the leading cause of {{accidental}} deaths among the elderly. The overwhelming majority of studies about falls using ICT are related to fall detection, which copes with the fall accidents and injuries that have occurred. The fall prevention aims to avoid falls before falls occurred. Only few studies have investigated fall prevention by using ICT. Currently, there are no relevant studies to fall prevention by ubiquitous computing. Objectives of this thesis are to investigate what are effective measures of fall prevention and how mobile and ubiquitous computing can support these measures for the elderly. This thesis project mainly applies several methods: Precaution Adoption Process Model to design the prototype applications, the iterative process, user participation in the whole process, and several other core design principles. The outcome of this thesis project includes a use case, usage scenarios, a high-level and interactive prototype, a system overall architecture, implementation of two prototype applications (open <b>source),</b> and <b>evaluations</b> <b>for</b> a high-level prototype and two prototype applications using a modified heuristic evaluation method. The <b>evaluation</b> <b>for</b> high-level prototype was performed by using the semi-structured interview with 4 participants. The <b>evaluation</b> <b>for</b> prototype applications was conducted by using a street survey (9 participants) and semi-structured interviews (3 participants). The findings from evaluations reveal that the prototype applications using mobile and ubiquitous computing could support the fall prevention well in usefulness, ease of use, intention of use (on tablets). The prototype applications works in two modes: interactive mode (fall risk assessments, fall prevention information, and social interactions), ambient display mode (smart photo frame: in the living room or the bedroom, and without requiring users? any direct interactions). The prototype applications aim to demonstrate the mobile and ubiquitous technologies could support the elderly in fall prevention. This thesis also demonstrates: 1. The prototype applications are possible to meet the challenge of personal relevance by enabling the elderly to perform fall risk assessments. 2. They enable the elderly to acquire knowledge about fall prevention. 3. They are possible to support the fall prevention program on a large population with low costs and without requiring amounts of health professionals to participate in, unlike traditional prevention programs. 4. They are possible to increase the acceptability for fall prevention among the elderly and enable the elderly to have behavioral changes about lowering the chances of falling, in a non-obtrusive and unconscious manner (users casually glance while passing by the prototype system) ...|$|R
