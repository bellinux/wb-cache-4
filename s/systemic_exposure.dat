40|$|High <b>systemic</b> <b>exposures</b> to {{calcitriol}} {{are necessary}} for optimal antitumor effects. Human prostate cancer PC 3 cells are insensitive to calcitriol treatment. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of 24 -hydroxylase (CYP 24 A 1), the major calcitriol inactivating enzyme, by ketoconazole (KTZ) or RC 2204 modulates calcitriol serum pharmacokinetics and biologic effects. Dexamethasone (Dex) was added to minimize calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia and as a steroid replacement for the KTZ inhibition of steroid biosynthesis cytochrome P 450 enzymes. KTZ effectively inhibited time-dependent calcitriol-inducible CYP 24 A 1 protein expression and enzyme activity in PC 3 cells and C 3 H/HeJ mouse kidney tissues. <b>Systemic</b> calcitriol <b>exposure</b> area under the curve was higher in mice treated {{with a combination of}} calcitriol and KTZ than with calcitriol alone. KTZ and Dex synergistically potentiated calcitriol-mediated antiproliferative effects in PC 3 cells in vitro; this effect was associated with enhanced apoptosis. After treatment with calcitriol and KTZ/Dex, although caspase- 9 and caspase- 3 were not activated and cytochrome c was not released by mitochondria, caspase- 8 was activated and the truncated Bid protein level was increased. Translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor to the nucleus was observed, indicating a role of the apoptosis-inducing factor-mediated and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways. Calcitriol and KTZ/Dex combination suppressed the clonogenic survival and enhanced the growth inhibition observed with calcitriol alone in PC 3 human prostate cancer xenograft mouse model. Our results show that the administration of calcitriol in combination with CYP 24 A 1 inhibitor enhances antiproliferative effects, increases <b>systemic</b> calcitriol <b>exposure,</b> and promotes the activation of caspase-independent apoptosis pathway...|$|R
