5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often <b>stick</b> to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not <b>stick</b> until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might <b>stick</b> to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E

40|$|The <b>sticking</b> {{behavior}} of different mold materials was investigated. <b>Sticking</b> of different molds {{can be described}} by two material specific values: the "lower" and the "upper" <b>sticking</b> temperatures.

This concoction on a <b>stick</b> was invented by Larry Fyfe, an entrepreneur and concessionaire at the fair. Versions at the Iowa State Fair have also been prepared and served formed as balls.

5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted control <b>stick.</b> Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by twisting the <b>stick.</b> No mechanical linkages were used, the <b>stick</b> instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E

5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his <b>stick</b> on the ice, {{and when he saw}} the misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his <b>stick</b> raised. Parise nearly swung his <b>stick</b> at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair on the ice.

5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel <b>stick</b> procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel <b>stick</b> procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel <b>stick</b> procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E

Afterwards, Hardy jumped {{off the top of}} a padded turnbuckle onto both Williams and Roode at ringside. Later, Roode re-entered the ring with Hardy remaining at ringside, allowing Jeff Jarrett to attack Hardy from behind with a hockey <b>stick.</b> Jarrett then pushed Hardy into the ring with Roode covering for the pinfall victory at 9 minutes and 7 seconds.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{evaluation}} method of image <b>sticking</b> was proposed by measuring 2 -Dimension of luminance level. We used the 2 D-CCD luminance meter and pattern generator for chessboard pattern.

The normalized value was so sensitive {{for determining the}} image <b>sticking</b> level. We proposed a new parameter of ISV(image <b>sticking</b> value) for increasing sensitivity. It was resulted that the image <b>sticking</b> under ISV 1 % was difficult to be detected by human eye. And the image <b>sticking</b> over ISV 2 % was strongly detected. It was found that this test method is similar to human eye testing result. Therefore, this analysis method helps to determine the objective image <b>sticking</b> level. 1...|$|R
