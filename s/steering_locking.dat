50|$|The {{steerable}} front {{truck was}} fitted with twin duplex wheels (four tyres), the inner wheels equipped with pneumatic drum brakes.

5000|$|Passenger {{automobile}} regulations {{implemented by}} the U.S. Department of Transportation required the <b>locking</b> of <b>steering</b> wheel rotation (or transmission locked in [...] "park") to hinder motor vehicle theft; in most vehicles, this is accomplished when the ignition key {{is removed from the}} ignition <b>lock.</b> See <b>steering</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{vehicles}} are {{fitted with a}} <b>steering</b> <b>lock</b> which is an anti-theft device. It is fitted to the steering column usually below the <b>steering</b> wheel. The <b>lock</b> is combined with the ignition switch and engaged and disengaged either by a mechanical ignition key or electronically from the vehicles electronic control unit. These locks were introduced on many General Motor products in 1969 drastically reducing thefts of these GM models, [...] and on Ford, Chrysler, and AMC products in 1970.|$|R

The export 968E (destined mostly for the Eastern Bloc) had headlights able to meet international standards, a safety glass windscreen, and anti-theft <b>steering</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R

50|$|Despite {{customer}} complaints, the Wiesel {{retained its}} predecessors hard upholstery, lockable fuel tap flap {{and lack of}} a <b>steering</b> <b>lock.</b> It was easy for a thief to force the flap, and Der deutsche Straßenverkehrs testers were astonished that IWL had not rectified this fault from the previous model.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1955, reporters from the East German Der deutsche Straßenverkehr magazine tested the Pitty and gave IWL numerous suggestions to improve it. Numerous customers who bought the scooter also complained. The Pitty has a dualseat that riders complained was too hard. Unlike most scooters, the Pitty has no <b>steering</b> <b>lock</b> for security. Its only anti-theft device is a flap in the enclosure under the seat that can be closed over the fuel tap and locked. IWL reacted to criticism by quickly developing a successor model, and kept the Pitty in production for only just over a year. In this time a total of only 11,293 Pitty scooters were built.|$|R

Extensive testing {{was carried out}} with take-offs, landings and taxiing on different surfaces including unprepared fields as well as ploughed land. Conversion was completed in 1938 and the flight trials proved the stability and manoeuvrability of the tri-cycle undercarriage during extensive taxiing trials, (landings and take-offs were carried out with the nosewheel <b>steering</b> <b>locked).</b> The fate of the RWD 20 is unknown {{but it did not}} survive WWII.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The fitting of {{security}} devices to motor vehicles {{has become an}} important approach to the prevention of motor vehicle crime. In cars, manu-facturers have focused primarily on improving perimeter security to prevent breaking-in to the vehicle, and installing devices to prevent parked vehicles from being unlawfully driven away. The <b>steering</b> column <b>lock</b> Is an Important example of this approach, being {{the outcome of the}} first and only regulations requiring vehicles to befitted with anti-theft devices. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first country to Introduce such regulations, In 1961, followed nearly ten years later by the U. S. and Britain. This paper examines the effect of these regulations on motor vehicle crime In each of these countries. The evidence from all three countries is that <b>steering</b> column <b>locks</b> have helped to bring vehicle theft, particularly theftfor temporary use, under control for lengthy periods. The paper provides evidence that the speed with which the vehicle population has been protected by <b>steering</b> column <b>locks,</b> and the availability of other types of vehicles notprotected by such anti-theft devices, are Important issues in explaining theft patterns...|$|R
