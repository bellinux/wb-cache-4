50|$|Petcore {{was founded}} in 1993 to promote the collection, sorting and {{recycling}} of post-consumer PET bottles. It networks with national collection agencies, governments, and the recycling industry. Used PET, or polyethylene terphthalate bottles are light-weight but once collected, <b>sorted</b> and <b>pressed</b> into bales, they become a valuable feedstock {{for a range of}} products. End markets for recycled PET include polyester fibre, sheet, strapping, and new bottles.|$|R

They started a kind of bowing dance about me, and <b>sort</b> of <b>pressed</b> me to take a pathway that lay through the trees. It was clear to me they didn't take me for a British citizen, {{whatever}} else they thought of me, and for my own part I was never less anxious to own up to the old country.|$|R
25|$|With the {{successful}} landing, the Allies effectively {{gained control of}} the sea lanes of communication to the Bismarck Sea, having secured lodgements {{on either side of}} the Vitiaz Strait, after earlier capturing Finschhafen. In January 1944, as they <b>sort</b> to <b>press</b> their advantage further, another Dexterity operation was conducted on the New Guinea coast with a landing at Saidor as the Huon Peninsula was cleared by Australian and US forces. In response, the Japanese high command at Rabaul ordered their forces withdrawing from the Huon Peninsula to bypass Saidor, and they subsequently began withdrawing towards Madang.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} NewsCATS (news categorization and trading system), a system implemented to predict stock price trends {{for the time}} immediately {{after the publication of}} press releases. NewsCATS consists mainly of three components. The first component retrieves relevant information from press releases through the application of text preprocessing techniques. The second component <b>sorts</b> the <b>press</b> releases into predefined categories. Finally, appropriate trading strategies are derived by the third component by means of the earlier categorization. The findings indicate that a categorization of press releases is able to provide additional information {{that can be used to}} forecast stock price trends, but that an adequate trading strategy is essential for the results of the categorization to be fully exploited...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{elicitation}} / {{discussion about}} the particular uses of plants. In the previous week, a botanist had visited the village. The native/local biologist pointed out plants and the botanist sampled pieces of bark, leaves, fruits or sometimes even flowers. After each walk the samples were <b>sorted</b> and <b>pressed</b> as vouchers {{to take to the}} Herbarium in Lae for further identification. While the botanist collected samples, I wrote down the name of each plant and made some notes about its use or significance. This way, about 150 lexical items were collected over the course of two days. This recording is part of revisiting those 150 lexical items and plants in order to record the correct pronunciation and inquire further about the usage of each particular plant...|$|R

5000|$|Chillwave {{reached its}} peak in mid 2010. Reynolds' refers to 2010 as the [...] "Year of Chillwave Backlash, a flurry of jibes almost as formularized as detractors make out the music to be: {{obligatory}} reference to Hipstamatic + snigger at the name + invocation of nostalgia as a priori Bad Thing = entire region of music dismissed." [...] George McIntire of the San Francisco Bay Guardian described its origin as in the [...] "throes of the blogosphere" [...] and called the term a [...] "cheap, slap-on label used to describe grainy, dancey, lo-fi, 1980s inspired music" [...] and a [...] "disservice to any band associated with it." [...] In 2011, Carles indicated that the bands he spoke to [...] "get annoyed" [...] by the tag, explaining [...] "It was just ridiculous that any <b>sort</b> of <b>press</b> took it seriously. ... But they understand that it's been a good thing. What about iTunes making it an official genre? It's now theoretically a marketable indie sound." ...|$|R
60|$|Arrived at a cafe whose window {{appeared}} to be a sort of museum of every kind of German sausage, they took possession of a vacant table and ordered coffee. Mike soon found himself soothed by his bright surroundings, and gradually his impressions of blancmange, Edward, and Comrade Prebble faded from his mind. Psmith, meanwhile, was preserving an unusual silence, being deep in a large square book of the <b>sort</b> in which <b>Press</b> cuttings are pasted. As Psmith scanned its contents a curious smile lit up his face. His reflections seemed to be of an agreeable nature.|$|R
50|$|After the extravaganza of le Vide {{eventually}} subsided, Klein's new found celebrity {{allowed him}} artistic endeavors based on commission, including the collaborative design, construction, and decoration of the Gelsenkirchen Opera House in West Germany. Klein {{seemed to have}} moved beyond the cramped confines of the Galerie Iris Clert: the small gallery could only house the plans of the project. These plans were given the lengthy title of La Collaboration Internationale entre Artistes et Architectes dans la realization du Nouvel Opéra et theater de Gelsenkirchen (International Collaboration between Artists and Architects in {{the realization of the}} New Opera and theater of Gelsenkirchen), and acted as a <b>sort</b> of avant-garde <b>press</b> release for the new opera house.|$|R
60|$|This {{caused a}} fresh {{outburst}} of commotion. At {{a signal from}} the leader above a number of well-armed men, who were evidently a <b>sort</b> of body-guard, <b>pressed</b> forward {{to the door and}} drove back the crowd with blows from the staves of their pikes. Presently those who had entered began to pour out, and in {{a quarter of an hour}} the house was cleared. As soon as it was so the windows were lit up by a lurid light which showed that it had been fired on each floor, and the flames very soon burst out through the casements. Satisfied with having done this the butchers returned to their quarter, and Guy mounted to the chamber of Simon Bouclier. The man had evidently just returned, as he too wore a white hood. He had been carrying a torch in the procession, and this was stuck into a ring on the wall.|$|R

Colonial administration meddling in the government system has not developed economic development based on social justice as expected. Effects of discrimination for many years led to the Malays began to become discouraged, lose self confidence, low self-esteem that had spawned feeling that they are not able to do what other people should do. An undeniable fact, after the country gained independence, the Malays only gained political power shared other ethnic groups. Unfortunately, the same does not happen in the economic sphere, after various of development policies and social policies introduced by the government, their participation is still far behind compared to the other races until now. Thus, the redevelopment of the Malays economy need social engineering (change planned) with regard to culture and social structure system that suits with them that they should not continue to left behind the mainstream when the country achieved developed country...|$|R
5000|$|The {{hotel is}} {{described}} in a diary of Lady Lamington, wife of the Governor of Queensland Lord Lamington between 1896 and 1901. In 1897, while travelling privately to meet her husband at Rockhampton on his return from New Guinea, her boat encountered bad weather and {{it was agreed that}} she, her husband's secretary and his wife should hire a vehicle and driver and travel the last section overland. They stayed one night at the Raglan Hotel [...] "a wooden hut with some small trees nearby." [...] The hotel was run by a woman and her children, one of whom had recently died and who she had buried, presumably {{in the vicinity of the}} inn. Lady Lamington remembered that:"We were shown into the house, one rather small centre room with a sort of counter on one side for a bar, and behind this room were two or three bedrooms. The floor and walls were of planks which had shrunk after being put up, so we could with little effort, see what was going on in the next room, and as the floor was the same, I used to see the chickens scratching the ground under the floor between the short wooden piles on which the little Hotel!!! was built. The walls had coloured and uncoloured illustrations from different newspapers stuck on them in places, which made one's room a little more private. There was only one bedroom and a <b>sort</b> of <b>press</b> with a bed in it. We had only one very small basin between us for our ablutions. It was easy to empty it by just opening a wooden window, but not so easy to get the water to fill it again. I have seen a good deal during my travels but sitting there in the little Bush shanty listening to this good woman's stories was very touching. Next morning I was woke up by hearing the children bringing in the cows for milking"A photograph, which survives, was taken of the inn on this occasion by Pascoe Stuart, the Governor's secretary. Since then, rooms have been added to the ends of the building, but the simple rectangular form and open area at the front remain.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{portrayal}} of facial injury during the First World War to contemporary photographs of veterans injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the most poignant innovations of the Great War was the production of portrait masks for severely disfigured servicemen: the surgical ‘failures’. In London and Paris, professional sculptors {{were responsible for the}} provision of these delicate masks, and their results are recorded in the photographs of British home front photographer Horace Nicholls and in a silent film of Anna Coleman Ladd at work in her American Red Cross studio in Paris. Both sources document the artistry of prosthetic repair, and Nicholls’ images dramatize the psychological impact of facial mutilation – regarded {{by many to be the}} most dehumanizing of injuries. Paradoxically, though, the juxtaposition of human face and portrait mask disturbs the equation of identity and appearance on which traditional portraiture depends. Given the professed ‘death of the portrait,’ one might expect a different treatment of disfigurement today; a loosening of the conviction that appearance and identity are relatively fixed; a more dispersed conception of personhood. Images from recent conflicts do not bear this out, however, and the representation of disfigured veterans (indeed, disfigurement of any <b>sort)</b> in the <b>press</b> and popular culture remains convention-bound. We will look at the work of two contemporary photographers, Nina Berman (American) and Stuart Griffiths (British), whose portraits of veterans challenge the usual narratives of sacrifice, courage and redemption – including the fantasy of repair...|$|R
60|$|The {{clash of}} arms filled that prim garden, which {{hitherto}} had known no more warlike sound than {{the click of}} clipping shears; and presently {{the upper part of}} an old lady's body was projected out of a window upstairs. She tossed her arms above her white cap, scolding in a cracked voice. The gardener remained glued to the tree, his toothless mouth open in idiotic astonishment, and a little farther up the path the pretty girl, as if spellbound to a small grass plot, ran a few steps this way and that, wringing her hands and muttering crazily. She did not rush between the combatants: the onslaughts of Lieut. Feraud were so fierce that her heart failed her. Lieut. D'Hubert, his faculties concentrated upon defence, needed all his skill and science of the sword to stop the rushes of his adversary. Twice already he had to break ground. It bothered him to feel his foothold made insecure by the round, dry gravel of the path rolling under the hard soles of his boots. This was most unsuitable ground, he thought, keeping a watchful, narrowed gaze, shaded by long eyelashes, upon the fiery stare of his thick-set adversary. This absurd affair would ruin his reputation of a sensible, well-behaved, promising young officer. It would damage, at any rate, his immediate prospects, and lose him the good-will of his general. These worldly preoccupations were no doubt misplaced in view of the solemnity of the moment. A duel, whether regarded as a ceremony in the cult of honour, or even when reduced in its moral essence to a form of manly sport, demands a perfect singleness of intention, a homicidal austerity of mood. On the other hand, this vivid concern for his future had not a bad effect inasmuch as it began to rouse the anger of Lieut. D'Hubert. Some seventy seconds had elapsed since they had crossed blades, and Lieut. D'Hubert had to break ground again in order to avoid impaling his reckless adversary like a beetle for a cabinet of specimens. The result was that misapprehending the motive, Lieut. Feraud with a triumphant <b>sort</b> of snarl <b>pressed</b> his attack.|$|R
