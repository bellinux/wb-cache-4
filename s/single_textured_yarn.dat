30|$|Increasing effect-yarn {{draw and}} effect-yarn overfeed {{increases}} {{the level of}} texturing and reduces strength, elongation and tenacity in both steam-jet and air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn.</b> When the steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> is considered, {{it can be concluded}} that spun-like <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> can be made satisfactorily using steam as an alternative fluid to air. Steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> has a similar filament entanglement structure to air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn.</b> Steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> has a stronger and more compact structure than air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> where the steam-jet yarn loops are shrunken due the effect of heat setting. Furthermore, steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> has less shrinkage and therefore post intermingled heat setting could be eliminated and the production cost of the spun-like <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> using steam could further be reduced.

30|$|The {{objective}} of this research work {{was to investigate the}} use of steam as a substitute fluid for air in spun-like <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> manufacturing. The new substitute product holds the potential for competitive advantage, lower manufacturing costs and streamlined manufacturing capabilities. Generally high-pressure steam is known to be cheaper to produce than compressed air. An existing air-jet texturing machine was modified to supply either air or steam to the texturing nozzle. Using an identical nozzle, both air-jet and steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> were manufactured. The influence of effect-yarn parameters on the steam-jet texturing performance has been studied. Furthermore, steam-jet texturing was compared with air-jet texturing in terms of the processing parameters and the <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> properties. The results show that spun-like <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> manufactured using steam has lower loop instability, lower loop density and higher tensile properties than air at comparable fluid pressures. SEM image analysis shows that the entangled structure of the steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> is comparable to the air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns.</b> To verify the commercial feasibility of the new product, sewing threads were manufactured using both steam-jet and air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> and tested for sewability under commercial specifications. Sewability results indicated that the steam-jet textured sewing threads can withstand sewing at high-speeds like air-jet textured threads and are therefore suitable for manufacture of sewing threads. Therefore, it can be concluded that steam can be used as an alternative fluid for air in making spun-like <b>textured</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
30|$|In general, steam {{generation}} cost is comparatively lower than {{compressed air generation}} cost. If the identical jets are used, steam consumption is less than air consumption in terms of Kg/hour. Therefore, when the steam-jet and air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> are compared, {{it can be concluded}} that steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> is more economical to produce than air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn.</b> Furthermore, environmental friendly alternative fluids such as biomass could be used to produce steam.|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} of loop density {{in the case}} of steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns,</b> could due to higher level of entanglement. The results conform to earlier results suggesting that more entangled yarns have more loops due to the smaller effect of shrinkage. The results are consistent with the earlier results that steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> have lower loop density than air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns.</b> It is believed that the steam shrinks the loops of yarn in texturing.|$|R

30|$|Generally {{high-pressure}} steam {{is known to}} be cheaper to produce than compressed air. This factor is critical when it is considered that the largest obstacle {{to the development of a}} successful performance air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> has been the energy cost involved in generating compressed air. Although the reduced cost of a pressurised fluid was of great interest on its own, high pressure steam has extra useful properties such as the in-built high energy content which could theoretically be used to thermally set the thread, thus obviating the need for separate electric heaters to achieve stabilisation. This could reduce further the energy requirement of the process and simplify the production machine design thus driving down cost further. The aim of this paper is to analyze and compare the properties of steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> with air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> made under similar process conditions with varying effect-yarn draw ratio and overfeed. Furthermore, sewing threads were manufactured using both air-jet and steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> and tested for sewability of the threads to check the feasibility of this yarns for sewing thread applications.|$|R

30|$|Since air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> {{has already}} been {{established}} within the industry, {{it is vital to}} improve the yarn quality while reducing the production cost. Since the production costs have already been reduced significantly by minimising compressed air consumption and using POY etc., attention is now needed at saving costs elsewhere. One option would be to find a cheaper substitute fluid for air as a texturing medium. There is no literature regarding this so far. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop the use of high-pressure steam, as a substitute fluid for compressed air to produce spun-like <b>textured</b> <b>yarn.</b> The new product holds the potential for competitive advantage, lower manufacturing costs and streamlined manufacturing capabilities. The idea is to take the technology of air-jet texturing and to modify the process so that high-pressure steam can be used as the texturing medium. Furthermore, study of the effect of effect-yarn draw ratio and overfeed percentage is critical for the textile application perspectives since surface characteristic of the core-effect spun like <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> is mainly determined by the effect-yarn overfeed.|$|R
40|$|The air-jet {{texturing}} process is briefly introduced and its advantages over other texturing processes are summarized. Characteristics of air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> are stated with special {{reference to the}} stability of the yarns. Test methods used in industry and research to determine the "stability" or "instability" of air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> are critically reviewed. These methods involve different basic principles and therefore inevitably give different results. There is no consensus on a standard method. Effects of various test parameters, such as specimen length, test duration, and the alternatives of using a single yarn, a hank, or a skein as a test specimen are investigated. An improved test method is suggested as a standard instability test, and various existing methods are compared with it. Results of all the methods show similar trends for varying values of air pressure. Other yarn characteristics such as linear density, breaking elongation, and tenacity are also determined, and their indications of yarn quality are compared with the indications of instability tests.

40|$|POY yarns {{are well}} know and commercialized since 1970 s. On the other hand, air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> are very common {{due to their}} unique {{structure}} which looks like natural spun-staple yarns. In the air-jet texturing process, the <b>yarn</b> is <b>textured</b> by overfeeding into a high-pressure of air to create a looped and more natural yarn appearance and also the bulkiness level of the yarn is controlled by input speed and jet-take out speed. This process reassigns flat, continous synthetic yarns into entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun like structured yarns. They are of higher bulk, exhibits increased covering power, have a more subdued lustre and are warmer in hand. Therefore, air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> possess some unique properties that require investigation. Hence, in this study, first the texturing process is introduced briefly and its principle of manufacturing is illustrated, later four different types of yarns were produced with two different fibre cross-sections at the three different nozzle types and three different core yarn feeding.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of false-twist {{texturing}} parameters (texturing speed, heater temperature, draw ratio and disc-to-yarn speed ratio (D/Y ratio)) on the structure and crimp properties of polyester yarn has been studied using a high temperature heater and high texturing speeds. <b>Textured</b> <b>yarn</b> was analyzed and characterized {{in terms of the}} degree of crystallinity, degree of orientation and crimp properties (crimp contraction, crimp module and crimp stability). The most important parameters, significantly affecting yarn temperature and its uniformity and thus <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> structure and crimp properties, are texturing speed and heater temperature. Depending on these texturing parameters, the degree of crystallinity and orientation varied in the range of 24. 48 to 36. 66 % and 0. 371 to 0. 595, respectively. The crimp characteristics increase with the increase in heater temperature, and decrease with the increase in texturing speed. The effect of draw ratio and D/Y ratio on the <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> structure and properties is less pronounced.

30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, air-jet texturing, operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts flat, continuous synthetic filament yarns into an entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun-like yarn. Air-jet texturing has three types based on the supply yarn. Single-end air-jet texturing denotes the situation whereby single filament yarn is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> is withdrawn. In case of parallel air-jet texturing, two or more filaments yarns are fed at the same overfeed into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect air-jet texturing two different filament yarns are fed under different overfeeds into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect air-jet texturing, the lower overfeed yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher overfeed yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn overfeed determines the strength of the <b>textured</b> <b>yarn.</b> The effect-yarn overfeed determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn overfeed is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect air-jet texturing or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on air-jet texturing performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect air-jet texturing and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns.</b> He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|R
30|$|However, {{the loop}} density {{results and the}} {{microscopic}} inspections show that the <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> produced by higher effect-yarn overfeeds have bigger and more frequent loops.

40|$|This paper {{systematically}} {{investigates the}} effect of a number of geometric parameters on the texturing performance of air-jet texturing nozzles. In order to facilitate the research, an air-jet texturing nozzle with a rectangular cross section has been developed. The texturing performance of the nozzles is assessed by means of process observations and on-line measurement of stabilizing zone tension, and also by measuring the in creased linear density of the yams on <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> samples. Furthermore, instability, elongation at break, and tenacity are measured, and texturing quality is judged by visual inspections and examination of scanning electron microscopy images of the <b>textured</b> <b>yarns.</b> Tension in the stabilizing zone, increase in linear density, and to a somewhat lesser extent instability are reliable measures of texturing quality. The best texturing comes from nozzles with a slightly diverging main channel and a single air inlet hole located far from the nozzle exit. A curved diverging exit profile is essential for successful texturing. The results of the tests to determine {{the effect of}} air inlet angk are inconclusive and require further investigation...|$|R

30|$|In the beginning, air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> were {{produced}} by blowing {{a stream of}} air into twisted continuous filament yarns, while they were being overfed to the take-up bobbin (Wray & Entwistle 1968). Studies in the 1960 s by Wray and Entwistle (1969) were followed those by Sivakumar (1975) in the early 1970 s. Since 1980 s, researchers have mainly focused on investigating the effect of process parameters, nozzle geometry, and the air-flow behaviour on yarn texturing. Researchers (Acar 1988; Acar et al. 1986 b; Rangasamy et al. 1990) have studied the effect of filament fineness {{and concluded that the}} filaments with finer linear densities are more suitable for air-jet texturing due to their less bending and torsional stiffness that blow the filaments more easily that enhance the entanglement effectiveness. Supply yarn properties are important for texturing since resultant forces acting on filaments are determined by the fluid forces acting on the filaments (Acar 1991; Acar et al. 1986 b). Further Acar et al. (1986 c) found that the filament cross section also has direct influence on texturing and concluded that the non-circular filament cross sections have better filament texturing due to larger surface areas than the circular filament of equal linear density. Spin finish on filaments has a negative effect on the texturing process due to contamination of the texturing nozzle (Simmen 1987). However, researchers (Acar 1988; Acar & Demir 1987) dispute the above explanation and argued that most of the spin finish blow off from the filament due to the secondary air-low and the new jets are self cleaned. They suggest using a suitable spin-finish for air-jet texturing which removes them in filament wetting that improves the filament flexibility. Feeder yarn wetting was studied by many researchers (Acar & Demir 1987; Acar et al. 1986 d; Acar et al. 1986 a; Demir et al. 1988; Fisher & Wilson 1982; Kothari & Timble 1991) and reported that the feeder yarn wetting before the air-jet nozzle influence the stability of the texturing process as well as the <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> properties. Recent studies by Acar et al. (2006) reported that water acted as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the air-jet texturing process. Study by Kothari et al. (1996) attempted to characterise the structure of air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> in terms of migration parameters. Since air-jet texturing process was developed to feed POY yarns, research were carried out by Sengupta et al. (1989) to understand the influence of drawing variables on the properties of air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> made from POY feeder yarns.|$|R
