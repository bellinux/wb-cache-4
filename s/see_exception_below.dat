50|$|Most of Quebec observes DST. However, {{the eastern}} reaches of Quebec's North Shore, east of 63° west longitude, {{are in the}} Atlantic Time Zone, but do not observe DST (<b>see</b> <b>exception,</b> <b>below).</b> The effect is that in summer their clocks match those {{of the rest of}} the province, while in November, their clocks are rejoined by their Atlantic Standard Time neighbours. Although places east of 63° west are officially on Atlantic Time, local custom is to use Eastern Time as far east as the Natashquan River. Those {{communities}} observe DST, including all of Anticosti Island, which is bisected by the 63rd meridian.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, {{property}} tax {{on real estate}} is usually levied by local government, at the municipal or county level. Rates vary across the states, between about 0% and 4% of the home value. The assessment {{is made up of}} two components—the improvement or building value and the land or site value. The {{property tax}} is the main tax supporting local education, police/fire protection, local governments, some free medical services and most of other local infrastructure. Many state and local jurisdictions add personal property taxes. (<b>See</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>below.)</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{scientific}} {{definition of}} a [...] "crystal" [...] {{is based on the}} microscopic arrangement of atoms inside it, called the crystal structure.

2500|$|When {{the player}} wants to attack, they move their piece onto a square {{occupied}} by an opposing piece. Both players then reveal their piece's rank; the weaker piece (<b>see</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>below)</b> {{is removed from}} the board. If the engaging pieces are of equal rank, both are removed. A piece may not move onto a square already occupied unless it attacks. [...] Two pieces have special attack powers. One special piece is the Bomb which only Miners can defuse. It immediately eliminates any other piece striking it, without itself being destroyed. Each player also has one Spy, which succeeds only if it attacks the Marshal, or the Flag. If the Spy attacks any other piece, or is attacked by any piece (including the Marshal), the Spy is defeated. [...] The original rules contained a provision that following a strike, the winning piece immediately occupies the space vacated by the losing piece. [...] This makes sense when the winning piece belongs to the player on move, but no sense when the winning piece belongs to the player not on move. [...] The latter part of the rule has been quietly ignored in most play.|$|R

50|$|With some rare <b>exceptions</b> (<b>see</b> <b>below),</b> women {{historically}} have generally not served as rabbis until the 1970s {{and the influence}} of second-wave feminism, when the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion first ordained women rabbis.

50|$|Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are {{carbohydrate}} polymers and {{are usually}} attached to extracellular matrix proteins to form proteoglycans (hyaluronic acid is a notable <b>exception,</b> <b>see</b> <b>below).</b> Proteoglycans have a net negative charge that attracts positively charged sodium ions (Na+), which attracts water molecules via osmosis, keeping the ECM and resident cells hydrated. Proteoglycans may also help to trap and store growth factors within the ECM.|$|R

5000|$|When the Second World War broke out, the Jewish {{population}} {{sided with}} Britain. David Ben-Gurion, {{head of the}} Jewish Agency, defined the policy with what became a famous motto: [...] "We will fight the war {{as if there were}} no White Paper, and we will fight the White Paper as if there were no war."

Note that there is generally no provision for an investigative detention by a private person under the law. With certain <b>exceptions</b> (<b>see</b> <b>below)</b> an arrest must be made. [...] "Holding them until the police get there", is simply a form of arrest. The officer is accepting the arrest and processing the prisoner on behalf of the private person.|$|R
50|$|With {{just two}} <b>exceptions</b> (<b>see</b> note <b>below)</b> all Larkman {{families}} {{in the world can}} trace their ancestry back to the county of Norfolk in eastern England. From the early 15th up to the 18th century, bar two sightings in London, no Larkman is listed outside Norfolk or neighbouring Suffolk. This, along with its rarity, suggests that Larkman is a locative surname i.e. it is derived from a placename.|$|R
5000|$|Dramaturgically the Wiener Film {{generally}} contains several {{principal characters}} and several more subsidiary characters, {{all of whom}} recur frequently throughout the film as the action develops. They do not always all know each other, but are nevertheless connected by the plots and sub-plots running in parallel. The action mostly centres on love affairs great and small, often with elements of the comedy of mistaken identity. The films are generally unchallenging {{in terms of the}} contemporary socio-political issues and environment (for some rare <b>exceptions</b> <b>see</b> <b>below).</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{shoulder}}, or {{hard shoulder}} {{is an emergency}} stopping lane by {{the verge of a}} road or motorway, on the right in countries which drive on the right, or on the left side in Japan, the UK, Australia, and other left-side driving countries. Many wider US as well as Swedish freeways have shoulders on both sides of each directional carriageway, in the median {{as well as at the}} outer edges of the road, for additional safety. Shoulders are not intended for use by through traffic, although there are <b>exceptions</b> (<b>see</b> <b>below).</b>|$|R

5000|$|About 98.5% [...] of {{the oxygen}} {{in a sample}} of {{arterial}} blood in a healthy human breathing air at sea-level pressure is chemically combined with the hemoglobin. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in mammals and many other species (for <b>exceptions,</b> <b>see</b> <b>below).</b> Hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity between 1.36 and 1.40 ml O2 per gram hemoglobin, which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventyfold, compared to if oxygen solely were carried by its solubility of 0.03 ml O2 per liter blood per mm Hg partial pressure of oxygen (about 100 mm Hg in arteries).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Map of the {{geographical}} distribution of attested placenames with the -dava suffix, according to Olteanu (2010). The dava distribution confirms Dacia and Moesia as {{the zone of}} Dacian speech. The dava zone is, with few exceptions, consistent with Ptolemy's definition of Dacia's borders. There is no conclusive evidence that Dacian was a predominant language outside the dava zone in the 1st century AD. According to Strabo, the Thracians spoke the same language as the Dacians, in which case Dacian was spoken {{as far as the}} Aegean sea and the Bosporus. But Strabo's view is controversial among modern linguists: dava placenames are absent south of the Balkan mountains, with one <b>exception</b> (<b>see</b> Thracian, <b>below)</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|Players first must roll {{a special}} die that has four colors {{on it and}} two stars. If a color is rolled, the player must knock out a brick of that color, out of the wall. If the player rolls a star, the player may knock out any brick they wish (with a few <b>exceptions,</b> <b>see</b> <b>below).</b> Players take turns using a {{motorized}} hammer known as the [...] "Rammer Hammer", {{in an attempt to}} knock out the specified brick out of the wall, without making the wall collapse, OR making the [...] "Knockout" [...] brick fall off the wall.
