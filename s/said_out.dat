25|$|Jones {{said she}} had some {{conscious}} memories of her involvement in the mind-control program: it began in 1960, she said, when an old USO acquaintance (an unnamed retired army general) asked to use Jones' modeling school as a mailing address to receive some letters and packages. Jones agreed, she <b>said,</b> <b>out</b> {{of a sense of}} patriotism.|$|E
2500|$|Conservative and Reform congregations {{sometimes}} abbreviate {{the public}} recitation of the Amidah by saying it once, {{with the first}} three blessings <b>said</b> <b>out</b> loud and the remainder silently. This abridged style, {{commonly referred to as}} (...) [...] "heikhe kedusha," [...] is also performed within Orthodox Judaism in certain circumstances; in some communities it is customary for mincha to be recited in this way. It is usually used to lead into the Silent Prayer.|$|E
6000|$|Darkness full {{of thunder}} followed, {{and after the}} thunder Father Brown's voice <b>said</b> <b>out</b> of the dark: [...] "Doctor, this paper is the wrong shape." ...|$|E
5000|$|Santos also {{outlined}} five mandates which, he <b>said,</b> came <b>out</b> of the summit: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{monotonous}} boy put {{his head}} round the beam on the left, and <b>said,</b> 'Look <b>out</b> there, ladies!' and disappeared. The sprightly gentleman with the black hair as suddenly {{put his head}} round the beam on the right, and <b>said,</b> 'Look <b>out</b> there, darlings!' and also disappeared. Thereupon all the young ladies rose and began shaking their skirts out behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be silly," [...] <b>said</b> Janet, <b>out</b> of humour with herself, and annoyed {{because she}} could not then {{appreciate}} Eda's generosity.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He has to me {{that air}} of {{selfishness}} which is so very common with people in London;--as though what he said were all <b>said</b> <b>out</b> of surface politeness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{object to}} that conversation!" [...] {{interposed}} the old woman. [...] "I was not capable enough to hear what I said, and what is <b>said</b> <b>out</b> of my hearing is not evidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There--you {{have done}} it again, Zubby," [...] said Mrs Langley, {{referring}} to a push that well-nigh rolled Master Jim, (as a sea-captain once <b>said),</b> <b>out</b> at the starboard side of the cradle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Violence nothing!" [...] the Police Surgeon <b>said,</b> pulling <b>out</b> and {{inspecting}} the man's tongue--"it {{is the truth}} that is killing him." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>said</b> so <b>out</b> of politeness, because I {{served the}} family, not because Tuggeridge was my uncle--no, as such I disown him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mademoiselle Isaline," [...] I <b>said,</b> strolling <b>out</b> {{into the}} garden, [...] "and {{who is the}} young {{cavalier}} with the black moustache?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, I {{will not}} say strangers,' she <b>said</b> <b>out</b> loud; 'it sounds --it sounds--I don't know how it sounds. But what I mean is, that as yet I've only sung it before mamma!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you'll {{be likely}} {{to see him again}} if you stay here, Dolly," [...] said Rachel. This she <b>said</b> <b>out</b> of pure {{mischief}},--that sort of mischief which her sister's rebuke was sure to engender.|$|E
6000|$|Hoopdriver had his {{handkerchief}} out and sneezed a prompt ATICHEW. It is the orthodox {{thing when you}} wish to avoid recognition. [...] "As small as you have," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>out</b> of his pocket handkerchief.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would {{you take}} that?' she <b>said,</b> holding <b>out</b> a three-penny piece. 'I'd make it {{twice as much}} if I could, but times are hard.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you, Mr. Bosinney?" [...] he <b>said,</b> holding <b>out</b> his hand. [...] "You've been {{spending}} money pretty freely down here, I should say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm on my reg'lar trip, of course," [...] <b>said</b> Vance. <b>Out</b> {{there on}} the sunlit river the {{situation}} seemed to call for an apology.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really," [...] I <b>said,</b> <b>out</b> of all patience, [...] "I think I must let you ask {{the ladies}} themselves," [...] and I turned and moved again toward the hotel, but the Altrurian gently {{detained}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope,' {{said the}} lady, 'you {{are not afraid}} of {{anything}} being <b>said</b> <b>out</b> of this house to your prejudice, Summertrees? I have heard the story before; but the oftener I hear it, the more wonderful I think it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As {{you observe}} so gracefully, it is {{annoying}} to have one's own silly words {{come back at}} one, boomerang fashion. I {{made up my mind}} to do something for you; to pay off your debts.' This so exasperated him that he <b>said</b> <b>out</b> brutally: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are delighted}} to see you, Miss Amedroz," [...] she <b>said,</b> putting <b>out</b> her hand,--of which Clara, however, felt {{no more than the}} finger.|$|R
6000|$|... --Will {{you tell}} him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford <b>said</b> {{throwing}} <b>out</b> his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{you have}} <b>said</b> bears <b>out</b> my {{impression}} of him. I must renew our acquaintance when I am in Shropshire. Are you staying here long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The wretched girls still sat {{silent and}} obstinate, {{with their heads}} down. I tremble again as I write of what {{happened}} next. Papa fixed his eyes on me. He <b>said,</b> <b>out</b> loud: [...] "Eunice!"--and {{waited for me to}} rise and answer, as my sister had done.|$|E
6000|$|We had not {{sat here}} many minutes, when Mrs. Markleham, who usually {{contrived}} {{to be in}} a fuss about something, came bustling in, with her newspaper in her hand, and <b>said,</b> <b>out</b> of breath, 'My goodness gracious, Annie, why didn't you tell me there was someone in the Study!' ...|$|E
6000|$|But, after all, Leonard was a man; and man's {{ways are}} more direct than woman's. Seeing {{that he could}} not achieve his object in any other way, he <b>said</b> <b>out</b> suddenly, thinking, and rightly, that she would not wish to force an issue in the {{presence}} of her aunt: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{thou art}} not my true mother, nor Humfrey nor Diccon my brethren," [...] she <b>said,</b> {{stretching}} <b>out</b> her hands like {{one in the}} dark.|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you?" [...] he <b>said,</b> holding <b>out</b> his hand. The young Indian took it {{and responded}} to the shake, but he shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] I <b>said,</b> looking <b>out</b> of the window. [...] "Here's Dr. Bauerstein. I believe you're {{right about}} that man, Poirot. I don't like him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Something may {{possibly}} be <b>said,</b> <b>out</b> of doors, after what {{passed in the}} other room, which renders it desirable {{that we should be}} off without delay, and quite clear of town,' said Mr Westwood. 'What do you say to one of the meadows opposite Twickenham, by the river-side?' ...|$|E
6000|$|All this passed {{within the}} bishop's bosom while Mrs. Proudie still {{sat with her}} fixed pencil, and the figures of her sum still {{enduring}} on the tablets of her memory. [...] "Â£4 17s. 7d." [...] she said to herself. [...] "Of course Mr. Quiverful must have the hospital," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>out</b> loud to her lord.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, no, I suppose not," [...] {{said the}} bishop, re-seating himself, and shading {{his face with}} his hands. Mr Harding sat down {{with his back to the}} further wall, playing to himself some air fitted for so calamitous an occasion, and the archdeacon <b>said</b> <b>out</b> his say standing, with his back to the empty fire-place.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are glad, indeed, to {{make the}} {{acquaintance}} of the brother of our dear friend," [...] the countess <b>said,</b> holding <b>out</b> her hand to Frank.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{beginning}} to think that too. Does nothing make any difference in this country?' he <b>said,</b> looking <b>out</b> of the window. 'How old is that farmhouse?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Though a fearfully {{cold wind}} blows in Verona,' he <b>said,</b> 'from <b>out</b> of the Alps. We shall have {{the smell of}} the snow in our noses.' ...|$|R
