25|$|Auto{{infection}} is {{the infection}} {{of a primary}} host with a parasite, particularly a helminth, {{in such a way}} that the complete life cycle of the parasite happens in a single organism, without the involvement of another host. This can occur with the intestinal parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. <b>Strongyloidiasis</b> involves premature transformation of noninfective larvae into infective larvae, which can penetrate the intestinal mucosa (internal autoinfection) or the skin of the perineal area (external autoinfection).|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to direct environmental damage, coypus are the host for a nematode parasite [...] (Strongyloides myopotami) that can infect {{the skin of}} humans, causing dermatitis similar to <b>strongyloidiasis.</b> The condition is also called [...] "nutria itch".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{infections and}} {{parasitic}} infestations produce {{patterns of the}} luminal surface, which are best seen on Barium examinations. Certain parasites are seen as filling defects outlined by Barium and Barium examinations {{play an important role}} in the diagnosis of intestinal infections and infestations as compared to other techniques. Barium studies show tapeworms and roundworms as thin, linear filling defects of the bowel. Because roundworms have a developed alimentary tract, barium may outline the parasites’ intestinal tracts on delayed images. In <b>Strongyloidiasis</b> barium studies show intestinal wall oedema, thickening of intestinal folds with flattening, and atrophy of the overlying mucosa. Schistosomiasis caused by infection with flatworms [...] have an appearance resembling colitis ulcerosa, with inflammatory polyps, ulcers, fibrosis, wall thickening, loss of haustration, and stenosis in Barium X-rays. Anisakiasis is demonstrated by Barium X-rays as bowel wall oedema, thickening, ulceration, or stricture due to inflammation. Sometimes worms are seen as long, thread-like, linear filling defects up to 30cm long. In Typhlitis Barium studies show oedema, ulceration, and inflammation of bowel wall resulting in wall thickening. In pseudomembranous colitis, barium studies show pancolitis with thumb printing and shaggy margins as well as plaque-like eccentric, nodular or polypoid appearance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strongyloidiasis</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in the 19th century in French soldiers returning home from expeditions in Indochina. Today, {{the countries of the}} old Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) still have endemic <b>strongyloidiasis,</b> with the typical prevalences being 10% or less. Regions of Japan used to have endemic <b>strongyloidiasis,</b> but control programs have eliminated the disease. <b>Strongyloidiasis</b> appears to have a high prevalence in some areas of Brazil and Central America. It is endemic in Africa, but the prevalence is typically low (1% or less). Pockets have been reported from rural Italy, but current status is unknown. In the Pacific islands, <b>strongyloidiasis</b> is rare, although some cases have been reported from Fiji. In tropical Australia, some rural and remote Australian Aboriginal communities have very high prevalences of <b>strongyloidiasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Strongyloidiasis</b> in immunocompetent {{individuals}} is usually an indolent disease. However, in immunocompromised individuals, {{it can cause}} a hyperinfective syndrome (also called disseminated <b>strongyloidiasis)</b> due to the reproductive capacity of the parasite inside the host. This hyperinfective syndrome can have a mortality rate close to 90% if disseminated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strongyloidiasis</b> {{can become}} chronic and then become {{completely}} asymptomatic.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Strongyloidiasis,</b> as an {{alternative}} to ivermectin or thiabendazole Albendazole can be given with diethylcarbamazine to lower microfilaremia levels.|$|E
5000|$|Rick {{completed}} his PhD on the helminth parasite Strongyloides in 1988 [...] He published an important book chapter on the morphology of Strongyloides spp. in [...] "Strogyloidiasis: A Major Roundworm Infection of Man", edited by David Grove (1989). Rick performed significant {{work on the}} public health control of human <b>strongyloidiasis</b> caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, particularly in Australian aboriginal communities. He was {{the founder of the}} Australian National Working Group on <b>Strongyloidiasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Disseminated <b>strongyloidiasis</b> {{occurs when}} {{patients}} with chronic <b>strongyloidiasis</b> become immunosuppressed. It presents with abdominal pain, distension, shock, pulmonary and neurologic complications and septicemia, and is potentially fatal. The worms enter the bloodstream from the bowel wall, simultaneously allowing entry of bowel bacteria such as Escherichia coli. This may cause symptoms such as sepsis (bloodstream infection), and the bacteria may spread to other organs where they may cause localized infection such as meningitis.|$|E

50|$|Urticaria {{including}} chronic spontaneous urticaria {{can be a}} complication and {{symptom of}} a parasitic infection, such as blastocystosis and <b>strongyloidiasis</b> among others.|$|E
50|$|Knowledge of the {{geographic}} distribution of <b>strongyloidiasis</b> is of significance to travelers who may acquire the parasite during their stays in endemic areas.|$|E
50|$|As an antiparasitic, it is able {{to control}} roundworms (such as those causing <b>strongyloidiasis),</b> hookworms, and other {{helminth}} species which attack wild animals, livestock and humans.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of <b>strongyloidiasis</b> can be {{difficult}} and Strongyloides {{has been known to}} live in individuals for decades; even after treatment. Continued treatment is thus necessary even if symptoms resolve.|$|E
5000|$|Ivermectin (which can {{be given}} orally) {{has been shown to}} reduce levels of louse infestation. [...] Originally {{approved}} for onchocerciasis and <b>strongyloidiasis,</b> Ivermectin is now approved by the FDA for pediculosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strongyloidiasis</b> {{is a human}} {{parasitic}} disease caused by the nematode (roundworm) called Strongyloides stercoralis, or sometimes S. fülleborni which {{is a type of}} helminth. It belongs to a group of nematodes called roundworms. This intestinal worm can cause a number of symptoms in people, principally skin symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. In some people, particularly those who require corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, Strongyloides can cause a hyperinfection syndrome that can lead to death if untreated. The diagnosis is made by blood and stool tests. The medication ivermectin is widely used to treat <b>strongyloidiasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Eryngial is a {{chemical}} compound isolated from E. foetidum. The University of the West Indies at Mona, Jamaica, has investigated {{the use of}} enyngial {{as a treatment for}} human Strongyloides stercoralis infection (<b>strongyloidiasis).</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{case of the}} Mazzotti {{reaction}} {{has been}} reported after presumptive treatment of schistosomiasis and <b>strongyloidiasis</b> with ivermectin, praziquantel and albendazole. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms after intravenous therapy with methylprednisolone.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to direct environmental damage, coypus are the host for a nematode parasite (Strongyloides myopotami) that can infect {{the skin of}} humans, causing dermatitis similar to <b>strongyloidiasis.</b> The condition is also called [...] "nutria itch".|$|E
50|$|A related {{dihydroxy}} avermectin B1 compound, ivermectin, is utilized orally {{in humans}} as an acaricide and insecticide {{for the treatment}} of <b>strongyloidiasis</b> and onchocerciasis. Veterinarians also employ ivermectin in the treatment of heartworms in dogs and other infestations.|$|E
50|$|Strongyloides stercoralis {{is a human}} {{pathogenic}} parasitic roundworm {{causing the}} disease <b>strongyloidiasis.</b> Its common name is threadworm. In the UK and Australia, however, the term threadworm can also refer to nematodes of the genus Enterobius, otherwise known as pinworms.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>strongyloidiasis</b> is transmittable by textiles, such as bedclothes and clothing, {{care must}} be taken never to use hotel bed sheets in endemic areas. Personal {{sleeping}} bags and using plastic slippers when showering are very important when travelling in tropical regions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strongyloidiasis</b> {{is a type}} of soil-transmitted helminthiasis. It {{is thought}} to affect 30-100 million people worldwide, mainly in {{tropical}} and subtropical countries. It belongs to the group of neglected tropical diseases, and worldwide efforts are aimed at eradicating the infection.|$|E
5000|$|The drug {{of choice}} for the {{treatment}} of uncomplicated <b>strongyloidiasis</b> is ivermectin. Ivermectin does not kill the Strongyloides larvae, only the adult worms, therefore repeat dosing may be necessary to properly eradicate the infection. There is an auto-infective cycle of roughly two weeks in which Ivermectin should be re-administered however additional dosing may still be necessary as it will not kill Strongyloides in the blood or larvae deep within the bowels or diverticula. Other drugs that are effective are albendazole and thiabendazole (25 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days—400 mg maximum (generally)). [...] All patients who are at risk of disseminated <b>strongyloidiasis</b> should be treated. The optimal duration of treatment for patients with disseminated infections is not clear.|$|E
50|$|Ivermectin is a {{medication}} that is effective against {{many types of}} parasites. It is used to treat head lice, scabies, river blindness, <b>strongyloidiasis,</b> and lymphatic filariasis, among others. It can be either applied to the skin or taken by mouth. The eyes should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum {{antiparasitic}} agent, traditionally against parasitic {{worms and}} other multicellular parasites. It is mainly used in humans {{in the treatment}} of onchocerciasis (river blindness), but is also effective against other worm infestations (such as <b>strongyloidiasis,</b> ascariasis, trichuriasis, filariasis and enterobiasis), and some epidermal parasitic skin diseases, including scabies.|$|E
50|$|Parasitic {{diseases}} such as ascariasis, hookworm, <b>strongyloidiasis</b> and whipworm can be diagnosed by examining stools under a microscope {{for the presence of}} worm larvae or eggs. Some bacterial diseases can be detected with a stool culture. Toxins from bacteria such as Clostridium difficile ('C. diff.') can also be identified. Viruses such as rotavirus can also be found in stools.|$|E
50|$|Human infection, <b>strongyloidiasis,</b> is chiefly {{caused by}} Strongyloides stercoralis, {{widespread}} in all tropical regions, or by Strongyloides fuelleborni, a parasite of primates in African and Asian tropics and of humans in African tropics and New Guinea. Other species include Strongyloides papillosus found in cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, rabbits, and rats, Strongyloides ransomi found in pigs, and Strongyloides ratti, found in rats.|$|E
5000|$|Finding Strongyloides in {{the stool}} is {{negative}} {{in up to}} 70% of tests. It is important to undergo frequent stool sampling as well as duodenal biopsy if a bad infection is suspected. The duodenal fluid can be examined using techniques such as the Enterotest string or duodenal aspiration. [...] Larvae may be detected in sputum from patients with disseminated <b>strongyloidiasis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dissemination {{can occur}} many {{decades after the}} initial {{infection}} and {{has been associated with}} high dose corticosteroids, organ transplant, HIV, lepromatous leprosy, tertiary syphilis, aplastic anemia, malnutrition, advanced tuberculosis and radiation poisoning. [...] It is often recommended that patients being started on immunosuppression be screened for chronic strongyloidiasis; however, this is often impractical (screen tests are often unavailable) and in developed countries, the prevalence of chronic <b>strongyloidiasis</b> is very small, so screening is usually not cost-effective, except in endemic areas.|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} S. stercoralis is autoinfection. Only one other {{species in the}} Strongyloides genus, S. felis, has this trait. Autoinfection is the {{development}} of L1 into small infective larvae in the gut of the host. These autoinfective larvae penetrate the wall of the lower ileum or colon or the skin of the perianal region, enter the circulation again, travel to the lungs, and then to the small intestine, thus repeating the cycle. Autoinfection makes <b>strongyloidiasis</b> due to S. stercoralis an infection with several unusual features.|$|E
5000|$|One study {{reports that}} Aboriginal Australians are {{significantly}} affected by infectious diseases, particularly in rural areas. These diseases include <b>strongyloidiasis,</b> hookworm caused by Ancylostoma duodenale, scabies, and streptococcal infections. Because poverty is also prevalent in Aboriginal populations, {{the need for}} medical assistance is even greater in many Aboriginal Australian communities. The researchers suggested the use of mass drug administration (MDA) {{as a method of}} combating the diseases found commonly among Aboriginal peoples, while also highlighting the importance of [...] "sanitation, access to clean water, good food, integrated vector control and management, childhood immunizations, and personal and family hygiene".|$|E
50|$|Auto{{infection}} is {{the infection}} {{of a primary}} host with a parasite, particularly a helminth, {{in such a way}} that the complete life cycle of the parasite happens in a single organism, without the involvement of another host. Therefore, the primary host is at the same time the secondary host of the parasite. Some of the organisms where autoinfection occurs are Strongyloides stercoralis, Enterobius vermicularis, Taenia solium, and Hymenolepis nana. <b>Strongyloidiasis</b> for example involves premature transformation of noninfective larvae in infective larvae, which can then penetrate the intestinal mucosa (internal autoinfection) or the skin of the perineal area (external autoinfection). Infection can be maintained by repeated migratory cycles for the remainder of the person's life.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease was}} first {{recognized}} in 1876 by the French physician Louis Alexis Normand, {{working in the}} naval hospital in Toulon; he identified the adult worms, {{and sent them to}} Arthur Réné Jean Baptiste Bavay, chief inspector for health, who observed that these were the adult forms of the larvae found in the stool. In 1883 the German parasitologist Rudolf Leuckart made initial observations on the life cycle of the parasite, and Belgian physician Paul Van Durme (building on observations by the German parasitologist Arthur Looss) described the mode of infection through the skin. The German parasitologist Friedrich Fülleborn described autoinfection and the way by which <b>strongyloidiasis</b> involves the intestine. Interest in the condition increased in the 1940s when it was discovered that those who had acquired the infection abroad and then received immunosuppression developed hyperinfestation syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Immunosuppressive drugs, {{especially}} corticosteroids {{and agents}} used for tissue transplantation, {{can increase the}} rate of autoinfection {{to the point where}} an overwhelming number of larvae migrate through the lungs, which in many cases can prove fatal. In addition, diseases such as human T-lymphotropic virus 1, which enhance the Th1 arm of the immune system and lessen the Th2 arm, increase the disease state. Another consequence of autoinfection is the autoinfective larvae can carry gut bacteria back into the body. About 50% of people with hyperinfection present with bacterial disease due to enteric bacteria. Also, a unique effect of autoinfective larvae is larva currens due to the rapid migration of the larvae through the skin. Larva currens appears as a red line that moves rapidly (more than 5 cm per day), and then quickly disappears. It is pathognomonic for autoinfective larvae and {{can be used as a}} diagnostic criterion for <b>strongyloidiasis</b> due to S. stercoralis.|$|E
