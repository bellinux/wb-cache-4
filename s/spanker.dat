5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes <b>spanker</b> boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
25|$|Brails {{run from}} the leech of a fore-and-aft rigged sail (a <b>spanker</b> or lateen mizzen, for example) to the gaff and mast and serve the same {{function}} as buntlines: to haul in the sail when furling. In this case, however, the action is more horizontal than vertical, hauling the sail forwards, toward the luff and a bit up, towards the gaff.|$|E
25|$|A brig is a {{sailing vessel}} with two square-rigged masts. During the Age of Sail, brigs {{were seen as}} fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval {{warships}} and merchant vessels. They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Brigs fell out of use {{with the arrival of}} the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind. They are not to be confused with a brigantine, which has different rigging (a brigantine has a gaff-rigged mainsail, while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged <b>spanker</b> behind the mainsail).|$|E

25|$|Brig sails {{are named}} after the masts {{to which they are}} attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main {{topgallant}} sail; and occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the main sail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the <b>spanker</b> or boom mainsail (it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called studding sails, and are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are {{named after the}} sails to which they are fastened, i.e. the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 Vanbrugh {{married the}} actor Dion Boucicault Jr., son {{of his more}} famous namesake. They {{frequently}} appeared together {{for the rest of}} his life, and he became her manager in 1915. There were no children of the marriage. Between the turn of the century and World War I she had leading roles in new plays by J. M. Barrie (The Admirable Crichton, 1902; and Rosalind, 1912), Pinero (Letty, 1903; His House in Order, 1906; and Mid-Channel, 1909), and Maugham (Grace, 1910; and The Land of Promise, 1914). She also starred in new plays by Charles Haddon Chambers (Passers-By, 1911), and A. E. W. Mason (Open Windows, 1913). In 1913 she played Lady Gay <b>Spanker</b> in a revival of Boucicault senior's London Assurance in an all-star cast including Tree, Charles Hawtrey, Bourchier, Weedon Grossmith and Marie Tempest. This was one of the many charity fund-raising productions in which Vanbrugh appeared throughout her career.|$|E

2500|$|A further {{problem is}} that {{especially}} wooden ships {{have more than one}} [...] "length". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the [...] "length of the topmost deck" [...] – the [...] "length on deck" [...] (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post on deck level' or the [...] "length between perpendiculars" [...] (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including jibboom and out-board part of <b>spanker</b> boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length. The largest length for comparing ships, the total [...] "overall" [...] length (LOA) based on sparred length, should be given if known.|$|E
2500|$|Howard and Beverly hit the road, seeking {{shelter in}} a gothic mansion where they battle {{a girl named}} Patsy and her {{animated}} gingerbread man. They eventually end up in New York City, where Howard is nominated for U.S. President by the All-Night Party. [...] Howard battles the Band of the Bland — Dr. Angst, Sitting Bullseye, Tillie the Hun, the <b>Spanker,</b> and the Black Hole — alongside the Defenders. [...] A doctored-photo scandal leads him to Canada, and {{the defeat of the}} supervillain who caused it, the Beaver, who falls to his death. Howard then suffers a nervous breakdown, and flees Bev and their situation on a bus. Unfortunately, the passengers are all believers in various weird cults, and try to interest Howard in them. His seatmates are Winda Wester (afflicted with an Elmer Fudd-like speech impediment) and S. Blotte, the Kidney Lady. After the bus crashes, Howard and Winda are sent to a mental institution. There he meets Daimon Hellstrom, and is briefly possessed by Hellstrom's demonic soul, becoming the Son of Satan. Beverly and Paul get them both back to Cleveland. Later, while on a cruise ship returning from scenic Bagmom, Howard and Beverly are taken captive by Lester Verde, who had a crush on Beverly in college and is now in the identity of the supervillain Doctor Bong, who illegally marries Beverly against her will and transforms Howard into a human. After escaping back to New York and being restored to his natural form, Howard is hired as a dishwasher by Beverly's uncle and namesake, who goes by Lee. [...] Howard battles Sudd, and then battles S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring From Indecency). Howard is then reunited with Dakihm the Enchanter, the Man-Thing, Korrek, and Jennifer Kale, and they all battle the demon Bzzk'Joh. After finally meeting up with the cruise ship that rescues Paul and Winda, now befriended by socialite Iris Raritan, he then attends her party on Long Island, where he is abducted by the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime. [...] Paul is shot and left in a coma, and Winda, abandoned by Paul and Iris, is apparently raped by a hobo. After defeating the Circus of Crime, Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, goes his way alone, as he had {{at the beginning of the}} series.|$|E

50|$|Spanking can be {{administered}} {{in a number}} of spanking positions. The choice of position takes into account the spankee's comfort in the position for long periods of time, the <b>spanker's</b> ability to swing at the spankee at a comfortable, natural angle, complete access to the spankee's buttocks, the <b>spanker's</b> control of the spankee's position and ability to readjust as necessary, safety, and the amount of strength the top is able to generate from such a position. Positions can also be chosen specifically for added effects such as increased humiliation, elevation and suspension.|$|R
