30|$|To {{expand the}} use of wood that {{includes}} thinned round timber, wood should be used not only for construction products but also for civil engineering products. One use of wood products for civil engineering would be for underground bearing piles. Wooden bearing piles would {{be used in the}} form of round timber without lumbering. When round timber is used underground, it must always be under a green condition. The strength of a <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimen</b> and that of timber are known to decrease in line with higher moisture content [1]. The strength data of green round timber was very poor, however, when compared with that of a <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimen</b> and timber. In this study, static bending tests and compressive tests parallel to the grain of sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica) green round timber were conducted to confirm whether its strength would satisfy the referenced strength determined by the Construction Ministry. The strength of green round timber and air-dried round timber were also compared for bending and compression parallel to the grain. The strength change ratio in response to a 1  % change in the moisture content of round timber was compared with that of small clear specimens and timber.|$|E
40|$|Static bending of <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used methods for assessing the stiffness (modulus of elasticity, MoE) of sawn timber and trees. <b>Small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> have traditionally been cut at breast height from the same growth rings on opposing radii, thus seeking to minimise the radial and longitudinal variation. The remaining (residual) variation between <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> determines the precision of the estimate of the tree mean MoE, but has rarely been analysed in detail because the method originally was not intended for tree-level analyses. To investigate this, axial stiffness measurements previously collected from <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> taken from opposing radii at breast height on New Zealand-grown Pinus radiata D. Don and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco (Douglas fir) were reanalysed to ascertain the magnitude of the residual variation at breast height.

30|$|There are {{significant}} {{differences on the}} design value of mechanical properties for the same grade dimension lumber, because different countries have different evaluation methods, load statistics, and load combinations. For example, the statistics of snow load (q), which equals the ratio average value and standard value, is 1.04 in China, but q value ranges from 0.61 to 0.82 in the United States [9]. Furthermore,design value of wood strength is generally determined by full-size testing and <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> testing [10]. Comparing these two methods, the full-size testing takes natural defect, size effect, and other factors into consideration. Therefore, the test results are {{much closer to the}} actual situation. The previous research [11] reported that the length had significant effect on tensile strength of visually graded Chinese fir dimension lumber. Currently,the full-size testing method has been applied in the United States, Canada, and Japan to determine the flexural, compressive, and tensile strength of dimension lumber [12, 13].

30|$|To {{examine the}} {{effectiveness}} of long rotation forestry and the potential of complete utilization of Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi Carriere), we designed a tensile test using the lumber from six 87 -year-old sample trees. Results showed that strength properties of lumber varied greatly in the radial direction within trees, but all sample trees showed a similar trend. There was little difference in dynamic Young's modulus but a large difference in tensile strength (TS) between the lumber and <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> from undestroyed parts of the lumber. These differences decreased {{with an increase in}} ring number and became constant after 30 years. The presence and distribution of knots markedly affected the TS; and among the knot indices, the knot number (Kn) and knot area ratio of a maximum single knot (Km) proved to be effective for explaining the effect of knots. The distribution of Kn and Km in the radial direction agreed with the variation of TS in the radial direction. By investigating the variation patterns of lumber and <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> in the radial direction, {{it was found that the}} strength properties of both required a long time, about 30 years, to reach a relatively constant state.|$|R
30|$|Static bending {{tests and}} {{compressive}} test {{parallel to the}} grain of sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica) green round timber were conducted to confirm whether its strength would satisfy the referenced strength determined by the Construction Ministry.

The average strength of air-dried round timber was higher than that of green round timber, in both bending and compression parallel to the grain, with significant differences indicated at a 5  % significance level. The relation between the cross-section area that includes round timber, timber and the <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens,</b> and the strength change ratio in response to a 1  % change in moisture content change was fitted to a logarithm curve.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work performed in Task 11 "Modelling Young's modulus on <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> in relation to silvicultural treatments" was the modelling of Young's modulus (MOE) on <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> of 24 Belgian Norway spruces in relation with the silvicultural treatment. The {{aim of the research}} was also to compare Young's modulus on <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> with Young's modulus on commercial size specimens with a view to defining the rate of prediction of wood quality of specimens including the natural timber defects. This work is corresponding to one task among the twelve of a large ECC Project entitled "SilvicuItural control and non destructive assessment of timber quality in plantation grown Spruces and Douglas fir" for which 210 trees have been sampled through 6 different European countries. The experimental raw material comes from the southern and eastern part<; of Belgium and concerns four different kinds of stands characterized by the site productivity class and the thinning intensity. Within each stand, the trees have been sampled in three different social positions classes. The <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> have been marked off with reference to the radial and axial positions inside the 24 trees. On the whole 350 <b>clear</b> wood <b>specimens</b> have been selected and tested by two different laboratories in order to get young's modulus by a non destructive four points flexural method described by the French Standard NF B 51 - 016. Young's modulus appears to be positively related with specific gravity and negatively related with growth ring width. Stands growing on high productive sites or those submitted to low thinnings and also suppressed trees give rise to a stiffer wood. Among all these factors, only the social position of the tree within the stand influences significantly the Young's modulus values. Nevertheless, a slow growth producing a heavier timber is not always linked with a stiffer wood. Young's modulus differences between juvenile and adult wood vary in connection with the specific gravity class considered. In other words, juvenile wood is stiffer than adult wood when referring to low density classes, but adult wood becomes stiffer than juvenile wood when referring to high density classes. That means that the stiffness of adult wood is more sensitive to changes in specific gravity than the stiffness of juvenile wood. The distribution of Young's modulus in relation with specific gravity shows a higher variability when specific gravity increases. In searching the reasons for a higher Young's modulus variability when specific gravity increases by looking back to the population of <b>clear</b> <b>specimens,</b> we point out a very low slope of grain on some specimens and above all the presence of compression wood on other specimens. When rejecting these defects, then it appears that Young's modulus is more strongly related to specific gravity, thus giving rise to more accurate models. Among all these models, the best one is corresponding to a combination of variables such as specific gravity and growth ring width per sampling level within the tree. The variance analysis of residues of each model has revealed a tree effect always very highly significant. On the opposite, the other factors, as site productivity, thinning intensity and social position of the tree within the stand, have no significant effect on Young's modulus values. That means that inter trees variability is far higher than the other sources of variation (intra tree variability, site productivity variability, thinning intensity variability and social position variability). This also means that the general model established is valid whatever the silvicultural treatment could be...|$|R

The nonlinearity of the stress-strain curve was quantified using two parameters representing the deviation from linear elasticity, and the formula of the stress-strain curve was deduced from the interrelation between these parameters. This formula is expressed quite simply by using the modulus of elasticity along the radial direction and another constant that is unique to the material.|$|R

Approximately half of the effort put into the investigations was concentrated on laboratory tests while the remaining effort was concentrated on modelling the observations made in the tests. The results from the investigations are published or submitted for publication in eight papers. Paper I : In this paper methods for testing the hygro-mechanical behaviour of <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> wood <b>specimen</b> are evaluated and discussed.

It was concluded that the equipment showed good potential to perform tests on the specimen in variable climate and that the methods for testing were reliable. Paper II : Results from performed tests on <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> wood <b>specimens</b> in climates representative for kiln drying of sawn timber are presented in this paper. Evaluations of the tests also showed that the hygro-mechanical behaviour at high temperatures and high moisture content consists of both mechano-sorption and time induced creep. Paper III : A material model for drying wood at constant temperatures on the material point level is presented in this paper. The model was calibrated against results. It was found that the material model predicted the response from climate and load action in small specimens. Paper IV : In this paper the one dimensional material model introduced in Paper III is verified against more test results on <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> wood <b>specimen.</b> Also, a two dimensional model was developed and is presented in this paper. Paper V : Results from tests on <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> wood <b>specimens</b> for indoor climates with single cycles of humidity are presented in this paper.

Long-term tests on <b>small</b> <b>clear</b> <b>specimens</b> in cyclic climates with both tensile and compressive loads were carried out. The development of internal stresses in timber was measured indirectly at different times during the adsorption and desorption processes. Released deformations were measured from cross-sections after cutting them to small slices. These deformations were used to estimate the internal stresses caused by the humidity variations. Tests with constant loads and multiple humidity cycles show a mechano-sorptive strain that is ten {{times higher than the}} elastic strain. It is shown that existing models for describing mechano-sorption perpendicular to grain are inaccurate when applied to multiple humidity cycles. The present results demonstrate that if the mechano-sorptive behaviour and the moisture gradients in wood can be accurately described, it is possible to predict the stress distribution in a timber cross-section by knowing the climate history...|$|R
