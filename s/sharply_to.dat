5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm developed on November23 about 460mi (740km) northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northeastward, strengthening to peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) on November24. It later turned <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> {{the west as}} it began a weakening trend, followed by a curve to the north. The cyclone dissipated on November26 about 450mi (725km) east-northeast of Bermuda, without ever affecting land.|$|E

5|$|Authorities in El Salvador {{declared}} a national state of alert {{in response to}} the potential threat from the hurricane. Residents in flood-prone areas were warned of potential flash flooding. As the hurricane turned <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, there are no reports of damage or deaths from Pauline in the country. Officials in Puerto Madero closed port facilities to all ships, excluding ships in open seas seeking shelter. The government ultimately closed six major ports between Acapulco and Puerto Madero. State authorities in Oaxaca opened 75emergency shelters and prepared 50schools to house 10,000people.|$|E
5|$|As the Racer {{endured the}} gale, another vessel to her north, HMSRingdove, felt the storm {{around the same}} time. Both ships {{recorded}} easterly winds for several days as they traversed the Yucatán Channel, indicating that the storm center remained to their south. The hurricane crossed the northern Yucatán Peninsula and moved west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, nearing {{the mouth of the}} Rio Grande by early on October3. The storm is estimated to have peaked as the equivalence of a Category4 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale. As the hurricane approached a strong high pressure area to the north, it slowed drastically and recurved <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the northeast while its center was just off southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|At Durand, I-69 {{meets the}} southeastern end of M-71 on the {{northwest}} side of town. The freeway turns <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the northeast before turning due east near Lennon. The interchange with M-13 south of Lennon marks the Shiawassee–Genesee county line. Continuing eastward, I-69 parallels Miller Road to the north {{as far as the}} city of Swartz Creek; east of town, the two roadways cross. I-69 parallels a line of the Canadian National Railway as it enters the Flint metro area. The freeway intersects Bristol Road near the Bishop International Airport and then crosses I-75/US23 southwest of downtown Flint. I-69, the railroad and the Swartz Creek all parallel into downtown Flint where the freeway intersects I-475 and M-54 (Dort Highway) before exiting {{the east side of the}} city.|$|E

5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the {{relatively}} low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E
5|$|East of Bronte Creek, Highway407 enters an {{agricultural}} area, interspersed with woodlots. It enters Oakville at the Tremaine Road (Halton Regional Road22) overpass, then gradually swerves {{to the north}} as it encounters an interchange with Bronte Road (Halton Regional Road25 and former Highway25). The route crosses Sixteen Mile Creek just north of Glenarchy Conservation Area, then travels parallel to the creek for several kilometres. It swerves north after an interchange with Neyagawa Boulevard, near the hamlet of Glenarchy. After diverging from the creek, it curves northeast, parallel to and north of Burnhamthorpe Road, where it interchanges with Trafalgar Road (Halton Regional Road3). Highway407 then encounters Highway403 at a large interchange where curves <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the northwest; Highway403, meanwhile, curves from the southeast to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Karen quickly {{weakened}} as {{it moved}} over cooler waters, and late on October 14 it degenerated back into a tropical storm as it accelerated northward. Convection gradually decreased, and Karen made landfall on southwestern Nova Scotia with winds of 45mph (70km/h) on October 15. Karen retained its tropical characteristics during and after making landfall, based on a research flight out of Halifax intended to study {{the early stages of}} extratropical transition. The flight reported arced bands and a warm-core system transitioning into a more typical mid-latitude system. Under the influence of a mid-latitude system, the storm turned <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, and after losing the remaining of its convection it became extratropical shortly after landfall. Continuing northward, the remnant low quickly weakened, and dissipated as it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E

5|$|Route22 then veers <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, {{resuming}} a northward direction only a {{short distance}} from the state line, a few hundred feet to the east. It then rounds a mountain and heads west, paralleling the New York State Thruway's Berkshire section (I-90) for a mile. NY980D (an unsigned reference route) leaves to the east, where it becomes Massachusetts Route102 at the state line. After Thruway exitB3, NY22 resumes its northerly heading. From here it intersects NY295, then passes Queechy Lake. NY22 then straightens out to reach New Lebanon, where it intersects US20. New York's longest east–west route (US20) overlaps with its longest north–south route (NY22) for a mile before the former continues to Pittsfield and the latter returns to the border-paralleling course, which takes it into Rensselaer County.|$|E
5|$|The Central Highlands rise <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> {{the north}} of the Grijalva, to a maximum {{altitude}} of , then descend gradually towards the Yucatán Peninsula. They are cut by deep valleys running parallel to the Pacific coast, and feature a complex drainage system that feeds both the Grijalva and the Lacantún River, which feeds into the Usumacinta River. The Central Highlands feature high rainfall and diverse vegetation dependent upon altitude, from high-altitude pine forests to lowland tropical forest further north and east towards the plains of Tabasco and Petén. At the eastern end of the Central Highlands is the Lacandon Forest, which is largely mountainous with lowland tropical plains at its easternmost extreme.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{charged with}} {{investigating}} the accident, examined the wreckage at Long Island MacArthur Airport. Reports from witnesses {{of the crash}} indicated the aircraft appeared {{to have made a}} normal takeoff and began climbing normally. But, moments later it began banking <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the right. Investigators examined the four charred engines and concluded all were producing power at the point of impact. They could not conclusively determine the amount of power being produced, but stated there was no evidence found in the wreckage that suggested the engines might have suffered an operational failure.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} {{formed as}} the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following {{the decision of}} clubs in the Football League First Division {{to break away from}} the Football League, which was founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth £1billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively. The league generates €2.2billion per year in domestic and international television rights. In 2014–15, teams were apportioned revenues of £1,600 million, rising <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> £2,400 million in 2016–17.|$|E
5|$|The subway {{through which}} the shuttle runs was opened on October 27, 1904 by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), {{the first day of}} subway service in Manhattan. The current shuttle line was part of the first IRT subway line, which ran north to 145th Street via Broadway and south to City Hall via Park Avenue and Lafayette Street. The 42nd Street section of the line {{connected}} Broadway at Times Square, on the west, to Park Avenue at Grand Central Terminal, on the east. At the Times Square end of this segment, the line curved <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the north under One Times Square, swinging northeast under Seventh Avenue before shifting under Broadway. The platforms at Times Square are located on this curve. In 1910, the platforms at the two stations were extended.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the effects}} of a larger upper-level low, Juan slowed on October 28 while {{approaching}} the Louisiana coastline. At 1200 UTC that day, the hurricane attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). After executing a loop just offshore southern Louisiana, Juan turned back to the east, making landfall at peak intensity near Morgan City at 1100 UTC on October 29. Subsequently, Juan turned <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, executing another loop over southern Louisiana near Lafayette. Late on October 29, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, emerging into Vermilion Bay early the next day with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Juan turned to the east, moving along the southern Louisiana coast and re-organizing slightly.|$|E

5|$|With this {{possibility}} in mind, the American battleships set out, {{accompanied by the}} ships of the British Third Light Cruiser Squadron and two flotillas of destroyers, all {{under the command of}} Admiral Rodman. This marked {{the first time in history}} that British warships had ever served under the command of a sea-going American admiral. Although the outbound trip to Norway was uneventful, things began to heat up for the escort force on 8 February, as they waited just outside Norwegian territorial waters for the return convoy to assemble. Shortly before 14:00, both Florida and Delaware reported sighting numerous torpedoes running in the water, and began maneuvering <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> avoid being struck.|$|E
5|$|After Exit 2, Route 25 {{bends to}} the northeast, {{bypassing}} Buttermilk Bay and the densely populated village of Buzzards Bay {{to the south}}. The route passes Union Pond and Dicks Pond {{to the south and}} Spectacle Pond and Sandy Pond to the north before entering the town of Plymouth. In Plymouth, Route 25 passes to the north of several cranberry bogs and small ponds. While the freeway has no interchanges in Plymouth, a rest area is located off eastbound Route 25 in the town; the area is inaccessible from westbound Route 25. Due to state funding cutbacks, services at the rest area are limited to summer weekends (Friday to Sunday) as of 2010. After the rest area, Route 25 passes over Bourne Road and turns <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> head in a southwestern direction. The route passes under Bournedale Road after entering the town of Bourne. In Bourne, Route 25 has its final interchange; Exit 3 (formerly Exit 2) serves the villages of Buzzards Bay and Sagamore, connecting to US 6 (Scenic Highway) and Route 28 north. From Exit 3, US 6 is used to access the Sagamore Bridge in northern Bourne and the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown on Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|After being designated, the cyclone became disorganized, and {{contained}} little deep and persistent convection; with dry air infringing {{on the western}} edge of the storm, substantial intensification was deemed unlikely. Despite being sheared, the cyclone neared tropical storm status later that day, though it remained a depression due to a partially non-tropical appearance. Initially, the depression meandered towards the northeast due to weak steering currents, and it intensified into a tropical storm at 0600UTC. As such, it was named Hanna by the National Hurricane Center. Over the next 24hours, the low-level center rotated around the mid- and upper-level centers, and the entire tropical storm turned southwestward by late September12. After a jog to the northwest, the low-level center became separated from the convection. Meandering, the storm started to turn northward under the steering currents of a southwesterly flow associated with an approaching mid-level trough. Hanna then strengthened <b>sharply</b> <b>to</b> reach to its peak intensity of 60miles per hour (100km/h) at 0000UTC on September14.|$|E
