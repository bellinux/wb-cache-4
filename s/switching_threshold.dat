50|$|One of {{the issues}} with using RC network to {{generate}} PoR pulse is {{the sensitivity of the}} R and C values to the power-supply ramp characteristics. When the power supply ramp is rapid, the R and C values can be calculated so that the time to reach the <b>switching</b> <b>threshold</b> of the schmitt trigger is enough to apply a long enough reset pulse. When the power supply ramp itself is slow, the RC network tends to get charged up along with the power-supply ramp up. So when the input schmitt stage is all powered up and ready, the input voltage from the RC network would already have crossed the schmitt trigger point. This means that there might not be a reset pulse supplied to the core of the VLSI.|$|E

5000|$|The circuit {{works by}} {{alternately}} switching {{the output of}} each stage between a voltage doubler driven by [...] and one driven by [...] This behaviour leads to another advantage over the Dickson multiplier: reduced ripple voltage at double the frequency. The increase in ripple frequency is advantageous because {{it is easier to}} remove by filtering. Each stage (in an ideal circuit) raises the output voltage by the peak clock voltage. Assuming that this is the same level as the DC input voltage then an n stage multiplier will (ideally) output nVin. The chief cause of losses in the cross-coupled circuit is parasitic capacitance rather than <b>switching</b> <b>threshold</b> voltage. The losses occur because some of the energy has to go into charging up the parasitic capacitances on each cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Propagation delay {{increases}} with operating temperature, as resistance of conductive materials tends to increase with temperature. Marginal increases in supply voltage can increase propagation delay since the upper <b>switching</b> <b>threshold</b> voltage, VIH (often {{expressed as a}} percentage of the high-voltage supply rail), naturally increases proportionately. [...] Increases in output load capacitance, often from placing increased fan-out loads on a wire, will also increase propagation delay. All of these factors influence each other through an RC time constant: any increase in load capacitance increases C, heat-induced resistance the R factor, and supply threshold voltage increases will affect whether more than one time constants are required to reach the threshold. If the output of a logic gate is connected to a long trace or used to drive many other gates (high fanout) the propagation delay increases substantially.|$|E

40|$|For {{any type}} of {{computer}} memory element, knowledge of the <b>switching</b> <b>threshold</b> is crucial for memory development. This determines the magnitude of read currents which can be applied without destroying {{the information contained in}} the storage element and is used to determine reliable operating levels for the complete memory. Initial tests of a new multilayer thin film magneto-resistive memory element have shown the <b>switching</b> <b>threshold</b> of these elements to be quite sharp. Such a sharp threshold in a thin film structure, which are normally plagued by the presence of multiple domains, had not been previously reported. The multilayer structure, though much larger than a single domain particle, appeared to behave effectively as a single domain. A more carefully controlled investigation of the <b>switching</b> <b>threshold</b> was thus warranted. This investigation consisted of a computer controlled experiment in which the word current amplitude was set using a digital/analog converter and the mean time between failures was measured by pulsing the word current and monitoring the output. The threshold was defined as the point at which switching occurs after the application of one pulse. Behavior between 94 and 100 % of this threshold was studied at room temperature, at 100 °C, and at - 21 ° or - 11 °C by pulsing the word current at a value near the <b>switching</b> <b>threshold.</b> The word current was reduced in steps to determine a relationship between the applied word field and the mean time between failures.

As expected, the rapidity at which a reliable operating level was approached decreased with increasing temperature.
