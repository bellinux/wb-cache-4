5000|$|While at Yale, Bushnell {{proved that}} {{gunpowder}} could be exploded under water. He {{also made the}} first time bomb. He combined these ideas by building the Turtle {{which was designed to}} attack ships by attaching a time bomb to their hulls, while using a hand powered drill and <b>ship</b> <b>auger</b> bit to penetrate the hulls.|$|E
50|$|Rogers pardoned Auger (“a {{steady and}} respectable old pirate”), {{entrusted}} {{him with a}} sloop named Mary - owned by a David Soward and outfitted for trading - and allowed him to leave with other ships on a resupply voyage. Soon after, Auger and his crew encountered two other sloops at sea. Abandoning their trading mission, they reverted to piracy and plundered the two <b>ships.</b> <b>Auger</b> and the crew debated whether to kill cargo master James Kerr, pilot Richard Turnley, and other officers Rogers had placed on board, but instead voted to maroon them.|$|R
50|$|She {{subsequently}} {{shifted to}} Buckner Bay, Okinawa, {{to serve as}} storage tanker there in September. On 9 October, a particularly heavy and violent typhoon swept over Okinawa. Vandalia ran aground at 1518, coming to rest about 200 yd from Miyegusuku Lighthouse on Naha Island and sinking rapidly. The 140 kn winds lashed the ship, and heavy seas pounded the old tanker unmercifully. One engine failed, and the ship went out of control, carried along with the fury of the typhoon, as the ships force determinedly tried to pump out the engine room, fire room, and after compartments. She came to rest listing to starboard, and the danger immediately confronting the commanding officer, Lieutenant John F. Auge, USNR, {{was that of the}} <b>ship</b> capsizing. Accordingly, <b>Auge</b> gave the order to abandon ship, which was done by 0740 on 10 October. There were no casualties.|$|R
