50|$|The 1970s was {{a period}} of great {{expansion}} for the Post Office. Most exchanges were modernised and expanded, and many services, such as STD and international dialling were extended. By the early 1970s, subscribers in most cities could dial direct to Western Europe, the US, and Canada; {{by the end of the}} decade, most of the world could be dialled direct. The System X digital <b>switching</b> <b>platform</b> was developed, and the first digital exchanges began to be installed. The Post Office also procured their own fleet of vans, based on the Commer FC model. However, progress came at a price. Investment was stifled by public spending limits, and long waiting lists for telephone lines developed, sometimes for years.|$|E

50|$|For a {{protocol}} that began {{life in the}} 1980s, DPNSS is natively {{a long way from}} VoIP. However, many of the hybrid VoIP PBXs available from manufacturers worldwide provide on-board DPNSS trunk cards. Where they do not, {{a protocol}} converter is necessary. Commercially available equipment offers the ability to convert from DPNSS to Q.Sig. Note that it is also possible to tunnel DPNSS and its associated PCM (G711) over an IP network. This can be point to point where the IP network carries packetised voice N x 64 Kbs speech and a separate IP signalling channel to carry the notional 64 Kbs of DPNSS signalling. A more sophisticated solution uses intelligence {{on the edge of the}} IP network to route voice to the correct node. This is a Voice VPN.Note that this should not be confused with the pre-VOIP 'Voice VPN' deployed by routing calls intelligently in a TDM <b>switching</b> <b>platform,</b> often Nortel DMS100 and customers PBX nodes.|$|E
50|$|The Match product {{provided}} automated {{systems for}} telephone companies in Operations, administration and management (OA&M) to migrate telephone services delivered by existings analogue AT&T 1AESS switches to newer digital switches, such as Northern Telecom's DMS-100 or AT&T's 5ESS switches. The MATCH {{was composed of}} three main system components: Decoding, Matching, and Provisioning. The Decoding module would decode core memory dumps from the AT&T 1AESS, 5AESS, Nortel DMS-100, and operating databases including COSMOS and TIRKS. Network inventory, services, and related constructs would be stored in a proprietary MATCH universal database management system, which was configurable based on job and customer preferences. The Matching module would compare two populated databases, being a source and target, and compute the functional transform required to bring the target system {{in line with the}} source. The Provisioning model examined the transform function and generated the necessary AT&T 5AESS recent change messages and DMS-100 service updates to reproduce telephony services provided by the old switch on the new <b>switching</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
