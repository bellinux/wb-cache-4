After considering several hydraulic system architectures and conducting in-depth analysis into two of them, the idler pulley scheme was chosen. This mechanism uses a double rod end hydraulic actuator connected to wire rope wrapped around a capstan drum and an idler pulley. The model was optimized for mechanical performance, and it is expected to be a more cost effective option than the existing actuation system in New Hampshire once the controls equipment required to actuate the hydraulic cylinders for the new design is specified. by Juan Felipe Carrillo.

40|$|In recent years, many {{research}} works {{focused on}} improving {{and reducing the}} cost of solar collectors. This paper focuses upon {{the development of an}} efficient modeling and optimization of solar collector. The approach adopted in modeling utilizes a parabolic trough collector absorber tube with non-uniform heat flux, fully developed mixed convection flow and Al 2 O 3 /synthetic oil as a base fluid. Optimization of thermal analysis in a <b>solar</b> <b>trough</b> <b>collector</b> using nanofluid is non-convex, non-linear and computationally intensive process. In order to overcome these difficulties, a hybrid optimization method involving GA (genetic algorithm) and SQP (sequential quadratic programming) is introduced in the optimization process. The optimization problem used in this study involves maximization of a nondimensional correlation consisting of Nusselt number and pressure drop with Reynolds and Richardson number which are used as design constraints. The methodology implemented within an integrated environment involving Matlab, Gambit and Fluent. The results obtained show that heat transfer enhancement has a direct relationship with the nanoparticle concentration ratio whereas it has inverse relationship with the operational temperature. In addition, the results show that the proposed methodology provides an effective way of solving thermal analysis in a solar parabolic trough collectors based on simulation models...|$|E
40|$|The KU EcoHawks are a {{mechanical}} engineering, undergraduate, senior design {{group at the}} University of Kansas that focuses on projects emphasizing a sustainable approach to automobiles and energy infrastructure. Much of the EcoHawks construction work is completed at a barn on campus that does not currently contain a heating or air conditioning system. Due to the temperature extremes reached in Kansas {{during the summer and}} winter months, thermal comfort is problematic for students working within the barn. This past academic year, one design group implemented a heating system for the barn utilizing a solar thermal parabolic collector. During the design phase, research of the literature found relatively little information in regards to the optimized depth of the parabolic curve. As a result, a prototype solar thermal parabolic trough was built in order to test three different parabolic shapes with varied depths. Static testing of a 50 - 50 mix of ethylene glycol and water found that the parabolic shape with the smallest focal length had the greatest solar collection efficiency. From this assessment, a final parabolic trough design was created. The assumptions, testing procedure, and results of static testing for the optimum parabolic shape of a <b>solar</b> <b>trough</b> <b>collector</b> will be addressed herein...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Solar based {{energy systems}} are now {{becoming}} very popular nowadays. <b>Solar</b> parabolic <b>trough</b> <b>collectors</b> {{are widely used}} for solar heating and solar thermal power plant. One aspect {{that is very important}} is the exact determination of drag force acting on the systems. To calculate drag force, drag coefficient, which is always associated with a particular area, is required. This drag coefficient can be determined by experimentally or by numerical simulation. This study reports on numerical predictions of drag coefficient, velocity and pressure fields in steady flow around a <b>solar</b> parabolic <b>trough</b> <b>collector.</b> Also the wind load acting on the collector is determined for each position of trough. In this paper drag coefficients are evaluated for different pitch angles (0 o to 180 o) of parabolic trough using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for wind velocity of 12 m/s. Also for 0 o pitch angle, drag coefficient is calculated varying wind velocity from 8 m/s to 18 m/s. It is found that maximum drag coefficient is 1. 71 at 0 o pitch angle and drag coefficient remains constant for wind velocity range 8 m/s to 18 m/s.

Parabolic <b>trough</b> <b>collector</b> is the most proven technology for indirect steam generation in solar thermal power plants. Since the annual average daily solar radiation for Malaysia are from 4. 21 KWh/m 2 to 5. 56 KWh/m 2 and sunshine duration is more than 2200 hours per year, parabolic <b>trough</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is a very promising technology in the renewable energy field.

The receiver of the parabolic trough is modeled in CFD code ANSYS Fluent environment and the geometry is similar to that of LS- 2 parabolic <b>trough</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector.</b> Some assumptions have been made to ease and simplify the simulation. Solar radiation flux profile around the absorber tube is assumed uniform and the radiation flux is treated as heat flux wall boundary condition for the absorber tube.

40|$|AbstractFrequently {{interrupted}} by dense clouds during the operational period, the thermal performance of parabolic <b>trough</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> will experience considerable variations. Therefore, both theoretical and experiment studies {{were developed to}} analyze the dynamic thermal performance under the condition of dramatically varying direct normal solar irradiance (DNI) based on energy balance equations and a thermodynamics analysis. Particularly for a closed system, this unfavorable weather condition leads to the variation in the outlet temperature of parabolic <b>trough</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors.</b> Consequently, both of main factors which impact on the running status of the whole system are coupled to make heat transfer processes complex.
