5|$|Marlohe {{had secured}} the role after two auditions for {{director}} Sam Mendes and casting director Debbie McWilliams. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> Xenia Onatopp {{as a point}} of inspiration for her performance. Distancing herself from the Bond girl title, she interpreted the character as more modern and realistic. Media commentators characterized Sévérine as a femme fatale and an anti-heroine. Costume designer Jany Temime designed Sévérine's wardrobe using concepts from film noir as well as contemporary fashion, with close attention paid to the black dress she wears when meeting Bond in a Macau casino.|$|E

One of those programs helped working women receive better wages. The New Deal also placed women into less machine work and more white collar work. Women {{did not have to}} work in the factories making war supplies because men were coming home so they could take over the long days and nights women had been working to contribute to the war efforts. Roosevelt brought unprecedented activism and ability {{to the role of the}} First Lady.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first eight}} weeks of filming {{took place in}} Los Angeles, which {{accounted}} {{for the majority of}} the shooting schedule. A [...] "massive" [...] newsroom set was built to act as the hub of operations for the fictional Washington Globe newspaper. Costume designer Jacqueline West indicated that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> the newsroom of The Washington Post for inspiration, and used photos of The Baltimore Suns newsroom to help her develop the journalists' looks. The production moved to Washington,D.C. for five weeks of location filming towards the end of the shoot, commencing on March6,2008. More than a third of State of Play was shot in Washington, D.C., with filming taking place throughout the city. The filmmakers estimated that State of Play may have set a record for the longest studio shoot in the city. Locations included the neighborhoods of Adams Morgan, Shaw, and Mount Pleasant. Scenes set on Mount Pleasant Street were also filmed at the Los Angeles studio, where a full replica of the strip's facade was built. In Georgetown, menswear store The District Line was transformed into a household goods store to shoot a chase scene for the film's opening sequence.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with USA Today, Azalea talked about {{the concept of the}} music video, mentioning Spears's signature dance scenes, [...] "I think Britney's identity is really embedded in being a dancer, and that's something she really wanted to do as well. So there's a lot of dancing in the video, but I wouldn’t say it's necessarily centered around that." [...] When asked about the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candids from the video shoot, she explained that it would have a narrative and stated that Britney wanted to do a video where she got to dress up and play a character. Azalea revealed <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> actress Geena Davis when modeling her style, describing her as [...] "the ultimate '80s pin-up hot, cool type of girl" [...] that Britney also liked. Spears added, [...] "I had called my manager and had some ideas about doing a Valley girl-type video. It was really kind of funny, because I had just watched Clueless on TV, and was like, 'It would be so fun to do something like that.' Then I saw Iggy's video, and I thought, 'Oh my God, to work with her would be heaven sent.'" [...] They brainstormed the concept for the video, deciding on a send-up of 1988 sci-fi comedy Earth Girls Are Easy, which starred Davis. Spears said, [...] "I do a makeover for her and we go to a club. The best part about it was just us coming together with the clothes and doing the '80s haircuts. We were all about being characters, so it was kind of funny for us. We weren't taking ourselves so seriously".|$|E

6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] {{returned}} the boy doubtfully, and surveying {{me with his}} arm held out above his burning eyes. [...] "She <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> me the t'other one. It ain't the bonnet, nor yet it ain't the gownd, but <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> me the t'other one." ...|$|R
