50|$|<b>Brace</b> <b>posts</b> {{are placed}} in-line about 8 ft {{from the corner}} post. A {{horizontal}} compression brace connects {{the top of the}} two posts, and a diagonal wire connects the top of the <b>brace</b> <b>post</b> {{to the bottom of the}} corner post. This diagonal wire prevents the <b>brace</b> <b>post</b> from leaning, which in turn allows the horizontal brace to prevent the corner post from leaning into the <b>brace</b> <b>post.</b> A second set of <b>brace</b> <b>posts</b> (forming a double brace) is used whenever the barbed wire span exceeds 200 ft.|$|R
50|$|The Chipman potato {{house has}} been {{modified}} for tractor access. Windows were once glazed beneath the shutters, a very unusual feature in a potato house. The internal structure uses <b>samson</b> <b>posts,</b> a kind of capped column that is normally employed in mill construction to bear heavy loads, leading to speculation that the feature echos construction in the adjacent, now destroyed Chipman's Mill. The Chipman house is also unusual in plan, divided into four quadrants with 2.5 ft walkways between. Each quadrant was divided into at least three bins. The attic is divided in two with a center aisle, {{for a total of}} 50 bins, typically 9 ft by 3 ft.|$|R

50|$|In the {{following}} {{months after the}} closure of the Hautapu-Cambridge section of line in 1999 all the yard and line tracks were quickly lifted and Goods Shed dismantled. The <b>Samson</b> <b>Post</b> was moved to the new terminus of the line at Hautapu. The 'Home' semaphore signal remained in position until being moved to the grounds of the Cambridge Museum where it is currently on display along with the 18 km and 19 km distance markers. The 'Cambridge' sign marking the entrance to the yard and also the 'Kissing Gates' of 1884 vintage remain preserved in place. The line formation is still very evident as a vacant plot of land stretching in a straight line to Hautapu for 4 km between Victoria Road East and Victoria Road West and tree-lined within the town boundary.|$|R
50|$|When {{the barbed}} wire span exceeds 650 ft, a braced line {{assembly}} is added in-line. This has the function of a corner <b>post</b> and <b>brace</b> assembly but handles tension from opposite sides. It uses diagonal brace wire that connects the tops to the bottoms of all adjacent posts.|$|R
50|$|The {{surface unit}} {{transfers}} energy for pumping the well from the prime-mover to the sucker rod string. In doing this, it must change the rotary {{motion of the}} prime-mover to reciprocating motion for the sucker rod. And it must reduce {{the speed of the}} prime-mover to a suitable pumping speed. Speed reduction is accomplished by using a gear reducer, and rotary motion of thencrank shaft is converted to oscillatory motion by means of a walking beam. The crank arm is connected to the walking beam by means of a pitman arm. The walking beam is supported by a <b>Samson</b> <b>post</b> and saddle bearing. The horse head and bridle are used to ensure that the pull on the sucker rod string is vertical all times so that no bearing movement is applied to that part of sucker rod string above stuffing box. The polished rod and stuffing box combination is used to maintain a good liquid seal at the surface.|$|R
5000|$|Completed in July 1949, {{the massive}} structure, which is 238 ½ {{feet long and}} 32 ft wide, {{incorporated}} 745 timbers, <b>posts,</b> and <b>braces,</b> 17000 ft of plank and other boarding, and 9000 sq ft of slate. Carpenters specially cut new clapboards for the exterior siding with an up-and-down saw (see Scroll Saw) to recreate the markings found on the original building.|$|R
50|$|They are {{constructed}} from {{a grid of}} heavy timbers laid to form a foundation, with <b>posts</b> and <b>braces</b> forming bracing for the walls. The interior walls are lined with heavy boards fixed on the inner side. In {{the case of the}} kura in Shirakawa, the roofs are thatched in a similar manner to gasshō-zukuri. Traditionally grain was stored on the ground floor with household items stored on the upper floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame of}} the {{building}} is composed largely of oak. The roof frame consists of six sets of rafters. The four interior trusses are composed of doubled rafters, rafter ties, and king posts. The king <b>posts</b> are <b>braced</b> longitudinally through the building by horizontal beams linking them at mid-height, and by diagonal braces which extend from points near the tops and bottoms of the king posts to the midpoints of the horizontal beams.|$|R
50|$|According to {{a notice}} board outside the church, the nave and south porch {{date from the}} 14th century, the {{crucifix}} dates from the 13th century and the pulpit from 1712. Inside are an ornately carved crucifix and pulpit. The church is a Møre-type stave church due to its structure and the exterior support <b>posts</b> that <b>brace</b> the walls. During an archeological survey in 1962-1963, marks were found from posts for an older building on the same location.|$|R
50|$|Gates for cattle {{tend to have}} 4 wires when along a three wire fence, as cattle tend to {{put more}} stress on gates, {{particularly}} on corner gates. The fence {{on each side of}} the gated ends with two corner <b>posts</b> <b>braced</b> or unbraced depending on the size of the post. An unpounded post (often an old broken post) is held to one corner post with wire rings which act as hinges. On the other end a full length post, the tractor post, is placed with the pointed end upwards with a ring on the bottom stapled to the other corner post, the latch post, and on top a ring is stapled to the tractor post, the post is tied with a Stockgrower's Lash or one of numerous other opening bindings. Wires are then tied around the post at one end then run to the other end where they are stretched by hand or with a stretcher, before posts are stapled on every 4 ft, often this type of gate is called a portagee fence or a portagee gate in various ranching communities of coastal Central California.|$|R
5000|$|The Rustic style {{structure}} features {{back and}} side walls composed of random rubble stone. On {{the center of}} the back wall is a stone fireplace and chimney. Two round timber <b>posts</b> with <b>bracing</b> hold up the timber gable roof. Exposed purlins extend below the overhang of the roof. Located on a small point of land near the lake, the significance of its architecture is that it was designed to blend into its natural surroundings by means of its material, design, and workmanship.|$|R
2500|$|The {{academic}} {{name for}} this type of house comes from the German words [...] "Fach" [...] (bay), describing the space (up to [...] ) between trusses made of two rafters fixed to a tie beam and connected to two <b>posts</b> with <b>braces</b> and [...] "Halle", meaning something like hall as in a hall house. The walls were usually timber-framed, made of posts and rails; the panels (Gefache) in between are filled with wattle and daub or bricks. One bay may be two or rarely three Gefache wide.|$|R
50|$|The schoolhouse is a single-story wood frame structure, {{with a side}} gable roof, {{weatherboard}} and shingle siding, and {{a foundation}} of stone piers. Atypically for Maine schoolhouses of the 19th century, it has an engaged porch and vestibule on the front (northwest) facade. The porch is supported by turned <b>posts</b> with <b>braces.</b> The northeast gable is finished in shingles, {{and there is a}} truss-shaped Stick style gable ornament in the peak. The interior is finished with vertical board wainscoting, original blackboards, and a 1927 pressed metal roof.|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section E of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE The procedures to be used for determining the bending strength (Minimum Resisting Moment) of fence <b>posts</b> and <b>braces</b> are described in this method. A point load at midspan is applied to a simply supported 1. 22 m span of fence <b>post</b> or <b>brace</b> in this method. B. APPARATUS 1. Any type of calibrated testing machine capable of applying a downward force in excess of the force required to produce the specified minimum Resisting Moment is required. 2. A testing frame and loading head similar to that shown in Figure 1 is required. 3. A dial micrometer is required, reading to 0. 01 mm with a spindle movement of 25 mm. C. TEST PROCEDURE 1. Mount the member in the testing frame for bending about its major axis. Apply a preload of not less than 90 N nor more than 360 N. Regulate the amount of preload so that the specimen is firm against all bearing points. Then, zero the dial micrometer located at midspan. 2. After preloading, apply an additional load in N corresponding to the minimu...|$|R
5|$|When {{the weather}} improved, work {{commenced}} outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed {{before the first}} work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the fantail <b>posts</b> and <b>braces</b> were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.|$|R
50|$|Once these <b>posts</b> and <b>bracing</b> {{have been}} erected, the wire is wrapped around one corner post, held with a hitch (a timber hitch {{works well for}} this) often using a staple to hold the height and then reeled out along the span of the fence {{replacing}} the role every 400 m. It is then wrapped around the opposite corner post, pulled tightly with wire stretchers, and sometimes nailed with more fence staples, although this may make readjustment of tension or replacement of the wire more difficult. Then it is attached {{to all of the}} line posts with fencing staples driven in partially to allow stretching of the wire.|$|R

50|$|The {{exterior}} is modestly detailed, with bracing, studding and nogging over tongue-and-groove boarding, paired shaped eaves brackets {{under the}} main roof, and timber doors and double hung sash windows. The verandah has square timber <b>posts</b> with a <b>braced</b> balustrade. The Landsborough Street elevation has central timber stairs with a timber pediment above the landing. The Little Brown Street elevation has timber stairs, new doors, and a partially enclosed verandah.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} and most time-consuming part of a barbed wire fence is constructing the corner <b>post</b> and the <b>bracing</b> assembly. A barbed wire fence is under tremendous tension, often up to half a ton, and so the corner post's sole function is to resist the tension of the fence spans connected to it. The bracing keeps the corner post vertical and prevents slack from developing in the fence.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{owner of}} the press was Isaac Norfleet, at a {{plantation}} about 2.5 mi southwest of Tarboro in Edgecombe County. It was originally a cider and wine press. Around 1860, the press was converted to a cotton press because of the growing need to process the cotton crop. The press is constructed of yellow pine. It has a large screw {{that is used to}} compress the cotton into a wooden form to produce the bale. The supporting frame has four upright <b>posts</b> with <b>braces.</b> There are two long booms. These booms or poles have been called [...] "buzzard wings." [...] Animal hitches were attached to the booms. Mules and oxen were used to rotate the screw. The overall height of the press is 22 ft.|$|R
50|$|The Ranger’s Office is a two-story, {{rectangular}} building, 53 ft {{across the}} front and 41 ft along the sides. It has a gabled roof with a stone chimney and no eaves. There are dormers {{on each side of}} the roof. The lower half of the office is board-and-batten construction; the upper half is built with horizontal clapboard. The front and back porches have 10-inch-square support <b>posts</b> with curved <b>braces</b> and stone floors.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of wire fences {{is that they}} are supported mainly by tension, being stretched between heavy strutted or guy-wired posts at ends, corners, and ideally at intervals in longer stretches (every 50 to 300 metres, 150 to 1000 feet). Between these <b>braced</b> <b>posts</b> are additional smaller wooden or metal posts which keep the wires spaced and upright, usually 3 to 6 metre (10 to 20 feet) apart, depending on the style of fencing used.|$|R
50|$|A base of dark glazed bricks {{runs the}} length of the structure, its {{horizontal}} line enhanced by a corrugated iron awning with wooden supports and diagonal metal bracing which shelters the railway siding and loading bays, some of which are arched. An unusual feature of this store are double doors which slide into the brick walls, their width determined by the size of a wool bale. A decoratively moulded central doorway leads into the main entrance foyer and offices which are timber panelled. A large passenger lift complemented by a modern timber staircase provides access to the next level. As usual for woolstores built before the First World War, the hardwood upper floors are supported by massive timber <b>posts</b> and <b>braced</b> by herring-boned struts, while the ground floor is concrete.|$|R
50|$|The three-room plan of {{the second}} floor {{consists}} of a large east room constituting about two-thirds the space and two small west rooms. The north-south paneled partition {{is similar to the}} partition of the first floor. This basic three-room plan probably is original, although the partition has been moved at least twice. Notches on the baseboard and patching of the wall plasters and chair rail indicate the wall was moved east, into the larger space, by about three feet. All outer walls were exposed logs until they were plastered, probably early in the 19th century. A door in the northeast corner of the large east room leads to an enclosed attic staircase; in the stairwell the structural system is clearly evident because the corner <b>post,</b> down <b>braces</b> and log infill have never been sheathed.|$|R
5000|$|The picnic shelter {{is located}} {{at the base of a}} slope to the lake. The Rustic style {{structure}} features a back wall and stepped end walls composed of random rubble stone. On the center of the back wall is a fireplace flanked by two stone benches. Four round timber <b>posts</b> with <b>bracing</b> hold up the timber roof supports and shed roof. The roof extends as a 7 ft overhang in the back. Another fireplace is located here. The patio in back continues to the hillside and ends at a curved stone bench. A set of 29 stone steps ascend the 25 ft hill south of the shelter. The significance of its architecture is that it was designed to blend into its natural surroundings by means of its material, design, and workmanship.|$|R
2500|$|The main frontage, {{facing the}} High Street, is about [...] long {{from north to}} south. [...] An open hall, formed of two bays of about [...] each, forms {{the main part of}} the interior.

50|$|The upper level, {{reached by}} a {{moveable}} ladder. The roofing system is an elaborate series of laminated beams and support <b>posts</b> that <b>brace</b> the three roof sections and the dormer. There is an upper laminated beam {{at the base}} of the metal aerator section that is braced by a series of cross-timbers that form a web of support. A circular hay track is mounted inside of this beam and it curves gracefully into the dormer thus allowing for efficient handling of hay and straw inside of the main doors. The roof trusses are then composed of balloon frame stick lumber pieces that radiate upwards toward the barn's center. The floor area of the upper level is open, with the exception of the area just inside of the northeast doors which is left open to accommodate loading and unloading of upper level feed.|$|R
