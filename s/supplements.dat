5|$|Most {{countries}} place dietary <b>supplements</b> in {{a special}} category under the general umbrella of foods, not drugs. As a result, the manufacturer, and not the government, has the responsibility of ensuring that its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed. Regulation of <b>supplements</b> varies widely by country. In the United States, a dietary supplement is defined under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. There is no FDA approval process for dietary <b>supplements,</b> and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of <b>supplements</b> introduced before 1994. The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor adverse events that occur with <b>supplements.</b> In 2007, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, part III took effect, regulating Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary <b>supplements.</b> Even though product registration is not required, these regulations mandate production and quality control standards (including testing for identity, purity and adulterations) for dietary <b>supplements.</b> In the European Union, the Food <b>Supplements</b> Directive requires that only those <b>supplements</b> that have been proven safe can be sold without a prescription.|$|E

5|$|Dietary <b>supplements</b> often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific {{evidence}} supports the benefits of dietary <b>supplements</b> for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin <b>supplements</b> may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary <b>supplements</b> or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E

5|$|The European Union {{and other}} {{countries}} of Europe have regulations that define limits of vitamin (and mineral) dosages for their safe use as dietary <b>supplements.</b> Most vitamins that are sold as dietary <b>supplements</b> {{are not supposed to}} exceed a maximum daily dosage referred to as the Tolerable upper intake level (ULs). Vitamin products above these regulatory limits are not considered <b>supplements</b> and should be registered as prescription or non-prescription (over-the-counter drugs) due to their potential side effects.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were: 1) to describe <b>supplement</b> consumption pattern on under-five children, 2) to describe mothers perception about <b>supplement</b> health claim and benefits for under-five children. 3) to analyze the factors that influence mother's perception about <b>supplement</b> health claim and benefits and 4) to analyze the relationship between mothers perception about <b>supplement</b> health claim and benefits with <b>supplement</b> consumption on under-five children. This study conducted in Public kindergarten "Pembina" at Jemurwonosari street JN/TK, Surabaya regency. 71 mothers of under-five children were selected as respondents. The data about respondent and family characteristics, <b>supplement</b> consumption pattern, mother's perception about <b>supplement</b> health claim and benefits, the factors that have relationship with mother's perception and <b>supplement</b> consumption were collected by using open-closed questionnaire. The factors that have relationship with mother's perception about <b>supplement</b> health claim and benefits analyzed by using logistic regression test.
