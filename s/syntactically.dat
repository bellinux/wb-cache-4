5|$|The pass statement, {{which serves}} as a NOP. It is <b>syntactically</b> needed to create an empty code block.|$|E
5|$|The {{semantic}} {{attribute of}} animacy is <b>syntactically</b> important: thus the sentence, 'the bread was eaten by me', which is acceptable in English, {{would not be}} acceptable in Mongolian. The reciprocal voice is marked by -ld-, the plurative by -tsgaa-, and the cooperative by -lts-.|$|E
5|$|Many {{language}} studies, {{particularly in}} fMRI, use the subtraction paradigm, in which brain activation in a task thought to involve {{some aspect of}} language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processingthe processing of real words), or activations while participants read <b>syntactically</b> complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.|$|E
5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning that word order in Nahuatl is basically free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with omission of all noun phrases or independent pronouns, not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are used only for emphasis. It allows certain kinds of <b>syntactically</b> discontinuous expressions.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are <b>syntactically</b> subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established <b>syntactically</b> by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E
25|$|In the De Bruijn index notation, any two alpha-equivalent {{terms are}} <b>syntactically</b> identical.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a noun as the non-verbal element, it is treated <b>syntactically</b> as the verb's (direct) object (never taking the ko marker; {{governing}} agreement in perfective and infinitival constructions), and the semantic patient (or agent: see gālī khānā below) of the conjunct verbal expression is often expressed/marked <b>syntactically</b> as a genitive adjunct (-kā ~ ke ~ kī) of the noun.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syntactically,</b> Centr(L) is a noun {{that takes}} the name of L as its DSyntA II: Centr−II→L, etc.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syntactically,</b> I {{bought it}} is grammatical, but done (always unstressed) {{is used to}} {{emphasize}} the completed nature of the action.|$|E
25|$|Lenition of all single consonants between vowels. That applied across word {{boundaries}} {{in the case}} of <b>syntactically</b> connected words.|$|E
25|$|Lenition and nasal {{assimilation}} across word {{boundaries in}} <b>syntactically</b> connected words produced extensive sandhi effects (Irish initial mutations). The variations {{became an important}} part of the grammar.|$|E
25|$|Vowel elision can be <b>syntactically</b> conditioned. For example, in nominal {{compounds}} and noun phrases, all adjectival/nominal modifiers {{with three or}} more vowels in a modifier + nucleus NP lose their final vowel.|$|E
25|$|CSP {{has been}} imbued with several {{different}} formal semantics, which define {{the meaning of}} <b>syntactically</b> correct CSP expressions. The theory of CSP includes mutually consistent denotational semantics, algebraic semantics, and operational semantics.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two classes}} of quantifiers that are {{distinguished}} <b>syntactically.</b> The first class heads a quantifier phrases that takes a demonstrative (or in its stead, a noun phrase) as its complement: xaxúa.|$|E
25|$|Demonstratives are {{associated}} either to nouns for reference tracking, {{or have the}} whole clause as their scope. Although they <b>syntactically</b> behave partially like locational adverbs, demonstrative words form a specific paradigm, which is easily identified morphologically.|$|E
25|$|In {{programming}} language theory, semantics is the field {{concerned with the}} rigorous mathematical study {{of the meaning of}} {{programming language}}s. It does so by evaluating the meaning of <b>syntactically</b> legal strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of <b>syntactically</b> illegal strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will execute on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} marker n’t as in couldn’t etc. {{is often}} {{thought to be}} a clitic developed from the lexical item not; linguists Arnold Zwicky and Geoffrey Pullum argue, however, that the form has the properties of an affix rather than a <b>syntactically</b> independent clitic.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideas of}} syntax {{highlighting}} overlap significantly {{with those of}} syntax-directed editors. One of the first such editor for code was Wilfred Hansen's 1969 code editor, Emily. It provided advanced language-independent code completion facilities, and unlike modern editors with syntax highlighting, actually {{made it impossible to}} create <b>syntactically</b> incorrect programs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syntactically</b> speaking, a noun can {{be either}} {{the subject of a}} sentence, the object of a {{transitive}} verb or the object of a preposition, all syntactic slots which are forbidden to verbs or adjectives. Proper names - place names and personal names - can be said to belong to the global category of nouns in Araki.|$|E
25|$|JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a {{general-purpose}} data {{interchange format}} that {{is defined as}} a subset of JavaScript's object literal syntax. Like much of JavaScript (regexps and anonymous functions as 1st class elements, closures, flexible classes, 'use strict'), JSON, except for replacing Perl's key-value operator '=>' by an RFC 822 inspired ':', is <b>syntactically</b> pure Perl.|$|E
25|$|Dravidian {{and other}} South Asian {{languages}} share with Indo-Aryan {{a number of}} syntactical and morphological features that are alien to other Indo-European languages, including even its closest relative, Old Iranian. Phonologically, there is the introduction of retroflexes, which alternate with dentals in Indo-Aryan; morphologically there are the gerunds; and <b>syntactically</b> there {{is the use of}} a quotative marker (iti). These are taken as evidence of substratum influence.|$|E
25|$|In English, causativity is {{predominantly}} expressed <b>syntactically,</b> by the phrase, 'make someone verb, whereas in Georgian it is expressed morphologically. The causative marker obligatorily cooccurs with the version marker -a-. There {{is no single}} causative marker in Georgian. To ditransitivize an already transitive verb, one uses in-eb or rarely ev: ch'am, 'you eat' > a-ch'Øm-ev, 'you make him eat / You are feeding him', with the syncope of the root.|$|E
25|$|Four-by-four (4×4) {{refers to}} the general class of vehicles. The first figure {{represents}} the total wheels (more precisely, axle ends), and the second, the number that are powered. <b>Syntactically,</b> 4×2 means a four-wheel vehicle that transmits engine torque to only two axle-ends: the front two in front-wheel drive or the rear two in rear-wheel drive. Alternatively, a 6×4 vehicle has three axles, two of which provide torque to two wheel ends each.|$|E
25|$|In some {{programming}} languages, given a two-argument function f (or {{a binary}} operator), the outer product of f and two one-dimensional arrays A and B is a two-dimensional array C such that C = f(A,B). This is <b>syntactically</b> represented in various ways: in APL, as the infix binary operator °.f; in R, as the function outer(A, B, f); in Mathematica, as Outer. In MATLAB, the function kron(A,B) {{is used for}} this product. These often generalize to multi-dimensional arguments, and more than two arguments.|$|E
25|$|The {{substitution}} rule demonstrates several common {{aspects of}} rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; {{one can tell}} whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (<b>syntactically</b> defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, {{as is often the}} case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syntactically,</b> every Boolean term {{corresponds}} to a propositional formula of propositional logic. In this translation between Boolean algebra and propositional logic, Boolean variables x,y… become propositional variables (or atoms) P,Q,…, Boolean terms such as x∨y become propositional formulas P∨Q, 0 becomes false or ⊥, and 1 becomes true or T. It is convenient when referring to generic propositions to use Greek letters Φ, Ψ,… as metavariables (variables outside the language of propositional calculus, used when talking about propositional calculus) to denote propositions.|$|E
25|$|Instances of {{ambiguity}} {{can be classified}} as local or global ambiguities. A sentence is globally ambiguous if it has two distinct interpretations. Examples are sentences like Someone shot the servant of the actress {{who was on the}} balcony (was it the servant or the actress who was on the balcony?) or The cop chased the criminal with a fast car (did the cop or the criminal have a fast car?). Comprehenders may have a preferential interpretation for either of these cases, but <b>syntactically</b> and semantically, neither of the possible interpretations can be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|In Fuzhou dialect, {{there are}} various kinds of initial assimilation, {{all of which are}} progressive. When two or more than two {{syllable}}s combine into a word, the initial of the first syllable stays unchanged while those of the following syllables, in most cases, change to match its preceding phoneme, i.e., the coda of its preceding syllable. As with the rime changes, initial assimilation is not as mandatory as tone sandhi in connected speech, and its presence and absence may indicate different parts of speech, different meanings of a single word, or different relationships between groups of words <b>syntactically.</b>|$|E
25|$|Note: (SA) {{indicates}} morphemes added through Suffixaufnahme, described below.These {{elements are}} not all obligatory, and in fact a noun can occur as a single root followed by nothing except zero-suffixes for case and number. Despite the general agglutinative structure of the language, the plural marker (5) merges with the case morphemes (6) in ways which {{do not seem to}} be entirely predictable, so singular and plural forms of the case endings are usually listed separately. The anaphoric marker (7) is formally identical to the article and anchors the Suffixaufnahme suffixes (8) and (9). While the absolutive pronoun clitics (10) attached to a noun are not necessarily connected to it <b>syntactically,</b> typically designating the object or intransitive subject of a nearby verb, the third plural pronoun clitic -lla can be used to signal the plural of the host noun in the absolutive.|$|E
25|$|The two {{arguments}} Sam and Sally in tree (a) {{are dependent}} on the predicate likes, whereby these arguments are also <b>syntactically</b> dependent on likes. What {{this means is that}} the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence big is a predicate in tree (b) that takes bones as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate on takes the two arguments the picture and the wall; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate to help in (d) takes the one argument Jim but is not directly connected to Jim in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.|$|E
25|$|Noun phrase {{morphology}} is agglutinative and {{consists of}} suffixes which simply attach {{to the end of}} a stem. These suffixes are in many cases fused with the article (-a for singular and -ak for plural), which in general is required to close a noun phrase in Basque if no other determiner is present, and unlike an article in many languages, it can only partially be correlated with the concept of definiteness. Proper nouns do not take an article, and indefinite nouns without the article (called mugagabe in Basque grammar) are highly restricted <b>syntactically.</b> Basque is an ergative language, meaning that inflectionally the single argument (subject) of an intransitive verb is marked in the same way as the direct object of a transitive verb. This is called the absolutive case and in Basque, as in most ergative languages, it is realized with a zero morph; in other words, it receives no special inflection. The subject of a transitive verb receives a special case suffix, called the ergative case.|$|E
500|$|Degrees of {{comparison}} are constructed <b>syntactically.</b> Comparatives are expressed {{using the word}} [...] : [...] "A X [...] " [...] (A is more X [...] ). [...] The most common way to express superlatives is with [...] : [...] "A X [...] " [...] (A is the most X). Intensity is also expressed <b>syntactically,</b> similar to other languages of the region, by reduplication or {{with the use of}} intensifiers.|$|E
500|$|Statements {{cannot be}} a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A {{particular}} case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is <b>syntactically</b> valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.|$|E
500|$|The Nannul {{remains the}} {{standard}} normative grammar for modern literary Tamil, which therefore {{continues to be}} based on Middle Tamil of the 13th century rather than on Modern Tamil. [...] Colloquial spoken Tamil, in contrast, shows a number of changes. The negative conjugation of verbs, for example, has fallen out of use in Modern Tamil – negation is, instead, expressed either morphologically or <b>syntactically.</b> [...] Modern spoken Tamil also shows a number of sound changes, in particular, a tendency to lower high vowels in initial and medial positions, and the disappearance of vowels between plosives and between a plosive and rhotic.|$|E
500|$|Wulfstan’s {{style is}} highly admired by many sources, easily {{recognisable}} and exceptionally distinguished. [...] "Much Wulfstan material is, more-over, attributed largely or even {{solely on the}} basis of his highly idiosyncratic prose style, in which strings of <b>syntactically</b> independent two-stress phrases are linked by complex patterns of alliteration and other kinds of sound play. [...] Indeed, so idiosyncratic is Wulfstan’s style that he is even ready to rewrite minutely works prepared for him by Ǣlfric" [...] (Blackwell, 495). [...] From this identifiable style, 26 sermons can be attributed to Wulfstan, 22 of which are written in Old English, the others in Latin. [...] However, it’s suspected that many anonymous materials are Wulfstan’s as well, and his handwriting has been found in many manuscripts, supplementing or correcting material (495). [...] He wrote more than just sermons, including law-codes and sections of prose.|$|E
