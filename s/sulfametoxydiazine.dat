50|$|<b>Sulfametoxydiazine</b> (INN) or sulfamethoxydiazine (USAN: sulfameter) is a long-acting sulfonamide antibacterial. It {{is used as}} a leprostatic {{agent and}} in the {{treatment}} of urinary tract infections.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop new films based on chitosan functionalized with sulfonamide drugs (<b>sulfametoxydiazine,</b> sulfadiazine, sulfadimetho-xine, sulfamethoxazol, sulfamerazine, sulfizoxazol) in order to enhance the biological effects of chitosan. The morphology and physical properties of functionalized chitosan films as well the antioxidant effects of sulfonamide-chitosan derivatives were investigated. The chitosan-derivative films showed a rough surface and hydrophilic properties, which are very important features for their use as a wound dressing. The film based on chitosan-sulfisoxazol (CS-S 6) showed the highest swelling ratio (197 %) and the highest biodegradation rate (63. 04 %) in comparison to chitosan film for which the swelling ratio was 190 % and biodegradation rate was only 10 %. Referring to the antioxidant effects the most active was chitosan-sulfamerazine (CS-S 5) which was 8. 3 times more active than chitosan relate...|$|E

Referring to the antioxidant effects the most active was chitosan-sulfamerazine (CS-S 5) which was 8. 3 times more active than chitosan related to DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging ability. This compound showed also a good ferric reducing power and improved total antioxidant capacity...|$|E
