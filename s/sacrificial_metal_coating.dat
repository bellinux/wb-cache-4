40|$|The {{corrosion}} of 62 Sn 36 Pb 2 Ag solder connections poses serious {{difficulties for}} outdoor-exposed photovoltaic (PV) modules, as connection degradation {{contributes to the}} increase in series resistance (RS) of PV modules. In this study, we investigated a corrosion mitigation method based on the corrosion mechanism. The effect of added <b>sacrificial</b> <b>metal</b> on the reliability of PV modules was evaluated using the oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction under damp heat (DH) conditions. Experimental results after exposure to DH show that the main reason for the decrease in power was a drop in the module’s fill factor. This drop was attributed to the increase of RS. The drop in output power of the PV module without added <b>sacrificial</b> <b>metal</b> is greater than that of the sample with <b>sacrificial</b> <b>metal.</b> Electroluminescence and current-voltage mapping analysis also show that the PV module with <b>sacrificial</b> <b>metal</b> experienced less degradation than the sample without <b>sacrificial</b> <b>metal...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{parts of}} an {{electrical}} contact device are treated by sputter etching {{to remove the}} parent metal oxide. Prior to exposure of the electrodes to any oxygen, a <b>sacrificial</b> <b>metal</b> is sputter deposited on the parts.

30|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} paper, {{sometimes referred}} to as bucky paper, is a random arrangement of carbon nanotubes meshed into a single robust structure, which can be manipulated with relative ease. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes were used to make the nanotube paper, and were subsequently modified with platinum using an electroless deposition method based on substrate enhanced electroless deposition. This involves the use of a <b>sacrificial</b> <b>metal</b> substrate that undergoes electro-dissolution while the platinum metal deposits out of solution onto the nanotube paper via a galvanic displacement reaction. The samples were characterized using SEM/EDS, and Hall-effect measurements. The SEM/EDS analysis clearly revealed deposits of platinum (Pt) distributed over the nanotube paper surface, and the qualitative elemental analysis revealed co-deposition of other elements from the metal substrates used. When stainless steel was used as <b>sacrificial</b> <b>metal</b> a large degree of Pt contamination with various other metals was observed. Whereas when pure <b>sacrificial</b> <b>metals</b> were used bimetallic Pt clusters resulted. The co-deposition of a bimetallic system upon carbon nanotubes was a function of the metal type and the time of exposure. Hall-effect measurements revealed some interesting fluctuations in sheet carrier density and the dominant carrier switched from N- to P-type when Pt was deposited onto the nanotube paper. Perspectives {{on the use of the}} nanotube paper as a replacement to traditional carbon cloth in water electrolysis systems are also discussed.|$|R

However few studies explicitly explain, what mechanisms decide on the increased fatigue endurance of <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with plastics.

Authors are putting the thesis on the basis of an analysis of literature and own examinations, that <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with material are characterized by an increased fatigue endurance.
