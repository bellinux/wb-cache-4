Current <b>superplastic</b> <b>alloys</b> are limited in use by high material costs. The utilization of solute-drag creep processes, the approach used in this study, to obtain enhanced tensile ductility in aluminum alloys has lead to tensile elongations of up to 325 % in simple, binary Al-Mg alloys with coarse grain sizes.

40|$|International audienceMany superplastic alloys are {{sensitive}} to strain induced cavitation. A specificity of damage in superplastic conditions comes from the importance of grain boundary sliding (GBS) which induces generally a significant role of cavity coalescence compared to the conventional steps of nucleation and cavity growth. In terms of cavity morphologies, the GBS contribution promotes the development of cavities with particularly complex shapes. A way to limit damage sensitivity can be to reduce the grain size in the <b>superplastic</b> <b>alloy</b> since {{it is expected to}} decrease the associated flow stress and consequently the cavity nucleation rate during deformation. Nevertheless, for ultra fine grained microstructures (like those obtained after severe plastic deformation techniques), superplastic properties can frequently be obtained at lower temperatures than for more conventional microstructures. In such cases, the effect on cavitation may be not straightforward and may depend on applied conditions.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the study of cavitation behaviour of two-phase superplastic alloys, using mainly a hot microhardness technique. Cavitation is a serious problem in copper and iron base alloys, it drastically limits the elongation to failure and may affect the service properties of superplastically formed components. There is some empirical evidence to suggest that, for cavitation to occur, the two phases involved must be 'incompatible' that is, they show marked differences in certain properties. Ideally, this phenomenon would be investigated directly by an in-situ study of the deformation behaviour of each phase separately in the microduplex alloy at the superplastic temperature and hence pinpointing the phase incompatibilities, but existing techniques do not allow for this. Here, a hot microhardness tester was commissioned and used to determine the hardness and activation energy of each phase in-situ in a duplex alloy in thc superplastic temperature range. Zn/Al eutectoid and 60 / 40 brass were here used as models to represent a non-cavitating and cavitating class of superplastic alloys. In addition, a series of alloys were produced of compositions corresponding to those of the individual phases in these systems over a supcrplastic temperature range. These alloys were hot tensile. tested to find the ductility and ten'fle strength of each phase of <b>superplastic</b> <b>alloy.</b> The hot hardness data was correlated with the hot tensile data for the alloys over the whole temperature range from 0. 4 to 0. 84 Tm. Variation of Young's modulus with temperature was determined by a vibration technique and activation energy calculated form LnH versus Tm plots for all the alloys. In 60; 40 brass, the amount E of -T cavitation decreased with an increase in temperatur% and this alloy gave a maximum elongation of ti 110 pct at 250 °C 1, 0. 45 Trrj, but it still exhibited extensive cavitation. In the Zn/Al eutectoid, no cavitation was observed apart from that associated with a few large inclusions. The hardness values of the two phases in a/ß brass were very different at the superplastic temperature, as were the load extension curves from the tensile tests and the calculated activation energies. In. the Zn/Al eutectoid however, the mechanical properties of the two phases were similar, though the activation energies were different.

A-zinc - 0. 4 Al alloy was developed, which showed a. remarkable degree of superplasticity. at room. temperature, and. elongations of greater than 500 % could be obtained at the relatively fast crosshead velocity of 0. 1 inch/min. The strain 7 rate sensitivity (m) was found to increase with strain up to 300 % on elongation (. 35 -*-. 5) -parallel to the rolling. direction. and it was also found to be anisotropic in-the plane of the sheet. The strain ratio r was also strain dependent and varied in the plane of the sheet. At 900 to the rolling direction, the strain ratio. increased from. 35 to. 75 after an elongation of 350 %, that is, tending to unity (isotropy). Texture determination after straining showed a marked change and agreed qualitatively with the change in strain ratio. Grain growth occurred at room temperature, but was observed to be inhibited on superplastic deformation. Surface observations after deformation revealed that grainboundary sliding was taking place; fracture behaviour, though characteristically ductile in nature, varied with strain-rate. This alloy obeyed the Hall-Petch relationship above. a certain critical grain size, below which it was inapplicable, due to the occurrence of superplasticity. Thin-foil transmission-electron microscopy showed the importance of a dislocation recovery Mechanism in the interpretation. of this deformation behaviour, and calculations based on the current theories of volume and grainboundary diffusion, grainboundary sliding and dislocation climb/recovery, showed-that a grainboundary sliding/dislocation-climb recovery model could reasonably predict the observed. strain rate sensitivity and strain-rate. Biaxial tests confirmed the anisotropic properties observed in uniaxial. tests and also in punch-stretching the effect of-friction on cup height was contrary to that observed with workhardening metals. In the second investigation, measurements of. the-flow stress (af) and. strain-rate. sensitivity (m). over a wide range of strain-. rates (6) -and temperatures between - 75 -to 3000 C have been made on a range of superplastic alloys, based on. the Zn - Al eutectoid, but with additions of up to 1 % copper. These additions do not significantly affect af or m above about- 1500 C. The peak in the m. -ý curve is not displaced. by these-copper additions at temperatures above 1500 C. Increasing the grain-size (L) increases af for. temperatures above about 600 C but decreases. of-below this temperature [...] With increasing-grain-size, the peak in m-value moves towards lower L, The dependence of af vs [...] La showed that the exponent a. was strain-rate dependent and varied, from 0. 6 to I at 2500 C. The exponent b in the relation ý vs. 1 was independent F of stress and varied from 1. 8 at 2500 C to 3 at L 200 C. The activation energy was grain-size and stress-dependent, and for the smallest grain size (. 55 jim), a value. of about 14 k. cal/mole was obtained in the superplastic region, while a value of near 20 k-cal/mole was obtained at the low 6 region. Creep-rate - measurements-at room-temperature showed that the secondary creep- rate decreased with increasing copper. content,, by a factor-of about 120 between 0 and 1. 0 % copper.. Increasing the grain size from 0. 55 Um to 1. 75 Um decreased the creep-rate further by a-factor varying from 10 - 50 times and thus an overall gain in creep resistance of 1200 times can be obtained.

40|$|Strain rate {{sensitivity}} exponent is {{an important}} parameter to describe {{the ability of a}} material to resist necking. Less research has been done to examine strain rate sensitivity of high-strain-rate superplastic aluminum-based composites under different stress states. In this paper, experimental investigations have been carried out to examine the deformation behavior of Al 6061 / 20 SiC sub W composite under both uniaxial and equibiaxial tension. A maximum elongation of about 505 % was observed at an initial strain rate of 6. 56 x 10 exp - 2 s exp - 1 and at a temperature of 873 K. Similar m value is observed under uniaxial and equibiaxial tension. The results also show that to value is almost independent of true strain, which differs from conventional <b>superplastic</b> <b>alloys.</b> It is believed that no significant concurrent matrix-grain growth {{is one of the reasons}} for the phenomenon. The reasons for a large discrepancy between the stress-strain rate curves under uniaxial and equibiaxial tension are also discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{producing}} new <b>superplastic</b> <b>alloys</b> by inducing in an alloy {{the formation of}} precipitates having a sufficient size and homogeneous distribution that a sufficiently refined grain structure to produce superplasticity is obtained after subsequent PSN processing. An age-hardenable alloy having at least one dispersoid phase is selected for processing. The alloy is solution heat-treated and cooled to form a supersaturated solid solution. The alloy is plastically deformed sufficiently to form a high-energy defect structure useful for the subsequent heterogeneous nucleation of precipitates. The alloy is then aged, preferably by a multi-stage low and high temperature process, and precipitates are formed at the defect sites. The alloy then is subjected to a PSN process comprising plastically deforming the alloy to provide sufficient strain energy in the alloy to ensure recrystallization, and statically recrystallizing the alloy. A grain structure exhibiting new, fine, equiaxed and uniform grains is produced in the alloy. An exemplary 6 xxx alloy of the type capable of being produced by the present invention, and which is useful for aerospace, automotive and other applications, is disclosed and claimed. The process is also suitable for processing any age-hardenable aluminum or other alloy...|$|R
40|$|The work of Burton, Crossland, Jones {{and others}} on the creep of, of grain size about 10 – 100 μm, at {{intermediate}} temperatures (about (0. 4 – 0. 6) Tm) and low stresses ((10 − 5 - 10 − 4) E), is reviewed. These investigators suggest that such materials will deform by diffusional (Coble) creep accompanied by a threshold stress below which creep will not occur. Jones' observations that the creep rates of such metals are generally faster than those predicted by Coble creep and that the observed threshold stresses are unpredictably high has led us to consider alternative mechanisms for plastic flow. Our analyses indicate that the creep of such materials follows a relation of the form, with no threshold stres, in agreement with the relation developed for describing fine-grained two-phase <b>superplastic</b> <b>alloys.</b> These correlations suggest that grain boundary sliding accommodated by slip is the principal mechanism of plastic flow. It is shown that diffusional creep (Coble) and grain boundary sliding accommodated by diffusional creep (Ashby-Verrall) are mechanisms which are not likely to contribute to plastic flow at stresses above 10 − 5 E.

40|$|Abstract. Experiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate the mechanical properties of a spray-cast Al- 7034 alloy processed by severe plastic deformation. The alloy was received with an average grain size of ~ 2. 1 µm and processed by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) at a temperature of 473 K to give a grain size of ~ 0. 3 µm after 6 or 8 passes. Following ECAP, the mechanical properties were evaluated at room temperature (298 K) and at an elevated temperature of 673 K. In tensile testing at ambient temperature, the stress-strain curves show very short regions of strain hardening after ECAP and low values for the ultimate tensile strength by comparison with the unpressed alloy. This lack of strength {{is due to the}} high pressures imposed by ECAP and the consequent fragmentation and dissolution of the rod-like MgZn 2 precipitates. It is shown that the strength may be restored by performing an appropriate ageing treatment after ECAP. Superplastic ductilities were recorded at a temperature of 673 K with tensile elongations exceeding 1000 %. Careful inspection of the polished surfaces of samples pulled to fracture in the superplastic condition revealed the occurrence of extensive internal cavitation. Quantitative measurements showed the development of these internal cavities is consistent with conventional <b>superplastic</b> <b>alloys...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} forming of near-net-shape {{parts from}} aluminum alloys is of significant interest for automotive and aerospace applications. It {{has traditionally been}} thought that the very high tensile ductilities necessary for many near-net-shape forming operations, in excess of 100 %, were only available in fine-grain superplastic materials. Tensile ductilities in excess of 300 %, however, have been attained in coarse-grain, non-superplastic, binary Al-Mg alloys {{as a result of}} a solute-drag-controlled dislocation creep process. Such enhanced ductilities from non-superplastic Al-Mg alloys might offer an inexpensive alternative to <b>superplastic</b> <b>alloys</b> that often require elaborate processing to develop fine grain sizes. In this investigation, tension tests at various temperatures and strain rates were used to characterize the ductility, strain-rate sensitivity, and strain-hardening behavior of two binary alloys: Al- 2. 8 wt. %Mg and Al- 5. 5 wt. %Mg. Under the proper conditions, tensile elongations of 300 % were achieved. The tensile elongations in these binary alloys were governed not by the onset of tensile instability in the classical sense, but by the rate of neck propagation when failure occurred by necking to a point. Predictions of tensile ductility for the case of failure by necking were made using a simple numerical model, and the results are correlated with data from the two binary alloys...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to study the {{cavitation}} and grain growth during superplastic forming. Design/methodology/approach: <b>Superplastic</b> <b>alloys</b> exhibit the extremely large elongation to failure by their high strain rate sensitivity. Cavities have widely been observed during superplastic deformation of metals and alloys and lead to the degradation of material properties such as tensile, creep, fatigue and stress-corrosion behavior. In this work, a finite element method is developed, which considers the grain growth {{and the effect of}} material damage. Findings: The effects of material parameters and deformation damage on the superplastic deformation process are numerically analyzed, and the means to control cavitation growth is discussed. The microstructural mechanism of grain growth during superplastic deformation is also studied. A new model considering the grain growth is proposed and applied to conventional superplastic materials The relationships between the strain, the strain rate, the test temperature, the initial grain size and the grain growth respectively in superplastic materials are discussed. Practical implications: The effect of variation of strain rate sensitivity (m value) on the strain limit of the superplastic deformation is investigated, and the theoretically calculated values are compared with the experimental results. Originality/value: A new microstructure model based on the microstructural mechanism of superplastic deformation has been proposed. This model has been successfully applied to analyze conventional superplastic materials...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{structural}} {{properties of}} LiFePO 4 {{prepared by the}} hydrothermal route and chemically delithiated have been studied using analytical electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and {{selected area electron diffraction}} measurements indicate that the partially delithiated particles include LiFePO 4 regions with cross-sections of finite size along the ac-plane, as a result of tilt grain boundary in the bc-plane, and dislocations in other directions. Only the boundary along the bc-plane is accompanied by a disorder over about 2 nm {{on each side of the}} boundary. The Raman spectrum shows the existence of both LiFePO 4 and FePO 4 phases in the shell of the particles at a delithiation degree of 50 %, which invalidates the core–shell model. This result also invalidates the recent model according to which each particle would be single-domain, i. e. either a LiFePO 4 particle or a FePO 4 particle. On the other hand, our results, like prior ones, can be understood within the framework of a model similar to the spinodal decomposition of a two-phase system, which is discussed within the framework of morphogenesis of patterns in systems at equilibrium. Both end-members, however, are well crystallized, suggesting a recovery similar to that observed in <b>superplastic</b> <b>alloys,</b> with dynamics that are due to the motion of nucleation fronts and dislocations, and not due to a diffusion phenomenon associated with a concentration gradient...|$|R
