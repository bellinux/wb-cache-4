5000|$|The Falloux Law created one academy {{for each}} department, decentralising the University and thus {{strengthening}} the notables' local influence. It reorganised the Superior Council of Education and academic councils, specifically by giving {{a large number}} of places to representatives of various religions, above all of Roman Catholicism. Eight University members had seats at the Superior Council of Public Instruction, alongside seven religious representatives (including four Catholics), three <b>state</b> <b>counsellors,</b> three members of the Institute, and three members representing [...] "free" [...] (i.e. private) teaching establishments.

However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi's government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in Shan and Kachin states, where thousands of refugees fled to China, and eventually the persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces escalated {{to the point that it}} is not uncommonly called a genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing. She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but no guarantees of citizenship.|$|E

Before the elections, Suu Kyi announced that {{even though she is}} constitutionally barred from the presidency, she would hold the real power in any NLD-led government. On 30 March 2016 she became Minister for the President's Office, for Foreign Affairs, for Education and for Electric Power and Energy in President Htin Kyaw's government; later she relinquished the latter two ministries and President Htin Kyaw appointed her <b>State</b> <b>Counsellor,</b> a position akin to a Prime Minister created especially for her.|$|E

50|$|With the Council {{set to be}} {{dissolved}} in December 1790, a provision of the new <b>state</b> constitution allowed <b>counsellors</b> and council officers whose terms would have expired that autumn {{to remain in office}} until December 21, rather than hold elections for new counsellors who would sit for only one or two months. Also, a review of the dates on which a particular county's counsellors began their terms will reveal several instances in which more than three years elapsed between the start of successive terms. It is uncertain whether the seat technically became vacant after exactly three years or if the incumbent's term extended to the start of his successor's, even if this meant exceeding the three-year term limit imposed by the 1776 Constitution.|$|R
30|$|Also, a {{counsellor}} learns self-kindness and self-compassion (Germer [2009] and Ding [2009]), {{through which}} s/he retains {{a positive attitude}} towards her/himself with {{the least amount of}} self-criticism and self-blame (Neff [2003], Neff, Kirkpatrick, and Rude [2007]). This healthy and balanced psychological <b>state</b> enables the <b>counsellor</b> to maintain self-awareness, self-esteem, self-worth, self-acceptance, and self-motivation (Neff [2004], Williams, Stark, and Foster [2008], Neff, Kirkpatrick, and Rude [2007], Neff and Vonk [2009]), which is especially important for counselling practitioners to prevent burnout or compassion fatigue (Patsiopoulos and Buchanan [2011]), and avoid over-involvement in others’ miseries (Cheng [2013]). In order words, a counsellor retains passion to help clientslxxvi but neither attaches themselves to their situation nor over-invests compassionlxxvii, because the bodhi nature is inherent in sentient beings, and is able to adjust her/his mental contentment accordingly.|$|R

40|$|In {{producing}} {{this special}} issue of the Canadian Counsellor we have had three goals: (a) to bring together in a single volume, for the first time, vari-ous points of view and research reports on counsel-lor training in Canada; (b) to distribute to all counsellor educators in Canada {{the results of a}} research study designed to test the competency preferences of a national sample of counsellor edu-cators, counsellor supervisors, practicing counsel-lors and counselling students; and (c) to present a condensed "state-of-the-art " literature review on counsellor education. To achieve this third goal, we have cited studies {{from a wide range of}} North American sources. This review confirms that the <b>state</b> of <b>counsellor</b> education reflects a number of unresolved issues. In an edition of The Counseling Psychologist addressing the issue of "Professional Identity", Shertzer and Isaacson (1977) suggested the most striking feature of counselling psychology today is its disarray. They contend that "incredible controversy abounds about its identity, licensure, practises, training models, clients served, effective-ness, to cite a few issues " (p. 33). The rest of this editorial essay is devoted to a condensed review of approximately the last decade of literature and attempts to identify trends and conclusions in counsellor education that can be reasonably supported by the available evidence. Those issues selected for review include: definition and identity; characteristics of the counsellor; counsellor competencies, standards, training modes, and practicum and supervision. The essay closes with a few predictions for the future. Definition and Identification: "For what are we training?"...|$|R
