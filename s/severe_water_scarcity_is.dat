40|$|SIEBEL,maarten: van der Zaag,PIETER: nase,dima: gijzen,Huub:Water in the West Bank of Palestine is a {{key issue}} due to its limited availability. Water is used from own sources for domestic, industrial, and {{agricultural}} purposes. Moreover, water is consumed in its virtual form through consumption of imported goods, such as crops and livestock, the production of which used water {{in the country of}} production. In addition, wastewater {{in many parts of the}} West Bank is disposed off without treatment into the wadis, deteriorating the quality of the water resources in the area and, therefore, further reducing the quantity of good quality water available. This paper calculates the water footprint for the West Bank. The consumption component of the water footprint of the West Bank was found to be 2, 791 million m 3 ⁄ year. Approximately 52 % of this is virtual water consumed through imported goods. The West Bank per capita consumption component of the water footprint was found to be 1, 116 m 3 ⁄ cap ⁄ year, while the global average is 1, 243 m 3 ⁄ cap ⁄- year. Out of this number 50 m 3 ⁄ cap ⁄ year was withdrawn from water resources available in the area. Only 16 m 3 ⁄ cap ⁄ year (1. 4 %) was used for domestic purposes. This number is extremely low and only 28 % of the global average and 21 % of the Israeli domestic water use. The contamination component of the water footprint was not quantified but was believed to be many times larger than the consumption component. According to the official definition of <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> the West Bank is suffering from a <b>severe</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity.</b> Therefore, there <b>is</b> a need for a completely new approach towards water management in the West Bank, whereby return flows are viewed as a resource and that is geared towards a conservation oriented approach of ‘‘use, treat, and reuse. ’’Water rights - West BankWater supply - West BankWater conservation - West Ban...|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{indicates}} China {{is experiencing}} a water crisis, were several regions <b>are</b> suffering of <b>severe</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> and rivers <b>are</b> heavily polluted. On the other hand, water is used inefficiently and wastefully: water use efficiency in the agriculture sector is only 40 % and within industry, only 40 % of the industrial wastewater is recycled. However, based on statistical data, China’s total water resources is ranked sixth in the world, based on its water resources and yet, Yellow River and Hai River dries up in its estuary every year. In some regions, the water situation is exacerbated {{by the fact that}} rivers’ water is heavily polluted with a large amount of untreated wastewater, discharged into the rivers and deteriorating the water quality. Several regions’ groundwater is overexploited due to human activities demand, which is not met by local. Some provinces have over withdrawn groundwater, which has caused ground subsidence and increased soil salinity. So what is the situation in China? Is there a water crisis, and if so, what are the causes? This report is a review of several global <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> assessment methods and summarizes the findings of the results of China’s water resources to get a better understanding about the water situation. All of the methods indicated that <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>is</b> mainly concentrated to north China due to rapid growth, overexploitation from rivers and reduced precipitation. Whereas, South China is indicated as abundant in water resources, however, parts of the region <b>are</b> experiencing <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> due to massive dam constructions for water storage and power production. Too many dam constructions in a river disrupts flow of the river water and pollutants are then accumulated within floodgates. Many Chinese officials and scholars believe that with economic growth comes improved environmental quality when the economy has reached to a certain of per-capita level. However, with the present water situation it is not sustainable or possible for China to keep consuming and polluting its water resources. Improvement of environmental quality does not come automatically with increased income, and policies, laws and regulations are needed in order to stop further deterioration of the environment. China’s water situation is not any news and the key factor is human activities, but the question is how to solve it. China’s water crisis is much more complex than over exploitation of groundwater and surface water. There are three water issues in China:  “too much water – floods, too little water – droughts, and too dirty water – water pollution” (Jun & Chen, 2001). Thus, solving China’s water crisis is a huge challenge to solve without negatively affecting the economic growth. ...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{increasingly}} affecting social-environmental systems and rural {{communities across the}} globe. It is expected to impact upon the climatic conditions on Chinas Loess Plateau, principally through prolonged variations in rainfall and droughts, pushing communities and farmers beyond their current adaptive capacity. There is an urgent need for assistance in building resilience and undertaking climate change adaptation efforts {{in order to reduce}} the vulnerability of social-environmental systems and farmers' livelihoods on the Plateau. The social-environmental systems on Chinas Loess Plateau are unique in that they are extremely dynamic and fragile due to severe deforestation, soil erosion, water stresses, and poverty, which have occurred over many centuries. Two remarkable and vast programs, the Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Program (1994 - 2005) by the World Bank, and the national Grain for Green (1999 -current) project, to a large extent, have made the social-environmental systems on the Plateau more resilient to environmental stresses. However, neither of these two initiatives has integrated climate change scenarios into planning, design or implementation. It reveals that emerging vulnerabilities to climate change have already affected these initiatives long-term sustainability. For instance, trees planted died due to <b>severe</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> and farmers <b>were</b> forced to re-farm retired land due to reduced farm income caused by unfavorable climatic effects. Therefore, the integration of climate change implications into the policy-making processes and adaptive management strategy are keys to enhancing the resilience of social-environmental systems on the Plateau. The case study area of Huachi explores in greater depth the vulnerability of agriculture and farmers livelihoods to climate change. It identified the following adaptive strategies currently available to local farmers: cultivation of drought resistant crops and varieties; water-saving agricultural technologies; and non-farm employment. It has been found that farmers resilience to the adverse effects of changing climatic conditions has been improved. The results also found that main factors can enhance farmers adaptive capacity are farmers knowledge and skills; access to climate information, farming technology and infrastructure; access to markets, farmland tenure and off-farm activities. These findings have considerable relevance for the Chinese Government in their efforts to develop policies aimed at improving these factors...|$|R

In order to devise appropriate measures for rehabilitation of the failing schemes and to enhance farmers’ adaptation capacity to <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> it <b>is</b> important to assess site specific plot and scheme level water management practices, challenges, farmers’ perceptions and adaptation strategies. So far, {{there is no such}} study in the context of Tigray, Ethiopia. A survey was conducted on 109 farmers in three groups based on the source of {{irrigation water}}, which included canal, seepage and both canal and seepage water users. Focus group discussions with elders, water users association (WUA) committee and women headed households were also made. Furthermore, random field measurements on conveyance loss, groundwater depth and quality (EC) were also taken to verify the farmers’ perception. The respondents’ perception of <b>severe</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> at scheme level and poor on-farm and scheme level water management practices are among the major causes for aggravating <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> crops yield decline and soil salinization were in line with field observations.

40|$|Biofuel is an {{important}} renewable fuel in the energy transition, especially in the transport sector. Bioethanol demand is rising, {{which means that the}} land use for biofuel crops such as sugarcane is increasing. Brazilian sugarcane-based bioethanol is a major source of biofuel. It is expected that Brazilian bioethanol production will increase, and thus sugarcane expansion is likely to occur, especially in the Parana basin in south east Brazil. Biofuel increase is associated with risks, such as food competition and increased water consumption. This thesis investigates what the impact of expansion scenarios would <b>be</b> on <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> by the year 2030. Land use projections for 2030 are adapted for use in the hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB, which is run over a period of 30 years in various scenarios. These are analyzed based on discharge and sampling points, which are reported chronologically, seasonally, and in flow duration curves. <b>Water</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>is</b> analyzed based on river flow reduction. According to the findings, tenfold expansion of non-irrigated Brazilian sugarcane will not result in <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in the Parana basin. When irrigation is fully applied however, a doubling of sugarcane production just touches the low <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> border (> 20 % flow reduction), a tripling causes low <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> (20 - 30 %), a fivefold increase results in moderate <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> (3040 %) and a tenfold increase leads to <b>severe</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> (> 40 %). This indicates that for <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> projections, the irrigated area {{is more important than the}} expanded area. From a perspective of avoiding <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> it <b>is</b> better for policies to focus on limiting irrigation than on limiting sugarcane expansion. For the near future, the likely expansion within Parana for the year 2030 is expected to double or (optimistically) triple. With irrigation remaining low (25 % across Brazil, including the dry north east), these expansions will likely cause low to no <b>water</b> <b>scarcity.</b> This allows for a doubling or even tripling of current bioethanol production. Although it remains important to assess <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> it will likely not be the main limitation to bioethanol expansion...|$|R

Three problematic District Metered Areas (DMAs) were chosen. The DSS provided a list of prioritized NRW reduction measures targeting at various NRW causes for each DMA. Nicosia’s water utility officials decided to apply some of the short-listed measures in those DMAs, resulting in significant NRW reduction and additional benefits. The annual water savings came up to 1 million m 3, equal to 4. 8 % of the water entering the network. Economic benefits of more than 700, 000 € are noted.
