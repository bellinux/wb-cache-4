40|$|In the future, robots {{will support}} humans in their every day activities. One {{particular}} challenge that robots will face is understanding and reasoning about {{the actions of}} other agents in order to cooperate effectively with humans. We propose to tackle this using a developmental framework, where the robot incrementally acquires knowledge, and in particular 1) <b>self-learns</b> a mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences, 2) rapidly acquires primitives and complex actions by verbal descriptions and instructions from a human partner, 3) discovers correspondences between the robots body and other articulated objects and agents, and 4) employs these correspondences to transfer the knowledge acquired from the robots point of view to the viewpoint of the other agent. We show that our approach requires very little a-priori knowledge to achieve imitation learning, to find correspondent body parts of humans, and allows taking the perspective of another agent.

2500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether from the onset [...] "the Cortina method" [...] entailed mechanically-aided learning. Some claim that already in the mid-1880s Cortina experimented with {{phonograph}} recordings, possibly in co-operation with Thomas Edison. It was in 1893 that his method was reported in The Phonogram, an academic journal, and he became the first person to use phonograph for foreign language instruction. It soon became a second leg of his business, as on-site learning was paired with development of <b>self-learning</b> correspondence courses and production of related aid materials. They consisted of two types. One was own textbooks; they contained excerpts from literary works, though also phrases tailored for daily usage. Another one was recordings. Initially phonograph-intended cylinders were used; first branded by Cortina, after 1896 they were made by Edison’s National Phonographic Company. In 1908 he registered the trademark of Cortinaphone, selling own brand of phonograph, and since 1913 his company started to issue flat round recordings. The Cortina school kept using English for instruction until 1920, when they switched to target language only. Around 1920 he was marketing [...] "Cortina phonograph outfit", advertised as more efficient than teaching by instructors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{absence of}} many {{military}} aspects {{does not mean}} that Baden-Powell was anti-military. His efforts for peace became stronger in time, making him anti-war, but he disapproved of anti-militarism. He even did not see any harm in training in a military way. One reason for not using military items can be seen from his reaction to the Boys Brigade. It was the intention of Baden-Powell to make an attractive boys game and he thought that the military was not attractive enough. The second reason was that some parents would object military training, which would limit the reach of Scouting. There was probably another reason. The centre of his Scout method was individuality (opposite to the group), making own decisions (opposite to following the commander), doing good turns, <b>self-learning</b> (opposite to instruction by drill) and a game based on theatre and [...] "make believe". These would never survive in a military scheme. Baden-Powell did use some parts of his profession which he found useful, like the uniform and some names, but these are always externals, rarely the essential fighting intention of military or specific military techniques.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} of hardware design and radio technologies {{have opened the}} way for an emerging category of network-enabled smart physical devices as a result of convergence in computing and wireless communication capabilities. Inspired by biological interactions, distributed processing of data collected by individual devices is now becoming crucial to let the nodes <b>self-learn</b> relevant network-state information and self-organize without the support of a central unit. Focus of this paper is twofold. First, a novel network channel model tailored for dense deployments is developed and validated on real data. The model describes relevant channel features that are representative of site-specific static/dynamic multipath fading and are shared by all links of a network. Second, a new class of distributed weighted-consensus strategies is introduced to support distributed network calibration and localization in device-to-device networks. Network calibration allows the devices to <b>self-learn</b> the common channel parameters, by successive refinements of local estimates and peer-to-peer information exchange. Network-localization enables each node to acquire augmented information about the whole network topology, by distributed learning from local channel observations. The proposed distributed algorithms guarantee a fast convergence and can replace conventional centralized schemes. An experimental case study is discussed in a representative indoor environment for the purpose of system validation. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of conventional solutions...|$|R
