40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle filter elements can be used directly as inverted candle filter elements, {{and the development of a}} new type of filter element is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle filter elements were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle filter elements, and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle filter elements are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> elements were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> element is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> element may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> elements could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> element manufacturing has not been established. The development of the <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, filter element fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|E

The three isoforms were stable up to 50 °C. The thermal inactivation curves of the enzymes as a function of time were biphasic at a temperature of 60 °C. Analysis of the gene expression of &# 946;-galactosidase was carried out using degenerate primers and total RNA from the stems of seedlings at ED III and ED VIII, sown both as control and under saline treatments. The results showed higher transcript levels at ED VIII, with reduced levels of &# 946;-galactosidase transcripts under saline treatment, and that &# 946;-gal I, II and III do not undergo changes during the early stages of development. There are a few differences in the properties of the three isoforms. Salinity affected the gene expression of enzymes. The enzymes were expressed differently for ED III and ED VIII...|$|R
50|$|Wide angle L-lenses {{typically}} have a {{gelatin filter holder}} on the mounting point of the lens, which allows the photographer to cut a small, square piece of gelatin out of a larger <b>filter</b> <b>sheet</b> {{and place it on}} the lens. On film cameras, these are typically used to correct the color temperature, but on digital cameras this is largely unnecessary, as the color temperature can be corrected in software. The mount is still commonly used for neutral density gelatin sheets though, especially on certain wide-angle lenses where the protruding front element precludes the use of any screw-in filters. Some telephoto L-lenses, such as the EF 70-200mm zoom lenses, or the EF 300mm f/4L IS USM do not have rear gelatin filter holders. Super-telephoto lenses such as the EF 500mm f/4L IS USM, or the EF 200mm f/2L IS USM do have a rear 52mm drop-in filter holder which can be used to hold gelatin type filters.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{viability}} of Aedes aegypti eggs was assessed in the Amazon region. The eggs were maintained under different conditions: indoors (insectarium) and outdoors (natural environment), {{as well as}} in different storage types (plastic cup, paper envelope, plastic bag) for different days. Egg viability was measured as the mean of hatchings observed from egg-bearing <b>sheets</b> of <b>filter</b> paper immersed in water, using three sheets randomly selected from each storage type and at both sites. There were significant differences in the {{viability of}} Ae. aegypti eggs with respect to the location (F= 30. 40; DF= 1; P< 0. 0001), storage type (F= 17. 66; DF= 2; P< 0. 0001), and time of storage (F= 49. 56; DF= 9; P< 0. 0001). The interaction between storage site versus storage type was also significant (F= 15. 96; DF= 2; P< 0. 0001). A higher hatching mean was observed for the eggs kept in the insectarium than for those outdoors (32. 38 versus 7. 46). Hatching rates of egg batches stored for 12 to 61 days ranged between 84 and 90 %. A reduction was observed between 89 and 118 days, with values of 63 and 48 %, respectively. With respect to type of storage, mean egg hatching was higher for the eggs in plastic cups (44. 46). It was concluded that the viability of the eggs of Ae. aegypti in the Amazon region remains high up to 4 months, after which it declines drastically, although in this study hatching occurred for up to 8 months in very low percentages...|$|R
