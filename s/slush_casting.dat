50|$|Permanent mold casting is a {{metal casting}} process that employs {{reusable}} molds ("permanent molds"), usually made from metal. The most common process uses gravity {{to fill the}} mold, however gas pressure or a vacuum are also used. A variation on the typical gravity casting process, called <b>slush</b> <b>casting,</b> produces hollow castings. Common casting metals are aluminium, magnesium, and copper alloys. Other materials include tin, zinc, and lead alloys and iron and steel are also cast in graphite molds.|$|E

50|$|To make thin, {{lead alloy}} badges, makers {{would have to}} create a {{eutectic}} alloy. Only at a specific ratio would lead and tin cast thin enough {{to make the most of}} the cheapest metal. The quality of pilgrim badges varied considerably, with some being naive and crudely made and others displaying great craftsmanship and skill. Ampullae, vessels for holy water or oil, were harder to make than badges, necessitating a process called <b>slush</b> <b>casting.</b> Much rarer examples were made in precious metals for the wealthy; these have mostly been recycled for their valuable materials over the centuries.|$|E

50|$|Miniature {{models of}} {{automobiles}} {{first appeared in}} Europe around the time real automobiles did. Then, shortly after, they appeared in the United States (Harvey 1974, p. 1995-1996). These were toys and replicas often made of lead and brass (Harvey 1974, p. 1995). Later models made {{in the early twentieth}} century were <b>slush</b> <b>cast</b> plaster or iron. Tin and pressed steel cars, trucks, and military vehicles, like those made by Bing of Germany, were introduced in the 1920s through the 1940s, but period models rarely copied actual vehicles, likely because of the crudeness of early casting and metal shaping techniques (Harvey 1974, p. 1995, 1997). Casting vehicles in various alloys, usually zinc (called zamac or mazac), became popular in the late 1930s and remained prominent after World War II (Earle 2009).|$|R
50|$|<b>Slush</b> <b>casting</b> is {{a variant}} of {{permanent}} molding casting to create a hollow casting or hollow cast. In the process the material is poured into the mold and allowed to cool until a shell of material forms in the mold. The remaining liquid is then poured out to leave a hollow shell. The resulting casting has good surface detail but the wall thickness can vary. The process is usually used to cast ornamental products, such as candlesticks, lamp bases, and statuary, from low-melting-point materials. A similar technique is used to make hollow chocolate figures for Easter and Christmas.|$|E
5000|$|Plastisol is {{used for}} slush molding or <b>slush</b> <b>casting,</b> a form of spin casting that {{is more complex than}} {{relatively}} simple resin casting, but less expensive and less sophisticated than the injection molding used for most plastic products. It involves metal molds that are filled with liquid plastisol. When the open mold cavities are filled, the mold is spun on a heavy duty, high speed centrifuge to force the liquid vinyl into all of the fine detail on the interior of the mold. Then the metal mold is placed into a heating solution, usually an industrial salt heated to about [...] The liquid vinyl cooks for a few seconds. The mold is then removed from the heating solution and the remaining liquid is poured out. This leaves a thin skin of vinyl on the interior of the metal mold. The mold is then placed back into the heating solution for three to four minutes to cure. After curing, the mold is again removed from the heating solution, cooled with water, and placed on a rack. While the vinyl part is still warm in the mold, it is very flexible and can be removed from the mold with pliers. When the parts cool, they become rigid and are ready for assembly.|$|E
40|$|Casting is {{most often}} used for making complex shapes that would be {{otherwise}} difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods is a manufacturing process by which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. After a certain time, the excess liquid will poured out, and then the solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process. Casting {{may be used to}} form various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay Therefore, this study is conducted to fabricate the tool holder by using rubberwood as the material for the pattern, RTV- 2 silicone rubber for the mould and polyester resin for product. The main objective {{of this study is to}} to study the effect of solidification time to the wall thickness created on the <b>slush</b> <b>casting</b> product to suit the function of product and find the optimum solidification time to achieve desire wall thickness for particular <b>slush</b> <b>casting</b> product. The study parameters are based on <b>slush</b> <b>casting</b> solidification time, which are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 minutes. The study output is wall thickness and digital vernier caliper is used to measure the dimension of wall thickness. Based on the measurement, only product have the value factor of safety (FOS) more than one, > 1 is selected as a product. Based on the study analysis, it is discovered that the highest solidification time produce the highest wall thickness created on the product...|$|E
5000|$|In {{its heyday}} Barclay {{produced}} 500,000 toys a week, making them the largest toy soldier manufacturer {{at that time}} in the United States (Young and Young 2007, 550). In 1939 Barclay acquired another toy soldier company, Tommy Toy and its art deco sculptor Olive Kooken (Fendelman and Rosson 2009) [...] Soldier's uniforms followed military fashion of the times, replacing closed standing collars with open ones with shirt and tie. Wrap around puttees were replaced by canvas leggings. Prior to the company's temporary closing in 1942 the foot soldiers were purchased individually for a nickel.Some of Barclay's first vehicles were <b>slush</b> <b>cast</b> white metal made in the 1930s. Some of the most interesting models were in art deco style. One intriguing selection was a [...] "Coast to Coast" [...] art deco style bus - another a two tone oil tanker with pontoon fenders - on both models, fenders were different colors from the bodies. One available set had a cartoon-like strip on the box lid that stated it was a [...] "Build and Paint Your Own Auto Set" [...] which was [...] "Loads of fun". The set included a four-door sedan, a two-door, and a tanker truck. It included paint and the cars had white rubber wheels.|$|R
