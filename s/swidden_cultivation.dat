One agent implicated in current discourse surrounding tropical forest fires is the small-scale farming peasantry {{who rely on}} fire in <b>swidden</b> (shifting <b>cultivation,</b> slash-and-burn) agriculture. The environmental degradation associated with fire has led to government responses at multiple scales (international, national, state, regional) via policies aimed mainly at managing ignition sources. However, continued increase in forest fires suggests that these policies may be having limited impact and a fresh evaluation of current policy approaches to fire management is needed. We review fire policy measures with insights of caboclo farming practices and perspectives from Eastern Amazonia and examine the congruence between policy and practice. We demonstrate a significant disparity between policy requirements such as firebreaks and actual fire management practices, in which measures rarely meet requirements outlined in legislation. We explore the origins and the impacts of these disparities, focussing on smallholder farm-level management measures and local capacity. Incomplete knowledge coupled with marginal awareness of legal requirements served to propagate widespread erroneous beliefs in what these are. This analysis at multiple scales (international, national, state, regional) will contribute to developing greater congruence between fire policies and smallholder farming practices...|$|R

In Timor- Leste shifting cultivation is still practiced nowadays as a form of subsistence agriculture. Swidden agriculture is characterized by slash and burn clearing, by a rotation of fields rather than of crops, and by short periods of cropping (1 - 3 years) alternating with long fallow periods. Based on the characterization of shifting cultivation in two Sucos of Bobonaro district, a reflection is made on the impact of this practice in the sustainable development of forest ecosystems of Timor- Leste. Primary data collection was performed using a questionnaire survey of farmers practicing shifting cultivation. The questionnaire characterized shifting cultivation, and asked farmers’ opinion on slash and burning of forest areas and on the importance of forests. According to the results obtained, in most situations the existing vegetation before the slash was composed of dense forest, the slash is made by the family group, the majority of farmers have been doing the “slush and burn” for more than ten years and the size of the plots where slash is made is less than 2 hectares. The materials resulting from the slash are used for firewood, building materials and fencing. The burning of vegetable residues is done before planting and soil preparation and sowing is done with a lever. Land and forest, despite having an individual use, have a tenure regime of ownership and access in which its nature of common pool good prevails.

The interview was conducted in April 2007 to all 41 households in the community.

40|$|Swidden (also called {{shifting}} cultivation) {{has long}} been the dominant farming system in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia (MMSEA). Today the ecological bounty of this region is threatened by the expansion of settled agriculture, including the proliferation of rubber plantations. In the current conception of REDD+, landscapes involving swidden qualify almost automatically for replacement by other land-use systems because swiddens are perceived to be degraded and inefficient with regard to carbon sequestration. However, swiddening in some cases may be carbon-neutral or even carbon positive, compared with some other types of land-use systems. In this paper we describe how agricultural policies and institutions have affected land use in the region over the last several decades and the impact these policies have had on the livelihoods of swiddeners and other smallholders. We also explore whether incentivizing transitions away from <b>swiddening</b> to the <b>cultivation</b> of rubber will directly or reliably produce carbon gains. We argue that because government policies affect how land is used, they also influence carbon emissions, farmer livelihoods, environmental services, {{and a host of other}} variables. A deeper and more systematic analysis of the multiple consequences of these policies is consequently necessary for the design of successful REDD+ policies in MMSEA, and other areas of the developing world.

On the contrary, is has nowadays widely been recognized amid scientists that, the practice is not as detrimental as believed. Nepal, being situated in the Himalayas has been experiencing rapid land-use changes in the last years due to changing policy, local developments and growing concern on environmental issues. The country is also highly vulnerable to climate change. For decades, swidden locally known as bhasme- has been a common practice in the mountains of Nepal. Despite decades of policy disputes, ignorance and misunderstanding of that age-old system, swidden is still the mainstay of livelihoods of many people. We performed an exploratory study in two central hill districts of Nepal amongst the rural Chepang farmers (N = 51) who lives on swiddening traditionally for years, to investigates the changes so far been taken place in the area, local understanding and perceptions of swidden agriculture. Study revealed that, although this land-use practice is changing rapidly, and cash crop based sedentary agriculture is becoming the prominent land-use, the role of swidden agriculture in food security is still crucial. The main reasons why farmers practice swidden agricultural are, in an order of importance: lack of secure tenure; poverty and unemployment; cultural identity; absence of alternative land-use options and as their traditional right.

The number of years that a swidden will lay fallow is determined by the plants demand for the nitrogen in the soil.

40|$|This ethnoecological {{study of}} the Makushi Amerindians of Amazonian Guyana explores the place of plants in the {{indigenous}} culture and cosmology. The North Rupununi, the homeland of the Makushi people, is a bioculturally diverse mosaic of neotropical savannahs, forests, and wetlands. As subsistence hunters, fishers, and horticulturalists, the Makushi live in a constant and dynamic interaction with their ecologically rich surroundings. Against the human-faunal bias latent in much Amazonian anthropology, I place plants firmly at the centre of analysis, a positioning that mirrors their centrality in the ethnographic context. Human-plant encounters explored herein include <b>swidden</b> agriculture, the <b>cultivation</b> of bitter cassava, the fermentation of cassava drinks using a domesticated fungus, {{the use of a}} category of charm plants, and the consumption of plant substances in shamanic ritual. With the Makushi, I emphasise the status of plants as living selves and agents of semiosis, occupying perspectives on the world in and outside of their interactions with human beings. In order to investigate ethno-theories of life, I attempt to understand the constitution of the person â and associated notions of body and soul â in the indigenous cosmology. Makushi ontology can be characterised as animic â though as I argue, it also incorporates naturalistic and analogic elements. Thus, it is poly-ontological. This study pursues a dual goal: first, to pay heed to the trans-specific domain of living entities revealed in the Makushi ethnoecology, and second, to rethink conventional symbolic frameworks characteristic of anthropological approaches to culture. I explore the application of a more robust approach to sign-flows in nature â Peircian ecosemiotics â that allows for the analysis of plant communication, birdcalls, insect stings, and leaf patterns, as well as human language. In tracing these interspecific webs of signification, conclusions are drawn about the varied ways in which Makushi people engage with and think about their living environment. At the same time, many Makushi multispecies engagements are based on the physical transfer of substances between bodies of different kinds. In order to better account for this pervasive âsubstance logicâ, greater attention must be paid to indigenous notions of corporeality and personhood. In doing so, I propose a dual analytical model that takes both the flows of signs and the flows of substances as its combined objective. This approach enables new conclusions to be drawn about multispecies relationality in indigenous Amazonian cosmologies. </p...|$|R

This suddenly increased demand for tropical timber has stimulated additional competition for hitherto unvalued forestland and provoked increased criticism of upland swidden farming groups. Although traditional levels of swidden farming did not cause the same level of land and forest damage as have recent logging activities, government statements increasingly have attributed rapid deforestation to swidden clearing and have envisioned the abolition of all upland <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> soon after the year 2000.

A continuing low-level insurgency against the government, substantially led by Hmong refugees who formerly fought for the RLG, is a further source of official mistrust directed at some Hmong and other minority groups. Government efforts to resettle Hmong and other swidden farming communities in lowland sites are motivated by security concerns—as was the case under the RLG in the 1960s and 1970s—and by competition for timber, but may lead to increased disaffection of the minorities affected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> on carbon storage and soil quality are {{outlined}} and {{compared to the}} effects of the intensified production systems that swidden systems of Southeast Asia transform into. Time-averaged aboveground carbon stocks decline by about 90 % if the long fallow periods of traditional <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> are reduced to 4 years and by about 60 % if <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> is converted to oil palm plantations. Stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) in tree plantations are 0 – 40 % lower than stocks in <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation,</b> with the largest losses found in mechanically established oil palm plantations. Impacts of tree plantations on soil quality are to a large extent determined by management. Conversion of swiddening to continuous annual cropping systems brings about substan-tial losses of time-averaged aboveground carbon stocks, reductions of SOC stocks and generally leads to declining soil quality. Knowledge of carbon storage in belowground biomass of tree based systems of the tropics is sparse but failure to include this pool in carbon inventories may significantly underestimate the total biomass of the systems. Moreover, studies that consider the ecological reasons behind farmers ’ land use decisions as well as spatial variability in biogeophysical and edaphological parameters are needed to evaluate the effects of the ongoing land use transitions in Southeast Asia...|$|E

Therefore, the government established the "Karen Area" in the late 19 th century, permitting <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> (shifting cultivation) for their self consumption. Short cultivation, long fallow <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> has been continued for over 100 years in the areas. We surveyed fallow vegetation and total carbon and nitrogen after <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> by Karen people in the Bago mountain range and compared with those in natural teak forests under selective logging systems. We set 9 circular plots 20 m in radius at fallow stands of various ages. Trees were identified and measured by diameter at breast height (DBH). Surface soil was sampled at 0 – 5 cm. The amounts of total carbon and nitrogen in soils varied among the plots, but no stand age dependency was observed. Grass and herb species such as Chromolaena odoratum and Thysanolaena maxima were dominant and comprised the maximum biomass in 1 - and 2 -year fallows. Bamboo species such as Bambusa polymorpha and Bambusa tulda rapidly recovered after grass and herb species, and the bamboo biomass in the 5 -year fallow was nearly equivalent to that in over- 40 -years fallows. Tree species recovered to nearly the same biomass level as that of bamboos in the 10 -year fallow, and further facilitated the increase in the above-ground biomass. Xylia xylocarpa was the most common tree species while species such as T. grandis might be excluded from the fallow vegetation cycle.

The Gunung Salak valley in West Java, Indonesia is presented as a case study. Based on farmersâ�� and expertsâ�� assessment, costs and benefits have been estimated, which show that the two investigated agroforestry systems have higher net present value and benefit-cost ratio (B/C) than the two <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> systems. Tree ownership also creates more permanent rights to farmland and is prestigious in the community. Agroforestry products (fruit, vegetables etc.) have high monetary value and help strengthen social cohesion when shared with neighbors. However, farmers are reluctant to implement agroforestry.

Farmers practicing agroforestry are less involved in forest clearing and forest products collection than swidden farmers indicating that it may contribute positively to conservation of local forests.

40|$|Understanding how land-use {{intensification}} affects forest resilience {{is a key}} for elucidating {{the mechanisms}} underlying regeneration processes and for planning more sustainable land-use systems. Here, we evaluate how the intensification of a <b>swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> system affects secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon. Along a gradient of land-use intensity, we analysed the relative role of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration in determining the resilience of early secondary forests (SFs). We assessed resilience as the recovery level of forest structure and species diversity achieved by SFs 5 years after abandonment. We used as a reference the recovery level achieved by SFs subjected to the lowest intensity of use, given that these SFs {{are part of a}} dynamic system and may not develop to old-growth forests. Therefore, we interpreted a deviation from this reference level as a change in forest resilience. The recovery of forest structure was determined by management intensity, while the recovery of species diversity was driven by landscape configuration. With increasing number of cycles and weeding frequency along with decreasing fallow period and patch area, SF basal area and canopy height decreased, regeneration shifted from a seed- to sprout-dependent strategy, and liana infestation on trees increased. With decreasing area covered by old-growth forest, species richness and Shannon diversity decreased. Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification, mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration strategies. Our findings demonstrate the – many times overlooked – importance of previous management intensity in determining the structure of SFs and highlight the importance of regeneration strategy for forest resilience. Synthesis. <b>Swidden</b> <b>cultivation</b> supports people's livelihoods and transforms landscapes in the tropics. The sustainability of this system depends on ecosystem services provided by SFs that develop during the fallow period. Land-use intensification reduces the resilience of SFs and ultimately may drive the system towards an arrested succession state that holds a lower potential to deliver ecosystem services to the Amazonian people.
