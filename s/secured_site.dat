The encryption key is obtained on the first start by requesting random keys a certain number of times.Opera Mini supports most advanced version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol it also supports modern secure ciphers like AES-GCM and ECC.

40|$|We {{show that}} the time web sites take to respond to HTTP {{requests}} can leak private information, using {{two different types of}} attacks. The first, direct timing, directly measures response times from a web site to expose private information such as validity of an username at a <b>secured</b> <b>site</b> or the number of private photos in a publicly viewable gallery. The second, cross-site timing, enables a malicious web site to obtain information from the user’s perspective at another site. For example, a malicious site can learn if the user is currently logged in at a victim site and, in some cases, the number of objects in the user’s shopping cart. Our experiments suggest that these timing vulnerabilities are wide-spread. We explain in detail how and why these attacks work, and discuss methods for writing web application code that resists these attacks...|$|E
40|$|Arguably, {{the more}} likely route by which terrorists might gain access to nuclear or other WMD {{capabilities}} is not through the possible collaboration between ‘rogue states’ and terrorist groups but through theft from improperly-secured sites in countries like Pakistan. The two main routes by which a terrorist group could acquire a nuclear weapon are: (1) transfer, that is, the deliberate hand off of a weapon from a nuclear state to a terrorist group; and (2) leakage, an unauthorised transfer or theft of a weapon from an inadequately <b>secured</b> <b>site.</b> Although after 9 / 11 the nightmare scenario focused on the possible collaboration between ‘rogue states’ and terrorist groups, this paper argues that, in fact, {{the more likely}} route by which terrorists might gain access to nuclear or other WMD capabilities is through the accidental leakage (that is, theft) of dangerous materials and technologies from inadequately-secured sites, primarily in Russia and Pakistan...|$|E
