In April 1780 the 64th {{was part of the}} covering force besieging Charleston, while the grenadier and light companies formed part of the main siege force. After the capture of Charleston, the grenadier and light companies were withdrawn to New York and as Major-General Cornwallis began to advance on Virginia, the 64th remained in Carolina as guard troops. In 1781 the 64th were involved in the Battle of Eutaw Springs and a year later in one of the last actions of the war, the Battle of the Combahee River. The grenadier company was reunited with the 64th but the light company was among the units that surrendered with Cornwallis at Yorktown.|$|E

25|$|As {{soon as the}} Captain of the Guard {{declared}} his charge to make him prisoner, Cromwell in a rage cast his bonnet on the ground, saying to the duke of Norfolk and others of the Privy Council assembled there {{that this was the}} reward of his services, and that he appealed to their consciences as to whether he was a traitor; but since he was treated thus he renounced all pardon, as he had never thought to have offended, and only asked the King not to make him languish long. Thereupon some said he was a traitor, others that he should be judged according to the laws he had made, which were so sanguinary that often words spoken inadvertently with good intention had been constituted high treason. The duke of Norfolk having reproached him with some “villennyes” done by him, snatched off the order of St. George which he bore on his neck, and the Admiral, to show himself as great an enemy in adversity as he had been thought a friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then, by a door which opens upon the water, he was put in a boat and taken to the Tower without the people of this town suspecting it until they <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> King's archers under Mr. Cheyney {{at the door of the}} prisoner's house, where they made an inventory of his goods.|$|E

500|$|JFK {{marked a}} {{fundamental}} change in the way that Stone constructed his films: a subjective lateral presentation of the plot, with the editing's rhythm carrying the story. Stone brought in Hank Corwin, an editor of commercials, to help edit the film. Stone chose him because his [...] "chaotic mind" [...] was [...] "totally alien to the film form." [...] Stone remembers that Corwin irritated the more traditional editors working on the film because his [...] "concepts are very commercial sixty-seconds-get-your-attention-fragment-your-mind-make-you-rethink-it. But he had not developed the long form yet. And so a lot of his cuts were very chaotic." [...] Stone employed extensive use of flashbacks within flashbacks for a specific effect.

Figures for the number of fatalities vary. Erich Gröner reports that out of a crew of 500 men, 269 died in the accident, while Lawrence Sondhaus states that 276 men were killed. Many of the bodies ended up in Cheriton Road Cemetery, where there is a substantial memorial. Arthur Sullivan, on his way to Paris, witnessed the incident, writing, [...] "I saw it all– saw the unfortunate vessel slowly go over and disappear under the water in clear, bright sunshine, and the water like a calm lake.

[...] "As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park," [...] Vulović said. [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the baggage.

[...] Flight 367 {{departed from}} Copenhagen Airport at 3:15p.m. At 4:01p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9's baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart mid-air over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović {{was the only one of}} the 28 passengers and crew to survive the crash. She was discovered by a villager named Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her [...] stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact.

He also defended questions by the Electoral Commission about the transparency of BNP funding. In November 2009, Griffin was a witness at the trial of an Asian man, Tauriq Khalid, at Preston Crown Court. The prosecution claimed that in November 2008 Khalid repeatedly drove past a demonstration that Griffin was attending, and on the second occasion shouted [...] "white bastards". Khalid admitted shouting derisory comments at Griffin and other demonstrators, telling the jury he shouted [...] "Nick Griffin, you fucking wanker" [...] and [...] "Get the fuck out of Burnley, you're not welcome here", but denied shouting [...] "white bastard". Griffin gave evidence against Khalid, and affirmed that Khalid had shouted [...] "white bastard" [...] at him. Griffin said the man [...] "leaned {{out of the car and}} pointed at me and made a gun and gang gesture", and that he threatened him by shouting [...] "I'm going to...". Griffin said he had left the demonstration early, fearing for his safety. The 23-year-old defendant denied his comments had any racial intent, and was found not guilty. Griffin later commented [...] "I think it's unfortunate and I think it's wrong, but that's the jury's right. They <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> evidence, I accept their decision.

When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E

At another field the pilot <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> personnel run for cover when he flew over the field.

[...] Most of the white students ignored her and she lived off campus with the other black students.

She graduated in 1928 in the top 20 in her class, and enrolled at Yale Law School where she was the only black student, and one of only three women. She became the first African-American woman to receive a law degree from Yale in 1931 and passed the New York state bar examination in 1932.|$|E
