40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and timing of}} <b>swarming</b> and <b>absconding</b> of the giant honey bee Apis dorsata F. at 5 perennial nesting sites located in and around Bangalore district during 1986 - 88 are determined. The percentages of <b>swarming</b> and <b>absconding</b> are very high and both these migratory activities occur regularly and at definite times of the year. Swarming was noticed both during October-November and in April, while absconding was observed during May to July. <b>Swarming</b> and <b>absconding</b> together caused migration in Apis dorsata.

50|$|The {{propensity}} to swarm differs between the honey bee races. Africanized bees are notable for their {{propensity to}} <b>swarm</b> or <b>abscond.</b> Absconding {{is a process}} where the whole hive leaves rather than splits like in swarming. Being tropical bees, they tend to <b>swarm</b> or <b>abscond</b> any time food is scarce, thus making themselves vulnerable in colder locales. Mainly for lack of sufficient winter stores, the Africanized bee colonies tend to perish in the winter in higher latitudes.|$|R
2500|$|The genus Ropalidia {{is unique}} because it {{contains}} both independent and swarm-founding species. R. romandi is a swarm founding species, meaning that new nests are founded by {{a large group of}} workers with a smaller number of inseminated females (egg-laying queens). There are two different types of swarms: reproductive and <b>absconding.</b> A reproductive <b>swarm</b> is made up of some females of an already established colony, who depart to form a new colony with a group of workers. On the other hand, <b>absconding</b> <b>swarms,</b> a continuation of the existing colony, are made up of all the members of a colony. R. romandi is thought to utilize both forms of swarming, however, not much is known about reproductive swarming in Ropalidia [...] and most research on R. romandi has been on <b>absconding</b> <b>swarms.</b> It has been found that R. romandi will abscond if their nest is destroyed, damaged, or continually disturbed.|$|R
50|$|A single African bee sting {{is no more}} venomous than {{a single}} European bee sting, though African honeybees respond more quickly when {{disturbed}} than do European honey bees. They send out {{three to four times}} as many workers in response to a threat. They will also pursue an intruder for a greater distance from the hive. Although people have {{died as a result of}} 100-300 stings, it has been estimated that the average lethal dose for an adult is 500-1100 bee stings. In terms of industrial honey production, the African bee produces far less honey than its European counterpart, whilst producing more <b>swarms</b> and <b>absconding</b> (abandoning its nest). For this reason, African races of Honeybees are less desirable than European races, except where the proclivity of African bees give beekeepers no other option due to the Africans' tendency to invade and take over European nests.|$|R
40|$|The {{tropical}} paper wasp, Ropalidia (Icariola) fasciata (F.), nests on {{leaves of}} gramineous plants (Miscanthus sinensis Andus. and sugarcane) in Okinawa, {{where there are}} frequent, strong typhoons. In Taiwan and Java, where the effects of typhoons are less severe, most nests are on tree twigs. A similar difference is seen in nests of Ropalidia (I.) marginata (Lepeletier) in the Northern Mariana Islands and in India. Okinawan R. fasciata also exhibits quite flexible social behavior, low frequency of intranidal dominance behavior, construction of satellite and multiple-comb nests, <b>absconding</b> <b>swarming,</b> and initiation and development of nests in late autumn. Study of the divergence of social habits in eusocial wasps on Pacific Islands will enhance our understanding of social evolution in insects...|$|R
5000|$|P.paulista {{are found}} in {{tropical}} areas of Argentina, Paraguay and are prevalent in Brazil, specifically São Paulo. [...] Nesting and colonization tends to occur in areas where they have protection from weathering. [...] Where there can be up to three colonies in the same location, and swarms are present periodically. [...] Initial development of the nest begins with <b>swarming</b> or <b>absconding</b> in which the first comb is used to fix the nest to a substrate. [...] The first comb does have the development of envelopes but no eggs are found, due to the low survival rate. [...] During this period {{there is a large}} percentage of the colony on the exterior of the nest due to the lack of available space inside the nest. This creates a tight cluster of wasps around the nest, which limits access of the nest to predators, such as ants. [...] The swarm on the exterior of the nest is no longer present around the 10 day period. This time can fluctuate depending on the season, warmer temperatures allow faster work rate of wasps causing quicker construction of the nest.|$|R
5000|$|The bees were, {{and still}} are, treated as pets. Families would {{have one or}} many log-hives hanging in and around their houses. Although they are stingless, the bees do bite and can leave welts similar to a {{mosquito}} bite. The traditional way to gather bees, still favored among the locals, is find a wild hive, then the branch is cut around the hive to create a portable log, enclosing the colony. This log is then capped on both ends with another piece of wood or pottery and sealed with mud. This clever method keeps the melipine bees from mixing their brood, pollen, and honey in the same comb as do the European bees. The brood is kept {{in the middle of}} the hive, and the honey is stored in vertical [...] "pots" [...] on the outer edges of the hive. A temporary, replaceable cap at the end of the log allows for easy access to the honey while doing minimal damage to the hive. However, inexperienced handlers can still do irreversible damage to a hive, causing the hive to <b>swarm</b> and <b>abscond</b> from the log. With proper maintenance, though, hives have been recorded as lasting over 80 years, being passed down through generations. In the archaeological record of Mesoamerica, stone discs have been found that are generally considered to be the caps of long-disintegrated logs that once housed the beehives.|$|R
40|$|Cape {{honeybee}} workers show important pre-adaptations {{for social}} parasitism {{and can cause}} the dwindling colony syndrome of host colonies. Parasitic workers may drift or actively disperse into host colonies. They may also join <b>absconding</b> <b>swarms,</b> which can merge with host colonies. After transmission, parasitic workers have to establish themselves in the host, which is probably promoted by their spatial distribution, their readiness to gain trophallactic dominance {{and their ability to}} survive worker-worker aggression. Established parasitic workers have to evade egg removal by other workers in host colonies. The resulting offspring is preferentially fed, can be expected to be highly virulent and may show different behaviour in the course of infestation. It is unknownwhy and how the host queen is lost. High numbers of parasitic workers are reared until the host colony dies or absconds. This offspring can infest new host colonies, thereby completing the social parasitic life cycle...|$|R
40|$|Red-throated Caracaras are enigmatic {{but seldom}} studied raptors of {{tropical}} American forests. They {{are known to}} prey on social wasps and exhibit cooperative breeding, but little quantitative data have been published. We investigated Red-throated Caracara nesting, predation and social behaviour {{in the field in}} French Guiana from 2008 to 2013. We closely studied two nests with automated camera systems and found a high level of cooperative behaviour among adults tending nests. Seven individuals were involved in bring prey to and guarding a nest in 2009. Our observations of caracaras nesting in bromeliads confirmed that the majority of their diet was comprised of the brood of social wasps, although they also brought millipedes and fruits to the nest. The social behaviour of the caracaras included intense territorial behaviour, including specific vocalizations and displays in response to conspecifics or playback of caracara calls. Caracaras also attacked conspecific decoys, and we observed them attacking members of other groups on two occasions in 2011. The caracaras provided their chicks with nests of a diverse assortment of wasp genera, including Polybia, Pseudopolybia, Leipomeles, Apoica and Parachartergus, and the proportional abundance of these taxa is not congruent with published studies on generic abundances. In addition, while army ants had previously been considered top predators of social wasps, we calculated that the caracaras, as specialist predators, could rival or exceed army ants as a mortality factor for social wasps. It had been hypothesized that these caracaras rely on a powerful chemical repellent to protect themselves from the stings of their defensive prey, but we found no evidence of such a repellent. We used a video recording arena to observe caracara predation behaviour on nests of various species of Polybia. We observed that the caracaras are indeed stung by some species of wasps, but the caracaras mount high-speed aerial strikes against such nests, knocking them to the ground or striking them repeatedly until the adult wasps depart in an <b>absconding</b> <b>swarm.</b> The caracaras exploit this absconding response when attacking highly defensive wasp species in order to minimize stings while obtaining the wasp brood...|$|R
