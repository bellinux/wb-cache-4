5|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer {{pertains}} to division algebras, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating {{that if a}} finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field <b>splits</b> locally everywhere then it <b>splits</b> globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their Hauptsatz ("main theorem"): every finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field F <b>splits</b> over a cyclic cyclotomic extension. These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit <b>splits</b> are detrimental or beneficial.

Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{have also}} argued that {{inconsistent}} application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair. Trevor W.

An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there {{is the potential for}} the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit <b>splits</b> are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|E
