Finally, a numerical study is performed to make a profit comparison between the Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches, when the demand follows a stationary lognormal distribution. A profit comparison is also made between the stationary and non-stationary Bayesian approaches to observe whether the Bayesian approach incorporates non-stationarity in the demand.

40|$|In-kind price {{subsidies}} {{are a new}} and important feature of U. S. agricultural policy. Yet the market effects of such subsidies have not been widely discussed in the professional literature even through they differ importantly from similar cash subsidies. This paper examines in-kind subsidies with simple, static demand and supply functions. In-kind price subsidies push down prices to favored buyers and increase total sales relative to no subsidy or to an equivalent cash subsidy. Inventory holdings by the subsidizing authority are diminished. However, the effects of an in-kind subsidy upon prices received by sellers and commercial sales volume (net of <b>stock</b> <b>disposals)</b> are problematic, depending upon the price elasticity of demand in the subsidized market. If the demand, including retaliation by other sellers, is price elastic, then an in-kind subsidy will increase prices received by sellers and commercial sales volume. But if the demand is inelastic, then sellers' prices and commercial sales volume will drop relative to a no-subsidy situation or to an equivalent cash subsidy. These conclusions do not depend upon the methods by which the scheme is administered. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|Public {{stockholding}} {{for food}} security purposes refers to state acquisition of foodstocks {{in support of}} food security objectives. Public stockholding for food security purposes in developing countries returned to WTO agenda {{in the wake of}} the 2007 / 2008 and 2010 / 2011 food crises. During the WTO Ministerial Meeting at Bali in 2014, a group of developing countries (known as the G- 33) proposed that disciplines on stockholding be relaxed to allow them to acquire large foodstocks in anticipation of future crises. They contended that stockholding was necessary because exporting countries often restrict food exports in times of crisis, which consequently affect importing countries’ food security. Food exporting countries, on the other hand, opposed the policy arguing that it could lead to increased subsidies to producers of importing countries and, consequently distort trade. Due to the absence of consensus, a Pease Clause was introduced to temporarily restrain member countries from challenging stockholding activities until a permanent solution is reached. This thesis assessed three issues relating to WTO trade policy, food security and public stockholding in developing countries. The first paper, presented in Chapter 2, assesses the need for public stockholding in developing countries. In this paper, the research estimates the speed at which markets respond to restore consumption distortions in developing countries. This speed is referred to as market response to consumption shocks. Low responses implies that food security cannot be guaranteed by relying on the international market. Hence, stockholding to support consumption can be legitimate food security policy in these countries. The research is applied to wheat, corn and rice due to their importance in the food security of developing countries. The results shows that markets generally fail to restore close to 60 percent of the consumption distortions, following a shock, in developing countries. This poses a risk to food security without public stockholding. Hence, the study concludes that stockholding will be a legitimate policy to consider in these countries. The second paper, presented in Chapter 3, also assesses the need for public stockholding for food security purposes in developing countries. However, the research investigates whether or not the current de minimis WTO rules on public stockholding constitute a restriction to food security in developing countries. The research posits that the proposal to relax stockholding policy will be justified if current regulations constitute a restriction to achieving food security. The research is applied to wheat, corn and rice. To analyse this question, optimal public stocks required to achieving food security are compared with WTO allowable public stocks. The policy is restrictive if optimal public stocks is more than stock levels permitted under the WTO. The results found the de minimis policy to be substantially restrictive across some developing countries especially those which demonstrate a high food security risk. Hence, expanding stockholding policy for these category of countries should be considered. The third paper, presented in Chapter 4, examines the potential impact of stockholding on trade. Stockholding has two important activities that can affect trade: stock acquisition and <b>stock</b> <b>disposal.</b> While stock acquisition can increase trade, the disposal of accumulated stocks from stockholding programs in importing countries could lead to significant trade losses for exporting countries. Food exporting countries are particularly against stockholding programs policy due to these potential negative impacts on their markets. In this paper, a potential public storage policy aimed at meeting 6 -months of domestic consumption is applied to rice, corn and wheat in order to gain insights into the impact of the proposed stockholding policies on trade. The research seeks to estimate the maximum impact on trade that can arise as a result of <b>stock</b> <b>disposal</b> and stock acquisition. The results suggest that <b>stock</b> <b>disposal</b> could significantly decrease trade by more than 35 percent. Where stock acquisition does lead to increased trade, the overall negative impact of the policies will be relatively low. Moreover, the impacts on trade are relatively small when the policy is considered for small consumption countries. Thus, stockholding policy can be considered for small countries faced with considerable food security risk without generating significant trade impacts. In conclusion, the study suggests that stockholding policies can be legitimate for small countries faced with considerable food security risk. Large consumption countries seeking to implement stockholding policies must establish appropriate compensation schemes to minimise their policies impact on affected countries...|$|E
40|$|Perishables, such {{as packed}} fresh food and {{pharmaceutical}} products (a. o. blood products), typically have a fixed shelf life set by a fixed use-by date or sell-by date. Despite their limited life time, orders in practice are usually {{based on the}} stock level irrespective of {{the ages of the}} products in stock. The management of inventories of such products can be improved by applying stock-age dependent ordering, issuing, and disposal policies. This paper investigates cost reductions that can be achieved by an optimal stock-age dependent ordering, issuing, or disposal policy as obtained by Stochastic Dynamic Programming. Orders are made before the uncertain demand is revealed. When demand turns out to be relatively low, a disposal policy enables to get rid of excess (old) <b>stock.</b> <b>Disposal</b> decisions are an understudied area, but may be relevant to retailers for which displaying the freshest items is of high importance. Also blood banks prefer not to issue products that are about to expire as transfusion of younger blood products is more effective. This paper fills a research gap identified in Karaesmen et al. (2011) : the paper appears {{to be the first to}} report optimal stock-age dependent disposal decisions, both under a base stock policy and under optimal stock-age dependent ordering. Results of optimal stock-age dependent ordering, disposal, and issuance are compared to a base stock policy, which is commonly used in practice. Under FIFO issuance, the added value of an optimal disposal policy is high. An optimal disposal policy in combination with optimal ordering reduces the average costs only when issuing old products is penalized, e. g. by selling at a discounted price. Under LIFO issuance, an optimal disposal policy has significant impact when orders are set by a BSP, but not under optimal stock-age dependent ordering. When no penalty or discount applies, disposals reduce costs only in case of suboptimal ordering, e. g. by a BSP...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the voluntary transfer of housing stock by Scottsh local authorities between 1986 and 1997, under a Conservative Government. The {{study sought to}} identify who had transferred what, why and how, employing a multi-theoretical approach {{and a range of}} concepts from policy studies to investigate rationaliy and opportunity in policymaking. The study used quantitative methods to define and establish the incidence of transfer, which was found in two forms: as partial transactions, with and without subsidy; and as privately financed <b>disposals</b> of whole <b>stocks.</b> Similar volumes of transactions were found in Scotland as in England, though on different terms and affecting fewer houses. Qualitative methods were used to explore the decisions, actions and capacity of people involved in voluntary sales of tenanted housing to other landlords. Key actors included tenants and community activists, politicians and officials in councils, government departments and agencies. The thesis argues that transfer in Scotland was the product of local responses to two key developments. One was accumulated financial constraints; the other, particularly affecting partial transfer, was the use of financial and organisational incentives, secured with ministerial acquiescence. Although government was ultimately responsible for both developments, it neither planned nor anticipated their consequences; it was often iiprepared to respond to local initiatives, partial and whole; and it failed to understand or monitor the consequences. Most Scottsh councils ignored whole stock transfer in 1996, when it came to be actively promoted by Conservative poliicians. Paradoxically, while organisations representing institutional interests in council housing vocalised opposition to <b>stock</b> <b>disposals,</b> their constituent members took action to transfer ownership, with the conflcting values of local incumbents accommodated by stealth. Transfer was later legally structured, when an afterthought from English legislation accidentally turned power relations upside down, making ministerial consent conditional on demonstrating lack of tenant opposition. Senior officials played a consistently critical role in initiating, brokering, frustrating and nourishing local negotiations. This study demonstrates the particular significance of local action in policy-making, allowing transfer to emerge in response to wider constraints determined at the centre.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an updated and {{critical}} assessment of the share reforms relevant to Chinese A-share issuers listed in the two mainland markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen. The reform programme first began in 2005 and has now spread widely across issuers in the two markets. It is therefore timely to assess how effective the reforms have been as well as gauging the ongoing effects of the transformation (of non-tradable scrip into tradable form) on A-share prices. Design/methodology/approach – The “Split Share Structure” reform programme represents a major policy initiative in China and potentially opens-the-door to large-scale state-share disposals. The evidence to date however suggests that the Chinese authorities are primarily concerned with the reconfiguration of the array of share types that presently exist into a more comprehendible, streamlined form. The various checks and balances imposed on controlling shareholders engaged in the transformation of their shares from non-tradable to tradable form suggest that eventual re-designation of the holdings into an unfettered tradable type will not necessarily translate to the state's acquiescence in the disposal of such shares. On the contrary, state holdings in the most strategic of assets are likely to be retained more or less intact. Insights are developed by focusing on examples involving major A-share issuers. In particular, a case study of the Sinopec reform proposal of August/September 2006 is set out to help illuminate the principal features of the reform package. Critical examination of the empirical literature relating to the A-share price effects of the share reform programme also features. Findings – There is little evidence to date of significant <b>stock</b> <b>disposals</b> amongst the largest and most strategic of China's issuers. However, for a number of A-listed issuers, parts of the lock-up moratoria have already expired or are set to do so in the very near future. Given the precipitous fall in A-share prices (in Shanghai and Shenzhen) since late 2007, largely wrought by the enveloping global credit-crunch, the Chinese authorities have an even more compelling case than hitherto to assiduously dampen fears of large-scale state-share disposals. Notwithstanding this, at least a small part of the drop in A-share values during 2008 derives from the building risk-premium on this issue. Research limitations/implications – As the trading moratoria on re-designated shares still applies in most cases, at least in respect of the majority of domestic stock holdings, a clearer picture will not emerge until 2009 - 2011 when all such moratoria would have lapsed. Originality/value – The discussions in this paper help to bring into focus a highly topical issue within the context of the Chinese equity market.

In this paper we present how interesting can be the coordination among owners in {{the preservation of the}} common good. Our approach takes into account economic dynamics and incentive mechanisms in a hidden information context. We consider a natural resource which is being used up for a continuum of producers on a common property regime. We also consider that each producer has an individual performance index which is a hidden information of the rest of players. We introduce coordination {{in the sense of a}} global maximization of the joint profit. If there is no coordination among the producers, their behavior leads to complete rent dissipation. We focus our model in the case of the producers convinced to coordinate their actions in order to preserve their own economic sustainability.

40|$|Extract] Disease {{problems}} {{constitute the}} largest single cause of economic loss in aquaculture. Despite reliable hatchery production and commercial expansion of the Asian seabass industry, a number of viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases threaten sustained production. Consequently, the focus and content of this chapter is on major viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases which have occurred in, and which may impact adversely on, production of Asian seabass. Where available, information is also provided on diseases inflicting wild seabass {{and a list of}} known infectious diseases (pathogens and parasites) of both wild and farmed Asian seabass has been compiled in Table 6. 1 as a reference. Asian seabass can be cultured in a variety of aquaculture systems (open, semi-closed and closed) in freshwater, brackish and marine environments, each which presents its own unique disease challenges. However, most of the losses caused by pathogens and parasites in Asian seabass aquaculture can be prevented by adopting appropriate biosecurity protocols. Common biosecurity measures may include routine health inspections, quarantine and treatment of wild-caught brood stock, egg disinfection, strict equipment sanitation, human traffic control, intake water treatment, effluent treatment, clean feeds, restricting movement of <b>stock,</b> appropriate <b>disposal</b> of mortalities and limiting interactions between wild and farmed organisms. Difficulties can arise once a disease has established and spread within a facility because eradication may be impossible. Following a disease outbreak, vaccination and chemoprophylaxis may need to be implemented to reduce outbreaks and minimise losses. Appropriate biosecurity is the most effective method of prevention of the numerous disease causing organisms described herein. In this chapter a brief description of important diseases is given, together with diagnosis and possible treatment and/or control mechanisms that may be applied in aquaculture. Information on management and treatment is provided as a guide only, and the author recommends consultation should be made with government authorities to ascertain regulations {{associated with the use of}} chemotherapeutants. The author recognises that noninfectious disease and abnormalities due to environmental contaminants, or nutritional deficiencies, are equally important problems, but these were beyond the scope of this chapter which focuses on infectious disease issues. Furthermore, continued intensive production of Asian seabass will likely result in further occurrences of previously unknown or undescribed diseases...|$|R
40|$|Obsolete {{pesticide}} stocks pose {{a serious}} threat to {{public health and the environment}} as storage conditions rarely meet international standards. In many countries, pesticide containers are kept in the open where containers deteriorate and leak their contents, which contaminate soil, surface water and groundwater. Many of the chemicals are so toxic that a few grams could poison thousands of people or contaminate a large area, and as most stores are in urban areas, the danger this poses is considerable. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), donor countries, aid agencies, agrochemical companies and recipient governments are all responsible for the steady accumulation of obsolete pesticides in developing countries. FAO estimates that there are more than 100, 000 tonnes of these substances in developing countries: 20, 000 tons in Africa alone. Some stocks are over 30 years old and, due to the absence of environmentally sound <b>disposal</b> facilities, <b>stocks</b> are constantly increasing. FAO has recently disposed of some 370 tonnes of unused pesticides in Zambia and Seychelles as part of its on-going programme to help developing countries clean up obsolete pesticides. Storage sites were cleaned and highly dangerous and persistent chemicals, including DDT, Lindane, Dieldrin, Atrazine, Diazinon, Captan, Malathion and Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were shipped to Europe for incineration. FAO received financial assistance from the Dutch Government and the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ) for the operation, which cost US$ 1. 3 million. The cost of disposing of obsolete pesticides stocks in Africa alone are estimated to exceed US$ 100 million. FAO is currently seeking financial support from agro-industry companies for pilot disposal operations in the Gambia (20 tonnes), Senegal (300 tonnes) and Botswana (200 tonnes). None of the developing countries has facilities for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of pesticides, which requires high-temperature incineration. The long-term solution to the problem lies in preventing the accumulation of these obsolete materials; stocks should be kept as low as possible and pesticide use should be drastically reduced. FAO has prepared Guidelines on The prevention and accumulation of obsolete pesticides; Pesticide storage; <b>Stock</b> control and <b>Disposal</b> of bulk quantities of obsolete pesticides which are available in Arabic, English, French and Spanish.
