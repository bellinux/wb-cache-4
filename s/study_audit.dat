We apply the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to <b>study</b> <b>audit</b> workpaper preparers ’ and reviewers’ perceptions toward the new electronic workpaper system, and their intentions to use the system as planned by its developers. We find the TAM model to be appropriate in this setting, as auditors’ perceptions of ease of use strongly influence their perceptions of system usefulness, and system usefulness perceptions in turn affect intentions to use the system. Further, we find that auditors’ perceptions and intentions toward the system are affected by workpaper role, {{as well as by}} task and technical knowledge.

Our article aims to <b>study</b> <b>audit</b> sampling in audit of financial statements. As an audit technique largely used, in both its statistical and nonstatistical form, the method {{is very important for}} auditors. It should be applied correctly for a fair view of financial statements, to satisfy the needs of all financial users. In order to be applied correctly the method must be understood by all its users and mainly by auditors. Otherwise the risk of not applying it correctly would cause loose of reputation and discredit, litigations and even prison. Since there is not a unitary practice and methodology for applying the technique, the risk of incorrectly applying it is pretty high. The SWOT analysis is a technique used that shows the advantages, disadvantages, threats and opportunities. We applied SWOT analysis in studying the sampling method, from the perspective of three players: the audit company, the audited entity and users of financial statements. The study shows that by applying the sampling method the audit company and the audited entity both save time, effort and money.

40|$|Aim: A {{study to}} explore the impact of {{implementing}} a bowel management protocol in a tertiary referral intensive care unit (ICU) in the West of Scotland. Methods: A three phase study was implemented. Phase 1 - a baseline audit reviewing 26 patients' medical notes and a baseline focus group reviewing the multidisciplinary team's (MDT's) opinions with regard to bowel care management in the ICU. Phase 2 - {{the implementation of a}} protocol, updated bowel care chart and education sessions for members of the MDT. Phase 3 - an end of <b>study</b> <b>audit</b> reviewing 27 patients' notes after the implementation of phase 2. Additionally, a further focus group examined the MDT's experiences of the protocol in clinical practice. Results and Findings: During the phase 1 data collection period, it was evident that there was a haphazard approach to bowel care in the ICU, resulting in poor bowel care documentation and a high incidence of constipation and diarrhoea days. After the interventions of phase 2, bowel care documentation days increased by 13 % (p = 0. 0003), constipation incidence decreased by 20. 7 % (p = 0. 13) and diarrhoea days reduced by 15. 2 % (p = 0. 18).

40|$|Purpose – The {{conduct of}} this {{research}} represents {{part of an effort}} to modify audit risk model (ARM) as an implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) by certified public accounting (CPA) firms. It is intended to make clear the phenomena about the relationship between audit risk (AR), implementation of business ethics principles (IBEP) and corporate governance risk (CGR). Design/methodology/approach – The method used was hypothesis testing. Unit of analysis was individual (i. e. Indonesian CPA), and the gathering of data was cross-sectional. The sample was determined by purposive sampling. Data were collected using questionnaires, and data analysis was conducted by structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings – According to Indonesian CPAs' perception, the AR is affected by the client's CGR, whereas the client's IBEP does not affect AR, but clients' CGR and IBEP both significantly affect AR. It is suggested: first, that the next researcher should <b>study</b> <b>audit</b> risk related to business ethics. Second, that the management should strengthen the implementation of business ethics in running a business; and finally that the Bapepam (Capital Market Oversight Board) should oversee both public company and public accountant in the implementation of governance. search limitations/implications – This research noted some implications, including: nature and intensity of gathering data, restricted respondent (CPA-CMAF), and restricted variables of corporate governance (BoD, and Audit Committee).

Researchers have endeavored to find out the factors that impact the quality of audit conducted by the auditors. The recent financial crises and financial scandals have further enhanced the importance of this topic. Although it is an empirically established fact that auditor’s performance is impeded by a number of factors that curb its independence however sudden surge in the emoluments of auditors during the last decades has actuated the researchers to <b>study</b> <b>audit</b> quality in context of compensation fee paid to the auditors. The results of studies differ as some are of the view that audit quality improves with the payment of excess fee while the rest are of the opposite view. Unluckily, Pakistan has been less explored in this regard and not even a single study has addressed the issue of audit quality in Pakistan. This study has attempted to analyze audit quality in context of abnormal or extra fee paid to auditor. Audit conducted without independence of auditor is futile and results in impairment of audit quality. Independence of auditor is usually curbed by extra fee paid to him, and auditor in fear of losing a lucrative fee does not report the misrepresentations of financial statements in his audit report. This study uses discretionary accruals as surrogate of audit quality which are computed by Cross-sectional Modified Jones Model (1995).

40|$|Very little {{accounting}} research exists which investigates specific decision tasks performed by audit committee members. More specifically, little research exists regarding the one decision task {{which appears to}} be a primary duty of all audit committees [...] the decision task of selecting and/or evaluating the external auditor. Since the auditor selection decision is basically an assessment of the tradeoffs between audit quality and audit fees and the determination of audit fees is straightforward, the current study focuses on the assessment of audit quality. The primary objectives of this research project were (1) to identify those factors which affect audit quality, (2) to investigate how those audit-quality factors correlate with audit committee chairpersons' assessments of audit quality, and (3) to determine whether audit committee chairpersons exhibit expert judgment in their audit-quality assessments. To meet these objectives of two-phase study was conducted. In {{the first phase of the}} <b>study</b> <b>audit</b> committee chairpersons were asked to rate the impact various factors have on the quality of auditing services. Those factors identified in the first phase to have the strongest impact on audit quality were then utilized in the second phase to develop audit-quality scenarios. The second phase of the study consisted of requesting each audit committee respondent to assess audit quality for 32 individual audit-quality scenarios. Regression analysis was employed in the second phase to represent the cognitive models of the respondents. The Judgmental Analysis (JAN) technique also was used in the second phase to cluster the decision makers into the various decision-making groups which exist. The results of this two-phase study provided data regarding the perceived impact of 15 audit-quality factors on audit quality and how the most important of these audit-quality factors correlate with audit committee chairpersons' audit-quality assessments.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} manifestations, mechanisms, {{and rates of}} system-related errors {{associated}} with two electronic prescribing systems (e-PS). To determine if the rate of system-related prescribing errors {{is greater than the}} rate of errors prevented. Methods: Audit of 629 inpatient admissions at two hospitals in Sydney, Australia using the CSC MedChart and Cerner Millennium e-PS. System related errors were classified by manifestation (eg, wrong dose), mechanism, and severity. A mechanism typology comprised errors made: selecting items from drop-down menus; constructing orders; editing orders; or failing to complete new e-PS tasks. Proportions and rates of errors by manifestation, mechanism, and e-PS were calculated. Results: 42. 4 % (n= 493) of 1164 prescribing errors were system-related (78 / 100 admissions). This result did not differ by e-PS (MedChart 42. 6 % (95 % CI 39. 1 to 46. 1); Cerner 41. 9 % (37. 1 to 46. 8)). For 13. 4 % (n= 66) of system-related errors there was evidence that the error was detected prior to <b>study</b> <b>audit.</b> 27. 4 % (n= 135) of system-related errors manifested as timing errors and 22. 5 % (n= 111) wrong drug strength errors. Selection errors accounted for 43. 4 % (34. 2 / 100 admissions), editing errors 21. 1 % (16. 5 / 100 admissions), and failure to complete new e-PS tasks 32. 0 % (32. 0 / 100 admissions). MedChart generated more selection errors (OR= 4. 17; p= 0. 00002) but fewer new task failures (OR= 0. 37; p= 0. 003) relative to the Cerner e-PS. The two systems prevented significantly more errors than they generated (220 / 100 admissions (95 % CI 180 to 261) vs 78 (95 % CI 66 to 91)). Conclusions: System-related errors are frequent, yet few are detected. e-PS require new tasks of prescribers, creating additional cognitive load and error opportunities. Dual classification, by manifestation and mechanism, allowed identification of design features which increase risk and potential solutions. e-PS designs with fewer drop-down menu selections may reduce error risk. 9 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{review the}} trends in patient {{selection}} and early death rate for patients undergoing elective endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) in 3 countries. For this <b>study,</b> <b>audit</b> data from 4, 163 {{patients who had}} undergone elective infrarenal EVAR were amalgamated. The data originated from Australia, Canada (Ontario), and England (London, Cambridge, and Leicester). Methods: Statistical analyses were undertaken to determine whether patient characteristics and early death rate varied between and within study groups and over time. The study design was retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively between 1999 and 2012. Results: One-year survival improved over time (P = 0. 0013). Canadian patients were sicker than those in Australia or England (P < 0. 001). American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (ASA) increased over time across all countries although more significantly in Canada. Age at operation remained constant, although older patients were treated more recently in London (P < 0. 001). English centers treated larger aneurysms compared with Australia and Canada (P < 0. 001). Australian centers treated a much larger proportion of aneurysms that were < 55 mm than other countries. Preoperative creatinine levels decreased over time for all countries and centers (P < 0. 001). Infrarenal neck angles have significantly decreased over time (P < 0. 001). Recent data from London (UK) showed that operations were performed on longer (P < 0. 001) and wider (P < 0. 001) infrarenal necks than elsewhere. Conclusions: In this international comparison, several trends were noted including improved 1 -year survival despite declining patient health (as measured by increasing ASA status). This may reflect greater knowledge regarding EVAR that centers from different countries have gained {{over the last decade}} and improved medical management of patients with aneurysmal disease.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to <b>study</b> <b>audit</b> pricing and the Big 4 fee premium in Belgium. While a number of studies have already {{explored}} these issues, the Belgian audit market provides an interesting setting to gain an additional insight into the pricing of audit services for many reasons (e. g. audit market concentration in Belgium is much lower than in other countries, the Belgian audit market mainly consists of non-listed firms, etc.). Design/methodology/approach – Besides the traditional audit fee model, based on seminal work by Simunic, the paper also estimates regression models in which the author allows coefficients to vary across Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors and control for self-selection (based on a two-stage procedure). Findings – Using the traditional audit fee model, results suggest that Big 4 auditors receive (or are able to charge) a fee premium compared to non-Big 4 auditors. Nevertheless, when the author allows regression coefficients to vary across Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors and control for self-selection, the aforementioned finding does no longer hold. The results reveal differences in fee structures between Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors and suggest that Big 4 auditors consider a richer set of variables when setting their fees. Research limitations/implications – Since Belgian firms are only required to disclose audit fees as from 2007 onwards, the analyses are based on data for one year only. Practical implications – An important implication, at least from an academic point of view, is that the results clearly illustrate and corroborate the need to control for self-selection when modelling audit fees (while this issue has been ignored by recent audit fee studies). The findings also have implications for the (Belgian) auditing profession. For example, the fact that significant differences are observed in audit pricing between the Big 4 and non-Big 4 firms may have an impact on the (Belgian) audit services market (e. g. it might influence the competitive nature of the tendering process). Originality/value – Using a two-stage procedure, the results corroborate the need to control for self-selection in modeling audit fees (an issue that has been largely ignored in the audit fee literature). In addition, the results reveal that Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors have different fee structures and that it is therefore important to allow the regression coefficients (and not only the intercept) to vary across both groups. Finally, the findings add to the very scarce evidence on audit pricing for non-listed firms. Auditing, Auditor's fees, Belgium...|$|E
