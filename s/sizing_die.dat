2500|$|With bottlenecked {{cartridge}} cases, {{choosing the}} right <b>sizing</b> <b>die</b> can also be important. Full length sizing of cartridges is often thought to greatly shorten case life by work hardening {{the full length of}} the case, which can cause the case neck to split, although some studies show that the number of reloads possible with a case is essentially the same for either full length sizing as for neck sizing only if the issue is one of neck hardening. If the reloaded cartridges are going {{to be used in the}} same firearm in which they were previously fired, though, and if that firearm has a bolt action or other action with a strong camming action on closing, then full length resizing may not be needed. A collet neck <b>sizing</b> <b>die</b> can be used to size just the case neck enough to hold the bullet, and leave the rest of the case unsized. The resulting cartridge will chamber into the specific rifle that previously fired it, though the fit might be tight and require more force to chamber than a full length resized case. The use of a neck-sizing die in conjunction with moderate pressure loads may extend the life of the case significantly by minimizing the amount of case that is work hardened or stretched. This is especially true for reloads intended for military rifles with intentionally large chambers such as the Lee–Enfield in [...]303 British. [...] The use of partial length or neck sizing for cartridges used in such large chambers permits effectively switching the headspacing from relying on the rim of a rimmed cartridge to the shoulder of the bottle neck transition instead, increasing the number of times a rimmed military cartridge can be reloaded from once to perhaps 5 or more times, all while avoiding dangerous incipient head separations. [...] One final form of limiting case wear is, unfortunately, limited strictly to benchrest shooters with custom-cut chambers. The chamber of these rifles is cut so that there is just enough room, typically just a few thousandths of an inch, in the neck area. [...] The result of using this type of chamber is that fired rounds don't require any resizing whatsoever once the case is fired. [...] The brass will 'spring back' a bit after firing, and will properly hold a new bullet without further manipulation. Some refer to this as a 'fitted' neck, however it is a function of both the carefully cut precision neck and the case adjusted to fit with very little clearance.|$|E

5000|$|Cartridge Case Preparation Method Two: Using the 220 Russian case, {{lubricate}} {{case and}} full length size in a 6PPC die with the expander button removed (it won't fit!) Insert a small PISTOL primer {{into the case}} to be converted (same size as small rifle primer.) Add a VERY STOUT quantity of a fast burning pistol propellant, such as Bullseye to the case—many other propellants will work, but it MUST be a fast burning pistol propellant. For this cartridge 16 grains of Bullseye works rather well. Melt some paraffin wax into the lid of a jar, and when it solidifies, turn the lid over and press it over {{the neck of the}} loaded blank cartridge, making a seal that will both keep the propellant in the case and provide a very modest resistance to the propellant when it is fired. Generously lubricate the case with [...] "Imperial <b>Sizing</b> <b>Die</b> Wax" [...] or some other VERY high quality case sizing lubricant (the serious benchrest shooters will only use Imperial.) Place the cartridge into the rifle and fire to [...] "fireform" [...] the case. The muzzle blast will be most impressive! Repeat for remaining cases, but don't allow barrel to overheat—if you can't hold the barrel in your hand, it is too hot, so slow down. When finished fireforming, clean rifle chamber to remove any hint of lubricant! Clean necks to remove lubricant and powder residue, then inside lubricate the necks with a Q Tip and Imperial Wax. Run cases thru a 6mm neck expander, which will be slightly oversized. Trim to length of 1.486" [...] (this step may not be necessary.) Inside/outside chamfer the necks. Turn necks to a thickness that will allow, at BARE MINIMUM, 0.001" [...] total clearance in the chamber for the loaded round (it helps to keep the neck turner in a pocket when not actually in use so that its temperature does not vary over the process; otherwise one can get considerable changes in the neck thickness due to heating and cooling of the [...] "neck turner". Remember that we are working in increments of 0.0001" [...] (ten thousandths of an inch) -- when one does the calculations, it is truly impressive how the dimensions of the neck turner can change over a 20 degree F range.) Lubricate the turner mandrel before each new case; again, Imperial is the optimal choice of lubricant. It is important when turning the necks to run the neck turner into the shoulder of the case a wee bit; if this is not done, one will experience the [...] "Dreaded Doughnut" [...] at the juncture of the neck {{to the rest of the}} case after the case is fired, and bullet seating can get very difficult. (Further, with a [...] "doughnut", a loaded round with the projectile seated below doughnut can be larger in diameter than the chamber neck.) Lubricate the case again with Imperial wax. Full length size the case in a 6PPC die with the expander ball in place. Decap primer, clean primer pockets, remove case lube and you are now ready to TRULY LOAD the case.|$|E

This study characterizes the plastic deformation of cups during a sizing operation following the recrystallization heat treatment. The purpose of the sizing operation is to achieve the specified roundness, diameter, and radius dimensions of the cup. The operation introduces various levels of plastic strain in the cup. Plastic strain can be a cause of inhomogeneous or abnormal grain growth during subsequent exposure to elevated temperature during the service life of the fueled clad. This is particularly true {{in the case of}} cups which have irregularities in the cup walls from the deep drawing operations. Diameter and roundness measurements were made on two cups both before and after sizing. Plastic strain levels were calculated using the ABAQUSTM finite element software. The calculated plastic strain levels in both cups were below 0. 025, a value shown to be below the critical strain for abnormal grain growth during a simulated service exposure. The calculated maximum plastic strain was found to increase with increased applied sizing load and was not sensitive to the input value for the clearance between the cup and the <b>sizing</b> <b>die.</b> The calculated geometry of the sized cups was in good agreement with the measurements on the finished cups...|$|E
