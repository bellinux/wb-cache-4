Coit and Smith early used a combined neural network and GA approach {{to solve the}} NP-hard problem.

Lobato et al. analyzed the reliability-based optimization by using differential evolution and inverse reliability analysis for engineering system design. And the double-loop model was used to improve the algorithm. Simulation test on several examples with different complexity shows that heuristic algorithm was more accurate than classical algorithm [6]. Gholizadeh and other scholars analyzed the Bayesian estimation for the electronic system and pointed out that if the faults were independent, E-Bayesian algorithm can improve the accuracy of analysis [7].

We have implemented a prototype of a new debugging system, IGOR, which provides a great deal more useful information and offers new abilities that are quite promising.

We describe here some improved facilities (reverse execution, <b>selective</b> <b>searching</b> of execution history, substitution of data and executable parts of the programs) that are needed for serious debugging and are not found in traditional single-thread debugging tools. With a little help from the operating system, we provide these capabilities at reasonable cost without modifying the executable code and running fairly close to full speed. The pro-totype runs under the DUNE distributed operating system. The current system only supports debugging of single-thread programs.

40|$|Food allergies (FAs) are an {{increasing}} problem in Western countries, affecting up to 10 % of young children. FAs are frequently associated with gastrointestinal manifestations. The role of FAs {{as a potential}} causative factor for infantile colic (IC) is still controversial. We report the most recent evidence on the pathogenesis, clinical and diagnostic aspects of FA-induced infantile colic (IC) and suggest a stepwise diagnostic approach. We selected articles on clinical and immunologic features, pathogenesis and management of FAs and IC from of 1981 to 2015. Original and review articles were identified through <b>selective</b> <b>searches</b> performed on PubMed, using the following terms: colic, infantile colic, food allergy and infantile colic, infantile colic treatment. The possible relationship between FAs and IC derives from the presence of dysmotility with visceral hypersensitivity and dysbiosis, demonstrated in both conditions, and the clinical response to dietary interventions. Unfortunately, {{the design of the}} studies, poor characterization of atopy and different dietary approaches limit the understanding of the importance of FAs in subjects with IC. The role of FAs in IC subjects without other symptoms of atopy remains controversial.

40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the best}} sources for high quality {{information}} about healthcare interventions is a systematic review. A well-conducted systematic review includes a comprehensive literature search. There is limited empiric evidence to guide the extent of searching, in particular the number of electronic databases that should be searched. We conducted a cross-sectional quantitative analysis to examine {{the potential impact of}} <b>selective</b> database <b>searching</b> on results of meta-analyses. Methods Our sample included systematic reviews (SRs) with at least one meta-analysis from three Cochrane Review Groups: Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI), Infectious Diseases (ID), Developmental Psychosocial and Learning Problems (DPLP) (n[*]=[*] 129). Outcomes included: 1) proportion of relevant studies indexed in each of 10 databases; and 2) changes in results and statistical significance of primary meta-analysis for studies identified in Medline only and in Medline plus each of the other databases. Results Due to variation across topics, we present results by group (ARI n[*]=[*] 57, ID n[*]=[*] 38, DPLP n[*]=[*] 34). For ARI, identification of relevant studies was highest for Medline (85  %) and Embase (80  %). Restricting meta-analyses to trials that appeared in Medline[*]+[*]Embase yielded fewest changes in statistical significance: 53 / 55 meta-analyses showed no change. Point estimates changed in 12 cases; in 7 the change was less than 20  %. For ID, yield was highest for Medline (92  %), Embase (81  %), and BIOSIS (67  %). Restricting meta-analyses to trials that appeared in Medline[*]+[*]BIOSIS yielded fewest changes with 1 meta-analysis changing in statistical significance. Point estimates changed in 8 of 31 meta-analyses; change less than 20  % in all cases. For DPLP, identification of relevant studies was highest for Medline (75  %) and Embase (62  %). Restricting meta-analyses to trials that appeared in Medline[*]+[*]PsycINFO resulted in only one change in significance. Point estimates changed for 13 of 33 meta-analyses; less than 20  % in 9 cases. Conclusions Majority of relevant studies can be found within a limited number of databases. Results of meta-analyses based on the majority of studies did not differ in most cases. There were very few cases of changes in statistical significance. Effect estimates changed in a minority of meta-analyses but in most the change was small. Results did not change in a systematic manner (i. e., regularly over- or underestimating treatment effects), suggesting that <b>selective</b> <b>searching</b> may not introduce bias in terms of effect estimates...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a new algorithm that generates candidate proposals for an object detection pipeline. We introduce Stochastic <b>Selective</b> <b>Search</b> (SSS), a segmentation based <b>selective</b> <b>search</b> method, which differs from previous work in two ways. First and most importantly, SSS is {{much faster than}} current state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining comparable accuracy. This {{is a result of}} our efficient stochastic segment merging process. Other work requires the computation of features to determine the order in which segments are merged. We show that currently used features from other work does not improve the results of SSS significantly and are therefore omitted. This makes our algorithm nearly twice as fast as the fastest prior <b>selective</b> <b>search</b> algorithms. Secondly, due to the stochastic merging process of SSS, it is not critically affected when two wrong segments are merged during the merging process, which leads to object proposals of higher quality. We show that SSS outperforms existing deterministic <b>selective</b> <b>search</b> methods while generating the same amount of proposals in less time. Additionally, we demonstrate the performance of our SSS algorithm in a state-of-the-art object detection pipeline based on convolutional networks.
