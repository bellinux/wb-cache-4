50|$|The {{monochrome}} plasma {{video display}} was co-invented in 1964 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by Donald Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and graduate student Robert Willson for the PLATO Computer System. The original neon orange monochrome Digivue display panels built by glass producer Owens-Illinois were {{very popular in}} the early 1970s because they were rugged and needed neither memory nor circuitry to refresh the images. A long period of sales decline occurred in the late 1970s because semiconductor memory made CRT displays cheaper than the 2500 USD 512 x 512 PLATO plasma displays. Nonetheless, the plasma displays' relatively large <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> and 1 <b>inch</b> thickness made them suitable for high-profile placement in lobbies and stock exchanges.|$|R

Findings indicate that regardless of the <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> of a mobile phone, students tended {{to have a positive}} overall opinion of m-learning and watching the video significantly increased their knowledge of the subject area.

They are marketed as premium high performance laptops for multimedia and gaming, {{as part of}} the IdeaPad line. The most significant differences from Lenovo's traditional ThinkPad business laptops were a more consumer-oriented appearance and performance-oriented components. IdeaPads feature a chiclet keyboard with rounded keys, similar to the latest ThinkPads. The first of the Y Series were the IdeaPad Y710 and the IdeaPad Y510 notebooks, with <b>screen</b> <b>sizes</b> of 17 <b>inches</b> and 15 inches respectively. Not all features were entirely new, however. Notebook Review reported that the Y710 and Y510 notebooks had a keyboard that felt similar to the ThinkPad when used, despite the absence of the TrackPoint.

They work {{the same as}} larger tablets, however with lower specifications {{when compared to the}} larger tablets. On September 14, 2012, Amazon released an upgraded version of the Kindle Fire, called the Kindle Fire HD, with higher resolution and more features compared with the original Kindle Fire, though it remained 7 inches.

In September 2013, Amazon further updated the Fire tablet with the Kindle Fire HDX. In November 2013, Apple released the iPad Mini 2, which remained at 7.9 inches and nearly matched the hardware of the iPad Air.|$|R

The duration of clips ranged from 20 s to 600 s, with average values between 94 s and 197 s. In [6] authors found average duration of videos hosted in Daum (popular service for user-generated content in Korea) from 30 s for advertisements to 203 s for music videos. Concerning viewing conditions, all sequences were displayed in a mobile handset (<b>screen</b> <b>size</b> of 2.8 <b>inches,</b> resolution of 320 * 240 pixels) instead of a normalised LCD display, and users were asked to hold the handset on their hands with a free viewing distance (commonly 6 - 8 times {{the height of the}} display). For quality assessments, we decided not to use the recommended continuous assessment method for long video sequences, since quality evaluation tasks may distort the results from a service perspective. Instead, absolute category rating (ACR) was used {{at the end of each}} sequence. In addition to quantitative assessments, qualitative evaluations were considered allowing users to add comments and to stop the play out if quality was perceived as unacceptable.|$|R

As the screen is too thin for I/O ports and buttons, Sony has connected the screen to a non-detachable base that contains these. The top of the base has the speaker and the power, volume, channel, input, and menu buttons, which are backlit so the symbols and abbreviations change when the XMB interface is accessed. The back of the panel has a DMeX service input, a 16-volt DC input, a VHF/UHF/cable input, a Memory Stick slot, and two HDMI inputs. On {{the left side of}} the panel there is an analog/digital audio output. The XEL-1 has a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, high color saturation, large viewing angles, high screen uniformity, and low power consumption.
