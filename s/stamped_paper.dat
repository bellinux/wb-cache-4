5|$|Mason slowly {{moved from}} being a {{peripheral}} figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable {{for the inclusion of}} his anti-slavery views. George Washington or George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow {{for one of the most}} common court actions, replevin, to take place without the use of <b>stamped</b> <b>paper,</b> and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766, but continued to assert the right to tax the colonies.|$|E
25|$|On February 18, 1766, two {{merchant}} ships {{arrived at}} Brunswick Town, without stamped papers. Each ship provided signed {{statements from the}} collectors at their respective ports of origin {{that there were no}} stamps available, but Captain Jacob Lobb of the British cruiser Viper seized the vessels. In response, numerous residents from southern counties met in Wilmington. The group organized as the Sons of Liberty and pledged to block implementation of the Stamp Act. The following day, as many as a thousand men, including the mayor and aldermen of Wilmington, were led by Cornelius Harnett to Brunswick to confront Tryon. The governor was unyielding to their defiance but a mob retrieved the seized ships. They forced royal customs officers and public officials in the region to swear never to issue <b>stamped</b> <b>paper.</b> Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in March 1766.|$|E
25|$|In the {{archives}} of the Salesian Congregation is a contract of apprenticeship, dated November 1851; another one on <b>stamped</b> <b>paper</b> costing 40 cents, dated February 8, 1852; and others with later dates. These are among the first contracts of apprenticeship to be found in Turin. All of them are signed by the employer, the apprentice and Don Bosco. In those contracts, Don Bosco touched on many sensitive issues. Some employers customarily made servants and scullery-boys of the apprentices. Don Bosco obliged them to agree to employ the boys only in their acknowledged trade. Employers used to beat the boys. Don Bosco required them to agree that corrections be made only verbally. He cared for their health, and demanded that they be given rest on feast days, and that they be given an annual holiday. But {{in spite of all the}} efforts and contracts, the situation of the apprentices of the time remained difficult.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} Hopkins' term, one of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues of the age arose, uniting the divided elements into a common cause. [...] In early 1765, the Stamp Act was passed by both houses of Parliament in England. [...] This act was a scheme for taxing the colonies, directing that all commercial and legal documents, to be valid in a court of law, must be written on <b>stamped</b> <b>paper</b> sold at fixed prices by governmental officers, and also directing that a duty be applied to newspapers. [...] Parliament assumed the right to tax the colonies and put additional duties on sugar, coffee, and other articles, and required that lumber and iron from the colonies only be exported to England.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 {{placed a}} limit upon the westward {{expansion}} of the American colonies. The Proclamation aimed to divert colonial expansion to the north (to Nova Scotia) and to the south (Florida). The Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government. With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings {{and the possibility of}} French incursions. The central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament. The Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to [...] "no taxation without representation". In 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. Since newspapers were printed on <b>stamped</b> <b>paper,</b> those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax. Meanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of Prime Minister. After a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville.|$|E

[...] New York merchants met on October 31 and agreed not to sell any English goods until the Act was repealed. [...] Crowds took to the streets for four days of demonstrations, uncontrolled by the local leaders, culminating in an attack by two thousand people on Governor Cadwallader Colden's home and the burning of two sleighs and a coach.

[...] Two months before Ward's election the Stamp Act was passed by both houses of the Parliament of Great Britain.

2500|$|The Stamp Act of 1765 (short title Duties in American Colonies Act 1765; 5 George III, c. 12) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain that {{imposed a}} direct {{tax on the}} colonies of British America and {{required}} that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on <b>stamped</b> <b>paper</b> produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. Printed materials included legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers, and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies. [...] Like previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money. The purpose of the tax was {{to help pay for}} troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the Seven Years' War and its North American theater of the French and Indian War. The Americans said that there was no military need for the soldiers because there were no foreign enemies on the continent, and the Americans had always protected themselves against Indians. They suggested that it was actually a matter of British patronage to surplus British officers and career soldiers who should be paid by London.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main issue}} was {{constitutional}} rights of Englishmen, so the French in Quebec did not react. [...] Some English-speaking merchants were opposed, but were in a fairly small minority. The Quebec Gazette ceased publication until the act was repealed, apparently over the unwillingness to use <b>stamped</b> <b>paper.</b> [...] In neighboring Nova Scotia a number of former New England residents objected, but recent British immigrants and London-oriented business interests based in Halifax, the provincial capital were more influential. [...] The only major public protest was the hanging in effigy of the stamp distributor and Lord Bute. [...] The act was implemented in both provinces, but Nova Scotia's stamp distributor resigned in January 1766, beset by ungrounded fears for his safety. [...] Authorities there were ordered to allow ships bearing unstamped papers to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps. [...] The Act occasioned some protests in Newfoundland, and the drafting of petitions opposing not only the Stamp Act, but {{the existence of the}} customhouse at St. John's, based on legislation dating back to the reign of Edward VI forbidding any sort of duties on the importation of goods related to its fisheries.|$|E
