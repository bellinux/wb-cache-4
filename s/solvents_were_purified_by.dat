Liver microsomes were prepared and then permeabilized to release the lumenal contents. After ammonium sulfate precipitation, the proteins <b>were</b> <b>purified</b> <b>by</b> chromatography; BiP <b>was</b> <b>purified</b> <b>by</b> affinity chromatography on ATP-agarose, and both endoplasmin and calreticulin <b>were</b> <b>purified</b> <b>by</b> affinity chromatography on Con A-Sepharose. PDI <b>was</b> <b>purified</b> <b>by</b> anionic ion exchange chromatography. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R

Finally, the simplest method relies on treating the zinc chloride with thionyl chloride.|$|R
