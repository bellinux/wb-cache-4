25|$|Chief Justice Roberts' dissent {{focused on}} whether the process afforded the Guantanamo detainees in the Detainee Treatment Act were an {{adequate}} substitute for the Habeas protections the Constitution guaranteed. By arguing in the affirmative, he implied {{that the issue of}} whether the detainees had any <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause</b> rights was moot (since, if they did, he found that those rights were not violated anyway). This line of reasoning was arguably more in line with the plain reading of Johnson v. Eisentrager (1950) (which denied German prisoners of war habeas rights primarily due to both practical logistical concerns and the determination that they had been afforded an adequate substitute: traditional military war crimes trials, which complied with the Geneva Conventions) than that of Justice Scalia, and also avoided the more controversial and complicated issue of whether the detainees were entitled to file habeas petitions in the first place.|$|E

40|$|Democratic {{conditionality}} accession clauses {{have become}} increasingly common in certain international organisations. Similarly, provisions on suspension of membership because of breaches of democratic order have emerged. Why do regional organisations introduce these kin of clauses?

On the one hand, accession clauses developed a posteriori {{of the creation of}} the organization being applied hence to new members rather to the ones creating them. These clauses have been used as an instrument for fostering clubness and imposing institutional features of applying states.

Firms facing financial difficulties did not go to the trouble of suspending or renegotiating particular provisions in the collective agreement but rescinded the agreement instead (Towalski 2005).|$|R

Part I provides a background on habeas corpus, the heart of the protection preserved in the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause,</b> and its semblance in the extraterritorial arena. Part II outlines the history leading up to Boumediene and the law surrounding this decision. Part III will then critically analyze Boumediene and its progeny against the Court 2 ̆ 7 s prior precedent in order to develop a framework for analyzing the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause.</b> Part III finally uses these concepts in several hypothetical scenarios in order to better illustrate the length and strength of the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause,</b> as it stands today...|$|E
40|$|Although the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause</b> {{explicitly}} {{mentions the}} writ of habeas corpus, {{it does not}} require that Congress make the writ available in its common-law form at all times. Rather, the Clause has long been understood to permit Congress to replace the writ with an alternative procedure, so long as that remedy is an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus. Under this functional view of the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause,</b> Congress might delegate responsibility for performing the habeas review function to an entity other than an Article III court, so long as the substitute procedure allows a detainee to challenge the lawfulness of his detention fairly and effectively. Because, at its core, habeas is concerned with checking arbitrary executive detention, however, this Article argues that any delegation of the habeas review function to a non—Article III entity must conform to the dictates of the nondelegation doctrine. To delegate the authority for designing the procedures used to challenge executive detention to the very Executive responsible for detention would defeat the purpose of the Clause. In Boumediene v Bush, the Supreme Court cast doubt on its prior functional jurisprudence regarding the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause.</b> In particular, the Court expressed hostility toward any substitute for habeas corpus that did not rely exclusively on an Article III court. This Article criticizes the Court 2 ̆ 7 s approach in Boumediene and demonstrates how it threatens the functional view of the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause</b> the Court had embraced previously. At the same time, this Article explains how and why nondelegation concerns justified the result in Boumediene. In particular, by relying so heavily on an executive-designed scheme—the Combatant Status Review Tribunals—Congress 2 ̆ 7 s substitute for habeas delegated excessive authority to the Executive to perform the habeas review function. For that reason, Congress 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to eliminate access to the writ for Guantanamo detainees through the Military Commissions Act of 2006 violated the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause</b> when read in conjunction with the nondelegation doctrine. A decision grounded more in nondelegation than in the absolutist conception of the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Clause</b> espoused by the Boumediene majority would have preserved more flexibility for the political branches to design a system for detaining terrorist suspects in the future...|$|E
