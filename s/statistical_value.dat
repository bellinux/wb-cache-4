An esti-mation method based on GMM can estimate a sound source direction on which GMM has already been trained; how-ever, it cannot estimate without a model that corresponds to a sound source direction. Three methods with interpo-lation techniques are investigated. Two generate GMMs for all directions by interpolating an acoustic transfer function or <b>statistical</b> <b>values</b> of GMM, and the other calculates the posterior probability for all directions with {{a limited number of}} GMMs. In our experiments, we investigated six interval conditions. From the results, the interpolation methods of an acoustic transfer function and the <b>statistical</b> <b>values</b> of GMM achieve better performance.

This finding, {{as well as}} the discovery that a large percentage of p values were inconsistent with reported test statistics, led to a great deal of concern in the popular press and scientific community. The findings ultimately led to new guidelines for all Nature Research Journals. Methods We checked the statistical analysis behind the original paper's tests of equiprobability. Results The original paper tested equiprobability with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test outside its regime of validity. Correct tests find no statistically significant deviations from equiprobability for the <b>statistical</b> <b>values</b> in Nature. Conclusion Statistical tests should be used correctly. </p...|$|R

When their free-taker, Jim Scott, and three Fitzgeralds transferred to Roseberry for the 1903 championship {{and went on}} to play in the 1903 and 1905 All Ireland finals, Moorefield stepped down to junior ranks in 1905 from which they re-emerged in 1932. Promoted to senior after an Intermediate final appearance against Maynooth in 1957, they proved by winning a treble of Leader Cups, 1958-1960 (in fact they won the 1958 competition after they had won the 1959 and 1960 titles), that they could indeed match the best in senior football with the likes of Jimmy Dowling, Paddy Anderson, Denis Craddock, Jim and John Cummins, Jim McDermott, Joe Moran, Paddy Moore, Toss McCarthy Harry Fay and Darrell Edmonds on the team. Moorefield were beaten by Carbury in the county semi-final in 1960, and were only eliminated from the 1961 quarter-final in a replay. The 1962 county semi-final between Moorefield and Kilcock resulted in a bitter objection and three replays before Moorefield qualified for the final and duly beat Kilcullen in a one-sided final the following May. Moorefield, still in shape after a wintertime of semi-finals, stormed ahead {{with the help of a}} 14th minute Harry Fay goal, led 1-6 to 0-2 at half-time, and another from Robert Clinton at the three-quarters was only of <b>statistical</b> <b>value.</b> The Moorefield midfield that day was influential with both Paddy Moore and Paddy Anderson in fine form.
