So, rather than viewing language evolution as a process in which the users adapt biologically to learn language, languages themselves adapt to the learning abilities of individuals. Within this framework, languages evolve through variation, competition and <b>selection.</b> <b>Invention</b> and learning are identified as variation mechanisms; learnability, transmission bottlenecks and stability are pressures for competition; and optimising for success is a good selection mechanism. Rather than studying the language development in individual users, this chapter illustrates how artificial multi-agent systems equipped with these principles can self-organise a compositional language from scratch. It is argued that this model offers a good alternative to many standard approaches in linguistics. ...|$|E

Indeed they are necessary to give applicants adequate protection for their invention. However, due to their complex nature, it is not always straightforward to determine their exact scope. The present paper looks at two extremes of Markush structures, which are unsearchable as such, the so-called "A-B-C type molecules" and "too simple compounds". Appropriate patentability search strategies, including non-unity and incomplete searches, are defined. Frequently, claimed Markush formulae partially overlap with prior art generic structures. Criteria for selecting the most relevant documents in such cases are discussed, including novelty and inventive step aspects of <b>selection</b> <b>inventions.</b> In a case study, the use of different search tools is compared.

40|$|Since {{the nineteenth}} century the Two Part Inventions have become {{standard}} repertoire for piano students. However, piano teachers have often failed to give serious consideration to the suitable <b>selection</b> of <b>Inventions</b> for study. Piano students have commonly formed a dislike for Bach's piano music because of an ungratifying initial experience. There is little material written in English dealing with the Two Part Inventions. Those studies of the Inventions which do exist consist mainly of brief articles in periodicals and limited discussions in piano literature books. Therefore, {{there seemed to be}} a need for a systematic collection of pedagogical ideas concerning the Two Part Inventions. In addition, it was felt that an analysis of the problems in each piece and a subsequent graded list of the Inventions would be a step toward a more intelligent and more knowledgeable approach in the teaching of these compositions...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{topics of}} {{operations}} management and supply chain {{systems have been}} gaining more interest of researchers. Efficiency in supply chain activities and operations management firstly benefit organisations. One of the main operations in supply chain systems is the collaboration with selected suppliers. Various models have been proposed in terms of supplier evaluation and <b>selection</b> studies. The <b>invention</b> of a new integrated frame for the building of an effective supplier evaluation system is a multi-attribute task that consists of several factors as external and internal variables. This paper delivers a creative integrated model of supplier selection problem using SWARA, QFD and a new MCDM tool called WASPAS. This work considers customer attitudes {{in the process of}} supplier evaluation. To give more weight to customer requirements, a new SWARA method has been designed; additionally, QFD and the house of quality matrix have been used to transform customer requirements into the supplier evaluation index. Finally, WASPAS has been used to rate the performance of suppliers and present supplier ranking scores. Application of initiative ways to propose a systematic supplier selection problem has always been encouraged by supply chain managers. This topic has been addressed in this paper as well.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{started off}} with a general view of thriving membrane technology in both industrial and academic fields. There is clearly an urgent need of highly efficient separation processes for various reasons, and the prerequisite of good and reliable membrane technologies can only start with the most basic step of scientific inquiry, materials <b>selection</b> or <b>invention</b> of new materials. With the rising world population and anthropogenic pollutions that follow, environmentally friendly materials are getting much more attention nowadays, such as room temperature ionic liquids. Room temperature ionic liquids, or simply ILs, are salts that stay in liquid form below 100 oC. They usually consist of bulky and asymmetric ions that are tunable. This prevents them from packing neatly at molecular level in order to crystallise and thus stay in liquid form. As ILs are already in ionic form, {{one of the most}} direct ways to exploit such conditions would be to incorporate them into battery electrolytes. In fact, some of the lithium-ion batteries on the market have indeed IL incorporated. However, there arenbsp;safety concerns regarding Li-ion batteries that contain conventional liquid electrolytes, e. g. solvent leakage, causing pollution to the environment; their lack of flexibility and difficulties to handle from a manufacturer’s point of view. Short-circuiting a battery will cause the cell to overheat and possibly catch fire. Hence, the conventional liquid electrolytes were replaced earlier by gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) and later bynbsp;polymer electrolytes (CPEs) and solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), leading to much safer “all solid state” electrochemical devices. Nevertheless, such polymer electrolytes have one significant short-coming: their low ionic conductivity due to the insulation properties of the polymer. Other than the addition of IL to replace common organic solvents and plasticisers, focus can be placed on the other ionic component of the system: the ionic salt. With the depletion of global lithium supply, it is essential to develop alternatives to the lithium-based batteries. Out of the metals that have not been so widely studied, magnesium salts are of considerable interest because of the divalent charge and the 2 : 1 anion to cation ratio. Therefore, the first two studies of this dissertation were devoted to the development of lithium- and magnesium-conducting SPEs with a congruent IL and well-suited functionalised polymer, poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) [P(VdF-HFP) ]. In the first study, it was observednbsp;even though the IL enhanced the ionic conductivity in Li-based SPEs, it also increased the activation energy for the ions to be transferred through the polymer matrix, and that some thermal instability was caused when the IL content increased. In the second study,nbsp;resultant Mg-based membrane SPEs exhibited a 4 × 10 - 3 S cm- 1 ionic conductivity at room temperature, comparable to that of the lithium counterparts of 2. 4 × 10 - 3 S cm- 1. Unlike the Li-system where the IL caused thermal instability, this study proposes that the variation ofnbsp;ionic conductivity is caused by ionic dissociation, which is facilitated bynbsp;addition of IL. The x-ray diffractometry (XRD) and thermogravimetric/differential thermogravimetric (TG/DTG) analyses were congruent with each other and aided in substantiating thenbsp;FTIR spectra revealed the possibility that this particular IL has no direct interaction with P(VdF-HFP), which suggests that the polymer host merely serves as an ionic transportation medium and mechanicalnbsp;these positive results, the direction of membrane application was moved towards gas separations, attributable to the high affinity between IL and CO 2. In the third study of this dissertation, the original plan was to further develop the scarce application of P(VdF-HFP) in gas separation. Theoretically, this polymer fulfils the necessities of a good gas separation membrane, which partly coincides with those of polymer electrolytes (e. g. co-existence of amourphous and crystalline zones to offer high permeability and yet mechanical strength). However, there were problems in the reproducibility of the results obtained, not to mention duplicating experiments from literature. The underlying cause of the problem was found to be the variation of monomer ratios in different supposedly similar commercial batches of P(VdF-HFP). Consequently, two batches of poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) [P(VdF-HFP) ] copolymer with different monomer ratios were identified and thoroughly characterised to relate the fundamental properties of this copolymer to its performance in CO 2 separation. Solubility testingnbsp;that the PVDF part of the copolymernbsp;dominating and calculations with Hansen’s solubility parameters corroborated the outcome. A very slow solvent evaporation rate and use of solvents with a high boiling point were found to be essential in the formation of defect-free membranes from this copolymer for gas separations. Physical examination, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), XRD and TGA were performed to better link the fundamental membrane properties to the gas separation performance. A low crystallinity in the prepared P(VdF-HFP) membranes was favourable innbsp;of compatibility, solubility, membrane formation and CO 2 separations. A fourth study was done with the initial intention of comparing results from the third study by replacing P(VdF-HFP) with polysulfone (PSf), a well-documented polymer used in gas separation. Rather surprisingly, a simple yet effective blending method was discovered for IL and PSf. Not only the IL was properly immobilised in the polymer matrix, which is crucial in high-pressure gas separation applications, but this method also produced tunable isoporous surfaced membranes, useful in several other applications. The sizenbsp;distribution of thenbsp;were found to be dependent on the type and amount of IL incorporatednbsp;the PSf. A membrane formation mechanism was proposed to explain the presence of such isoporous surface structure. Several commercially available ILs were tested to examine their compatibility with the polymer and the CO 2 /N 2 gas separation performance. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), FTIR microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to shed light on the observed membrane structures. nrpages: 131 status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Hence {{the need}} for the {{introduction}} of precise evolutionary parameters, the very necessity, in general, to bring back the inner articulation of the eigenforms not only to the structures of simple perception but also to those of intentionality. As Carsetti shows making reference to this particular and very simple theoretical “landscape” we can easily realize that the constraints imposed by specific selective pressures (operating in ambient meaning and articulating in accordance with suitable non-standard procedures [...] ) {{at the level of the}} dynamics of an original cellular (dissipative) automaton can, actually, permit a more complex canalization of the informational fluxes at stake. In particular, they can allow the unfolding of silent potentialities, the full expression of generative principles never before revealed and, consequently, the effective expression of new autonomous processes of production of varied complexity.In this way, we have the possibility to preserve the deep insights outlined by Gregory Chaitin relative to the mathematical substratum underlying biological evolution. At the same time, we also have the possibility to refer them to the realm of that dialectics between creativity and meaning that allows us not to close ourselves into the enclave of the first-order structures but to range in a much broader realm of functions also featured in accordance with the tools offered by non-standard mathematics. Thus, it will then be possible to take into account some general themes concerning, for instance, the role played, at the level of the development of living beings, by: 1) meaning in action; 2) the computational membranes; 3) those specific processes that determine that particular emergence of ever-new biological structures that distinguishes natural evolution. In a nutshell, we shall have the opportunity to enter, according to a more precise mathematical formalism, the mystery concerning, at the biological level, the stratified and hierarchical development of the differentiation processes.As Carsetti remarks: [...] "The intentionality belonging to meaning manages, through the brain’s channeling, to rise to the surface of the incarnated coder, constituting itself as membrane able to mirror in itself the coder's nesting by programs. The result is a surfacing [...] "countenance" [...] and an extended arborization revealing itself at surface level (in that life traverses it) as a design-web of connections unified by a living intentionality finally expressing itself as true harmony. This harmony is that of signs created by a “hand” which ramifies (as instantiated, for example, by Auguste Rodin in a famous sculpture) to become countenance, a hand that individuates (and perceives) itself, through the operated design, as the combined and productive features of meaning in action. Through the realized arborization meaning reaches the surface-life of pure abstraction and freezes in all its conceptual [...] "elegance": membrane-mirror which accommodates and enfolds all things within itself. Hence Endymion enclosed within his lunar dream, the sleeping hero with eyes shipwrecked in the harmony"At the level of the membrane (or at the level of the visual cortex, for example), a (neural) geometry of the connections is created by means of a specific self-organization process: a neurogeometry that will be to weave itself on the basis of the nourishment offered by the original web of the programs. The reflection-mirroring in the countenance of meaning in action serves to enact a still more profound entrenchment. The cell closes on itself to ensure stability and autonomy, but on the basis of its own growth and self-identification, result will be both <b>selection</b> and evolution, <b>invention</b> and rediscovery. At cell level the [...] "epistemological" [...] work and the ongoing reflection play a vital role. As remarked by Henri Atlan at the level of life (and of cognition) the function cannot but self-organize together with its meaning. The cell’s achieved autonomy must, then, necessarily refer to the gradual identifying of an “internal model” marking off (and scanning) within itself the process of selection taking place. In this autonomy we can recognize the early dawn of a consciousness of itself (but mathematically implemented) on behalf of the self-organizing system. As Gregory Chaitin shows. Metabiology cannot avoid dealing with a renewed critical assessment of this mysterious but intrinsically biological phenomenon, a phenomenon that is central to the interests of Carsetti in the field of Philosophy of Mind.|$|R
