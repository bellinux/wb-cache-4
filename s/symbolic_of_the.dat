5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of {{tinnitus}} is heard. This sound generally coincides {{with the death of}} a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency. In this way, then, the loss of the tones is <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss of the characters.|$|E

5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} {{in the ancient world}} by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.|$|E
5|$|For many years, {{the islanders}} had {{no means of}} {{contacting}} the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps and hoping that someone would see them. A radio telephone was installed in 1935, and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid. A red telephone box was installed in {{the centre of the}} island, <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK. It is still there today, though no longer in use.|$|E
5|$|In Wicca, salt is <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> element Earth. It is also {{believed}} to cleanse {{an area of}} harmful or negative energies. A dish of salt and a dish of water are almost always present on an altar, and salt is used {{in a wide variety}} of rituals and ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|In this way, the Quenya {{language}} was <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high {{status of the}} Elves, the firstborn of the races of Middle-earth, because of their close connection to Valinor, and its decreasing use also became <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slowly declining Elven culture in Middle-earth. In the Second Age of Middle-earth's chronology the Men of Númenor learnt the Quenya tongue. In the Third Age, {{the time of the}} setting of The Lord of the Rings, Quenya was learnt as a second language by all Elves of Noldorin origin, and it continued to be used in spoken and written form, but their mother-tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey-elves. As the Noldor remained in Middle-earth, their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor, undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} Achebean ending {{results in}} the destruction of an individual and, by synecdoche, the downfall of the community. Odili's descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in A Man of the People, for example, is <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere. Even with the emphasis on colonialism, however, Achebe's tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, as represented by Sophocles and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E

5|$|Hari Damle (Sachin Khedekar), {{head of a}} Chitpavan Bramhin family, {{lives in}} the village Torgaon in Konkan with his wife Tara (Medha Manjrekar), their three children, his younger brother Mahadev (Abhijit Kelkar), and his widowed aunt, Namu Aatya (Savita Malpekar). Hari {{arranges}} the marriage of Mahadev with a pre-pubescent girl, Durga (Ketaki Mategaonkar), renamed as Uma after marriage. However, Mahadev dies before the consummation of the marriage. Hari performs death rituals (Śrāddha) for Mahadev but crows (<b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spirit of the deceased in Hinduism) refuse to touch the offerings. Hari mumbles something while offering food after which crow touches the offerings.|$|E
5|$|In November 1997, Gascoigne {{received}} a five-match ban after being sent off for violent conduct during the Old Firm derby following an incident with Celtic midfielder Morten Wieghorst. In January 1998, Gascoigne courted serious controversy after {{he played a}} mock flute (<b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flute-playing of Orange Order marchers) during an Old Firm match at Celtic Park. The gesture infuriated Celtic fans who had been taunting him and Gascoigne was fined £20,000 by Rangers after the incident. He also {{received a}} death threat from an Irish Republican Army (IRA) Member following the incident. The 1997–98 season was not a success, as Gascoigne scored just three goals in 28 games and Rangers failed to win any trophies, losing the league title to Celtic.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the debate {{concerning}} <b>the</b> constitutional recognition <b>of</b> Christianity in Europe, we need to pose the more general question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role (if any) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern democratic constitution in relation to religion. In the present paper, we differentiate between three stylized understandings of constitution-making, namely communitarian, liberal and discursive. Our argument is that <b>the</b> discursive 'model' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution combines the merits and avoids <b>the</b> demerits <b>of</b> communitarianism and liberalism...|$|R
5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France. It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of the ailing French film industry. Berri's pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|The Italian naval ensign {{comprises}} the national flag defaced with {{the arms of}} the Marina Militare; the Marina Mercantile (and private citizens at sea) use the civil ensign, differenced by the absence of the mural crown and the lion holding open the gospel, bearing the inscription PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEVS, instead of a sword. The shield is quartered, <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four great thalassocracies of Italy, the repubbliche marinare of Venice (represented by the lion passant, top left), Genoa (top right), Amalfi (bottom left), and Pisa (represented by their respective crosses); the rostrata crown was proposed by Admiral Cavagnari in 1939 to acknowledge the Navy's origins in ancient Rome.|$|E

5|$|The Liverpool badge {{is based}} on the city's liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, {{including}} a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{built by}} Bishop Gundulf {{in the late}} 12thcentury was {{enclosed}} by a stone wall. Situated in the south-west corner of the city, the castle used {{the remains of the}} Roman town walls as foundations. The circuit had at least one tower; it was replaced in the 14thcentury. The original gateway was radically altered in the 13th or 14thcentury. From across the River Medway, the twin landmarks of Rochester's castle and cathedral would have dominated the medieval landscape, <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authority of the church and nobility in the period. Most castles were built by secular nobles, but the work by Gundulf and his successor Corbeil provide examples {{of the role of the}} church in castle building.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lighting}} {{ceremony for}} the new candle was held on November 28, 1969, and attended by about 450 people. Mayor Fred Ashton Jr. threw the switch, and Rev. Harry Maue of the Olivet Presbyterian Church urged that the symbol serve {{as a symbol of}} peace in America, nothing the growing casualties in the Vietnam War at the time. Schultz said the new candle was <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing development in the Easton area. The new candle was stored in the city's garage on Bushkill Drive while not assembled.|$|E
