40|$|Existing {{methods for}} spatial joins require {{pre-existing}} spatial indices or other precomputation, but such approaches are inefficient and limited in generality. Operand data sets of spatial joins may not all have precomputed indices, {{particularly when they}} are dynamically generated by other selection or join operations. Also, existing spatial indices are mostly designed for spatial selections, and are not always efficient for joins. This paper explores the design and implementation of <b>seeded</b> <b>trees</b> [1], which are effective for spatial joins and efficient to construct at join time. <b>Seeded</b> <b>trees</b> are R-tree-like structures, but divided into seed levels and grown levels. This structure facilitates using information regarding the join to accelerate the join process, and allows efficient buffer management. In addition to the basic structure and behavior of <b>seeded</b> <b>trees,</b> we present techniques for efficient <b>seeded</b> <b>tree</b> construction, a new buffer management strategy to lower I/O costs, and theoretical analysis for choosing algorithmic parameters. We also present methods for reducing space requirements and improving the stability of <b>seeded</b> <b>tree</b> performance with no additional I/O costs. Our performance {{studies show that the}} <b>seeded</b> <b>tree</b> method outperforms other tree-based methods by far both {{in terms of the number}} disk pages accessed and weighted I/O costs. Further, its performance gain is stable across different input data, and its incurred CPU penalties are also lower...|$|R
40|$|Recruitment {{represents}} {{the net effect}} of seed dispersal and survival (germination and establishment) processes. Both are known to be a function of distance from the <b>seed</b> <b>trees.</b> <b>Seed</b> densities usually decline with distance from the <b>seed</b> <b>trees</b> and the survival function can have different shapes. It may e. g. increase with distance (Janzen-Connell type effects) or decrease in the case of facilitation. In recruitment modeling the dispersal kernel is often directly fitted to the number of saplings instead of to the number of seeds, by indirectly assuming a distance-invariant survival function. This assumption may be violated in many cases as the survival function may attain different shapes. The interaction of distance-dependent seed deposition and survival becomes more complex in the case of several <b>seed</b> <b>trees,</b> since processes shaping the survival function may act on seeds from different <b>seed</b> <b>trees.</b> We develop a recruitment model disentangling (1) seed dispersal as derived by a summed seed shadow model and (2) survival as a function of distance of several nearby <b>seed</b> <b>trees.</b> Using Bayesian model inversion we parameterize our model for post fire Pinus sylvestris regeneration, which is known to suffer from strong root competition in the vicinity of <b>seed</b> <b>trees.</b> We show that accounting for distance-dependent survival substantially improves the model performance for three tested seed dispersal kernels. We show that ignoring distance-dependency of survival leads to ecologically unrealistic parameter estimates, questionable seed dispersal properties and biased sapling density predictions at the landscape level. Disentangling seed dispersal and survival processes is essential for modeling recruitment patterns in the case of distance-dependent survival. Our model helps to learn about the connection between seed and sapling patterns particularly when several <b>seed</b> <b>trees</b> are present. Our modeling approach derives separate seed dispersal kernels, survival functions, and the resulting recruitment-patterns, also when only sapling counts are available. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|Clearcutting, clearfelling or clearcut logging is a forestry/logging {{practice}} {{in which most}} or all trees in an area are uniformly cut down. Along with shelterwood and <b>seed</b> <b>tree</b> harvests, it is used by foresters to create certain types of forest ecosystems and to promote select species that require an abundance of sunlight or grow in large, even-age stands.

40|$|Written {{sources and}} archaeological {{evidence}} suggest that coppicing {{was a common}} practice in past woodland management. Depending mainly {{on the length of}} rotations, coppices provided wood products of various sizes, and coppice-wood has been identified in fuel-wood remains as well as in timber studies. Assigning the origin of the wood analyzed to coppice is based on observation of “typical growth patterns”: an even-age structure and a rapid decrease in ring-width with age are used nowadays. However, the wide variety of coppice practices and the variability observed in living-tree analogs make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. To contribute to improving coppice-wood identification, the present study analyzed differences in growth and tree-ring anatomy between living sessile oaks from a mixed stand of coppiced and <b>seeded</b> <b>trees.</b> Stems were compared based on ring-width, early- and late-wood widths, number and size of the earlywood vessels, and tissue proportions measured at different heights. The growth of coppiced trees was found to be faster than that of <b>seeded</b> <b>trees,</b> in height at cambial ages between 3 and 5 years and in diameter at 5 – 8 years. A quantitative anatomy study showed that tree rings from coppice shoots had smaller and more numerous vessels per unit surface area and a weaker hydraulic conductivity. Earlywood width, which can be acquired on archaeological wood much more easily than vessel surface, was significantly greater in the sample of <b>seeded</b> <b>trees.</b> Linear discriminant analysis performed on the data used to model earlywood width (leave-one-out procedure) correctly classified 77 % of coppice and 54 % of <b>seeded</b> <b>trees</b> when the radius exceeded 1. 66 cm and offers promising perspectives for dendro-anthracology and dendrochronology.

The hypothesis that its understorey regeneration may be affected by <b>seed</b> <b>tree</b> size and growing conditions was investigated in the tropical moist forest in southern Cameroon using mature trees of various diameter classes for a sustainable management of the species. Biomass partitioning was also examined in regenerating seedlings growing in loading bays and forest understorey. Seedling density was highest when <b>seed</b> <b>tree</b> diameter at breast height (dbh) was 100 cm or more. A strong positive correlation was found between <b>seed</b> <b>tree</b> diameter dbh and crown size expressed as mean diameter of projected crown area, but crown size correlated much better with seedling density. Compared with their counterparts of the same height growing in loading bays in full sunlight but devoid of litter and topsoil, seedlings found in understorey exhibited lower root: shoot ratio, indicating that soil-derived resources were more limiting in loading bays than on undisturbed forest floor. Leaf weight per area (leaf dry weight/leaf area) (LWA) and leaf packing (leaf number/cm shoot height) were almost 2 -fold greater in loading bays than in understorey. As seedlings seldom grew taller than 50 cm in the latter environment, it may be inferred that root: shoot ratio, LWA, and leaf packing can be used to assess the sustainability of growth and development of this pioneer species at the seedling stage...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of forest management is the promotion of natural regeneration of commercial timber species.   To explore the potential of tree selection processes that consider species requirements for regeneration, I developed an approach to select trees to be retained as <b>seed</b> <b>trees</b> and to be felled alternative to a conventional system.   The commercial species were characterised for attributes relevant to tree selection.   The alternative approach developed to retain <b>seed</b> <b>trees</b> consisted in to retain 10 - 30 % regarding to seven ecological attributes.   The conventional consisted of 10 % retention regardless species characteristics.   I compared the % of retention per species of conventional and alternative approaches in blocks of 100 ha.   The two methods selected a similar proportion of <b>seed</b> <b>trees</b> (17 %), yet the alternative approach retained relatively more <b>seed</b> <b>trees</b> for species with more limitations for regeneration.   Shade bearing species were responsible for 87 % of commercial species group basal area, suggesting that gap reduction and damage control on advanced regeneration as a silvicultural strategy.   The alternative approach to select trees for felling included a harvest map designed to facilitate the protection of <b>seed</b> <b>trees</b> and potential crop trees.   A field rule was introduced to control the spatial variation in harvest intensity.   I compared impacts of treatments on residual stand conditions and timber production. The area in logging gaps was reduced from 28 % to 15 % {{with the introduction of}} the alternative approach, the impacts on ground level, from 52 % to 32 % and on damage on potential crop trees from 13 % to 6 %.   Timber production from the conventional approach was on average 45. 5 m 3 ha - 1 and from the alternative was 24. 4 m 3 ha - 1.   However, the proportion of volume of high valued species increased from 57. 5 % to 72. 7 % with the alternative approach.   This study suggests that a compromise between timber production and impact reduction is required to achieve sustainable forest management.

The results were also compared to the genetic composition ofseed used for artificial regeneration following clear-cutting. Both natural regeneration treatments resulted in higher genetic variation in post-treatment seed, indicating a richer pollen cloud after management.

Randomization tests designed to evaluate the phylogenetic information content of the data suggest the data are highly significantly different from random {{in spite of the}} large number of parsimonious trees produced.
