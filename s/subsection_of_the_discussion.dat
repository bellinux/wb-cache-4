40|$|<b>The</b> main aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to conduct a meticulous {{analysis}} of which words or terms are used in the variables that best represent <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> SCM practices. <b>The</b> research conducted can be classified as being of a descriptive, exploratory and qualitative character. <b>The</b> search <b>of</b> <b>the</b> articles was made in the Scopus and Web <b>of</b> Science. <b>The</b> final sample was composed of 51 articles, drawn from 18 periodicals. For analysis, <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> a construct was taken as the base, its relation with manifested variables and words or terms most used and coherent with <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts and the contexts in which these terms were applied. A total of 639 variables that defined constructs, were transcribed. Similarity is noted in <b>the</b> employment <b>of</b> their variables and common use <b>of</b> words in <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts. However, the constructs possess different nomenclatures. Therefore, confusion is present in the studies analyzed. The study sought to contribute to greater discernment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts, making a critical reflective understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practices in the area. It was raised in <b>the</b> <b>subsections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> that <b>the</b> authors used the same terms in different contexts. It was pointed out the future prospects for formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts, showing how such constructs are being modified and perfected by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> theories, such as <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> Transaction Cost Economics, the Resource-Based View, Agency Theory, and Knowledge-Based Theor...|$|R
