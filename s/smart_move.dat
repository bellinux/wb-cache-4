500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The <b>smart</b> <b>move</b> {{would have been to}} take {{the rest of the year}} off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings I did with Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E

This can only be a good thing, as everything Becky touches turns to gold." [...] Francine Cohen of the Daily Mirror commented on Becky's storylines stating: [...] "Becky’s plots have ranged from drug busts to drunken rampages, but the most poignant yet has been her recent pregnancy, miscarriage and subsequent infertility."

40|$|An active {{lifestyle}} {{is a vital}} component of any successful preventative health strategy. Physical activity in Queensland (QLD) State schools is traditionally territorialized in the Key Learning Area (KLA) of Health and Physical Education (HPE) and school sport. The introduction of <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> in QLD State schools is recognised as an ecological approach to obesity prevention that aspires to increase students' physical activity levels. This study examines {{the ways in which}} <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> aims to de-territorialize health promotion and regular physical activity from its traditional settings and distributes it across broadened aspects of the curriculum in QLD State schools. Deleuzo-Guattarian post-disciplinary social theory provides a methodological lens for this document-based project. <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> policy and implementation guidelines are analysed as essential components of the <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> assemblage to illuminate its affective potential to increase {{the quality and quantity of}} physical activity in curriculum time. It is argued that <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> opens avenues for physical activity to be deterritorialized from existing forms in HPE and school sport. However, lax school and teacher accountability controls do not ensure holistic implementation of <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves.</b> Thus, it is inferred that the lack of stringent implementation and accountability controls may limit <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> affective capacity to connect with the school administrators, teachers, and ultimately students who stand to benefit significantly from the initiative...|$|R

500|$|Activision faced further {{criticism}} upon {{revealing that}} the Variety Map Pack would equally not be sold alongside the standalone version of Remastered. Fans also took offense {{to the fact}} that both the cost of the base remaster and that of the DLC amounted to an almost full-price game. Kain was understanding {{of the cost of the}} standalone as selling it cheaply would have affronted those who had bought a premium version of Infinite Warfare for the remaster, but had been [...] "almost certain" [...] that the game would have included the DLC. Subsequently, he wrote that doing so would have been [...] "a gesture of good will to the community" [...] and [...] "a <b>smart</b> <b>move</b> for the company". Mic's Jason Faulkner condemned Activision's previous business practices involving Remastered and found the standalone version to be [...] "a bad deal", criticizing that it was being sold for double that of its cost when bundled with Infinite Warfare, and found it [...] "ridiculous" [...] that with the DLC it amounted to almost full-price. As a result, he advised that fans should wait for the game to be reduced in price before buying.|$|E

Cabin also said it was impressive and clever that the studio managed to keep the short a surprise for general audiences to discover at the theater. Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and [...] "a great way to keep the buzz going for" [...] Deadpool 2 despite not actually revealing anything about that film. Matthew Monagle of Screen Crush said the short proves that the first Deadpool was [...] "not a one-hit wonder for Reynolds and company", and praised its jokes. He also noted its release with Logan as another connection being made by Fox between its X-Men films and Deadpool, pointing toward future crossovers between the two. The Verge's Andrew Liptak said the short was [...] "a fun one", noting the visual gags in the background and the Stan Lee cameo, and saying, [...] "At the very least, [...] we can expect the same irreverent humor in" [...] Deadpool 2 as was in the first film.|$|E

Downey {{appeared}} as a favor to Marvel Studios, which he acknowledged as a <b>smart</b> <b>move</b> on Marvel's part, because when he was promoting his film he would also have to mention their other production. Hulk co-creator Stan Lee cameos as a man who becomes ill when drinking the soda poisoned by Banner's blood. Michael K. Williams appears as a Harlem bystander, a role that was written for him by Norton, who is a fan of The Wire. Paul Soles, who voiced Banner in the 1966 The Marvel Superheroes cartoon, appears as Stanley, a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner. Additionally, the late Bill Bixby appears, in a scene on his TV comedy-drama The Courtship of Eddie's Father on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film. Rickson Gracie has a small role as Bruce Banner's martial arts instructor, despite his Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu background, he is credited as an Aikido instructor. Peter Mensah plays a small role as General Joe Gellar, one of General Ross' military friends/associates.

40|$|In 2006, the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) instigated a {{mandatory}} daily physical activity program for implementation in Queensland state schools following recommendations from a Ministerial Review of Sport and Physical Activity. The daily physical activity program {{is referred to}} as <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves.</b> This research seeks to determine if teachers are implementing <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> as per the mandated requirements {{and the extent to which}} the program is being implemented in Queensland state primary schools. In order to make these determinations, a mixed methods approach was used to collect data from Queensland state primary school teachers required to implement <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves.</b> A survey questionnaire was disseminated and face-to-face interviews were conducted. The data collected has been analysed and the findings discussed. There have been a number of limitations affiliated with the data collection and subsequent analysis and discussion of this project. The results are recorded with these limitations in mind. The major finding of the research is Queensland state primary school teachers are not implementing <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> as per the mandated requirements. This has been attributed to a number of reasons, however, the most significant is the lack of time available to provide opportunities for the students to engage in daily physical activity. Generally, teachers are aware of the benefits of daily physical activity, and acknowledge the elements that enable them to include physical activity in their program. The implication of this research suggests that the parameters of the daily physical activity requirements need to be reviewed and further investigation into the implementation of <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> needs to be undertaken. The <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> program, in its current form, is not being implemented in Queensland state primary schools as per the mandated requirements. ...|$|R

500|$|The {{first time}} Karofsky {{received}} significant notice from critics {{was for the}} second season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience {{as much as it}} did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and [...] "emotionally unsound". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as The Atlantic Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on [...] "Furt" [...] of the bullying storyline as a [...] "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved". In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially was a <b>smart</b> <b>move.</b> Up until now, he's been kind of a walking cliché, and now he gets to be someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies." [...] Reiter commented, [...] "And best of all, we got to watch Karofsky's character develop a bit more. It was nice to see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|Authors Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens {{commented that}} [...] "the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending {{approach}} associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism." [...] They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, {{leading them to}} say that [...] "the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism." [...] However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained to her bed do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes {{the fact that women}} can be in control because of their sexual prowess. Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike Metropolis, where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female. Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity, and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk {{came to the conclusion that}} [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was a <b>smart</b> <b>move</b> for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position. Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book Political Theory for Mortals, that [...] "Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America." [...] Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of [...] "Michael Jackson's androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity." [...] He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, {{there was a bit}} too much flash cutting [...] it was just like a {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a <b>smart</b> <b>move</b> in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} {{focus of}} this study is to explore Queensland (Australia) state school generalist teachers' perceptions regarding the barriers and enablers associated with the implementation of the <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> (compulsory physical activity) policy in the primary classroom setting. This study sought to primarily add to the literature on, and understanding about, implementing compulsory physical activity policy by generalist primary teachers. More generally, this study also aimed to explore generalist primary teachers' attitudes towards daily compulsory physical activity policy within the context of <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves.</b> Such a research undertaking was positioned within the interpretivist paradigm and a basic interpretive study methodology was employed. The research project involved semi-structured interviews with six generalist teachers from six Gold Coast State primary schools. Results of this study identify a cross section of both major thematic institutional and teacher-related barriers and enablers affecting the implementation of the <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> policy. The sub-themes being: (1) crowded curriculum, (2) lack of priority, (3) ensured that children are physically active, (4) the importance of teacher confidence and (5) inadequate access to facilities and equipment. These factors are clearly affecting the implementation of <b>Smart</b> <b>Moves</b> sessions and need to be addressed to ensure teacher compliance for the benefit of students. This paper concludes by offering potential recommendations for the future adoption and implementation of compulsory physical activity programmes within a primary school setting.
