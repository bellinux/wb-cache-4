500|$|The United States has two {{significant}} oil-shale deposits which are suited for commercial development {{due to their}} size, grade and location. The Eocene Green River Formation covers parts of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah; the second significant deposit is Devonian oil shales in the eastern United States. In both places, there are sub-basins varying in volume {{and quality of the}} reserves. Oil shale in the Green River Formation is found in five sedimentary basins namely, Green River, Uinta, Piceance Creek, <b>Sand</b> <b>Wash</b> and Washakie. The first three have undergone some significant exploration and attempts to commercialize the oil shale reserves since the 1960s. The Green River Formation includes deposits from two large lakes which covered an area of over [...] during early to middle Eocene period. These lakes were separated by the Uinta uplift and the Axial Basin anticline. For significant periods during their 10Ma life, the lakes became closed systems allowing many changes in size, salinity and sediment deposition. Oil shale is a result of abundant blue-green algae that thrived in the lakes.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the potential use of <b>sand</b> <b>washing</b> waste as filler for epoxy resin mortar. The mechanical properties of four series of mortars containing epoxy binder at 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt. % mixed with sand blended with <b>sand</b> <b>washing</b> waste filler in the range of 0 – 20 wt. % were examined. The compressive and flexural strength increased with the increase in epoxy and filler content; however, above epoxy 20 wt. %, slight change was seen in strength due to increase in epoxy and filler content. Modulus of elasticity also linearly increased with the increase in filler content, but the use of epoxy content beyond 20 wt. % decreased the modulus of elasticity of the mortar. For epoxy content at 10 wt. %, poor bond strength lower than 0. 8 MPa was observed, and adding filler at 20 wt. % adversely affected the bond strength, in contrast to the mortars containing epoxy at 15, 20, 25 wt. %. The results indicate that the <b>sand</b> <b>washing</b> waste can be used as potential filler for epoxy resin mortar to obtain better mechanical properties by adding the optimum level of <b>sand</b> <b>washing</b> waste filler...|$|R
50|$|The suburb {{is largely}} flat {{from the river}} north to Walkerville Terrace, then slopes upwards to its {{northern}} extent. Due to the elevation of views from the northern section, this land attracted wealthier purchasers. Some of their ornate Victorian homes, sited on large grounds, remain today. At a large bend in the River, {{the location of the}} today’s St Peters river park, gravel extraction, <b>sand</b> <b>washing</b> and a rubbish dumping have all been commercial activities. <b>Sand</b> <b>washing</b> was replaced by a dump in 1961, leading to complaints from the neighbouring suburb of St Peters about fumes from the burning rubbish. After the land was purchased by St Peters the bend was straightened and the dump reclaimed.|$|R

5000|$|The Moon Lake Project - In the 1930s, the Bureau of Reclamation {{designed}} and constructed the Moon Lake Project on the Lake Fork River.

5000|$|Enlarged Big <b>Sand</b> <b>Wash</b> Reservoir — The {{enlargement}} of the Big <b>Sand</b> <b>Wash</b> Reservoir (by raising {{the level of the}} dam and associated dikes and saddle dams) will provide additional water storage capacity and regulation capability. The enlarged reservoir will allow for the storage of water that had been stored in the High Mountain Lakes. This transfer also results in improved instream flow in certain reaches of the Lake Fork River and its principal tributary—the Yellowstone River. The water stored in the enlarged reservoir will serve irrigation and M&I purposes. Increasing the height of the new dam is being accomplished by removing about two-thirds of the downstream side of the old dam, excavating a new keyway immediately downstream of the remaining structure, constructing the new dam, and integrating the remnants of the old dam into the upstream fill of the new, taller structure.|$|E

50|$|During the Spring, Summer, and Fall months, many boaters {{each year}} make the 83 mile trip through Desolation and Gray Canyons from <b>Sand</b> <b>Wash</b> to Swasey's Rapid, just above Green River, Utah. This section is {{managed by the}} Price office of the Bureau of Land Management, which issues permits. An {{additional}} permit must be obtained to camp or hike on the Eastern side of the river, {{which is part of}} the Ute Reservation for most of the canyon's length. As of Spring 2015, the Utes are no longer offering permits to non-tribal members, however enforcement is effectively non-existent. Over 60 named class two and three rapids challenge boaters, and the gradual increase in size and difficulty of rapids make it an ideal place for beginner to intermediate boaters to develop their skills. At high water (over 20,000 cfs), Joe Hutch Canyon Rapid (Cow Swim) approaches a class IV difficulty. Rapids in the canyon are big enough to swamp an open canoe at any water level.|$|E

50|$|The prairie sphinx moth or Wiest's {{primrose}} sphinx (Euproserpinus wiesti) is {{a species}} of moth in the family Sphingidae. It is found from north-eastern California through central Nevada and most of Utah to north-eastern Arizona and northern three-quarters of New Mexico and most of Colorado, and further eastward into extreme western portions of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. The habitat consists of <b>sand</b> <b>washes</b> and prairie blow-outs.|$|R
40|$|General Description. —Threadleaf {{groundsel}} is {{also known}} as threadleaf butterweed, Douglas groundsel or ragwort, felty groundsel, <b>sand</b> <b>wash</b> groundsel, comb butterweed, old man, yerba cana, squawweed, creek senecio, and cenicillo (Elmore 1976, Epple 1995, Stubbendieck and others 1997). This species commonly reaches heights of 80 to 130 cm and under ideal conditions may reach 2 m. It is probably best classified as a subshrub. It forms woody stems to a meter or so but often dies back to less than 50 cm from the ground-line. It tends to become somewhat straggly as branches may lean over in different directions, some becoming almost decumbent. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound (sometimes not divided), narrow and thread-like, up to 12 cm in length, and usually covered with whitish hairs giving the plant an obvious grayish color (Carte...|$|E
40|$|Near {{the end of}} the {{frontier}} period in the late 1880 s, cattlemen and then sheepmen grabbed at the last chance for grass and water. They found it along the Green River in Desolation Canyon. The settlement period lasted about sixty years. In the river bottoms ranchers like Jim McPherson, Dan and Bill Seamount, and Preston Nutter discovered luxuriant native bunch grasses. In addition they had a continuous water source in the Green and in its many side canyons like Nine Mile, Rock Creek, and Florence Creek. Ranchers irrigated out of those creeks—for both domestic use and for alfalfa. The first ranch at Florence Creek was started by Jim McPherson and his uncles in 1887. Jim ran a model operation for over forty years. Around 1905 his in-laws, the Seamount brothers, bought out Shed Lunt’s ranch upstream at Rock Creek. Sheepmen came into the area {{by the turn of the}} century. They required ferries to carry the sheep across the river between winter ranges on the Pariette Bench and summer ranges on the East Tavaputs. Hank Stewart ran two different ferries, at Tia Juana Bottom in 1915 and then at <b>Sand</b> <b>Wash</b> in 1920. Ute Indians like Red Moon, who clashed with Stewart, grazed their horses in the river bottoms. A copper mill south of Ouray, the Uteland Mine, prospered for a short time around 1911. Its owners used the Green’s water to process copper. A Carey Act water project saw promoter O. S. Buell attempt to dam the river at Coal Creek in 1906. Like the Uteland Mine, it failed. A truly “beneficial use” of water in the area went to moonshining, especially once Prohibition took effect in 1920. Ben Morris and Frank Hyde were two of the most prominent at that trade. By 1940 most settlers had left the area. The Taylor Grazing Act, the Indian Reorganization Act, World War II, the development of synthetic materials, and better jobs in the defense industry all helped push settlers elsewhere. Desolation returned to its name...|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} heavy surf {{along the}} western coastline, {{as well as a}} storm tide of 4.78feet (1.46m) at Clearwater Beach. The wave action caused minor beach erosion, with 50–60feet (15–18m) of <b>sand</b> <b>washed</b> away at Bradenton Beach. The increased ocean action caused minor flooding along several roads in the Tampa Bay area, which trapped some automobile travelers. At Indian Shores, a woman died after sustaining injuries from the rough surf.|$|R
