The same year, he was {{promoted}} to Assistant Secretary, and Under-secretary in 1954. Apart from a stint in the Ministry of Health from 1958–60, he remained with the Treasury until 1966, when, aged 60, he had reached the normal retirement age for the civil service. He was persuaded instead to carry on as a ceremonial officer administering the honours <b>system.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> role, he supported the knighthoods of P. G. Wodehouse and Noël Coward. Milner-Barry eventually retired in 1977. He was appointed OBE in 1946 for his work in World War II, CB in 1962, and KCVO in 1975.|$|E

Individual weapons are given the availability to have an 11th evolved state, increasing the weapon's stats further. Due to the great emphasis in the duelling <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> expansion, it is at times seen as its own individual game - separate from the original Dynasty Warriors 4.|$|E
