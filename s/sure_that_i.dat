I didn't know why it was so important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't have cared less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. When he talked about his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them." [...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E

500|$|Thirty-four {{years after}} Branded to Kill, Suzuki {{directed}} Pistol Opera (2001), a loose sequel co-produced by Shochiku and filmed at Nikkatsu. The character Goro Hanada returns {{as a mentor}} figure to the new Number Three, played by Makiko Esumi. However, Joe Shishido was replaced by Mikijiro Hira {{in the role of}} Hanada. Suzuki has said that the original intention was for Shishido to play the character again but that the film's producer, Satoru Ogura, wanted Hira for the role. Reviews were of a favourable nature on par with its predecessor. Jonathan Rosenbaum supposed, [...] "Can I call a film a masterpiece without being <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> understand it? I think so..." [...] Although some, such as Elvis Mitchell for The Village Voice, felt its zeal fell slightly short of the original.|$|E

[...] "These next two years are huge for the national team with the World Cup and Olympics on the horizon and I wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be giving my team and my country my best on the field," [...] Solo said of the surgery.

Then an unmastered version of [...] "Turn Off" [...] was leaked online in September 2008. After selecting the predominantly pop-sounding [...] "Energy" [...] and [...] "Return the Favor", Hilson selected [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] as In a Perfect World...s third single. When asked {{in an interview}} with That Grape Juice if choosing the song was a conscious effort, since the song had a different sound than the previous singles, Hilson responded, [...] "Absolutely! I mean, there’s another side of me. I’m from Decatur, Georgia and that is a predominantly black neighbourhood with a lot of lower-class and some middle-class neighbourhoods. I guess that is the song that probably properly describes the type of girl I am, in relation to where I’m from. So yeah, it was definitely a conscious effort to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stay close to home on some records." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Bridget's first {{high-profile}} storylines was {{coping with}} a disability, after Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) hit Bridget with her car. She had been paralysed {{on one side of}} her body, the storyline saw her trying to regain the complete use of her body. Mignon explained during an interview with media reporting website Last Broadcast, the research that had been carried out and the effects on the character stating: [...] "Bridget suffers extreme physical difficulties as a result, because she's such a sporty tomboy, to be incapacitated suddenly poses emotional problems for her. To make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could understand better what Bridget's going through, I studied medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet." [...] The storyline also explored self-image issues that come with disabilities, in one episode Bridget was doing physiotherapy exercises and became in danger of drowning until Declan Napier (James Sorensen) saved her. He tried to kiss her but she fended off his advances, of this Mignon said: [...] "Bridget pushes him off, she fears he'll see her differently due to her disability." ...|$|E

[...] She began seeing Robert Oppenheimer in 1936, {{when she was a}} graduate student there and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at Berkeley. They met through his landlady, Mary Ellen Washburn, who was {{also a member of the}} Communist party, when Washburn held a fund raiser for communist-backed Spanish Republicans. The couple started dating and had a passionate relationship; he proposed to her twice, but she refused. She is credited with introducing Oppenheimer to radical politics during the late 1930s, and to people involved with, or sympathetic to the Communist Party or related groups, such as Rudy Lambert and Thomas Addis. They continued seeing each other after he became involved with Kitty Harrison, whom he married on November 1, 1940. Oppenheimer and Tatlock [...] spent the New Year together in 1941, and once met at Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|The French {{electronic}} group Daft Punk {{composed the}} film score of Tron: Legacy, which features over 30 tracks. The score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. Jason Bentley {{served as the}} film's music supervisor. An electronic music fan, Kosinski stated that to replicate the innovative electronic Tron score by Wendy Carlos [...] "rather than going with a traditional film composer, I wanted to try something fresh and different", adding that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} interest from different electronic bands that I follow to work on the film" [...] but he eventually picked Daft Punk. Kosinski added that he knew the band was [...] "more than just dance music guys" [...] for side projects such as [...] their film Electroma. The duo were first contacted by producers in 2007, when Tron: Legacy was still {{in the early stages of}} production. Since they were touring at the time, producers were unsuccessful in contacting the group. They were again approached by Kosinski, eventually agreeing to take part in the film a year later. Kosinski added that Daft Punk were huge Tron fans, and that his meeting with them [...] "was almost like they were interviewing me to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to hold up to the Tron legacy".|$|E

500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... {{it never occurred to me}} that he was smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, I was <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was in love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible for me not to be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E
500|$|After a {{short period}} of inactivity, Dickinson once again teamed up with Roy Z and Tribe of Gypsies to record his next album, Accident of Birth; [...] "It was {{actually}} Roy that dragged me back into some assemblance, because he called up and he said, 'Listen, I've got some stuff and it's like a metal record.' And I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't really <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had anything to offer... Then he played me some backing-tracks he'd done for what was to become Accident of Birth down the phone and I thought 'There is something there.'" [...] Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit. The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, [...] "The album's heavy feel is very satisfying, and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90's." [...] The follow-up, The Chemical Wedding, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blake's writings; with some songs, such as [...] "Book of Thel", having the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring one of his paintings. The record was even more successful than its predecessor, with Sputnikmusic commenting, [...] "Bruce had shattered all expectations to create an album that might even be better than the previous one." [...] During The Chemical Weddings supporting tour, the live album, Scream for Me Brazil was recorded in São Paulo, after which Dickinson and Smith returned to Iron Maiden in February 1999.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] were often {{difficult}} for listeners to decipher, both {{due to their}} nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that the Nevermind album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one Geffen promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, [...] "We can't play this. I can't understand what the guy is saying." [...] MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule. The lyrics for the album—and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs—were later released with the liner notes of the [...] "Lithium" [...] single in 1992. American rock critic Dave Marsh noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was [...] "the 'Louie Louie' of the nineties" [...] and wrote, [...] "Like 'Louie,' only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently." [...] Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics of the song, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that [...] "what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang," [...] and added, [...] "Worst of all, I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know more about [...] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts." ...|$|E

500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam."
