50|$|Allen Ravenstine {{was born}} on May 9, 1950. He had much {{exposure}} to music at a young age, his interest derived from his mother playing Sergei Rachmaninoff and other classical music and his father's interest in jazz and percussion records. He played the trombone in grade school but quickly lost interest. Ravenstine's first real experience as an artist came in 1971 after abandoning his college pursuits. He met visual artist Bob Bensick, who was experimenting with <b>sending</b> <b>distortion</b> into oscillators and out a stereo system. Eventually, they discovered a way to attach lights and have them work {{in conjunction with the}} sounds being produced and decided to stage art shows. The act was short lived as Ravenstine moved out of the area and lost contact with Bensick. Soon after, Ravenstine purchased his first synthesizer, an ElectroComp EML 200, and began associating with the garage band Rocket from the Tombs and recording their performances.|$|E

Adaptive media playout at the client {{can be used to}} reduce re-ceiver buffering and therefore average latency, and provide a lim-ited rate scalability. Rate-distortion optimized packet scheduling determines the best packet to <b>send</b> given the <b>distortion</b> reduction associated with sending that packet, interpacket dependencies, and the success of past transmissions. Channel-adaptive packet depen-dency control can greatly improve the error-robustness of stream-ing video and reduce or eliminate the need for packet retransmis-sions. Finally we consider three architectures for wireless video streaming and discuss the utility of the discussed techniques for each architecture. 1...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the large}} {{development}} {{in the use of}} distributed systems applications many problems emerged. We have discussed in this paper {{one of the most important}} problems that are faced when using distributed systems to <b>send</b> data, the <b>distortions</b> that occurs while image is being sent where these distortions caused reduced color accuracy and clarity of images. This paper introduced a very efficient algorithm to process the problem of distortions that occur with images and this algorithm is very fast to images interpolation. The basic idea of this algorithm is digital image segmentation into homogeneous areas and edges, depending on the structural analysis of the images. In addition, in order to get the best performance of images interpolations, algorithms used are customized to interpolate area classified images, respectively. The experimental results showed a significant improvement in the quality of interpolation of images compared with the interpolation of images by using the proposed algorithm. The comparison results of complexity calculations of the proposed algorithm are shown in this work...|$|R
