40|$|The {{design of}} a day lighted space is both an art and a science. The biggest {{challenge}} facing the lighting designer is to admit only as much light as necessary and distribute it evenly throughout the space without introducing glare or heat. In warm climates such as Florida, it has become common practice in windowed spaces to specify blinds and glazing with high <b>shading</b> <b>coefficients</b> to control glare and minimize heat gain. However, this practice reduces the effectiveness of lighting systems that dim automatically. Improved systems are needed to capture natural daylight and distribute it uniformly throughout a space while controlling heat gain and glare. One such system is the light shelf. Light shelves shade the space from direct sunlight and reflect this sunlight onto the ceiling for a deeper and more uniform distribution. While {{this is not a}} new idea, little unbiased empirical data has been collected, outside the laboratory, that compares the performance (energy savings, uniformity, and level) of an automatic daylighting system. This study measures the effectiveness of light shelves and manually controlled horizontal blinds in an automatic daylighting system. Power consumption and interior work-plane lighting levels were compared in four essentially identical private offices. Two offices were configured with an interior light shelf, one with a white diffuse top surface and the other with a specular surface. The third office had no window treatment and the fourth office had horizontal blinds, which were manually adjusted by the user. All offices had two lamp fluorescent luminaires with dimming ballasts (min. 20 %) controlled by a ceiling mounted photosensor.

40|$|Today's {{energy-efficient}} windows can dramatically {{lower the}} {{heating and cooling}} costs associated with windows while increasing occupant comfort and minimizing window surface condensation problems. However, consumers are often confused about how to pick the most efficient window for a residence. Product information typically offers window properties U-factors or R-values, Solar Heat Gain <b>Coefficients</b> or <b>Shading</b> <b>Coefficients,</b> and air leakage rates. However, {{the relative importance of}} these properties depends on site-and building-specific conditions. Furthermore, these properties are based on static evaluation conditions that are very different from the real situation a window will be used in. A computer tool such as RESFEN can help consumers and builders pick the most energy-efficient and cost-effective window for a given application, whether it is a new home, an addition, or a window replacement. It calculates heating and cooling energy use and associated costs as well as peak heating and cooling demand for specific window products. Users define a specific scenario by specifying house type (single-story or two-story), geographic location, orientation, electricity and gas cost, and building configuration details (such as wall, floor, and HVAC system type). Users also specify size, shading and thermal properties of the window they wish to investigate. The thermal properties that RESFEN requires are U-factor, Solar Heat Gain Coefficient, and air leakage rate. RESFEN calculates the energy and cost implications of the window compared to an insulated wall. The relative energy and cost impacts of two different windows can be compared. RESFEN 3. 0 was a major improvement over previous versions because it performs hourly calculations using aversion of the DOE 21 E (LBL 1980, Winkelmann et al. 1993) energy analysis simulation program.

40|$|This project {{compares the}} {{performance}} of two different heating and cooling systems. These two systems are a water based system, which is mainly based on Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS), and an air based system, {{which is based on}} a simple heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. A climate classification for the use of TABS has been created in the current project. The intention of this classification is to determine in which climate zones a building requires to implement a heating, a cooling or a dehumidification system. A climate classification system that considers dehumidification is important when TABS are implemented, since risk of condensation can be a problem when these systems are used for cooling requirements. The new European Climate Classification (ECC) system is based on a combination of the annual number of heating and cooling degree days and the outdoor dew-point temperature. Four different thermal categories, which are defined by the number of heating and cooling degree days, and three dew-point categories, which are defined by the dew-point temperature, are introduced in the ECC system. In total, the current classification is based on twelve possible final climate categories and has been evaluated in 92 European cities. Some parameters have been introduced in thermal and dew-point categories. These parameters are investigated in a parametric analysis conducted in this project. This analysis investigates how changing some parameters in the ECC system affects the location of the different climate zones in the map of Europe. As shown in this analysis these parameters {{have a significant effect on}} the climate classification of the locations in Europe. Only two of the five initial base temperature cases were evaluated in the entire parametric analysis as more suitable classifications for Europe according to existing climate classifications were obtained with these two cases. These base temperature cases are HDD 18 °C/CDD 18 °C and HDD 16 °C/CDD 19 °C. Thermal comfort and energy consumption are compared between water and air based systems using the building simulation program IDA ICE. The performance of both systems is tested in ten European cities classified in seven different climate zones found with the ECC system. The comparative analysis is carried out in four different offices of the Balanced Office Building (BOB) in Achen, Germany. The BOB is an energy-efficient and well-insulated office building in which TABS are implemented for cooling and heating requirements. The shading devices implemented at the beginning are modified for offices A, C and/or E, according to each city case, in order to improve thermal comfort.

The main goal is to investigate the effects of different glazing types applied onto {{the front and rear}} windscreens of the car on the distribution of air-temperature inside the passenger compartment in the steady-state conditions. The air-flow condition in the passenger's compartment is also investigated. Fluent CFD software was used to develop a three-dimensional symmetrical model of the passenger's compartment. Simplified representations of the driver and one rear passenger were incorporated into the CFD model of the passenger's compartment. Two types of glazing were considered namely clear insulated laminated tint (CIL) with a <b>shading</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 78 and green insulated laminate tint (GIL) with a <b>shading</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 5.

This contributes to a better thermal comfort condition to the occupants. Swirling air flow condition occurs in the passenger compartment.

40|$|In {{agroforestry}} systems (AFS), quantifying {{the competition}} for light is a prerequisite toward understanding the impact of shade trees on the productivity of the under-crop. Models for homogeneous canopies and shade/full-sun approaches do not address the intra-plot heterogeneity, typical of AFS. For the first time, MAESTRA, a 3 D light absorption model, was fully parameterized in a heterogeneous 2 -canopy layers AFS. We quantified competition for photosynthetic photon flux density (Q) between shade trees (Erythrine poepiggiana) and coffee (Coffea arabica), with a spatial resolution from the plant to the plot (2. 7 ha) and a temporal resolution from half-hour to one full year. The predicted transmittance through the 2 -canopy layers was verified against field measurements. The goodness of fit (R- 2 > 0. 75, RRMSE < 26 %) was comparable to the predictions from 10 other studies using 3 D light models and mostly verified in one-layered systems (mean R- 2 = 0. 89 and mean RRMSE = 17 %). Maps of absorbed Q showed that despite their low density in the plot (5. 2 trees ha(- 1)), the tall Erythrina trees reduced Q available for the coffee layer by 14 % annually. Annual pruning of the oldest unproductive coffee resprouts maintained a large horizontal heterogeneity in coffee LAI, with direct impact on the Q absorption map. This management practice had a strong impact on seasonal variations of absorbed Q by the coffee canopy. We proposed also a simple approach to estimate Q absorbed yearly by the coffee plants in AFS of variable tree density, requiring only few measurements in the field. An extrapolation indicated {{that the amount of}} Q absorbed by the coffee canopy would display a negative exponential relationship (k = - 0. 34) when increasing shade tree density (from nil to 29 trees ha(- 1)). The estimated k was similar to the <b>shade</b> tree extinction <b>coefficient</b> of diffuse radiation measured with a plant canopy analyzer. We showed that the presence of shade trees tends to reverse the diurnal time course of the fraction of Q(a) when compared to a plantation in the open. Overall, MAESTRA proved to successfully unlock the question of intra-plot heterogeneity for light absorption and to provide defensible light budgets as a continuous and mapped covariable, a crucial step for many field experimentations.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Freshwater is {{the most}} {{fundamental}} of all life-supporting resources that determine our social, economic and political wellbeing. It is, however, {{only a small percentage}} of the world's water resources and is also unevenly distributed. Arid regions make-up about forty percent of the world's land area and have a large proportion of the world population, however, they only have a small fraction of the freshwater compared to other areas. Conventional freshwater sources in arid environments such as surface water in rivers, lakes and dams are often seasonal, available mainly during the rainy season. Equally, only a small part of the rain (0 - 5 % of rainfall) infiltrates into groundwater reserves, and even this groundwater displays high rates of salinisation such that the end-water is too saline for human consumption. The poor quality of groundwater in arid regions is generally understood, however, it is always assumed that this is mainly a problem in areas where surface water does not occur. The study investigates seasonal groundwater salinisation in ephemeral (seasonal) river sources in some parts of Namibia and aims to derive a better understanding of the nature of this problem and how it affects people in these areas. It also looks at some possible solutions to the problem with the aim of informing water managers and scientists who are responsible for formulating solutions for water supply to areas in arid regions. These solutions are designed to take advantage of available opportunities in the study areas namely; the abundant supply of solar energy, alternative sources of freshwater such as fog and general atmospheric moisture, and adaptations for water collection in animals that inhabit these regions. The results show that groundwater in shallow ephemeral river sources of the Namib Desert and the Cuvelai delta in North central Namibia display high seasonal variation in Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and chemical composition. The lowest TDS values are recorded during the rainy season, mainly after the first rains in the high rainfall areas and only after flood events in the lower rainfall regions. The groundwater salinity increases during the remainder of the year and in most cases becomes too saline for drinking purposes. The investigations of possible solutions indicate that small-scale photovoltaic reverse osmosis; solar distillation and fog collection could be used to address the seasonal shortage of potable water in these areas. The low-pressure (6 bar) reverse osmosis desalination experiments show that it is possible to operate the unit on a solar-driven pump to produce enough water to cover the typical daily water demand of a village in the Namib Desert. This unit would produce about 4600 litres per day (l/day) of 500 - mg/l TDS product water, which exceeds the water production of similar world-leading small-scale RO units in Australia and The Canary Islands. The results also show that the cost of solar distillation units (solar stills) can be reduced sufficiently to make them a viable option for water supply to individual households in these rural areas. The study also found that fog is a feasible alternative source of freshwater in some of the study areas. The fog water is generally of 'A' quality drinking water according to the WHO-derived Namibian Drinking Water Quality Guidelines (NDWQG) and can be used directly or mixed with the saline groundwater to provide potable water. Mixing of the above-mentioned waters is particularly suitable in the Central Namib Desert because the period of high groundwater salinity coincides with that of peak fog deposition. The results also show that fog water can be collected with vanous polymeric greenhouse shade netting that can be easily obtained, and provides guidelines on the correct percentage <b>shade</b> <b>coefficient</b> and weave of possible fog collector mesh to intending users of fog collection technology in areas where the polypropylene mesh that is used in Standard Fog Collectors is not available. The investigations of surface properties of fog-harvesting beetles and experiments with various prototype collectors show that it is possible to increase water production in fog collectors existing today. The hydrophobic surface conditions as were found on the cuticles of fog-basking beetles (Onymaeris unguicularis and Onymacris bieolor) would enhance formation and runoff of large fog droplets on the collector surface. The prototype extractor-fan- and cooling system-based collectors show that it is possible to increase fog collection on polymeric meshes about three times and also that a comparable volume of atmospheric moisture can be collected even when there is no fog, up to a relative humidity of about 40 %. In conclusion the study emphasizes that groundwater salinity in arid regions is at times a seasonal problem that should be considered in water supply strategies for these regions. Also that atmospheric moisture is a feasible alternative source of freshwater in some arid regions that often exceeds rainfall several times and should be considered as an important aspect of the strategies to address water problems in these areas. The study strongly recommends that scientists, engineers and water managers in these regions should always investigate the available opportunities such as climatic conditions (e. g. fog deposition) and adaptations for water collection/conservation that are found in the endemic plants and animals in order to develop sustainable solutions to this problem. They should also constantly update themselves on developments/opportunities that arise in the larger water industry that could be of benefit to water supply initiatives for remote areas in developing countries. Lastly, the study serves to better the understanding of the nature of groundwater salinity in arid environments that are dependent on seasonal surface flow for water supply as well as to contribute to the formulation of solutions to this problem in these areas, particularly in west coast hyper arid environments where conventional sources of freshwater are most inadequate. It also emphasises the role of materials science (polymers) and environmental engineering as well as that of UNESCO associated scientific institutions in the formulation of sustainable solutions to some of the current water problems in arid regions.

Dit is egter slegs 'n klein gedeelte van die totale waterbronne van die wereld, en is boonop baie oneweredig versprei. Natuurlike waterarm gebiede (woestyne en halfwoestyne) beslaan ongeveer veertig persent van die landoppervlakte van die aarde en word bewoon deur 'n relatief groot persentasie van die wereldbevolking, maar beskik oor slegs 'n klein gedeelte van die varswater in vergelyking met ander gebiede. Konvensionele bronne van varswater in waterarm gebiede, soos oppervlaktewater in riviere, mere en darnme, is dikwels seisoenaal, en slegs beskikbaar gedurende die reenseisoen. Verder beland slegs 'n klein gedeelte van die reenval (0 - 5 %) in die ondergrondse waterreserwes, en selfs hierdie grondwater vertoon 'n hoe mate van versouting, sodat die eindproduk te brak is vir menslike gebruik. Die swak gehalte van grondwater in waterarm gebiede word algemeen verstaan, maar daar is tot nog toe aanvaar dat dit oor die algemeen slegs 'n probleem is in gebiede waar oppervlaktewater me voorkom nie. Hierdie studie ondersoek seisoenale grondwaterverbrakking in seisoenale rivierbronne in sekere dele van Namibie en beoog om 'n beter begrip te formuleer van die aard van die probleem en hoe dit die inwoners van hierdie gebiede raak. Daar word ook ondersoek ingestel na moontlike oplossings vir die probleem, met die doel om 'n inligtingsbron vir waterbestuurders en wetenskaplikes wat verantwoordelik is vir die formuleer van oplossings vir watervoorsiening in waterarm gebiede daar te stel. Hierdie oplossings is ontwerp om voordeel te trek uit die beskikbare geleenthede in die ondersoekgebiede, naamlik; die oorvloedige beskikbaarheid van sonenergie, altematiewe bronne van varswater soos mis (Eng. "fog") en atmosferiese vog in die algemeen en aanpassings (Eng. "adaptations") vir die opvang van water wat voorkom by diere, veral insekte, in hierdie gebiede. Die resultate toon dat grondwater in die vlak seisoenale rivierbronne van die Namibwoestyn en die Cuvelai-delta in noordsentraal Namibie hoe seisoenale variasie in totale opgeloste stowwe (TVS) en chemiese samestelling vertoon. Die laagste TVS-waardes word waargeneem tydens die reenseisoen, hoofsaaklik na die eerste reen in die hoe-reenvalgebiede en eers na vloede in die lae-reenvalgebiede, Die soutgehalte van die grondwater neem toe gedurende die res van die jaar en in die meeste gevalle verbrak die water tot ondrinkbare vlakke. Die ondersoek na moontlike oplossings dui aan dat kleinskaalse fotovoltaiesgedrewe tru-osmose, sondistillasie en die opvang van mis (Eng. "fog collection") aangewend kan word om die seisoenale tekort aan drinkwater in hierdie gebiede aan te spreek. Die laedruk (6 bar) tru-osmose-ontsoutingseksperimente wys dat dit moontlik is om die eenheid met behulp van 'n sonkraggedrewe pomp te bedryf en voldoende water te lewer vir die tipiese daaglikse drinkwaterbehoeftes van 'n nedersetting in die Namibwoestyn. Hierdie eenheid sal sowat 4600 liter per dag (l/d) water, met 'n TVSwaarde van 500 mg/I, lewer. Dit is aansienlik meer as die lewering van soortgelyke eenhede in Australie en die Kanariese Eilande. Die resultate wys ook dat die koste van sondistillasie-eenhede genoegsaam verminder kan word om dit 'n lewensvatbare opsie vir watervoorsiening aan enkelhuishoudings in die plattelandse gebiede te maak. Die studie het ook bevind dat die opvang van mis 'n toepaslike alternatiewe bron van varswater is in sekere van die studiegebiede. Die miswater is oor die algemeen 'A' -gehalte drinkwater vol gens die Namibiese gehalteriglyne Vir drinkwater (gebasseer op bepalings van die Wereldgesondheidsorganisasie) en dat dit net so, of vermeng met brak grondwater, gebruik kan word as drinkwater. Vermenging is besonder geskik in die sentrale Namibwoestyn, aangesien die periode van hoe grondwaterverbrakking saamval met die piek van benutbare misneerslag. Die resultate toon ook aan dat miswater opgevang kan word met verskeie tipes polimeriese skadunet, wat maklik verkrygbaar is, en verskaf riglyne vir die optimale skadu-koeffisient en weefpatroon van moontlike misvangsnette vir voomemende gebruikers van misvangstegnologie in gebiede waar die polipropileennet wat in die standaard miskollekteerders gebruik word nie, beskikbaar is nie. Die ondersoek van oppervlakeienskappe van mis-koesterkewers (Eng. "fog harvesting beetles") en eksperimente met verskeie prototipe versamelaars toon dat dit moontlik is om die waterproduksie van bestaande kollekteerders te verhoog. Die hidrofobe oppervlaktetoestande soos gevind op die opperhuid van die mis-koesterkewers (Onymacris unguicularis en Onymacris bicolor) bevorder die vorming en afloop van groot misdruppels op die versameloppervlak. Die prototipe suigwaaier- en verkoelerstelselgebasseerde versamelaars toon dat dit moontlik is om die misvogversameling op polimeriese nette tot drie maal te verhoog en dat 'n vergelykbare volume atmosferiese vog versamel kan word, selfs in die afwesigheid van mis, tot by 'n relatiewe humiditeit van ongeveer 40 %. Ten slotte benadruk die studie dat grondwatersoutgehalte in waterann gebiede soms 'n seisoenale probleem is, en dat dit in ag geneem moet word in watervoorsieningstrategiee vir sulke gebiede. Dit benadruk ook dat atmosferiese vog 'n bruikbare alternatiewe bron van varswater kan wees in sekere areas, waar dit dikwels verskeie male meer is as reenval, en gesien behoort te word as 'n belangrike aspek in strategiee om waterprobleme in hierdie gebiede aan te spreek. Die studie beveel sterk aan dat wetenskaplikes, ingenieurs en waterbestuurders in hierdie gebiede altyd die beskikbare geleenthede soos klimaatstoestande (bv. misneerslag) en aanpassings vir vogvangslbewaring wat voorkom by inheemse plante en diere sal navors om sodoende onderhoudbare oplossings vir die probleem te vind. Hulle behoort deurlopend op hoogte te bly met ontwikkelings/geleenthede wat ontstaan in die wyer waterindustrie, wat van waarde kan wees in by waterverskaffmgsinisiatiewe vir afgelee gebiede in ontwikkelende lande. Laastens dien die studie om 'n beter begrip daar te stel van die aard van grondwatersoutvlakke in waterarm gebiede wat afhanklik is van seisoenale oppervlaktevloei vir watervoorsiening sowel as om 'n bydrae te lewer tot die formuleer van oplossings tot die probleem in hierdie gebiede, veral in die hiperdroe omgewings aan die Namibiese weskus, waar konvensionele waterbronne mees onvoldoende is. Dit benadruk ook die rol van materiaalkundige wetenskappe (polimere) en omgewingsingenieurswese sowel as die UNESCO-geassosieerde wetenskaplike instellings in die formulering van volhoubare oplossings vir sommige van die huidige waterprobleme in waterann gebiede.

HISG might be {{presumed to be}} a conventional photovoltaic glazing product; however, it is completely unique by having some characteristic features such as superior thermal insulation, which is competitive with triple-glazed windows using argon as inert gas, acoustic and thermal comfort, self-cleaning ability owing to TiO 2 nano-coating on module surface and extraordinary energy saving potential in both summer and winter. In our previous works, comprehensive experimental and numerical works {{have been carried out}} for power generation and thermal insulation performance of HISG under various climatic conditions. Within the scope of this research, optical- and lighting-related performance parameters of this smart building material are evaluated through extensive laboratory and in situ tests. <b>Shading</b> <b>coefficient,</b> visible light intensity, and UV and IR penetration are investigated via the tests conducted in real operating conditions. It is achieved from the results that the <b>shading</b> <b>coefficient</b> of HISG is only 0. 136, which yields almost 80 % reduction in solar heat gain compared with ordinary glazing. It is also observed from the in situ tests that HISG has a % 100 UV and 99 % IR blocking rate, which is of vital importance in terms of human health and thermal comfort conditions. Glaring effects are totally resolved via HISG, which is still a challenge for the buildings with conventional glazing products, especially in summer...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a Monte-Carlo method for the {{simulation}} of the angle-dependent light transmittance of thermotropic material. The results show that the scattering light increased as temperature rose, and most of light transmitted went through the sample of thermotropic material at the angles between 10 ~ 40 deg. The results also indicate that the light transmittance measurement of thermotropic material by spectrophotometer without an integrating sphere is not accurate. As a conclusion, Monte Carlo simulation is an effective method for the determination of angle-dependent light transmittance of thermotropic material, and results of these simulations can be used to calculate the <b>shading</b> <b>coefficient</b> of window for building energy efficiency...|$|E

Previous literature shows that planting trees to shade a building can reduce its cooling load. This work proposes {{a model to}} determine the cost effectiveness and profitability of planting a shade tree by considering both its potential to reduce cooling energy and its purchase and maintenance cost. A comparison between six selected tree species is used for illustration. Using growth rates, crown sizes, and shading coefficients, cooling energy savings from the tree shades are computed using an industrial-standard building energy simulation program, offset by costs of purchase, planting, and maintenance of these trees. The result shows that most worthwhile tree to plant should have high <b>shading</b> <b>coefficient</b> and moderate crown size to maximize shading while keeping the maintenance costs manageable. ...|$|E
