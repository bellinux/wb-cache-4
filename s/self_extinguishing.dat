The astronauts' spacesuits, originally made of nylon, were changed to beta cloth, a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from fiberglass and coated with ].

50|$|The Burgan {{field is}} known to be {{pressurized}} by seawater intrusion. While this had been speculated upon for decades, definitive proof was made evident in the 1991-92 period when the Iraqi Army used demolition explosives to break open scores of wells and set them on fire. The wells kept producing oil until capped, demonstrating to the world that natural pressure was causing the oil to flow to the surface, and pressure in nearby Saudi Arabian fields declined until the Burgan wells were capped. If the wells were productive under artificial lift the fires would have <b>self</b> <b>extinguished</b> from lack of fresh oil when the pumps were shut off.|$|R

Chemically, this fire resistant fuel (FRF) was a stable mixture of diesel fuel, 10 percent water, and an emulsifier. The Army FRF program ended in 1987 without fielding this fire resistant fuel formulation. There were both technical and logistical reasons for this. Unconventional warfare experienced in Iraq and Afghanistan involving use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) has led the Army to restart the FRF program {{in an attempt to}} counter the increasing threat of fuel fires. Efforts are now underway to develop new Fire Resistant Fuel to reduce and/or eliminate both the initial mist fireball and any residual pool burning.

All six polyphosphazenes produced were completely characterized, {{four of them}} were furthermore subjected to isothermal gravimetric analysis, smoke density measurements, flammability and oxidative thermal degradation testing. The results of the characterization studies indicate that only low molecular weight oligomers, possibly of a cyclic structure, were obtained in the polymerization reactions. Despite this, however, two of the materials showed no weight loss after 96 hr at 200 C, one did not autoignite at 500 C in air, and all four <b>self</b> <b>extinguished</b> when exposed to a flame as soon as contact between flame and resin was lost.

30|$|Tickings perform {{differently}} in {{the presence or absence}} of fire barrier materials. A majority (~ 80 %) of mattresses with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ticking pass the TB 129 without using a barrier fabric because PVC tickings are active fire barriers with <b>self</b> <b>extinguishing</b> behavior ([Nurbakhsh & Mc Cormack 1998]). Approximately 20 % mattresses with PVC coated ticking fail due to antagonistic reactions of highly plasticized PVC coated fabrics with other components of upholstery. Mattresses with cotton/fiberglass ticking do not require an additional fire barrier material to protect the underlying cushioning layer either. In this case, the cotton/fiberglass ticking acts as a passive fire barrier and physically prevents flame and heat transfer to the underlying cushioning layer. On the other hand, mattresses with cotton ticking certainly require a fire barrier in order to pass the open flame test. This is partly because cotton is extremely flammable and cotton tickings burn with a higher rate of flame spread, thereby exposing underlying cushioning layers to the open flames.|$|E
40|$|Confusion, {{misleading}} terminology and classification Some {{manufacturers of}} insulation boards and sandwich panels use ill-defined terms implying fire safety to their products {{for marketing purposes}} – terms such as inflammable, fireproof, <b>self</b> <b>extinguishing,</b> equivalent to non-combustible, and recently firesafe. To the unwary specifier a term like Firesafe might suggest that the product is inorganic or non-combustible or will not contribute heat or smoke to a developing fire. PIR and phenolic foams may have better fire properties than PUR foam or polystyrene foam (expanded or extruded). However, both PIR and phenolic foams, like all plastics, are derivatives of the petrochemical industry {{and so it is}} not surprising that these materials can, in the event of a fire, contribute to fire. If materials become involved in ‘flashover ’ they can contribute significant amounts of heat, together with toxic smoke; The recently approved product standard for metal faced sandwich panels EN 14509 [1] does not make the distinction between the fire properties of panels any easier.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown {{interest}} in flame retardants containing phosphorus, nitrogen and sul-fur a combination small molecule with a promising new approach in preparing an important class of flame retardant materials. Tetraethyl piperazine- 1, 4 -diyldiphosphonate (TEPP) and O,O,O’,O’-tetramethyl piperazine- 1, 4 -diyldiphosphonothioate (TMPT), based on Piperazine derivatives, were prepared successfully and their structures were proved by means of 1 H, 13 C and 31 P NMR. Cotton twill fabric was treated with both compounds to provide different add-on levels. Thermogravime-tric Analysis (TGA), microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC), vertical and 45 ˚ flame test and li-miting oxygen index (LOI) were performed on the treated cotton fabrics and showed promising results. When the treated twill fabrics (5 wt %- 7 wt % add-ons) were tested using the vertical flammability test (ASTM D 6413 - 11), we observed that the ignited fabrics <b>self</b> <b>extinguished</b> and left behind a streak of char.

30|$|Tickings perform {{differently}} in {{the presence or absence}} of fire barrier materials. A large majority (about 80 %) of mattresses with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ticking pass the high occupancy dwelling open flame test (TB 129) without using a fire barrier material, because PVC tickings are active fire barriers that <b>self</b> <b>extinguish.</b> Approximately 20 % of the mattresses with PVC coated tickings fail due to antagonistic reactions of the highly plasticized PVC coated fabrics with other components of upholstery. Mattresses with cotton/fiberglass tickings also do not require an additional barrier fabric layer to protect the underlying cushioning layer. In this case, the cotton/fiberglass ticking acts as a passive fire barrier that physically prevents flame and heat transfer to the underlying cushioning layer. On the other hand, thermoplastic tickings used in modern residential mattresses do require a fire barrier in order to pass the open flame test. A study (Nurbakhsh & Mc Cormack [1998]) that investigated the effects of cover fabrics and filling materials with and without fire barriers showed that polyester and polyester blend ticking perform poorly in the presence of a barrier material. Furthermore, placement of the barrier in the mattress can be critical to the resulting fire performance. The role of barrier materials is discussed in much greater detail in the following section.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of electrical power in today's automobile {{has led to}} the research and development of a new 42 V standard. One danger at this new voltage is stable electrical arcing. At the higher voltage, stable electric arcs do not <b>self</b> <b>extinguish</b> and can cause damage to the arcing conductors and cause a fire. This work evaluates possible methods to use to detect and stop electrical arcing before any major damage can occur to the vehicle and more importantly to the passengers. Electronic detection is proposed as the best approach. Arcing current of stable and unstable arcs at- 42 V and- 14 V are produced by the rebuilt apparatus of a previous MIT experiment that used a motor controlled mechanical switch to periodically energize a conductor to produce stable and unstable arcs. Fourier analysis is performed on the measured current waveforms to look for arc signatures in the frequency domain. Fourier analysis on the average of ten spectra of stable arcs showed that there were no consistent features universally present in stable arcs. Current waveforms of real electrical loads are also measured using electrical accessories (windows,door locks, seat adjustment, lights, sunroof, CD changer, radiator cooling fan) on an electrically operationa...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} the preparation and characterization of wood polymer nanocomposites based on impregnation of styrene acrylonitrile co-polymer-nanoclay intercalating system in presence of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), a cross linking agent, and vinyl trichloro silane (VTCS) as additives into Simul (Bombex ceiba, L.), a soft wood. The effect of nanoclay and VTCS on {{the properties of}} the resultant wood polymer nanocomposites (WPNC) has been evaluated. FTIR spectroscopy shows the interaction among wood, polymers, GMA, nanoclay and VTCS. The penetration of polymer and nanoclay into the wood cell wall is supported by SEM study.

TGA results show an improvement in the thermostability of the resultant composites. The inclusion of VTCS enhances the <b>self</b> <b>extinguishing</b> behaviour of the WPNC as revealed by limiting oxygen index (LOI) test.

40|$|Abstract—Research on the {{chemical}} modification of cellulosic textiles has been focussed primarily on crosslinking reactions {{during the late}} 1950 's and early 1960 's. During the last decade, emphasis has shifted {{to the study of}} modifications which alter the course of the thermal degradation of cellulose, and more specifically, to the study of compounds, reactions and processes which can be used to decrease flammability in cellulosics. This paper reviews current knowledge on thermal degradation reactions which occur in unmodified cellulose and in cellulose treated with flame retardants as a conceptual framework in which the effectiveness of specific compounds can be interpreted and discussed. In addition to exhibiting flame retardant effectiveness, compounds used for decreasing the flammability of cellulosics must satisfy a large number of other requirements which can only be defined with reference to the substrate, the specific application contemplated, and the level of flame resistance which is to be attained. Highlights of current research in this area are presented, including: recent work on flame retardant compounds used in the manufacture of regenerated cellulose fibers; new reagents and processes for modification of 100 % cotton fabrics by finishing; recent approaches to the complex problem of modifying polyester/cotton blend fabrics for flame resistant (<b>self</b> <b>extinguishing)</b> apparel. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{collaboration}} with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and McMaster University, the authors are investigating the removal of NOx from engine exhaust streams using nonthermal plasmas (NTPs). The near-term experiments focus on measuring temperature distributions and reactive species concentrations in electric discharge NTP reactors using laser induced fluorescence (LIF) and tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS), with first experiments on LIF measurements of OH in a pulsed dielectric-barrier discharge. Because the <b>self</b> <b>extinguishing</b> microdischarges in a conventional (low frequency driven) barrier discharge are both short lived (a few to a few tens of nanoseconds) and randomly distributed in the process volume, {{it is difficult to}} measure the time-varying properties of the species produced by the plasma. To synchronize the plasma ignition with the optical diagnostics, a thyratron switched, high voltage pulse generator has been constructed to drive a small dielectric-barrier plasma cell. A fast rise time thyratron tube is used in a low inductance geometry to deliver a negative high voltage pulse to the cell. The output voltage pulse has a rise time of 6. 5 ns, a peak voltage of 40 kV, and a repetition rate of 20 Hz. A microdischarge streamer occurs between the pin electrode and the glass barrier during the rise time of the voltage pulse. The delay between the input signal and the microdischarge is 250 ns with a jitter of 4 ns, thus allowing repetitive initiation of a microdischarge with low temporal jitter. The energy per pulse is obtained from the voltage and current versus time, v(t) and i(t), measured at the cell. The fast rising pulse also produces a higher E/N at breakdown in the discharge than in conventional NTP cells, which may affect the removal efficiency of pollutants...|$|E

40|$|Flammability {{experiments}} on silicone samples {{were conducted in}} anticipation of the Spacecraft Fire Experiment (Saffire). The sample geometry was chosen to match the NASA 6001 Test 1 specification, namely 5 cm wide by 30 cm tall. Four thicknesses of silicone (0. 25, 0. 36, 0. 61 and 1. 00 mm) were examined. Tests included traditional upward buoyant flame spread using Test 1 procedures, downward opposed flow flame spread, horizontal and angled flame spread, forced flow upward and downward flame spread. In addition to these configurations, upward and downward tests were also conducted in a chamber with varying oxygen concentrations. In the upward buoyant flame spread tests, the flame generally did not burn the entire sample. As thickness was increased, the flame spread distance decreased before flame extinguishment. For the thickest sample, ignition could not be achieved. In the downward tests, the two thinnest samples permitted the flame to burn the entire sample, but the spread rate was lower compared to the corresponding upward values. The other two thicknesses could not be ignited in the downward configuration. The increased flammability for downward spreading flames relative to upward ones is uncommon. The two thinnest samples also burned completely in the horizontal configuration, as well as at angles up to 75 degrees from the horizontal. The upward and downward flammability behavior was compared in atmospheres of varying oxygen concentration to determine a maximum oxygen concentration for each configuration. Upward tests in air with an added forced flow were more flammable. Complementary analyses using SEM and TGA techniques suggest the importance of the silica layer formed on the burned sample surface. As silicone burns upward, silica deposits downstream If the silicone is ignited in the downward configuration, it burns {{the entire length of the}} sample Burning upward at an angle increases the burn length in some cases possibly due to less silica deposition Forced flow in the upward burning case increases flammability, likely due to an increase in convective flow preventing silica from depositing Samples in upward configuration burning under forced flow <b>self</b> <b>extinguish</b> after forced flow is remove...|$|R
40|$|Fire is a {{continuous}} threat {{to life and}} property. The total annual UK fire los 5 {{is estimated to be}} 0. 25 % of its gross domestic product (GDP). (Goddard, 1995). According to fire statistics, more than 12 million fires break out every year in the United States, Europe, Russia, and China killing about 166, 000 people and injuring several hundreds of thousands (Morgan and Wilkie, 2007). Polymers which take up 80 % of the organic chemical industry, are known for their high flammability with the production of heat, corrosive toxic gases, and smoke (Bent, 2010). Improving the fire retardancy of polymeric materials is a major concern and also a major challenge. Nanotechnology could {{have a significant impact on}} polymeric materials through the achievement of polymer nanocomposites (PNs) with enhanced functional properties (Giannelis, 1996, Schartel and Batholmai, 2006). If this can be achieved, there will be an enormous increase in the use of improved flame retardant (FR) PNs in mass transportation, aerospace, and military applications where fire safety will be of utmost importance (Horrocks and Price, 2008). In this research project nanoparticles that could have a synergistic effect with traditional FR systems, or that could have a FR action (nano-fire extinguishers), were formulated and surface modified during continuous hydrothermal synthesis (CHS). The bespoke nanoparticles were developed in a structure that could be easily integrated and effectively dispersed into a polymeric matrix. A solvent blending approach for integrating and dispersing colloidal organic modified nanoparticies into polymeric matrices was developed. The impact of nanoparticles of different morphologies including nanospheres, nanoplates, and nanorods on epoxy mechanical, thermal, and flammability properties was evaluated. A laboratory based technique using a Bunsen, video footage, and image analysis was developed to quantify the nanocomposite's direct flame resistance in a repeatable fashion. A new <b>self</b> <b>extinguishing</b> epoxy nanocomposite was developed which showed an enhanced performance in extreme conditions and with good mechanical properties.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the second step in the project GRUVAN: the site {{inventory}} in operational mines. The main purposes of the inventory are: -          To get {{a clear picture of}} the risks in the different mines. -          To get a clear picture of the protective measures of each mine. -          Optimize the choice of design fires for each mine. The site inventories were conducted through actual visits to the two LKAB mines in Sweden and through e-mail correspondence with LKAB personnel responsible for the different sections and areas. During the inventories, predefined forms for each type of item were used in order to facilitate the work. The following items were examined: -          Combustible materials in general, for example large amounts of wood. -          Vehicles -          Cables -          Fire barriers -          Ventilation systems -          Extinguishing systems   Besides the above items, earlier fires and fire incidents were also examined. As the two LKAB mines are tremendously large with a large amount of equipment etc, only the most common vehicles were listed and examined further. Also, only the sites with the largest amount of cables and other combustible materials were listed.   The following conclusions were made based upon the findings of the inventory: -          With respect to earlier fires and fire incidents for the two LKAB mines, the most common causes and the causes to focus on are: electrical cause, flammable liquid or material on hot surface, hot works and equipment running hot. -          Both the production area and the infrastructure part should be regarded in the future studies as fires are almost identically frequent in both areas. -          When it comes to combustible material in general, the amount of combustibles seems to be more frequent in the Malmberget mine. In the Kiruna mine, the places with wood and conveyor belts seems to be interesting enough for further investigation. Even though <b>self</b> <b>extinguishing</b> conveyor belts means a limited fire in size, the amount of smoke emitted can be quite extensive. Also the storage of tyres at the contractor’s depots could be worthwhile investigating due to the sensitive surroundings. -          Regarding the Malmberget mine, the sites with wood combustibles, tyres and conveyor belts are all interesting for further investigation due to the large amount of combustibles and the surroundings. -          With respect to flammable liquids: - The tank stations in the Kiruna and the Malmberget mine should be looked          into with respect to potential pool fires. - The larger workshops and warehouses in the Kiruna mine and the Malmberget     mine should also be investigated with respect to pool fires. - The crusher levels and draw points in the two mines should be investigated          with respect to spray fires. - The diesel tanks in the main ramps and the production areas should be investigated with respect to pool fires. - The media drifts, distribution levels, shaft hoisting levels and pumping stations    should be investigated with respect to pool fires. -          With respect to fire barriers, as the main ramps of each mine does not contain any fire barriers the impact of a vehicle fire in the main ramp would be interesting to investigate. It would also be interesting to validate the ventilation strategy in the Malmberget mine regarding preventing smoke spread to adjacent compartments. -          With respect to vehicles, all the common heavy vehicles listed in this report would be worthwhile to try to reconstruct a possible fire scenario for each type of vehicle. The reason for this is to have better tools when working on possible scenarios of each mine. -          Regarding cables, all listed sites with a high load of electrical cables would be interesting to investigate. Even though the immediate surroundings are not sensitive, an extensive smoke spread would make a large impact on {{a large portion of the}} mine. -          When looking into the ventilation system of the Kiruna mine, both the mine production area and the infrastructure part should be investigated due to the differences in each system and their surroundings. Also, the difference in systems whether you are below or above level 775 should be considered. The function and impact of oversteering should also be included in the investigations. -          The impact of a ventiflex PVC-tube being burned up on the fire behaviour in a production area should be investigated. The different fire scenarios in a production area depending on the position of the fire with respect to the ventilation should also be investigated. -          One scenario should put the fire right at the end of the intake air tube, other scenarios should be at a certain length interval from the end of the intake air tube. The likelihood of the power cables to the intake and exhaust air fans being burned off should be looked into. The impact on the surroundings should also be investigated. The return air fan capacity should be examined with respect to fires, such as vehicle fires. GRUVA...|$|E
