5|$|The main {{short-term}} {{danger to}} Enron's survival {{at the end}} of October 2001 seemed to be its credit rating. It was reported at the time that Moody's and Fitch, two of the three biggest credit-rating agencies, had slated Enron for review for possible downgrade. Such a downgrade would force Enron to issue millions of <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> to cover loans it had guaranteed, which would decrease the value of existing stock further. Additionally, all manner of companies began reviewing their existing contracts with Enron, especially in the long term, in the event that Enron's rating were lowered below investment grade, a possible hindrance for future transactions.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} evident that, {{contrary}} to some rumors, Norton {{had died in}} complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single gold sovereign, then worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of headgear (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master); an 1828 French franc; {{and a handful of}} the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> in a defunct gold mine.|$|E
5|$|The Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike Road Company was {{initially}} financed through 800 <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> valued at $20 each. Under {{the text of}} the act establishing the entity, only one toll gate was permitted on the turnpike. The toll charged at the gate varied by person; the exact amount was based on the vehicle used and the number of livestock and horses that were brought onto the roadway. By 1920, the turnpike company ceased to exist and the state of New York had plans in place to improve the portion of the turnpike west of the hamlet of East Whitehall. The improved road would be part of a state highway extending from the village of Whitehall to the Vermont state line at Fair Haven, Vermont. The contract for the project was awarded on April5, 1921, and the highway was completed by 1926.|$|E

5|$|Banking {{operations}} in Hampshire County ceased throughout {{the duration of}} the American Civil War, and a new banking institution was not established in Romney until 1888. By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling 30,000 USD. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The bank initially used a safe as its bank vault and security for the bank was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank office's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's residency at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president. The Bank of Romney began to outgrow its spaces {{on the first floor of}} the Wirgman Building almost immediately after its incorporation, and in 1906 it moved across Main Street to a new bank building.|$|E

40|$|Through a short sale, {{a person}} borrows a <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> from a lender, sells the {{borrowed}} share {{to a third}} person at the current price, and purchases an identical share in the market at a future date and at a future price to replace the borrowed <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock.</b> This only makes sense if the short seller anticipates a downward trend in share price. The short seller incurs a gain if share price decreases because the cost of replacing the borrowed share falls below the selling price. The reverse is true in an ordinary sale, where a person owning a <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> incurs a loss if price decreases because the selling price falls below the basis or acquisition cost. Therefore, when a taxpayer simultaneously owns a <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and short sells an identical stock, any gain in an ordinary sale <b>of</b> the owned <b>stock</b> is offset by a corresponding loss in the short sale of the borrowed identical stock, vice versa. This offsetting effect, in turn, creates an unexpected tax deferral opportunity abused in other jurisdictions and which remains unregulated in the Philippine tax system...|$|R
