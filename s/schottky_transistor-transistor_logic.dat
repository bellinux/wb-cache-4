40|$|A {{selection}} switch {{with high}} isolation between RF signal input terminals is achieved with a gated Schmitt trigger circuit feeding into a control NAND gate in each signal switching channel. The control NAND {{gates of the}} separate signal channels are coupled to an output terminal by a single NAND gate. The schmitt trigger circuits and all gates are implemented with <b>Schottky</b> <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic</b> circuits having input clamping diodes. Each Schmitt trigger circuit includes two cascaded NAND gates and a feedback isolation Schottky diode between one input terminal connected to receive an RF input and another input terminal connected to receive a feedback signal from {{the second of the}} two cascaded NAND gates. Both NAND gates of the Schmitt trigger circuits are enabled by the same switch control signal which enables the control gates...|$|E

50|$|Diode-transistor logic (DTL) is a {{class of}} digital {{circuits}} that is the direct ancestor of <b>transistor-transistor</b> <b>logic.</b> It is called so because the logic gating function (e.g., AND) is performed by a diode network and the amplifying function is performed by a transistor (in contrast with RTL and TTL).|$|R

50|$|IBM {{referred}} to PALM as a microprocessor, though they used that term {{to mean a}} processor that executes microcode to implement a higher-level instruction set, rather than its conventional definition of a complete processor on a single silicon integrated circuit.
