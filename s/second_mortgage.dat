5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E

Florida law Sections 201.02 and 201.031 authorizes counties to levy the surtax on documents that transfer interest on real property, with an exemption for single-family residences.

40|$|Since the {{beginnings}} of the eighties house prices in the Netherlands haveincreased steadily and considerably. In this paper we study the effect of this developmenton the demand for <b>second</b> <b>mortgages</b> and on the savings of Dutch households. We use the dataof the Dutch socio-economic panel for the years 1987 - 1994. These data contain self-reportedvalues of the houses of owner- occupiers, which are shown to correspond to the median salesprices provided by the Dutch Association of Realtors. Households therefore seem to be wellaware of the increase in the value of their house. We use panel data methods to investigatethe effect of house prices on (i) the number and size of <b>second</b> <b>mortgages,</b> (ii) the savingsof owner-occupiers and (iii) the savings of renters that may be considered as would-beowners. We find a significant effect of home equity on the demand for <b>second</b> <b>mortgages.</b> Savings of homeowners decrease when house prices accelerate. We find no evidence that inc!reased demand for mortgage loans is caused by substitution from other forms of consumercredit. Contrary to results reported in the literature, we find no evidence of an increasein savings of would-be owners caused by higher house prices.

25|$|Wild Oats was co-founded in 1986 by {{husband and}} wife team Mike Gilliland and Libby Cook in 1987 in Boulder, Colorado. Originally {{purchasing}} a convenience store, which they bought with cash advances on 17 credit cards and a <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> on Gilliland's mother's house, the pair decided to buy a natural foods market, Crystal Market, which they felt would prosper in health-conscious Boulder. The $300,000 purchase, completed in 1987, thrust the couple into an environment {{quite different from the}} junk-food focus of convenience stores, an environment that gradually persuaded Gilliland and Cook to become healthy eaters themselves. In that first store, Gilliland worked the counter, while Cook worked the deli. Soon, the couple had opened another natural foods store, {{on the south side of}} Boulder, called Wild Oats Community Market. As the Wild Oats business expanded, a holding company was formed, and Gilliland became chief executive officer and president, while Cook became vice-president and in-house attorney.|$|E

40|$|Quality {{problems}} that are known to the seller of a product, but will become known to the buyer only after the purchase {{have the potential to}} frustrate voluntary exchanges. Where the determination of quality after the sale is cut-and-dried, brand names and unconditional guarantees will bond contract performance. When the problem is more subtle or confounded by the extent of consumer inputs, requiring risk-sharing by the contracting parties, these bonding devices typically are not sufficient. Under the circumstances, seller financing may be an efficient contracting solution for bonding the quality dimension of the contract. This form of financing makes both the buyer and the seller share the risk that the product may not suit the buyer’s needs in the way promised by the seller. This paper provides further empirical evidence on the quality assurance role of seller financing. We consider seller-financed <b>second</b> <b>mortgages</b> in the National Association of Realtors database. Seller financing in <b>second</b> <b>mortgages</b> may be a supplement to first mortgages supplied by conventional lenders. The role of seller financing as a quality assurance mechanism in <b>second</b> <b>mortgages</b> is more complex than its role in first mortgages, but is also less subject to an alternative interpretation of credit rationing than is its role in seller-financed first mortgages. To avoid further complexities, we do not consider second seller financing transactions that supplement first assumption mortgage transactions. Dogan Tirtiroglu and David N. Laban...|$|R
25|$|The {{duty of care}} owed by {{trustees}} and fiduciaries has its partner in the common law of negligence, and was also long recognised by courts of equity. Millett LJ, however, in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew emphasised that although recognised in equity, and applicable to fiduciaries, the duty of care is not itself a fiduciary duty, like the rule against conflicts of interest. This means that like ordinary negligence actions, the common law requirements for proving causation of loss apply, and the remedy for breach of duty is of compensation for losses rather than restitution of gains. In Mothew this meant that a solicitor (who occupies a fiduciary position, like a trustee) who negligently told a building society that its client had no <b>second</b> <b>mortgage</b> was not liable for the loss in the property's value after the client defaulted. Mr Mothew successfully argued that Bristol & West would have granted the loan in any case, and so his advice did not cause their loss.|$|E
