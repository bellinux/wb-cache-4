40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the protein requirements for the growth of intact male, female, and castrated male Saanen goats weighing 30 to 45 kg of body weight (BW) and to compare estimates of the protein requirements for maintenance (NPm) by the comparative slaughter and nitrogen balance techniques. To determine the maintenance requirements, 55 goats were assigned in a split-plot design using a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement (three sexes and three dry matter intake (DMI) levels). A linear regression of retained N (as measured by the <b>slaughter</b> <b>technique</b> and estimated from the nitrogen balance) on N intake on a daily basis was used to calculate the net protein for maintenance. The net protein requirement for weight gain (NPg) was obtained using 65 goats fed ad libitum in a completely randomized design. The first derivative of the allometric equation of protein content in the empty BW with respect to the empty BW yielded estimates of the NPg. According to the comparative <b>slaughter</b> <b>technique,</b> the estimated NPm was 1. 46 g/kg of metabolic weight, which is 50 % lower than the estimate from the nitrogen balance technique. When evaluating the variance of the error, the nitrogen balance also showed greater values, indicating less precision compared with that of the comparative <b>slaughter</b> <b>technique.</b> The daily NPg ranged from 155. 7 ± 10. 9 to 153. 4 ± 13. 5 g/kg of EBW gain for growing Saanen goats. The protein requirements (NPm and NPg) of intact male, female, and castrated male Saanen goats are similar, from 30 to 45 kg BW, in accordance with current feeding systems. Moreover, the results of the present study indicate that the estimate of NPm using the comparative <b>slaughter</b> <b>technique</b> is more precise and lower than that using the N balance technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} crude protein requirements for broiler breeder pullets, using the factorial method. The protein requirements for maintenance were obtained by comparative <b>slaughter</b> <b>technique</b> and also by nitrogen balance technique, as usual.

The {{techniques were}}: ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA), cannulation at the distal ileum and a <b>slaughter</b> <b>technique.</b> A standard diet and three diets in which 20 % of the standard diet was substituted with either skim milk powder (SMP), fish meal or roasted full-fat soya beans (FFS) were used. Piglets were weaned at 21 days of age, and the respective diets were fed in 24 equal hourly portions per day from days 29 - 37. Ileal digesta was collected from day 33 - 37 in IRA and cannulated piglets. Piglets used for the <b>slaughter</b> <b>technique</b> were killed at 37 days of age and ileal digesta was collected. Chromium in oxide was used as an indigestible marker with all three techniques. Although AID means did not differ (p > 0. 05) between the different techniques, the cannulation technique resulted in the lowest variation (standard error of the mean) of all treatments (8. 2 vs 13. 7 and 14. 1 for the slaughter and IRA-techniques respectively). AID means obtained using the cannula technique were 1. 8 percentage units higher for the SMP diet than values obtained using the other techniques (83. 2 versus 81. 4 %), and up to 9. 3 percentage units higher for the FFS diet (75. 4 versus 66. 1 %). Growth data suggested that the cannulation technique caused less trauma for the piglets than the IRA-technique. IRA-piglets had not yet regained their initial weaning weight by 37 days of age, while the other piglets gained weight over the trial period. The cannulation technique is the most attractive method for use with piglets in terms of the lower variation in digestibility values. Practical aspects such as ease of handling and sampling, surgical trauma and piglet stress, are also important and contribute to the selection of the cannula technique as the most appropriate.

40|$|In Belgium and {{in several}} European countries, two cattle {{slaughtering}} protocols exist: the classical method, that encompasses a stunning step before the sticking procedure, and the halal method, combining the stunning and the sticking in one single step. The main difference {{lies in the fact}} that, in the halal protocol, a single cut with a sharp knife is practiced directly on live cattle, instead of two cutting steps with two different knives for the sticking in the classical <b>slaughtering</b> <b>technique.</b> The unique section in the halal technique results generally in the cross section of trachea and esophagus of cattle. The aim {{of this study was to}} seek if the two <b>slaughtering</b> <b>techniques</b> were similar regarding the superficial contamination of carcasses, swabbed between 2 and 4 hours after the killing step. For this purpose, classical microbiological tests (TVC and Enterobacteriaceae) and 16 S rDNA metagenetic analysis were carried out from 20 cattle carcasses (swabbing of “legal” zone – 1. 600 cm 2 – and in the neck area – 200 cm 2). The classical microbiological results revealed no significant differences between the two slaughtering practices. Statistical analysis of pyrosequencing data showed that differences in bacterial population abundance between slaughtering methods were mainly found in the “legal” swabbing zone compared to the neck area. Bacterial genera belonging to Actinobacteria (Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium) were more aundant in “Halal” samples whereas populations from the Proteobacteria (Caulobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae) and Firmicutes (Lactobacillus) were more abundand in the “classical” group. The analysis of OTU abundance of bacteria from the digestive or respiratory tract revealed no differences beteween groups. In conclusion, the slaughtering method does not influence the superficial microbiological pattern in terms of specific microbiological markers of the digestive or respiratory tract. However, precise analysis to the genus level underlines differences between methods, the legal swabbing zone being still the best sampling zone compared to the neckline. The next step will be the identification of precise contamination origin of the differences found between slaughtering methods. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The estimates of body composition per kg EBW for the animals from 15 to 25 kg were: 0. 591 and 0, 578 g for Mg: 2. 914 and 2. 776 g for K 1. 830 and 1. 637 g for Na; and the net requirements for kg weight gain were: 0. 515 and 0. 503 g for Mg: 2. 408 and 2. 294 g for K; 1. 315 and 1. 177 g for Na, respectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} studies were {{conducted}} using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure energy and protein deposition in pigs. In an initial validation study DXA was compared directly with slaughter analysis as a method for measuring energy deposition in pigs. During growth from 30 to 60 kg the mean value for carcass energy deposition measured by DXA was 251 MJ compared to 249 MJ by chemical analysis (R 2 = 0. 94). Subsequently it was shown that both compensatory growth {{and the addition of}} ractopamine to the diet resulted in an improvement in efficiency of protein deposition (PE), however, ractopamine also resulted in a reduction in the efficiency of energy deposition (k g). Another study was conducted to compare the efficiency of utilization of dietary energy and protein by control and IGF-I transgenic pigs in response to dietary conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Addition of CLA to the diet resulted in a reduction in k g, though {{there was no difference in}} k g based on genotype or sex. The PE was higher (P< 0. 05) in the IGF-I transgenic pigs. DXA was also used to assess energy deposition in pigs that were either homozygous stress non-sensitive (NN), heterozygous (Nn) or homozygous stress sensitive (nn). During growth from 30 to 60 kg or 60 to 90 kg there were no differences in the efficiency of either energy or protein deposition. In conclusion, DXA can be used to replace the comparative <b>slaughter</b> <b>technique</b> for measuring energy and protein deposition in pigs, thus this approach is useful for identifying differences in energy and protein deposition in pigs of different genotypes or when subjected to various dietary treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} to determine body composition and calcium and phosphorus requirements of Santa Ines lambs. Eighteen entire male lambs with average initial live weight of 15 kg were used. The animals were allotted to three groups: six animals were slaughtered {{at the beginning of}} the experiment, to access the amount of calcium and phosphorus present in the body, as reference animals for the comparative <b>slaughter</b> <b>technique.</b> Six animals were ad libitum fed and six were restrict fed (maintenance level plus 20 %). The animals ad libitum and restrict fed started the experimental period by pairs and they were both slaughtered when the first reached 25 kg body weight. The body composition was estimated through the prediction equations obtained by regression of the logarithm of the amount of calcium and phosphorus in the empty body on the logarithm of the empty body weight. Net requirements for calcium and phosphorus for maintenance and the absorption coefficient were obtained through the correlation between the amount of each mineral consumed and retained in the animal body. The net requirements maintenance for live weight gain were obtained by means of derivation of the prediction of body composition equations. The net requirements maintainance of calcium and phosphorus for animals from 15 to 25 kg body weight were: 305 mg Ca/day and 325 mg P/day and net requirements for kg of the body weight gain for animals with 15 and 25 kg LW were 11. 41 and 10. 33 g Ca and 5. 72 and 4. 94 g P, respectively. The absorption coefficients were estimated to be. 44 and 0. 55 for Ca and P, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Growth {{rates of}} Boer goats were {{generally}} lower than sheep and, under favorable nutritional conditions, weight gains {{of more than}} 200 g per day were obtained, against values of up to 176 g per day under extensive subtropical conditions. Lactation and pregnancy had a marked effect on ME intake, and the latter had an improved feed conversion ratio (6. 06 kg/kg) in comparison to that of virgin does (10. 96 kg/kg). Below 6 % crude protein in the diet, feed intake is reduced and has negative effects on birth weights, growth and milk production. Little information is available on mineral requirements of goats. The carcass of Boer goats is generally leaner, less compact and has different carcass proportions than sheep. The relatively high collagen contents with lower solubility of Boer goat meat, has meant that the eating quality has been regarded as inferior to that of Iamb and mutton. Breeding holds the key to improving tenderness of goat meat; different <b>slaughtering</b> <b>techniques</b> {{can be used as}} well. Boer goats have high potential as meat animals when yielding three kid crops in 2 years and when fed to gain more than 200 g/day...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} study regarding the effects of Kosher and conventional <b>slaughter</b> <b>techniques</b> on carcass and meat quality of cattle, it was speculated that electrical stimulation may have affected some of the meat qualities. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to investigate the effects of electrical stimulation (ES) and non-electrical stimulation (NES) on key carcass and meat quality attributes of cattle slaughtered by Kosher vs. conventional slaughter methods. Carcass pH and temperature profiles over a 24 h post mortem (pm) period, meat shear force and water holding capacity were investigated in feedlot type cattle of comparable weights and breed types. Results showed that the combined effects of slaughter methods did not influence the meat quality attributes, but there were differences within the slaughter groups. The effect of ES on carcass pH lasted longer within the conventionally slaughtered group (12 h), than in the Kosher slaughter group (6 h). Muscle samples from the ES groups for both slaughter methods were more tender. Electrical stimulation also had a significant effect on the cooking loss from Kosher meat, while there was no significant difference in meat from the conventional slaughter methods. The results show that ES influences certai...|$|R
