This paper considers the problem of deterrence and finds that tournaments reflect special circumstances that are not present in a traditional model of law enforcement. The traditional model considers <b>sanctions</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> as the instruments of deterrence.

Nevertheless, if Member States choose mandatory and binding processes, this may be compatible with the fundamental right to judicial protection, if emphasis is placed on efficiency benefits. If they choose voluntary processes/non-binding decisions, success will depend partly on incentives, <b>sanctions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> at EU and Member State levels...|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} {{are using the}} strategy of international recruitment {{to make up for}} shortages of health professionals to the detriment of health systems in the poorest parts of the world. This study reviewed the potential impact of eight national level and international codes of practice or similar instruments that are being introduced to encourage ethical recruitment in order to protect these countries. Whilst effective dissemination of the instruments is generally in place, support systems, incentives and <b>sanctions</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems necessary for effective implementation and sustainability are currently weak or have not been planned. If such codes or instruments are to be used to protect developing country health systems, lessons should be learnt from the early adopters; the focus of protecting developing country health systems needs to be emphasised in instruments with multiple objectives; the process of implementing the instruments strengthened; and internal and external pressure needs to be increased to ensure the codes and instruments lead to ethical recruitment and help to protect developing country health systems.

40|$|Instead of {{a tragedy}} of the commons {{occurring}} in which resources used in common are degraded over time as individuals act in their own self-interest, many scholars have shown that these common resources can be successfully managed {{through a process of}} collective action. This study examines the conditions required for sustainable collective action in urban community gardens, as a community garden is a resource used in common by local people. The research takes a comparative case study approach by investigating seven community gardens in the UK. The data collection method used was interviews and documentation analysis. The results of the research were compared to a conceptual model for successful collective action developed in light of the theoretical propositions put forward in the literature. This conceptual model was derived from the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. The results of this research showed that five of the seven case studies can be classified as sustainable and durable collective action whilst two of the cases were analysed as unsuccessful. The picture across the case studies was highly complex, no one case study was completely in line with the theory as different variables were present in different cases. Some of the findings were largely in line with the theoretical propositions however in two of the case studies the conditions of appropriations rules, <b>sanctions</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> were not sufficiently apparent; yet these cases still clearly demonstrated successful collective action contrary to the theory. The principle conclusions that can be drawn are as follows: not all the design principle conditions are required to be present for successful collective action to be achieved; common understanding, leadership, trust and knowledge are all important variables for successful collective action although size and homogeneity {{do not appear to be}} significant...|$|E

40|$|This book brings {{together}} {{a collection of}} essays by leading criminologists to explore the relationship between the private sector and criminal justice. The private sector has become an increasingly important ‘partner’ in contemporary criminal justice with the unprecedented growth of public sector ‘outsourcing’ arrangements. This has resulted in an increasingly pluralised and marketised landscape of contemporary criminal justice. This edited collection examines these developments in different jurisdictions as well as {{in a wide range of}} criminal justice contexts and sectors including: the private security sector, policing, prisons, probation <b>and</b> community <b>sanctions,</b> <b>and</b> electronic <b>monitoring.</b> In so doing, it addresses fundamental normative, ideological and ethical debates about the role of the private sector within this new and evolving landscape, as well as descriptive and analytical questions about how criminal justice structures, agencies and processes function and with what effect. The Private Sector and Criminal Justice is essential reading for scholars and students of criminology, penology, policing, security, criminal justice and organisational and management studies. It is also an invaluable resource for criminal justice practitioners. [Book Synopsis...|$|R

The success of an institution is assessed from the best services for users. Circulation desk is often regarded as the spearhead of library services, for the first time dealing with users and the most frequently used. Therefore, the performance of service personnel circulation can affect the performance of libraries in general. This observation was conducted to determine how performance of service personnel circulation. Types of observations made is descriptive qualitative. Source of data was obtained through informant, event or activity location and documents. Data collection a technique was used interviews with the informant or informants, observation and use of documents, books or records as treated with the problem being observed. From the result of observation can be concluded that the activity in the circulation desk in the Office of Archives and Library Region of Wonogiri Regency, as follows: member registration, loan process, the extension of the loan period, the process of return, penalties or fines, circulation services system that is used is to use a service system open, which is a way of freeing visitors visited the library collection, they can immediately choose, look at books, and pick it up yourself.

40|$|In Indonesia, the Ministry of Health has set an Exclusive Breast Feeding [EBF] {{target of}} 80 %, which is {{considered}} asunrealistic, especially where the current trend of EBF is showing a decline. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the implementation and the policy of EBF and Early Initiation of breastfeeding (EI) in Indonesia based on existing studies. The policy, as stated in Kepmenkes No. 237 / 1997, PP No. 69 / 1999, and Kepmenkes No. 450 / 2004, was analysed using content, context, process and actor models, and triangulated by an advocacy coalition framework. Review on implementation shows that EBF practice in Indonesia is still very low and midwives have not been facilitating EI optimally. Policies on EBF are not complete and not comprehensive. EI has not been included explicitly and several aspects of policy content should have been updated. The advocacy coalition framework analysis confirms the findings of earlier analysis by emphasizing weaknesses in the external system as well as policy sub-system in the development of EBF policy. It is suggested to update and renew the existing EBF policy as to be more relevant in terms of content, context, process, and actor. An EBF policy should always include an Early Initiation component. The new policy should also include <b>sanction,</b> reward, <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> evaluation to strengthen the implementation of the policy in community...|$|R

40|$|Illegal {{fishing is}} a serious problem that threatens the {{sustainability}} of fisheries around the world. Historically, fisheries managers have attempted to increase the costs of illegal fishing through imposition of stricter <b>sanctions</b> <b>and</b> improvements to <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> enforcement programs. Non-monetary factors also influence illegal fishing behaviors, and failing to address them can undermine the efficacy of an otherwise well-designed fishery management system. Furthermore, in many of the world’s fisheries, strong <b>and</b> reliable <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> enforcement has proven to be an elusive goal. In such cases, interventions designed to address the social, moral, and cognitive drivers of illegal behavior can potentially supplement conventional deterrence methods. Building on insights from the behavioral sciences, we developed a process for designing interventions aimed at strengthening social incentives and psychological motivations for complying with fishery regulations. This process begins with an in-depth stakeholder characterization exercise. Potential interventions that may disrupt undesirable beliefs, norms, and modes of thinking, along with those that encourage behaviors that support the objectives of the fishery, are then developed. Experimental testing is conducted prior to piloting and, finally, scaling of the resulting intervention(s). We are currently applying this process in a catch share fishing community in the Upper Gulf of California, Mexico, where illegal fishing is a pervasive problem that jeopardizes the sustainability of the region’s fisheries, as well as the wellbeing of the community members who depend on them. The results of this research can inform management design to more effectively meet the environmental and social objectives of the region. ...|$|R

In particular, if the returns to search decline during unemployment, e. g. because of human capital depreciation, it is (ceteris paribus) optimal to increase the monitoring intensity with increasing unemployment duration. Based on a simulation I further characterize optimal <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanction</b> systems as a function of worker characteristics, unemployment duration, monitoring costs, wage dispersion and labor market conditions...|$|R
