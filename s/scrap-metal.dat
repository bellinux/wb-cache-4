50|$|By the 1960s, {{the larger}} {{container}} ships could not navigate the River Avon {{to enter the}} Royal Edward, necessitating {{the need for the}} planning of the construction of the Royal Portbury Dock on the south bank. Whilst much of the former warehousing was redeveloped as residential housing, the residual quays were redeveloped for new cargos. Today these range from the export of <b>scrap-metals,</b> dredged aggregates, vegetable oil and domestic coal; with regional container services from and to Ireland, Europe and Scandinavia, all linked to the rail network via the Henbury Loop Line.|$|R

50|$|Once {{vehicles}} in a wrecking yard {{have no more}} usable parts, the hulks are usually sold to a <b>scrap-metal</b> processor, who will usually crush the bodies on-site at the yard's premises using a mobile baling press, shredder, or flattener, with final disposal occurring within a hammer mill which smashes the vehicle remains into fist-sized chunks. These chunks are then sold by multiple tons for further processing and recycling.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} that <b>scrap-metal</b> hunters have found the dumpsite {{previously}} {{as many of the}} locomotives have been partially gas-cut to allow access to their copper inner fireboxes and bronze bearings. This has often dictated what engines can be salvaged from the dumpsite. Since the final dumpings took place, the Invercargill city council has constructed a stop-bank near the dumpsite, allowing easier access by enthusiasts to the locomotives.|$|E

50|$|Despite these {{reversals}} of his prior statements, he steadfastly {{and repeatedly}} continued to deny to the Commission {{that he had}} received any financial compensation from Barmat. However, in early February, {{only a few days}} after the testimony, the Lokal-Anzeiger reprinted a letter from Barmat to Bauer as a part of an article on the scandal. This letter was written during the period of their 1923 commission dispute over the <b>scrap-metal</b> deal, and identified the occasions on which Bauer had received money from Barmat.|$|E

Unwilling to return to New York right away, Savannah eventually begins a sordid affair with Jake despite their backgrounds.

However, the prideful Jake repeatedly refuses because he makes sculptures out of principle rather than for money.|$|E
50|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} his work had diversified to include {{paintings}} and recycled found-object sculptures. His yard and adjacent abandoned lots {{near his home}} became an immersive art environment that was celebrated by visitors from the art world, but threatened by <b>scrap-metal</b> scavengers and eventually, by {{the expansion of the}} Birmingham International Airport.

He rejected the airport authority's offer to buy the property at the market rate of $14,000, knowing that his site-specific installation had personal and artistic value he demanded $250,000. The dispute went to probate court and in 1997 a settlement was reached and the airport authority paid $165,700 to move Holley's family and work to a larger property in Harpersville, Alabama.|$|E
