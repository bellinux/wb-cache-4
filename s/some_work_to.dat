25|$|As {{demand for}} silver {{increased}} and large-scale manufacturing techniques emerged, silver products {{became much more}} standardized. For special-order objects that would likely only be made once, silversmiths generally used lost-wax casting, in which a sculpted object was carved out of wax, an investment casting was made, and the wax was melted away. The molds produced in this manner could only be used once, which made them inconvenient for standard objects like handles and buckles. Permanent mold casting, an industrial casting technique focused on high-volume production, allowed smiths to reuse molds to make exact replicas {{of the most commonly}} used items they sold. In creating these molds and developing standardized manufacturing processes, silversmiths could begin delegating <b>some</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> apprentices and journeymen. For instance, after 1780, Paul Revere's sons took on more significant roles in his shop, and his silver pieces often included wooden handles made by carpenters more experienced with woodwork. For even some of the most successful artisans like Revere, artisan was not a profitable enterprise compared to mass-production using iron or bronze casting. Creating products that could be replicated for multiple customers, adopting new business practices and labor policies, and new equipment made manufacturing more ultimately efficient. These changes, in tandem with new techniques and requirements defined by changing social standards, led to the introduction of new manufacturing techniques in Colonial America that preceded and anticipated the industrial revolution.|$|E
500|$|The {{first session}} was on 26 February, {{three of the}} first songs—fully {{recorded}}—attempted during the session were [...] "Baby Lemonade", [...] "Maisie" [...] and [...] "Gigolo Aunt". However, Gilmour thought they were losing the [...] "Barrett-ness". After [...] "Baby Lemonade" [...] was attempted, 2 takes of [...] "Maisie" [...] were recorded before Barrett went into 15 takes of [...] "Gigolo Aunt". The next day, two-track demos of [...] "Wolfpack", [...] "Waving My Arms in the Air", [...] "Living Alone" [...] and [...] "Bob Dylan Blues", were recorded. The former two {{made it to the}} album; the latter two didn't. On the recording sheet, it lists Gilmour as having taken home a copy of the latter two, Gilmour later returned and took the master tapes too. Gilmour has since said [...] "Those sessions were done so quickly. We were rushing to gigs every day and had to fit recording sessions in between. I probably took it away to have a listen and simply forgot to take it back. It wasn't intended to be a final mix. Syd knocked it off, I took a tape home." [...] Despite some minor work made to [...] "Gigolo Aunt", Barrett wouldn't return to Abbey Road Studios until 1 April, due to Pink Floyd working on their 1970 album, Atom Heart Mother. On various occasions, Barrett would [...] "spy" [...] on the band as they recorded the album. Again, Barrett recorded <b>some</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> a song, [...] "Wolfpack," [...] on the 3rd, before the sessions were postponed until 5 June, this time due to Gilmour and Wright going on tour in the US with Pink Floyd.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 September, two {{companies}} of the 2/16th crossed the Umi. After dusk, {{the rest of}} the 21st Infantry Brigade followed, crossing in five rubber rafts. The jeeps and light guns were dragged across the Umi, leaving three behind to form a shuttle service that moved stores from Kaiapit. They were taken across the river and thence to a dump at Sagarak. By the morning of 30 September, all the stores were across the river. The track became impassable about [...] beyond Sagerak, requiring <b>some</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> be done to improve it. The airstrip at Sagerak was put to use, with four more jeeps and trailers, and some supplies flown in. Vasey also flew in, bringing new, written orders for an advance on Gusap. By this time, Herring knew that {{the rest of the}} Japanese 20th Division was on the Rai Coast and not in the Marawasa area, so Vasey was opposed only by its 78th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
2500|$|After stumps, with Australia at 4/254, Ponting {{was happy}} with his performance, [...] "I'm as pleased with that innings as I {{probably}} have been with any innings I've ever played," [...] he said. [...] "I'd played eight Tests here before with a highest score of 60, so I had <b>some</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> do. I had a point to prove to a few people as well. It was satisfying today." [...] I've been working really hard," [...] Ponting said on his technique. [...] "I've {{made no secret of}} it, my record here has been poor. Today is one step in the right direction. It was nice to get some runs out there and put the team in a good position. But one innings doesn't make a tour. The other tours I've had here, apart from the last Test I played, I've batted at six, always coming in against spin and when the wicket has worn. One thing that stands out in my career is whenever I've been in early, with the team in a bit of trouble, I've managed to make runs." ...|$|E
