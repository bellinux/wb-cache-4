2500|$|A more {{efficient}} {{alternative to a}} <b>shunt</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> is an active voltage regulator circuit. [...] An active regulator employs reactive components to store and discharge energy, so that most or all current supplied by the rectifier is passed to the load. It may also use negative and positive feedback in conjunction {{with at least one}} voltage amplifying component like a transistor to maintain output voltage when source voltage drops. [...] The input filter must prevent the troughs of the ripple dropping below the minimum voltage required by the regulator to produce the required output voltage. [...] The regulator serves both to significantly reduce the ripple and to deal with variations in supply and load characteristics.|$|E

The resistor R1 supplies the Zener current [...] as well as the load current IR2 (R2 is the load). R1 can be calculated as , where [...] is the Zener voltage, and IR2 is the required load current.|$|E

2500|$|A more usual {{alternative}} to additional filter components, if the DC load requires very low ripple voltage, {{is to follow}} the input filter with a <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator.</b> [...] A <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> operates on a different principle than a filter, which is essentially a <b>voltage</b> divider that <b>shunts</b> <b>voltage</b> at the ripple frequency away from the load. [...] Rather, a regulator increases or decreases current supplied to the load {{in order to maintain}} a constant output voltage.|$|R

40|$|Initial {{testing and}} {{commissioning}} of two high power klystrons (TH 2103 D) and gyrotron (VGA 8000 A 19) {{have been carried out}} at our Institute. Each of the klystrons is capable of delivering 500 kW at 3. 7 GHz, to be used for non-inductive lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) in the Steady State Superconducting Tokamak (SST- 1). The gyrotron is capable of delivering 200 KW at 28 GHz, for breakdown and electron cyclotron resonant heating (ECRH) experiments on Aditya tokamak. The potential appearing at the anode point with respect to the cathode will turn-ON, turn-OFF and control the beam current. Thus these anode modulator power supplies control the out put power of the devices. Main input for both the power supplies is derived from the cathode power supply. A - 2 kV bias power supply is connected between the modulator output and anode terminal to suppress dark current. The output pulse duration is adjustable from 50 msec. to 1000 sec. by the control system. The oil cooled tetrode YU 155 is used as <b>shunt</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> in the klystron anode modulator power supply. A potential divider is made with the tetrode as a series element. It operates in its linear range and a variable voltage is available at the klystron anode by varying the impedance of the tetrode. © IEE...|$|E

40|$|An {{ultra-low}} area, current efficient <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> {{appropriate for}} distributed point-of-load voltage regulation in high performance integrated circuits (ICs) {{is described in}} this paper. The proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> is a hybrid combination of a switching <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> and a linear <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator.</b> The <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> can supply over 100 mA current while generating 0. 9 volts from a 1. 2 input voltage. The current efficiency exceeds 99 % while the load regulation to a step current ranges between 40 ns and 60 ns. No output capacitor is required to ensure stability. Hence, the required on-chip area is as small as 0. 026 mm 2 for the proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> which is approximately four to six times smaller than area efficient low dropout regulators.

The method had to enable detection of the circuit's degradation during exploitation, without terminating its operation in an ionizing radiation field. Moreover, it had to enable automatic measurement and data collection, {{as well as the}} detection of any considerable degradation, well before the monitored <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator's</b> malfunction. The principal parameters of the <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator's</b> operation that were monitored were the serial pnp transistor's base current and the forward emitter current gain. These parameters were procured indirectly, from the data on the <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator's</b> load and quiescent currents. Since the internal consumption current in moderately and heavily loaded devices was used, the quiescent current of a negligibly loaded <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> of the same type served as a reference. Results acquired by on-line monitoring demonstrated marked agreement with the results acquired from examinations of the <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator's</b> maximum output current and minimum dropout voltage in a radiation environment.
