5|$|Rutherford began {{a career}} in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a <b>special</b> <b>judge</b> in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895. He {{developed}} {{an interest in the}} doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement, and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931. Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of The Finished Mystery, a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I.|$|E

He became a trial lawyer for a law firm and later served for four years in Boonville as a public prosecutor. He campaigned briefly for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan.

500|$|Just {{prior to}} the Supreme Court's ruling, the grand jury handed down indictments against Fletcher for three misdemeanors â€“ conspiracy, {{official}} misconduct, and political discrimination. Fletcher did not appear at his arraignment on June 9 because he was on vacation in Florida; his attorney entered [...] "not guilty" [...] pleas to all three charges on his behalf. On August 11, 2006, <b>Special</b> <b>Judge</b> David E. Melcher ruled that because the personnel violations were allegedly committed while Fletcher was acting in his official capacity as governor, he was protected by executive immunity {{and could not be}} prosecuted until he left office. Melcher asked that the two sides work together to reach a settlement in the case. On August 24, Fletcher and Stumbo announced such an agreement. Under the settlement, Fletcher acknowledged that evidence [...] "strongly indicate wrongdoing by his administration" [...] but did not admit any wrongdoing personally. Fletcher also acknowledged that Stumbo's prosecution of the case [...] " [...] necessary and proper [...] of his constitutional duty" [...] and ensured that abuses of the merit system would be ended. In addition to dropping the charges against Fletcher, Stumbo conceded that any violations by Fletcher's administration were [...] "without malice". Four members of the state Personnel Board who were appointed by Fletcher were required to step down. Their replacements would be chosen by Fletcher from a list provided by Stumbo.|$|E

[...] After returning to duty, he served on Hampton's staff from 1811 to 1812, first in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and then again in New Orleans. [...] In one notable event following his return to active duty, Scott was appointed [...] <b>special</b> <b>judge</b> advocate for the court-martial in Baton Rouge of Colonel Thomas Humphrey Cushing, who was accused of several charges, including misappropriation of government property and insubordination.
