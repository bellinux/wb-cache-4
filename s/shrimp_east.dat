40|$|The pontoniinid shrimp fauna {{of central}} East Africa,—Kenya and Tanzania, is summarized. One hundred and thirty-four species, of thirty-six {{different}} genera are recorded, of which sixty-seven species are {{reported for the}} first time and twenty-one species are newly recorded from the Indian Ocean. The available information on the associated host animals of these commensal <b>shrimps,</b> in <b>East</b> African waters, is provided. The incidence of commensalism in the subfamily and its distribution among the different invertebrate host types, is outlined and the fauna of East Africa is compared with that reportedfrom other localities in the Indo-West Pacific region. The East African fauna shows almost double the number of species found in the Indonesian-Philippine region, often considered the dispersal centre of the Indo-West Pacific shallow-water marine fauna...|$|R
5000|$|The small painted shrimp Hymenocera picta, {{a general}} {{predator}} of starfish, {{has been found}} to prey on A. planci at some locations. A polychaete worm, Pherecardia striata, was observed to be feeding on the starfish together with the <b>shrimp</b> on an <b>east</b> Pacific coral reef. About 0.6% of the starfish in the reef population were being attacked by both the shrimp and polychaete worm, killing the starfish in about a week. Glynn suggested this resulted in a balance between mortality and recruitment in this population, leading to a relatively stable population of starfish.|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{biology of}} populations {{of a typical}} {{demersal}} carnivorous fish species, Nemipterus japonicus (Japanese threadfin bream) from four different locations of India was studied {{on the basis of}} percentage number, percentage weight and occurrence of food items. The basic indices viz., percentage number, gravimetric index and percentage occurrence were used to calculate preference indices like the index of relative importance (IRI) and index of preponderance (IP). Percentage similarity index (PSI) and dietary breadth (DB) were used for investigating the site specific variation in food and feeding biology from 4 sites viz., Mumbai and Cochin from the west coast and Chennai and Kakinada from the east coast of India. Some important food items like squid, lizard fish, Solenocera sp. and polychaetes which were common in other locations, were not reported from Kakinada samples. The PSI and DB indicated marked variations in feeding biology of populations from different sites on the east and west coast. Similarity index was maximum between Mumbai and Cochin while the second highest value was between Kakinada and Chennai. A narrow spectrum of food items was observed for Kakinada and Chennai populations in contrast to a broader spectrum for Cochin and Mumbai populations. The west coast individuals revealed abundance of <b>shrimps,</b> while <b>east</b> coast individuals showed abundance of crabs in the diet. The analysis reflected a coastwise variation in the food items of the species...|$|R
40|$|Taking related {{concepts}} of friction and a simplified value chain analysis, {{this article focuses}} on interaction of three regulatory networks and their influence over sustainable <b>shrimp</b> aquaculture in <b>East</b> Kalimantan. The results show that while government and nongovernment organization (NGO) regulatory networks have focused on the standardization of best practices, it is artisanal trade networks, controlled by local patrons (or ponggawa), that hold most influence over production. By exploring the influence of these ponggawa over production and trade we demonstrate how patronage is key to regulating the conduct of farmers and constitutes a vital, but poorly understood element in the shrimp value chain. We conclude that while ponggawa hold a central position in these value chains they remain systematically ignored by state and NGO-market-led regulatory networks. As a result, many of the frictions inherent to local–global interconnections of shrimp aquaculture limit any externally led attempt to create change...|$|R
40|$|The large branchiopod {{crustaceans}} (fairy shrimp, tadpole {{shrimp and}} clam <b>shrimp)</b> of South <b>East</b> (SE) Asia {{have only recently}} been examined with scientific vigor. Although more than 70 species have been reported for Asia and Indonesia, only six native taxa and one introduced species are known from SE Asia. The majority of records are from Thailand, with fewer than three records each from Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Singapore. Eleven genera reported from adjacent regions may potentially occur in SE Asia. Spinicaudatan clam shrimp have been collected from Thailand and Cambodia, but have not been identified beyond genus. Four of the five native fairy shrimp species are endemic to SE Asia. The limited distributions of these few taxa suggest that this region has a distinct branchiopod fauna. In addition, we present new species and records of clam shrimp from Thailand. Future survey efforts will undoubtedly reveal additional taxa...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{fragments}} of white spot virus (Systemic Ectodermal and Mesodermal Baculovirus:SEMBV) were detected in various natural aquatic organisms by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. The suspected carriers (shrimps, crabs, fish, benthic organisms and planktons) {{were collected from}} sources near <b>shrimp</b> farms (<b>East</b> coast and West coast in southern of Thailand) during October 1997 to September 1998. First step amplification of the DNA extracted from samples consistently yielded 643 basepairs PCR product as expected. Second step amplification PCR product containing SEMBV DNA yielded an expected 330 basepairs. Specific DNA {{fragments of}} SEMBV were detected in 6 species of wild shrimp (Krill Acetes sp. and Euphausia sp., snapping shrimp Alpleus euphrosyne, banana shrimp Penaeus merguiensis, speckled shrimp Metapenaeus monoceros and dwarf prawn Macrobrachium equideus). It was also detected in 2 species of wild crab (merder's mangrove crab Sesarma merderi and hermit crab Eupagurus bernberdus) and 3 species of fish (mud skipper Periophthalmus sp., goby fish Gnathogobius aliceae and blue panchax Aplocheilus panchax). Gastropod (Family Cerithidae), benthic polychaete and planktons (copepods, rotifers, moinas, nauplius and oscillatoria) were also positive for the SEMBV DNA fragments detection. Thers aquatic organisms {{were found to be}} reservoir hosts of SEMBV. Using both techniques demonstrated that the virus was found in carriers similar to SEMBV in the cultured shrimp Penaeus monodon with white spot syndrome. The prevalence of SEMBV in different carriers ination to seasonal cycle and localities is discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Microbiological and sensorial {{characteristics}} of treated whole and peeled <b>shrimp</b> from the <b>east</b> coast of Saudi Arabia were evaluated. Shrimp samples {{were treated with}} organic acid salts with or without bifidobacterium breve culture and stored in ice. Peeling alone extended the microbiological shelf life by four days. Treatment of whole shrimp with sodium acetate alone or potassium sorbate with bifidobacteria prolonged the microbiological shelf life by three days and increased the microbial generation time from 12. 8 h (control) to 30. 1 h or 31. 4 h, respectively. The microbiological and sensory shelf life of peeled shrimp treated with sodium acetate was more than 17 days. Sodium acetate extended the microbial lag phase and lengthened the generation time (38. 7 h compared to 15. 8 h for the control). Micrococci and coryneforms were the predominant microorganisms in whole shrimp during storage. Treatment with sodium acetate maintained better sensory characteristics for peeled shrimp than potassium sorbate combined with bifidobacteria...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} could directly reduce {{water quality}} for shrimp cultivation. This study aims {{to determine how}} the environmental quality, shrimp population and genetic characteristics of shrimp that live in polluted waters in <b>shrimp</b> ponds in <b>East</b> Java associated with WSSV disease that often attacks on cultivated shrimp. The method used was a descriptive exploratory. Data collection was collected by observation and interview with farmers on disease history. Water was sampled for water quality study and characterize its suitability for shrimp cultivations. Shrimps were also sampled for morphological and genetical study for its susceptibility of WSSV. All samples were taken every week during shrimp cultivation in Malang ans Gresik. Morphological study using scoring method to determine the disease stages on shrimp, while for genetical study using specific primer for ICP 11 for WSSV detection, since ICP 11 is expressed when WSSV infection is occur. Samples were taken from 2 shrimp ponds in South Malang and Gresik. The overall water quality is good, except for NO 2 and TOM in both seawater shrimp ponds which higher than the freshwater/estuary shrimp ponds. Light infections of WSSV were detected in all seawater ponds both in morphology and genetics. However, in the freshwater/estuary pond only shrimps from freshwater/estuary Gresik which showing light WSSV infection genetically, but not in the morphological signs. Early disease detection is important to control the disease spread...|$|R
40|$|The Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC) is a {{regional}} treaty organization with 11 member countries. This {{was established in}} 1967 to promote fisheries development in Southeast Asia. As one of four SEAFDEC departments, the Aquaculture Department based in Tigbauan, Iloilo, Philippines, has conducted activities for aquaculture research and development in the region. Since 2000, the Regional Fish Disease Project has been implemented at the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department through the Government of Japan Trust Fund. Under this project, research studies were conducted on various aspects of viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases of fishes and <b>shrimps.</b> In <b>East</b> Asia, koi herpesvirus (KHV) disease initially occurred in Indonesia and Taiwan in 2002. KHV infection was also found in Japan in 2003. This disease had a serious, devastating impact on common carp and koi (Cyprinus carpio) production in Indonesia and common carp production in Japan. Common carp is an important food resource {{in the rural areas}} of the region, while koi is internationally traded as ornamental fish among Southeast Asian countries. Under these situations, the Regional Fish Disease Project identified KHV as a serious, transboundary pathogen in the region and decided to work on KHV disease at the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department in coordination with the SEAFDEC member countries {{to prevent the spread of}} KHV in the region. The planned research includes survey of the distribution of KHV in the region, standardization of the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) detection method, characterization of the virus isolated from the region, mode of transmission of KHV, and pathophysiology of KHV-infected fish. To support establishment of the fish disease quarantine and surveillance in Southeast Asia, the Regional Fish Disease Project has, since 2002, annually conducted a hands-on training at the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department on viral diseases of fishes and shrimps for scientists and technical staff from the SEAFDEC member countries. The trainees are expected to play key roles in the diagnosis, prompt information exchange, and surveillance of fish diseases, including KHV disease, in their respective countries. The Regional Fish Disease Project organized two meetings in March 2004 and will convene another meeting in June 2004 : Pre-KHVD Symposium Meeting, International Symposium on Koi Herpesvirus Disease, and Meeting on Current Status of Transboundary Fish Diseases in Southeast Asia: Occurrence, Surveillance, Research and Training...|$|R
40|$|Mahakam Delta area, {{which is}} {{situated}} in Kutai Kartanegara Regency, has become a pond center that gives {{a significant contribution to}} <b>shrimp</b> export of <b>East</b> Kalimantan Province. Pond-produced shrimps, however, do not always accord to the intention of cold storage companies at expected price. The companies even sometimes reject the request due to poor quality of the product. The decreasing shrimp quality may be due to maintenance process by the pond farmers as well as the improper collectors. In the other hand, importing countries have decided more and more restricted requirements for the imported fishing products. This study was held in Muara Jawa, Anggana, and Muara Badak Districts using techniques of data collection of in-depth interview with twelve respondents. In order to improve shrimp quality, farmers or the producers have to formulate a strategy towards the improvement of the post harvest shrimps from the pond using an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Results of the AHP consist of as follows: (1) application of pond shrimp post harvest technology and improvement of facilities and accommodation that support the quality improvement of the pond shrimps, (2) human resource quality improvement of pond farmers, collectors, and field instructors, (3) development of pond culture by applying best practices principle and local policies in order {{to improve the quality of}} the pond shrimps, and (4) improvement of interagency coordination, monitoring, and evaluation to enhance the pond shrimp qualit...|$|R
