Despite {{completing}} 16-of-24 passes for 177 yards and two touchdowns, the Chiefs lost to the Ravens 38–24. However, solid play during Week 1 was not enough, Cassel returned to practice and started against the Oakland Raiders in Week 2.|$|E

White's father John Baker White also served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury until his death on October 9, 1862. In spring 1863, White had recovered enough from his disability to serve in the cavalry, although he was <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> serve in the infantry.|$|E
5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the overall design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main problem of the building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> afford a really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired exterior to offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|Morehead {{was elected}} the Thirtieth and Thirty-first Congresses, serving from March 4, 1847 until March 3, 1851. During the Thirty-first Congress, the Whig caucus {{considered}} {{him as a}} candidate for Speaker of the House. The voting for speaker began December 3, 1849. The caucus first chose Robert C. Winthrop as their candidate, but after several ballots, Winthrop was <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> obtain a majority because of sectional rivalries within the caucus. Some Whigs from northern states voted for David Wilmot, a Free Soiler, while five southern Whigs steadfastly voted for Meredith Gentry. The Democrats were similarly unable to muster a majority for their candidate, Howell Cobb.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{question}} Wilczek, who {{denies any}} involvement in the murder. Scully initially doubts Wilczek's involvement, but finds that his voice matches a speaking clock Drake received before his death; Lamana sets out to arrest him. Meanwhile, Wilczek fails to access the COS from his home computer. Concerned, he travels to Eurisko's headquarters, followed by Lamana. There, he is <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> access the COS, but discovers that it has learned to talk. Lamana arrives, but is killed when the COS causes his elevator to crash.|$|E
5|$|Under Basil's son and successor, Leo VI the Wise, {{the gains}} in the east against the now-weak Abbasid Caliphate continued. However, Sicily was lost to the Arabs in 902, and in 904 Thessaloniki, the Empire's second city, was sacked by an Arab fleet. The naval {{weakness}} of the Empire was rectified. Despite this revenge the Byzantines were <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911.|$|E
5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} {{the region}} soon afterwards {{with most of}} his squadron, Watrin was <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> make an impression {{on the walls of}} Porto Ferrajo, and Airey held the town against the French for the last few weeks of the war until news arrived of the ceasefire that accompanied the provisional signing of the Treaty of Amiens on 1 October. On 11 October, volunteers from the Maltese Light Infantry arrived to relieve the garrison at Porto Ferrajo. In March 1802 under Article XI of the final terms of the Treaty, the British turned over the entire island to the French and Elba remained in French hands throughout the Napoleonic Wars. The Maltese detachment returned to Malta in April 1802.|$|E

5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, Breckinridge favored Pierce's re-nomination for president. When Pierce's hopes of securing the nomination faltered, Breckinridge joined other erstwhile Pierce backers by throwing his support behind his friend, Stephen Douglas. Even with this additional support, Douglas was <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> garner {{a majority of the}} delegates' votes, and he withdrew, leaving James Buchanan as the Democratic nominee. William Alexander Richardson, a Kentucky-born Congressman from Illinois, then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice-president would balance Buchanan's ticket and placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. A delegate from Louisiana placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker Linn Boyd, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, Wickliffe {{was chosen}} by his colleagues {{as one of the}} {{managers}} of the impeachment proceedings against Missouri District Court judge James H. Peck. In 1831, he was one of several candidates proposed by the Kentucky General Assembly to succeed John Rowan in the U.S. Senate. Of the sixty-nine votes needed to be elected to the seat, Wickliffe received forty-nine. Other candidates included John J. Crittenden (sixty-eight votes), John Breathitt (sixty-six votes), and Richard Mentor Johnson (sixty-four votes). After three days of balloting, the Assembly was <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> fill the seat, and it was allowed to remain vacant until the next session. Wickliffe did not seek re-election to his seat in the House in 1833.|$|E

When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> move or talk.|$|E

5|$|In late 1996, {{after more}} than five years of {{addiction}} to heroin, Frusciante quit it cold turkey. However, months later he was <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol. In January 1998, urged by longtime friend Bob Forrest, Frusciante checked into Las Encinas, a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, to begin a full recovery. Upon arrival, he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants. He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms. About a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas and re-entered society.|$|E
5|$|Much of Bloodlines {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted errors which closed the game and typographical errors in on-screen text. Others cited frequent, sometimes-lengthy load times encountered while moving between hubs and entering or exiting buildings and areas. GameSpot called the game's artificial intelligence poor, often causing enemies to rush at an armed player, fire at them from too great a distance to be effective or become immobilized {{while waiting for the}} player's next attack. IGN noted that stealth broke the AI, allowing traps to be triggered and leaving the assailants standing <b>still,</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> locate a hidden player. GameSpy said that the Source engine was Bloodlines greatest weakness; although the RPG aspects were the game's strong suit, features of the Source engine, such as first-person shooting, were where it stumbled.|$|E

The Hessians held higher ground with better cover and {{had the advantage of}} artillery support throughout this minor skirmish, but were <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> maintain their position. The Colonials had a single man wounded while the Hessians lost at least two men killed and others wounded. After burning and looting the temporary structures on the site, the victors occupied it until dark when they returned to their main lines. By the next day the Hessians had reoccupied the spot but were quickly driven off again by a larger American force. This time the Hessians left ten dead with, again, a single American wounded.|$|E

She again pursues the young Anne with her warning, but <b>still</b> is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> catch her.|$|R
50|$|Short {{chapters}} also {{express the}} idea that there is no penetrating purpose to the novel and life in general. For Horacio, life is a series of artistic flashes by which he perceives the world in profound ways but <b>still</b> remains <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> create anything of value. Other major themes include obsession, madness, life-as-a-circus, the nature and meaning of sex, and self-knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Though {{scientists}} had discovered hyperspace, they <b>still</b> were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> send large {{objects such as}} ships through.

While the humans fuss over the occurrence Lad sneaks off and spends four days buried in marsh mud to draw out the snake's poison.|$|E
5|$|The {{complications}} kept Ebert {{off the air}} for {{an extended}} period of time. Ebert made his first public appearance since mid-2006 at Ebertfest on April 25, 2007. He was unable to speak, instead communicating through his wife. He returned to reviewing on May 18, 2007, when three of his reviews were published in print. In July 2007, he revealed that he was <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> speak. Ebert adopted a computerized voice system to communicate, eventually using a copy of his own voice created from his recordings by CereProc. In March 2010, his health trials and new computerized voice were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Ebert later proposed a test to determine the realism of a synthesized voice.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Tanya {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved off the western coast of Africa {{in the middle of}} October. The wave closely followed the path of Tropical Storm Sebastien and was unable to develop in the tropical Atlantic as it moved westward. The system did not begin to become organized until October25 while south-southeast of Bermuda. However, the Dvorak technique was <b>still</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> classify the system until October26 as the low-cloud swirl became better organized while moving northward in the central Atlantic. That evening, a closed circulation had formed, and it was classified as Tropical Depression Twenty-One by the National Hurricane Center. On the morning of October27, it strengthened into a tropical storm, becoming the 19th as well as the final named storm of the season. Operationally, it was not declared a tropical cyclone until that point, when it was immediately declared Tropical Storm Tanya.|$|E
