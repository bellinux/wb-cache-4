5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the <b>steadycam</b> camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a <b>steadycam</b> shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the <b>steadycam</b> shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] was {{directed}} in February 1997 by Gregg Masuak, and filmed in a theatre {{located in the}} north of London. It features the Spice Girls singing and dancing solo in front of various colourful backgrounds whilst filmed with a <b>steadycam.</b> Other scenes show the group performing on a stage in front of an energetic crowd. In addition, there are many background performers doing unusual tricks. Chisholm wrote about the shoot: [...] "We shot the video for 'Who Do You Think You Are' in a really mad club—a real dive. The toilets were horrible and we had to have our make-up done in a Winnebago. The vibe was excellent, though—I think it was my favourite video because it was such good fun. I felt like a proper pop star. [...] It was just how you imagine it when you're young".|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} the group running, singing, dancing, and creating mischief at an eccentric bohemian party. Among their antics is Chisholm's back handspring {{on one of}} the tables. Because the video needed to be taken in one shot, the group rehearsed the routine several times through the night, while a <b>steadycam</b> operator followed them. About the experience, Halliwell wrote: [...] "The video I remember as being very chaotic and cold. It wasn't very controlled—we didn't want it to be. We wanted the camera to capture the madness of the Spice Girls". Virgin's executives were horrified with the final result: [...] "the girls were freezing cold, which showed itself in various different ways", Ashley Newton recalled. The video was later banned in some parts of Asia because of Brown's erect nipples. Additionally, the lighting was considered too dark and gloomy; the best takes showed the girls bumping with the furniture and looking behind them. Virgin was concerned that old people appeared on the video, the part when they jump up on the table, and Halliwell's showgirl outfit would be considered too threatening by music channels. Virgin immediately opened discussions about a re-shoot of the video or creating an alternate one for the US, but the group refused. The video was sent for trial airing in its original form.|$|E

It’s a rare pleasure to see a film made with such an elegant compositional eye... Deep-focus shots of Lyokha at his most pensive, standing on the shores of the lake, are loaded with a sense of place, and of belonging. The same goes for the hypnotic <b>Steadycam</b> sequences of him zooming along in his boat, the sound of the motor quietly giving way to a slow build of electronica composer Eduard Artemyev’s stirring ambient score with choral elements." ...|$|E
50|$|However, {{instead of}} taking the genre seriously, the film parodies the {{original}} André Hunebelle OSS 117 series and other conventional spy and Eurospy films such as Se Tutte le Donne del Mondo with its sequence {{on top of the}} Christ the Redeemer statue, and most noticeably the early James Bond series right down to the cinematography, art direction and costumes of the 1960s-1970s. For example, driving scenes are all filmed with obvious rear projection and camera movements are simple, and avoid the three-dimensional <b>Steadycam</b> and crane movements that are easily accomplished today. The film also parodies Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo and North by Northwest with de La Bath's clothing inspired by Harper and the set furniture inspired by Dean Martin's Matt Helm films.|$|E

50|$|The {{film is a}} {{continuation}} of the OSS 117 series of spy films from the 1950s and 1960s, which were in turn based on a series of novels by Jean Bruce, a prolific French popular writer. However, instead of taking the genre seriously, the film parodies the original series and other conventional spy and Eurospy films, most noticeably the early James Bond series right down to the cinematography, art direction, music and costume of the 1960s (although this is a slight anachronism as the film is stated in dialogue to be set in 1955, hence a sequence where OSS 117 briefly dances the twist is out of place). For example, driving scenes are all filmed with obvious rear projection, night scenes were clearly shot during the day with a blue filter and camera movements are simple, and avoid the three-dimensional <b>Steadycam</b> and crane movements that are easily accomplished today. The scene at the Cairo airport was filmed in the entrance hall of a campus of Panthéon-Assas University.|$|E
5000|$|Dan Kneece, {{best known}} for his work on the 1986 film Blue Velvet, {{operated}} the Steadicam for the video shoot. 3D said that Kneece {{was one of the main}} reasons why they had chosen to shoot the video in Los Angeles, [...] "because there aren't many people the UK who have the expertise to hold a <b>Steadycam</b> on their back for five minutes", the other reason being [...] "the light, because you can't get that kind of golden light anywhere else". Kneece recalled that the shoot started with him on a Shotmaker arm on which he filmed the gang before being lifted into the air and then down again, at which point he had to take a running jump off the arm onto the sidewalk to follow Nelson. Six takes were recorded before Kneece became too exhausted to carry the camera any more. The equipment used for the filming included an Arriflex III camera, a Cooke triplet lens, and a 400-foot camera magazine. Precision speed control was used to fit the entirety of the song onto the camera roll.|$|E
5000|$|Producer Giridharilal Nagpal {{announced}} his intentions of making, Suyamvaram, a film shot within 24 hours in January 1999, citing {{it had been}} a fourteen-year dream. The film's launch occurred in March 1999 with Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan in attendance. He {{announced his}} intentions of shooting the film within 24 hours on 5 and 6 April 1999 across film studios in Chennai. Along with Nagpal, the film brought together 19 associate directors, 45 assistant directors, 19 cameramen, 36 assistant cameramen, nine <b>steadycam</b> operators, 14 heroes, 12 heroines, villains, comedians, five dance masters, 16 assistants, 140 chorus dancers, stunt coordinators, art director, makeup, costume and set designers, 15 film units, a still photographer and 1,483 extras to make the film. Despite months of planning, Nagpal has left many details to the last minute with no script produced and directors describing scenes to actors, who would rehearse them once before filming. Two representatives, on behalf of the Guinness World Records, were present to oversee the time-schedule. Giridharlal said, [...] "The goal is to finish every stage of film-making within the stipulated 24 hour period, Shooting, developing rushes, editing, dubbing, re-recording and final mixing for the master copy will all be done in that time. The script is being divided into 11 parts, and one director will shoot one part, all of them working on the same day, at different sets and venues".|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] was {{produced}} by Vincent Joliet and directed by Joe Pytka and depicts, {{from the point of}} view of a bird in flight, many references to Beatles songs, such as [...] "Penny Lane", [...] "Paperback Writer", [...] "A Day in the Life", [...] "Eleanor Rigby", [...] "Helter Skelter", [...] "Piggies", [...] "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill", [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", [...] "Doctor Robert", and [...] "The Fool on The Hill". Between 80 and 100 allusions to the Beatles' story, music and lyrics in the video have been estimated. Although the bird can be heard at the beginning of the video, it is never seen. Neil Aspinall (Apple Records executive at the time) said that this was because no-one could agree on what kind of bird it should be. Pytka had to send his ideas to McCartney, Harrison and Starr, as well as Ono, to make sure they all agreed before he could proceed with the filming of the video. Derek Taylor (ex-Apple Records executive) sent a two-page letter to Pytka confirming that he could proceed, and personally encouraged and supported Pytka's ideas. The video was filmed in as many authentic locations as possible: Penny Lane was made by Pytka's art department to look as it was in the 1950s, and other locations filmed were The Liver Building, and Liverpool Docks (as a reference to Lennon's father Alfred Lennon). Although Pytka fixed the ideas on a storyboard, he abandoned it as soon as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycamera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a <b>steadycam</b> shot on the ground was a much better idea.

To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos. Harrison played the ukulele in the studio for the song, and asked to appear as the ukulele player seen only from behind at the very end of the video. Pytka resisted this, as he felt it would be wrong for any contemporary members of the Beatles to appear on screen. Pytka later stated that it was [...] "heartbreaking" [...] that Harrison had not played the role, particularly after Harrison's death in 2001 and upon discovering that the ukulele was not a sample of an old song as Pytka had assumed. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1997.|$|E

El pla en primera persona és una figura intermèdia, que sorgeix de les interaccions recíproques de les innovacions tecnològiques desenvolupades en diferents plataformes: la <b>steadycam</b> i els seus derivats, les càmeres digitals i les seves {{versions}} en miniatura, els equips de vigilància o els videojocs. D'altra banda, és una figura experimental, atès que expressa directament la comprensió dinàmica del món, promulgada per un agent híbrid (un cos-sensor), i, en conseqüència, és una figura que expressa la vívida i canviant experiència perceptual i emocional. The article {{analyzes the}} first person shot, a stylistic figure resulting from a radical transformation of the classical point of view or subjective shot within the contemporary media landscape. The {{first part of the}} article focuses on two main features of {{the first person}} shot. On the one hand, it is an intermedia figure, arising from the reciprocal interactions of technological innovations which unfolded on different media platforms: the <b>steadycam</b> and its derivatives, digital cameras and their miniaturized versions, surveillance equipments, videogames playable from a first-person perspective. On the other hand, it is an experiential figure, as it directly expresses the dynamic grasp of the world, enacted by a hybrid agent (a body – sensor), and consequently its perceptual, practical, emotional, living and ongoing experience. The second part of the article considers the first person shot as a figure expressing in sensorial terms a well defined idea of subject and subjectivity. This idea contrasts with the main conceptions adopted by film and media scholars: the article analyzes the debate between J. L. Baudry and V. Sobchack and argues that both scholars –despite their different philosophical premises– consider the subject as an entity defined by its position in a specific location. Rather, {{in the case of the}} first person shot the subject is continuously redefined through a constant shifting; hence the subject should be conceived as dis-posed and dis-located. Finally, the article argues that this conception of subject and subjectivity links film and media studies to current mind theories inspired by cognitive phenomenology, which elaborated a conception of subject as a dynamic agent involved in an ongoing narrative negotiation of selfhood through continuous flows of transformations...|$|E
40|$|Head-fixed camera {{systems are}} widely known, {{but since they}} are aligned by the head only and not by the eyes they {{are not able to}} always look at what the {{cameraman}} is looking at, and the image quality is poor if no effort is made to stabilize the camera. Systems like <b>Steadycam,</b> in contrast, focus on image stabilization at the cost of restricting the cameraman in his actions. The prototype of a new mobile head-mounted camera system was developed that is continuously aligned with the orientation of gaze. In doing so, the biological gaze stabilization reflexes are used to keep the video camera stable on target. Applications like movie making through the eyes of an actor or documentary movies for sports and other activities are conceivable. The system was tested by a surgeon who could successfully document his activities. disadvantage that the recorded video stream will not contain the spontaneous view of the user, since the eyes move relative to the head when not restricted by a viewfinder. Therefore two major benefits are gained when human eye movements are used as input signals for the camera motion device: on the one hand, the biological gaze stabilization can be used to keep the gaze direction of the video camera stable, and on the other, the user’s gaze direction will control the video camera so that the camera always sees what the cameraman sees. 1...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007 an Italian Urban Simulation Laboratory was founded at the Politecnico di Milano. The laboratory, coordinated by prof. Fausto Curti, has been developed thanks to the one year presence of the visiting professor Peter Bosselmann, director of the Environmental Simulation Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. The laboratory has an interdisciplinary approach and a threefold mission: experiment, using the laboratory setting to study urban projects at different scales, communicate, aiding public communication by making urban projects understandable to everyone, integrate and innovate, working on different kind of simulations techniques in an integrated way. In its initial experience the laboratory is primarily a didactic and research facility. Students can join the work and participate actively to the research. Until now about 40 students have worked with us, {{more than a half}} were foreign students from all over the world. The majority of the students did an internship of about 150 (three-year degree) or 300 (master degree) hours and some of them have continued working after this period developing a thesis. At the moment the case study, used as a pilot research, is about the Porta Nuova project at the Garibaldi- Repubblica area in Milan. The 300. 000 mq of the total area and its well served central position make this place strategic for Milan. In this area the adopted urban transformation plan is creating a new business center that affects redevelopment projects, new infrastructures, and a park. The overall project will overhanging the surroundings city center with some of the highest buildings of its skyline. The importance of the site and the dimension of the project make this case significant to test the use of simulation for supporting evaluations about morphological aspects, comfort conditions, visual impacts, and other aspects that directly influence the quality of the new urban spaces. We are now applying different simulation methodologies in order to better understand the peculiar usefulness of each kind as a tool to support evaluation. As any kind has its own limits we work with different typologies at the same time. We are working with 1 : 500 scale physical model of a 1 km square of the area and different kind of static and dynamic simulations. We developed, with an external office, a micro-car to move a micro-camera in the maquette. We use this equipment to better explain the project implications to the students by producing subjective shot videos or showing a walk in real-time. To reproduce in a better way some relevant walks through the transformed site we have also produced some videos made of a superimposition of the real existing context and the virtual projects. To do this we used a rendered video of the project superimposed to the filmed promenade of the today condition, previously recorded using <b>steadycam.</b> A lot of static simulations has been employed to better understand the new city configuration from some representative points of view, as for example the roof of the Duomo cathedral. We are now developing some other kinds of analysis such as shadows impact, this is done by using a 1 : 1000 scale maquette in the Heliodon, but also with some digital tools. In the next future a work with the wind tunnel will help to understand some other comfort implications of the project at the micro-urban scale. The multilayer approach is the main aim of the laboratory and is an important tool to clarify the multidimensional project impacts to the students. In this way the laboratory can be a learning tool, it can stimulate the project process and support decision-making while improving the knowledge about the correct use of simulations for evaluating the cumulative implications of the proposed urban processes...|$|E
