5000|$|He {{eventually}} {{decided to}} start his own business and, in 1886, moved to Enköping where he started Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad (the Mechanical Workshop of Enköping) which quickly became a successful venture. It was during the years in his workshop that he invented the adjustable <b>spanner</b> <b>and</b> the plumber <b>wrench.</b> In 1890, B.A. Hjorth & Company agreed to distribute his tools worldwide under the [...] "Bahco" [...] trademark. The Bahco tools became greatly successful, and the company is still in operation and has manufactured over 100 million wrenches to date.|$|R
40|$|Wrench {{converts}} gripping {{action of}} hand to rotary motion without imparting reactive moments or forces on part being turned or on operator. Wrench should {{be useful in}} undersea operations and other delicate work where reactive forces and torques have to be controlled. In design for valve tightening, tool resembles cross between conventional <b>spanner</b> <b>wrench</b> <b>and</b> pilers. One handle engages valve body; second handle has ratchet pawl that engages toothed coupling ring on perimeter of valve handle. When operator squeezes wrench handles, valve handle rotates with respect to valve body...|$|R
5000|$|In 1901 Frank Hornby, a clerk from Liverpool, England, invented and {{patented}} a new toy called [...] "Mechanics Made Easy" [...] {{that was}} based on the principles of mechanical engineering. It was a model construction kit consisting of perforated metal strips, plates and girders, with wheels, pulleys, gears, shaft collars and axles for mechanisms and motion, and nuts and bolts and set screws to connect the pieces. The perforations were at a standard ½ inch (12.7 mm) spacing, the axles were 8-gauge, and the nuts and bolts used 5/32 inch BSW threads. The only tools required to assemble models were a screwdriver <b>and</b> <b>spanners</b> (<b>wrenches).</b> It {{was more than just a}} toy: it was educational, teaching basic mechanical principles like levers and gearing.|$|R
25|$|This marble obelisk {{is on top}} of {{a square}} base with three reliefs on it. The south side of the base has a relief of Benjamin Grenup {{at the time of his}} death. The relief shows Grenup being run over by a fire water wagon and his fellow firefighters {{reacting}} to the accidental death—one has his arms in the air while the other firefighters stop the wagon. The west side of the base has a relief of a fire hose and two nozzles. The east side has a relief of a fire axe, torch <b>and</b> <b>spanner</b> <b>wrench</b> tied together with a rope. Egg-and-dart motif along with garland and ribbons decorate the sculpture. The sculpture sits on a triangle plot surrounded by a fence. Fire hydrants sit at each of the three corners of the base.|$|R
50|$|In Commonwealth English (excluding Canada), spanner is the {{standard}} term. The most common shapes are called open-ended <b>spanner</b> <b>and</b> ring <b>spanner.</b> The term wrench is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. tap <b>wrench</b> <b>and</b> pipe <b>wrench),</b> or {{may be used for}} a monkey wrench - an adjustable spanner.|$|R
