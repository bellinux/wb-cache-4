50|$|An {{elevator}} may {{be marked}} with a sign noting that it is specially configured for Shabbat observance. There are several ways the elevator works (going up and down); <b>stopping</b> at every <b>floor,</b> <b>stopping</b> at alternate <b>floors,</b> or rising to the top <b>floor</b> and <b>stopping</b> while going down.|$|R
5000|$|Observe the situation, {{approach}} {{the children with}} a calm voice, and sit {{with them on the}} <b>floor.</b> <b>Stop</b> any hurtful behavior if necessary.|$|R
60|$|Elliot {{crossed the}} <b>floor,</b> <b>stopping</b> {{now and then}} when {{somebody}} spoke to him, and after a time reached Marston's table, where he sat down.|$|R
50|$|John Doe {{is injured}} when an {{elevator}} he has entered plunges several <b>floors</b> and <b>stops</b> abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, the {{man told}} me. The floor is laid on top of those joists--those boards on edge that we crawled over--but the <b>floor</b> <b>stops</b> at a partition. Well, if you get behind a partition, same as you did in the attic, don't you see that you can shove {{anything}} you please under the floor between the floor-boards and the lath and plaster of the ceiling below? Look here. I've drawn it." ...|$|R
50|$|Unlike closed towers, {{which were}} fully {{enclosed}} by walls, half towers were {{open on the}} inside, typically the side facing the city or the inner bailey of a castle. On this side, a wooden railing on individual <b>floors</b> <b>stopped</b> people or objects from falling off. Sometimes the open side was sealed with wooden planking or weaker timber framed walls. Towers that are fully open {{at the top and}} rear are open towers, whilst those only open on the lower floors (i.e., the top floor is walled and roofed) are partially open towers.|$|R
50|$|The Parc 1 Tower is a supertall {{skyscraper}} {{under construction}} in Seoul, South Korea. It will stand 334 metres(1,095 ft) and contain 72 <b>floors.</b> Construction <b>stopped</b> in 2011 but has resumed in 2017.|$|R
60|$|Charnock got up {{and walked}} about the <b>floor.</b> Then he <b>stopped</b> {{opposite}} his wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "Work! Don't {{you call}} all that work, and useful? I'm sure I envy the cook {{in my kitchen}} at times; I envy the woman that scrubs my <b>floors.</b> <b>Stop!</b> Don't ask why I don't go into my kitchen, or get {{down on my knees}} with the mop. It isn't possible. You simply can't. Perhaps you could if you were very grande dame, but if you're {{anywhere}} near the line of necessity, or ever have been, you can't. Besides, if we did do our own household work, as I understand your Altrurian ladies do, what would become of the servant class? We should be taking away their living, and that would be wicked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] she said. [...] "The thing stood there. He {{knows how}} I hate her flowers, {{and he put}} her nosegay in the vase out of my way. There was a woman's face painted on the china, {{and he told me}} it was the living image of her face. It was no more like her than I am. I was in such a rage that I up with the book I was reading at the time and shied it at the painted face. Over the vase went, bless your heart, crash to the <b>floor.</b> <b>Stop</b> a bit! I wonder whether that's the book you have been looking after? Are you like me? Do you like reading Trials?" ...|$|R
50|$|On June 8, 2017, Peterson shouted an {{obscenity}} at Representative Dodie Horton of Haughton after Horton asked a {{group of}} senators present on the House <b>floor</b> to <b>stop</b> talking so that the budget proceedings being considered could be heard. Peterson later apologized for her verbal attack.|$|R
5000|$|The B1-class {{comprises}} two trams {{built as}} prototype light rail vehicles built by Comeng in 1984 and 1985 for the St Kilda and Port Melbourne light rail conversion projects. Both B1s were fitted with air compressors and air brakes (the only other trams currently in service also fitted with air brakes are the W class), and were originally fitted with both trolley poles and pantographs. They were originally built with dual height steps {{to allow for}} level boarding at railway platforms and street level, but both have had these features removed, with low <b>floor</b> <b>stops</b> build adjacent to the railway platforms instead. They have a very similar interior to proceeding B2-class, except they have no air-conditioning, and are fitted with opening windows and different sun shades.|$|R
60|$|He {{crossed the}} <b>floor</b> carefully, <b>stopping</b> often to listen. At last {{he heard a}} {{rustling}} sound just ahead of him. His fingers tightened upon the revolver he carried in his right hand, by the barrel, clublike. Billy {{had no intention of}} making any more noise than necessary.|$|R
60|$|Clank! clank! clank! Baron Conrad strode {{across the}} stone <b>floor,</b> and then <b>stopped</b> short {{in front of}} the good old man.|$|R
50|$|On June 8, 2017, Democratic state Senator Karen Carter Peterson of New Orleans shouted an {{obscenity}} at Representative Horton after Horton asked a {{group of}} senators present on the House <b>floor</b> to <b>stop</b> talking so that the budget proceedings being considered could be heard. Peterson later apologized for her verbal attack.|$|R
60|$|He {{reached under}} the bed, {{pulled out the}} snake and flung it, still coiled, {{to the center of}} the room, whence with a harsh, {{shuffling}} sound it slid across the polished <b>floor</b> till <b>stopped</b> by the wall, where it lay without motion. It was a stuffed snake; its eyes were two shoe buttons.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower was}} built as Elrond College, an {{experiment}} in {{a new model of}} student housing. Elrond College, associated with Queen's University, was designed as a non-profit student run co-operative. The brutalist style structure was built to house the college in 1972, and was the first high rise constructed in Kingston. The building had 184 apartments and was designed to hold 400 students. Some of the floors were divided between split-level apartments; this means there is no 5th or 10th <b>floor</b> <b>stop</b> on the elevator. The students would pool their labour to keep the building maintained, and would pay towards the substantial mortgage the co-operative took out to build the structure. The residence was named after Elrond, a character in J.R.R. Tolkien's works. In the books, Elrond's home Rivendell is an idealized place of safety and respite.|$|R
50|$|A first {{explosion}} {{came at a}} {{few seconds}} past 11:30 am; a clock on the third <b>floor</b> balcony <b>stopped</b> at that time. After the hollow center of the building was filled with poisonous gas, a second explosion shattered the skylight and sent the vapors into {{every corner of the}} clinic. Many of the building occupants succumbed to the poisons.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused and}} walked slowly {{up and down the}} room, with his hands behind him and his eyes fixed upon the <b>floor.</b> Suddenly he <b>stopped</b> and looked up.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has a double core construction, with a circular cross section. The Umeda Exit of the Ikeda Route of the Hanshin Expressway system (when exiting the highway {{from the direction}} of Ikeda) passes between the fifth through seventh floors of this building. The highway is the tenant of those floors. The elevator passes through the <b>floors</b> without <b>stopping,</b> <b>floor</b> 4 being followed by floor 8. The floors through which the highway passes consist of elevators, stairways and machinery. The highway does not make contact with the building. It passes through as a bridge, held up by supports next to the building. The highway is surrounded by a structure to protect the building from noise and vibration. The roof has a helipad.|$|R
50|$|Inside the {{elevator}} {{there is no}} call button to push, or the buttons are there but they cannot be pushed — except door opening and alarm button — they only indicate <b>stopping</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
6000|$|There {{was another}} {{interval}} of silence; {{and the boy}} was stealing away, when he heard her footstep on the <b>floor,</b> and <b>stopped.</b> She went up to him, as it seemed, and spoke lovingly; saying that she would defer to him in everything and would consult his wishes and obey them, and they might be very happy {{if he would be}} gentle with her. He answered with an imprecation, and-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold wasn't to be stopped. He {{led the way}} out of {{the room}} and upstairs, and we all trailed after him. We had just reached the top <b>floor,</b> when Hilda <b>stopped,</b> and said [...] "Hark!" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was no need}} of {{the proverbial}} feather. Mrs. Muldoon made a grab at the settle but missed it. She caught at a chair, but that gave way. It was the <b>floor</b> that finally <b>stopped</b> her.|$|R
60|$|As his {{retainers}} {{left the}} room at his command, Peter of Colfax strode back and forth upon the rushes which strewed the <b>floor.</b> Finally he <b>stopped</b> before the girl standing rigid {{in the center of}} the room.|$|R
50|$|All of {{the ground}} <b>floor</b> windows had <b>stopped</b> short of the plinth, the {{original}} extent indicated by the queen closers, and also by the rather abrupt truncation of the plinth where the new doors have been inserted.|$|R
50|$|Janata Tower is an eleven storey {{building}} located in Karwan Bazar, Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was originally {{planned to be}} 15 <b>floors.</b> After construction <b>stopped</b> in 1991 when General Ershad stepped down the tower became a home for squatters.|$|R
50|$|The new Tillis was {{short-lived}} however, as {{he traveled to}} Australia and lost a decision to veteran Joe Bugner. In 1987 he was upset in eight rounds, as underdog (and regular Tyson sparring partner) Michael Williams came off the <b>floor</b> to <b>stop</b> Tillis. Later in the same year, he was stopped in five rounds on cuts by future champ Frank Bruno in London, and then knocked out in 10 rounds by hard-hitting Johnny DuPlooy in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|When {{the state}} {{government}} proposed to move its Alcoholic Rehabilitation Center to the Vocational Rehabilitation Department to qualify for federal funds, Rogers led a <b>floor</b> fight that <b>stopped</b> the transfer. Rogers told The State in Columbia that such a move was contrary to ethical principles.|$|R
5000|$|On June 10, 2006, a Schindler {{elevator}} in Urayasu started ascending {{while the}} door was open, passed the top <b>floor,</b> and finally <b>stopped</b> in the mechanical shaft. Two people were trapped in the car. The elevator had firmware [...] "80TH v1.4" [...] with faulty codes.|$|R
5000|$|One day, {{a new man}} {{is brought}} into his cell: Valentin Arregui Paz, a Marxist revolutionary, already in a bad state of health after torture. Molina cares for him and tells him of Aurora. But Valentin can't stand Molina and his {{theatrical}} fantasies and draws a line on the <b>floor</b> to <b>stop</b> Molina from coming nearer to him. Molina, however, continues talking, mostly {{to block out the}} cries of the tortured prisoners, about Aurora and his mother. Valentin at last tells Molina that he is in love with a girl named Marta.|$|R
5000|$|Estação-Tubo (meaning {{literally}} [...] "tube station", {{which are}} {{not to be confused with}} London Underground stations) are bus stops for Curitiba's Integrated Transportation Network. Designed as futuristic tubes made from steel and glass, these bus stops allow fare payment in advanced and boarding at the same level as the buses' <b>floor,</b> thus reducing <b>stop</b> time.|$|R
2500|$|In 1755, about 4:15am on Tuesday, November 18, was {{the most}} {{destructive}} earthquake yet known in New England. The first pulsations of the ground were followed for about a minute of tremulous motion. Next came a quick vibration and several jerks much worse than the first. Houses rocked and cracked; furniture fell over. Dr. Edward A. Holyoke, of Salem, wrote in his diary that he [...] "thought of nothing less than being buried instantly {{in the ruins of}} the house." [...] The shaking continued for two to three minutes more, and seemed to move from northwest to southeast. The ocean along the coast was affected; ships shook so much that sleeping sailors awoke, thinking they had run aground. In Boston, the earthquake threw dishes on the <b>floor,</b> <b>stopped</b> clocks, and bent vane-rods on churches and Faneuil Hall. Stone walls collapsed. New springs appeared, and old springs dried up. Subterranean streams changed their courses, emptying many wells. The worst damage was to chimneys. In Boston alone, about a hundred were leveled; about fifteen hundred were damaged, the streets in some places almost covered with fallen bricks. Falling chimneys broke some roofs. Many wooden buildings in Boston were thrown down, and some brick buildings suffered; the gable ends of twelve or fifteen were knocked down to the eaves. Despite the danger and many narrow escapes, no one was killed or seriously injured. Aftershocks continued for four days.|$|R
50|$|The Smith that Ferguson was {{referring}} to was Lieutenant Elza C. Smith of the 13th Kentucky Cavalry. The twenty-nine-year-old Smith was a relative of Ferguson's first wife. Smith had joined the 13th in Clinton County, Kentucky, in 1863, and {{spent much of his}} service chasing down terrorists such as Ferguson. Ferguson was a confederate sympathizer in an area that was predominantly Union. Ferguson saw it as his duty to form a guerrilla party to attack Union sympathizers. According to Thurman Sensing, Ferguson's biographer, Smith's death was the culmination of eleven murders. Ferguson allegedly suffered at the hands of his pro-Union neighbors during the war. Dr. J. B. Murfree stated that Smith made Ferguson's wife undress and march around before him along a public road. Sensing then concludes that with the death of Smith, his family honor was restored. Ferguson then attempted to ascend one of the stairways in the hospital {{to gain access to the}} third floor. The guard that was placed by Dr. Murfree and the quartermaster to keep the federal soldiers on the third <b>floor</b> <b>stopped</b> Ferguson and the men with him. The band of raiders advanced on the guard swearing that they would get up the steps in spite of the guard. Undaunted, the guard raised his gun and leveled it at Ferguson and told him that he would shoot him if he approached another step. Angrily, Ferguson and the men left that guard to find another way up the stairs.|$|R

60|$|Alexina, {{not waiting}} {{to shut the}} oven door--for delay might impress Uncle James unfavourably--rushed upstairs to get the letter. She was ten minutes finding it. Then, remembering her pies, she flew back to the kitchen. In {{the middle of the}} <b>floor</b> she <b>stopped</b> as if transfixed, staring at the table. The turkey was gone. And the plum pudding was gone! And the mince pies were gone! Nothing was left but the platters! For a moment Alexina refused to believe her eyes. Then she saw a trail of greasy drops on the floor to the open door, out over the doorstep, and along the boards of the walk to the back fence.|$|R
