40|$|Illegal {{migration}} is an impalpable phenomenon with complicated dimensions. Thousands of people leave their homelands every year {{due to a}} number of reasons such as civil wars, terrorism, economic difficulties, and social oppressions. With their flexible modus operandi, migrant <b>smugglers</b> benefit from individuals or groups that wish to immigrate for a more comfortable life. In order to reach a complete perception of illegal migration one needs to draw an accurate profile of migrant <b>smugglers.</b> At this end, data collection from both <b>smugglers</b> as perpetrators and illegal migrants as the object of the smuggling process provides important information for a holistic definition of “smugglers”. In this study researchers interviewed 262 illegal migrants and 174 <b>smugglers</b> captured in Istanbul from 2007 to 2013 in order to identify and develop a profile of migrant <b>smugglers</b> and understand the operating methods of illegal migration organizations. The collected data were analyzed and important results on illegal migrant <b>smugglers</b> were reached...|$|R
