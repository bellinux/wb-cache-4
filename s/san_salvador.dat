5|$|By 1539, the Spanish {{advances}} in El Salvador were sufficient that Cuscatlan was considered fully pacified. In {{the immediate aftermath}} of the Spanish conquest, the conquistadors sought wealth through slaving and mining, but both of these industries soon faltered, and the colonists instead turned to agriculture. In 1545, <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> was moved to its current location, and on 27 September 1546, it was elevated in status to a city. El Salvador originally formed three administrative divisions, those of Sonsonate (Izalcos), <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> (Cuscatlan), and San Miguel. Sonsonate was an alcaldía mayor, while <b>San</b> <b>Salvador,</b> San Miguel, and Choluteca (now in Honduras) formed the alcaldía mayor of <b>San</b> <b>Salvador.</b> From 1524, all of these fell within the jurisdiction of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. In 1542, this jurisdiction was reorganised as the Real Audiencia de Guatemala, and later the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Ecclesiastically, all of El Salvador fell within the Roman Catholic diocese of Guatemala. The native inhabitants of the Izalco region of El Salvador, famed for its prodigious production of cacao, were among the most heavily exploited in the whole Spanish Empire. By the end of the 16th century, this had led to the collapse of cacao production in the province.|$|E

5|$|The first {{campaign}} against the native inhabitants was undertaken in 1524 by Pedro de Alvarado. Alvarado launched his expedition against the Pipil province of Cuscatlan from the Guatemalan Highlands, but by July 1524 he had retreated back to Guatemala. Gonzalo de Alvarado founded <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> the following year, but it was eradicated by a native attack in 1526, during a general uprising that spread across the region. Pedro de Alvarado returned to campaign in El Salvador in 1526 and 1528, and in the latter year, Diego de Alvarado reestablished <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> and issued encomiendas to his supporters. In 1528, the uprising finally ended when the Spanish stormed the native stronghold at the Peñol de Cinacantan.|$|E

5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E

5|$|In 1529, Pedrarias Dávila sent an {{expedition}} led by Martín de Estete to annex {{the territory of}} El Salvador to his domains in neighbouring Nicaragua, {{going so far as}} to distribute the unconquered natives of the Gulf of Fonseca in encomienda to his followers. At the time, Diego de Rojas was in command of the Spanish forces attempting to pacify indigenous resistance centred on Popocatepet. In January or February 1530, Martín de Estete captured Rojas, and marched on <b>San</b> <b>Salvador,</b> but was unable to gain the support of the residents there, and set up camp at Perulapan (modern San Martín Perulapán), just to the south, which he called Ciudad de los Caballeros ("City of the Knights"). The acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Orduña, sent his captain Francisco López at the head of {{an expedition}} to drive out the interlopers. López left Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala in March 1530 with thirty cavalry, and an unspecified body of infantry. The residents of <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> rose up in arms to join the relief force; Estete abandoned his camp and retreated towards Nicaragua, taking with him 2000 enslaved Cuzcatlecos. López pursued Estete and caught up with his forces after crossing the Lempa River. Estete and his second-in-command fled for Nicaragua, and his soldiers surrendered to López. Diego de Rojas was freed, and the slaves recovered. This intervention put an end to Pedrarias Dávila's hopes of securing El Salvador as part of Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|In El Salvador, {{heavy rains}} from the {{depression}} helped alleviate drought conditions; however, flooding also inundated 200homes in <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> along the Acelhuate River. Fifteen farms were inundated by flooding, five {{of which were}} destroyed. Seventy people evacuated to shelters set up after the storm by the local Red Cross and armed forces. Military crews were quickly deployed to help clean up the damages on September22.

5|$|The {{inhabitants}} of <b>San</b> <b>Salvador,</b> {{alarmed by the}} uprising engulfing the region, responded by sending a great quantity of weapons, armour, gunpowder, and other supplies to Montejo in Honduras. One hundred Indian auxiliaries were also sent, with one thousand native porters. Further supplies were forthcoming from the embattled residents of San Miguel. By the end of 1538, Lempira's stronghold had been taken by the Spanish, and Montejo crossed from Honduras to San Miguel to assist in putting down continued indigenous resistance in the district.|$|E

5|$|About {{two months}} into the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the {{majority}} of Spanish soldiers in Honduras were concentrated around the fortress. Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both Gracias a Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, with almost no soldiers left there. Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The whole region south of the Peñol rose up, as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador around <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions around San Pedro, and outlying areas around Trujillo.|$|E
5|$|Andres {{originated}} from a disturbance that slowly organized and formed into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm {{status as a}} second circulation formed north-northwest of the initial circulation. However, the former circulation became dominant, and Andres intensified slightly. After {{a brief period of}} a normal track to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten Central America. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the Caribbean Sea, Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since record-keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres then turned back to the northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Frances was {{the sixth}} named storm, the fourth {{hurricane}}, {{and the third}} major hurricane, of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. The system crossed the open Atlantic in mid and late August, moving {{to the north of}} the Lesser Antilles while strengthening. Its outer bands struck Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands while passing north of the Caribbean Sea. The storm's maximum sustained wind peaked at , achieving Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the system's forward motion slowed, the eye passed over <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> Island and very close to Cat Island in the Bahamas. Frances was the first hurricane to impact the entire Bahamian archipelago since 1928, and almost completely destroyed the agricultural economy there.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{efforts by}} mayor Norman Quijano to restore public safety have been {{somewhat}} successful. Security measures in <b>San</b> <b>Salvador's</b> most troubled Districts (5 and 6, which border Soyapango, and are home to many gangs) included safety campaigns and recreational activities to keep youth from joining gangs. The mayor also initiated a security camera program so the police can monitor the most heavily trafficked areas of the city. The project was launched in the historic downtown and will expand throughout the entire city.|$|R
5|$|Turning southeastward, Tropical Storm Andres passed about 35miles (55km) off {{the coast}} of Guatemala, before it began {{weakening}} due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The convection became amorphous and later shifted to the southeast of the circulation. On June6 Andres weakened to tropical depression status. It turned northward and moved ashore near <b>San</b> <b>Salvador,</b> El Salvador on June7, which was the first recorded landfall in the country. The low-level circulation quickly dissipated over land, although the mid-level circulation persisted across Central America. After the featured reached the western Caribbean Sea, a new surface circulation developed, and initially, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated the development of a significant storm in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Instead, the system remained disorganized, bringing rainfall to Cuba, Florida, and the Bahamas before it was absorbed by a weak trough in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west}} coast of Africa on September 23, and merged with the southern end of a decaying frontal system over the Caribbean Sea. The combined disturbance gradually split, with the northernmost section eventually becoming Tropical Storm Marco. The southernmost end moved into the eastern Pacific, which then immediately showed signs of organization. The system stalled just south of El Salvador throughout October 5, where it came under the influence of strong vertical wind shear. The circulation slowly drifted east-northeastward and became absorbed by a neighboring tropical wave, with the broad resultant low re-curving to the west-northwest. In response to relaxing shear aloft, convection redeveloped around the newly formed center of circulation. It subsequently acquired a sufficiently organized structure and post-analysis found that a tropical depression formed at around 1200UTC on October8. Upon developing, the depression was designated as Sixteen-E about 120mi (195km) south-southwest of <b>San</b> <b>Salvador,</b> El Salvador, and operationally, advisories were initiated at 2100UTC — 9 hours after post-analytic estimates of formation.|$|E
5|$|Around midday on September13, {{the storm}} {{strengthened}} into a Category5 hurricane, {{based on the}} anemometer at San Juan observing sustained winds of 160mph (268km/h). The hurricane peaked with sustained winds at the intensity. About six hours later, the system made landfall in Puerto Rico; {{it was the only}} recorded tropical cyclone to strike the island as a Category5. Very strong winds resulted in severe damage in Puerto Rico. Throughout the island, 24,728homes were destroyed and 192,444were damaged, leaving over 500,000 people homeless. Heavy rainfall also led to extreme damage to vegetation and agriculture. On Puerto Rico alone, there were 312 deaths and about $50million in damage. After emerging into the Atlantic, the storm weakened slightly, falling to Category4 intensity. It began crossing through the Bahamas on September16. Many buildings and houses were damaged or destroyed, especially on Bimini, Eleuthera, New Providence, and <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> Island. Nineteen deaths were reported, eighteen from a sloop disappearing and one due to drowning.|$|E

5|$|In 1529, El Salvador became {{embroiled in}} a {{jurisdictional}} dispute with neighbouring Nicaragua. Pedrarias Dávila sent Martín de Estete {{at the head of}} an expedition to annex the territory to Nicaragua. Estete captured the leader of a rival Spanish expedition in eastern El Salvador, and marched on <b>San</b> <b>Salvador,</b> before being repulsed by a relief force sent from Guatemala. In 1530, Pedro de Alvarado ordered the establishment of a new settlement at San Miguel, in the east of the country, to protect against further incursions from Nicaragua, and to assist in the conquest of the surrounding area. Indigenous uprisings against the invaders continued, spreading from neighbouring Honduras. The general uprising across the two provinces was put down by the end of 1538, and by 1539 the province was considered pacified. The conquistadores discovered that there was little gold or silver to be found in El Salvador, and it became a colonial backwater with a small Spanish population, within the jurisdiction of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The natives {{launched}} a furious mass assault against Santa María de Comayagua. The depleted garrison fought {{its way out}} under cover of night and {{set out on a}} desperate march to Gracias a Dios, leaving the town to be sacked – not even the livestock were spared. All across the province the Spanish were short of soldiers, arms and supplies, except at the Peñol de Cerquín, which remained the focus of Spanish attention. In {{a very short period of}} time, Spanish control had collapsed across Honduras; only two small Spanish pockets remained – at Gracias and San Pedro. Montejo sent Gonzalo de Alvarado to <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> to seek assistance, which was readily supplied in the form of 100 Indian auxiliaries, 1000 Indian carriers, livestock, arquebuses, crossbows, gunpowder, ammunition, shields, spears, armour and iron. Further supplies were forthcoming from San Miguel, but similar requests sent to Guatemala were largely rebuffed, as a response to Montejo's policies which were perceived as undermining the rights of Guatemalan colonists.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Nine caused minor {{flooding}} in Central America in September2001. The ninth tropical cyclone of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, the depression developed from a tropical wave {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea on September19. Without significant intensification, the depression made landfall in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua early on September20, which was about six hours after becoming a tropical cyclone. Once inland over Central America, the depression significant deteriorated and dissipated later that day, after lasting for less than 24hours. The remnants emerged into the Pacific Ocean and later developed into Hurricane Juliette. Impact from the depression was rather minor. Although sustained winds on land did not exceed 30mph (55km/h), a fallen tree injured three children in El Salvador. In addition, heavy rainfall flooded at least 200homes in <b>San</b> <b>Salvador</b> and inundated 15farms. The depression {{did not result in}} fatalities and damage caused by it is unknown.|$|E
