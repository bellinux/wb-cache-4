40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to study the effect of <b>steckling</b> size on vegetative growth, flowering date, seed yield, 1000 -seed weight and germinability. It was observed that <b>steckling</b> of 1 / 3 rd of the root size took the longest time to 50 % flowering and 100 % flowering and the whole root took the shortest time to 50 % flowering and 100 % flowering whereas the <b>steckling</b> of 2 / 3 rds of root size showed intermediate effect for days to flowering. Whole root also resulted in highest yield as compared to root and 2 / 3 rds root. Seed quality attributes viz., 1000 seed weight and seed germination were also found to be affected significantly {{by the size of}} stecklings in both years In year 2001 - 02, the germination increased singnificantly in 2 / 3 rds and full root over the control, however, the increase in germination was at par in latter treatments.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effects of <b>steckling</b> weight and planting density on sugar beet monogerm (Cv. 9597) seed quantitative and qualitative characteristics, this experiment was carried out in Ardabil Agricultural Research Station-Iran (38 ° 30 'N and 48 ° 30 'E) during 2 years (2002 - 2003). In the study, <b>steckling</b> weight (main-plot) in three levels including 100, 100 - 200 and 200 - 300 g and planting density (sub-plot) in three levels including 40, 50 and 60 cm were used in a split-plot experiment based on the RCBD (Randomized Complete Blocks Design) with 5 replications. The measured characteristics were morphological and qualitative (velocity and uniformity of germination) characters, seed size distribution and monogerm seed percentage. According to the results of the experiment, the effect of planting density on the auxiliary branches No. and seed yield was significant at the probability levels of 1 and 5 %, respectively. Seed yield increased by 43 % as planting density was increased from 65 x 40 to 65 x 60 cm. The increase in <b>steckling</b> weight led to the increase in standard seed portion (with 3. 5 - 4. 5 mm in diameter), germinable standard seed yield (11 %) and decrease in germination velocity and germination uniformity; and increase in planting density was accompanied by increase in > 4. 5 mm seed percentage, velocity and uniformity of germination and decrease in germinable standard seed yield. Eventually, the highest seed yield (1208 kg ha - 1) was obtained by using <b>steckling</b> weight of 200 - 300 g and planting density of 65 x 60 cm. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} study, {{conducted}} in the years 2010 – 2012, was to evaluate bolting and seed production of shallot depending on storage temperature of <b>steckling</b> bulbs with dif-ferent diameters. The present study included 4 cultivars (‘Toto’, ‘Ambition F 1 ’, ‘Bonilla F 1 ’, and ‘Matador F 1 ’) and one local po-pulation (‘U’). Bulbs with the following diameters: 20 – 30 mm, 31 – 40 mm, 41 – 50 mm, and 51 – 60 mm, were stored from the first 10 -day period of November (2010 and 2011) {{until the end of}} March (2011 and 2012) at a temperature of 0 – 1 oC, 4 – 6 oC, and 8 – 10 oC. After they were planted in the field (the second 10 -day period of April), observations of bolting were carried out, while the weight of seed umbels and seed yield were deter-mined only for the cultivar ‘Toto ’ and the population ‘U’. The storage temperature of <b>steckling</b> bulbs in the range of 4 – 6 oC and 8 – 10 oC was most conducive to bolting, in particular in plants grown from large bulbs with a diameter above 40 mm. In the cul-tivar ‘Toto’, plants from bulbs with a diameter above 40 mm and stored at a temperature of 4 – 6 oC were characterized by the hi-ghest weight of seed umbels. This had an effect on obtaining the highest seed yield (on average 1604. 16 - 2300. 7 g per 100 m 2 of area). Shallot plants from the population ‘U ’ grown from bulbs with a diameter of 20 – 30 mm were characterized by a distinctly lower percentage of bolting plants compared to the cultivars stu-died. For this reason, this population does not promise positive effects in shallot production for seed. Key words: Allium cepa L. var ascalonicum, bulb size, cultivar, generative shoots, seed yiel...|$|E
