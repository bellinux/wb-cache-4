25|$|In 1909 Sunnyside {{and later}} in 1935 Northchurch were added to Berkhamsted Urban District. Shortly after 1918 much of the {{extensive}} estate belonging to Berkhamsted Hall, at {{the east end of}} the High Street, was sold; many acres west of <b>Swing</b> <b>Gate</b> Lane were developed with Council housing. More council housing was built at Gossoms End. Development {{on the north side of}} the valley was limited until the sale of the Ashridge estate in the 1930s after which housing appeared at each end of Bridgewater Road. Meanwhile, over the last century, many of the old industrial firms in Berkhamsted closed, while the numbers of commuters increased.|$|E
25|$|Five windows flank {{either side}} of the portico to create a simple, clean and {{balanced}} façade. To {{the north side of the}} building, in place of the outermost windows to the cellar and ground floor, a double <b>swing</b> <b>gate</b> was located behind which was a passage which led into a yard for the coaches. The partially grilled windows to the basement extended under the road level. The first floor windows received stone surrounds and the high windows of the entertainment rooms on the ground floor were also provided with small bracketed canopies. A balustrade extended over the entire length of the facade above the entablature. Other than the laurel wreaths below the bracketed sandstone cornice, the facade has no other sculpted ornamentation.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Chickerel and {{his family}} now lived at Firtop Villa, in that place, a house which, like many others, had been built since Julian's last visit to the town. He was {{directed}} to the outskirts, and into a fir plantation where drives and intersecting roads had been laid out, and where new villas had sprung up like mushrooms. He entered by a <b>swing</b> <b>gate,</b> on which 'Firtop' was painted, and a maid-servant showed him into a neatly- furnished room, containing Mr. Chickerel, Mrs. Chickerel, and Picotee, the matron being reclined on a couch, which improved health had permitted her to substitute for a bed.|$|E

Generally there are four types of electromechanical gate operator: Worm driven (or screw type) <b>swing</b> <b>gates,</b> barrier arm operators and sliding operators Electric and automatic gate openers are designed for both sliding and <b>swinging</b> <b>gates.</b> They can be programmed to open with a manual device or a wireless transmitter. Automatic gate operators can also be fitted with solar panels to operate without high voltage power. Many manufacturers offer battery backup either integrated or as an add on to systems that ensure function during loss of electricity.|$|R

50|$|In the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway {{navigation}} channel {{there are}} two gates constructed. One gate is closed with two sector gate leaves, the other gate with a barge <b>swing</b> <b>gate,</b> comparable to a caisson.

50|$|For {{air intake}} shut down, two {{distinct}} types are commonly utilized, i.e. butterfly valves and <b>swing</b> <b>gate</b> or guillotine valves. Because diesel engines ignite fuel using compression {{instead of an}} electronic ignition, shutting off the fuel source to a diesel engine will not necessarily stop the engine from running. When an external hydrocarbon, such as methane gas, {{is present in the}} atmosphere, it can be sucked into a diesel engine causing overspeed or over revving, potentially leading to a catastrophic failure and explosion. When actuated, ESD valves stop the flow of air and prevent these failures.|$|E

The far end of Concourse D is built at ground level to serve small {{regional}} planes. Gates D1, D3 and D5 are international <b>swing</b> <b>gates</b> generally used by Southwest Airlines for non-precleared international arrivals. These <b>swing</b> <b>gates</b> can serve both domestic and international passengers. Concourse D is connected to concourse E by a secure connector. Concourse D originally housed Piedmont Airline's hub at BWI.|$|R

50|$|In the 1930s, a cinema {{was already}} in {{operation}} in Berkhamsted High Street, the Court Cinema {{on the corner of}} Water Lane. It was acquired around 1930 by the Shipman & King cinema circuit, who also planned to open a second cinema in the town. Originally they intended to build on a site at the eastern end of town on the corner of <b>Swing</b> <b>Gate</b> Lane, but in 1936 S&K acquired Egerton House, a site closer to the centre of town which had spacious grounds for a cinema and car park. Egerton House was demolished and the Rex Cinema was erected in its place. The cinema was opened on 9 May 1938 by Viscountess Davidson, and the first screening was the film Heidi, starring Shirley Temple.|$|E

50|$|The façade to Wilhelmstrasse made a grand impression, the portico in {{the centre}} of the façade rose 2 storeys. Four Corinthian {{sandstone}} columns carried a pediment whose tympanum featured a bas-relief with five figures arranged in an unknown theme. Historical photographs show a central, winged figure, which is perhaps an allegory for the arts. To the right of centre sat a female figure with a Caduceus; this ancient symbol of commerce, associated with the Greek god Hermes, the messenger for the gods, conductor of the dead and protector of merchants and thieves, was cruelly apt to describe the eventual fate of the 'Railway King'. Porticos in the 1860s were an unusual motif in Berlin and were much more common in the Palladian buildings in England, where Strousberg had spent his youth.Five windows flank either side of the portico to create a simple, clean and balanced façade. To {{the north side of the}} building, in place of the outermost windows to the cellar and ground floor, a double <b>swing</b> <b>gate</b> was located behind which was a passage which led into a yard for the coaches.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} bachelor's {{thesis is}} to design a battery powered control system for {{wireless}} controlling <b>swing</b> <b>gate</b> (may be used for cantilever sliding gates or garage doors).

The result of this bachelor's thesis are two main PCBs with dimensions of 5 × 5 cm for controlling the gate and remote controller with dimensions of 2, 3 × 4, 4 cm. Main PCB allows adding more remotes, deleting all remotes and modes for the way of controlling the gate (opposite direction, open only, close only, open wing, close wing, stop the gate) and selecting Master/Slave gate.
