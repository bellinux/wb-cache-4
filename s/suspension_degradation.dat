6000|$|As to the {{previous}} knowledge of the Company, and its sanction to the debts, you see that this assertion of that knowledge is utterly unfounded. But did the Directors approve of it, and ratify the transaction, when it was known? The very reverse. On the same 3d of March, the Directors declare, [...] "upon an impartial examination of the whole conduct of our late Governor and Council of Fort George [Madras], and on the fullest consideration, that the said Governor and Council have, in notorious violation of the trust reposed in them, manifestly preferred the interest of private individuals {{to that of the}} Company, in permitting the assignment of the revenues of certain valuable districts, to a very large amount, from the Nabob to individuals"; and then, highly aggravating their crimes, they add,--"We order and direct that you do examine, in the most impartial manner, all the above-mentioned transactions, and that you punish, by <b>suspension,</b> <b>degradation,</b> dismission, or otherwise, as to you shall seem meet, all and every such servant or servants of the Company who may by you be found guilty of any of the above offences." [...] "We had" [...] (say the Directors) [...] "the mortification to find that the servants of the Company, who had been raised, supported, and owed their present opulence to the advantages gained in such service, have in this instance most unfaithfully betrayed their trust, abandoned the Company's interest, and prostituted its influence to accomplish the purposes of individuals, whilst the interest of the Company is almost wholly neglected, and payment to us rendered extremely precarious." [...] Here, then, is the rock of approbation of the Court of Directors, on which the right honorable gentleman says this debt was founded. Any member, Mr. Speaker, who should come into the House, on my reading this sentence of condemnation of the Court of Directors against their unfaithful servants, might well imagine that he had heard an harsh, severe, unqualified invective against the present ministerial Board of Control. So exactly do the proceedings of the patrons of this abuse tally with those of the actors in it, that the expressions used in the condemnation of the one may serve for the reprobation of the other, without the change of a word.|$|E
40|$|Uptake and {{degradation}} of the cytokinin, N 6 -(Δ 2 -isopentenyl) adenosine, were studied in tobacco cells grown as cell <b>suspensions.</b> <b>Degradation</b> occurs by cleavage of the isopentenyl chain which gives adenylic products. Rate of N 6 (Δ 2 -isopentenyl) [8 - 14 C]adenosine degradation increases several-fold after a 3 - to 4 -hour delay when cells {{have been exposed to}} a cytokinin. Consequently, only rates of N 6 -(Δ 2 -isopentenyl) adenosine degradation measured during the first 3 hours of incubation with [8 - 14 C]-N- 6 (Δ 2 -isopentenyl) adenosine are representative of the intrinsic in vivo cytokinin degradative activity of tobacco cells. Within these limits, it appears that cytokinin degradative activity is high in cytokinin-autonomous tobacco cells, as indicated by the half life of the supplied N 6 (Δ 2 isopentenyl adenosine (about 3 hours) when it is supplied at the physiological concentration of 0. 2 micromolar. This cytokinin degradative activity appears to be under the control of cytokinins themselves because N 6 -(Δ 2 -isopentenyl) adenosine degradative activity is increased several-fold following a 3 - to 4 -hour delay after these cells have been exposed to a cytokinin...|$|R

RSVE are fusogenic unilamellar vesicles containing two transmembrane glycoproteins: the HN (haemagglutinin-neuraminidase) protein and the F (fusion) factor. The fate of the viral proteins after fusion-mediated transplantation of RSVE into hepatoma (HTC) cell plasma membranes was studied to probe plasma-membrane protein degradation. Both protein species are degraded at similar, relatively slow, rates (t 1 / 2 = 67 h) in HTC cells fused with RSVE in <b>suspension.</b> Even slower <b>degradation</b> rates for HN and F proteins (t 1 / 2 = 93 h) were measured when RSVE were fused with HTC cells in monolayer.

40|$|The {{biodegradation}} of 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (2, 4, 6 -TCP) by Phanerochaete chrysosporium was {{studied in}} batch systems. In experiments with mycelial <b>suspension,</b> the <b>degradation</b> of 2, 4, 6 -TCP {{was found to}} occur in the absence of ligninase. Chloride ion was recovered in nearly stoichiometric amounts {{at the end of the}} process. The microorganism did not retain its degradation ability for more than 6 days under substrate-deficient conditions. Neither the mycelium nor the extracellular protein alone could degrade 2, 4, 6 -TCP; both were required for complete degradation to occur. In experiments in which 2, 4, 6 -TCP was exposed to the culture supernatant separated from its mycelium, negligible degradation was obtained and no chloride ion was recovered. No degradation was observed even when the supernatant was supplemented with hydrogen peroxide as a possible cosubstrate. In experiments performed with washed mycelium separated from its supernatant, no degradation took place until the mycelium released additional extracellular protein 5 to 6 h into the incubation. Additions of washed mycelium separated from its supernatant to active cultures also produced an increase in the rate of degradation in correspondence with the protein release. The protein release was independent of the presence of 2, 4, 6 -TCP. The addition of cycloheximide to inhibit the synthesis of de novo proteins completely suppressed the release of protein by the mycelium and resulted in no 2, 4, 6 -TCP degradation. Additions of culture supernatants containing a high concentration of extracellular protein to active cultures produced an increase in the rate of 2, 4, 6 -TCP degradation.

40|$|The {{importance}} of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is well recognized for thick film technology, but unfortunately {{there is no}} universal suspension medium for the EPD of oxides. Thus, {{the selection of the}} medium, the stability of the suspensions, and the control of the particle potentials, critical for a good deposition, need to be established for each new material being processed by EPD. In this article, we investigate the key parameters, studying the electrochemistry of BaNd 2 Ti 5 O 14 (BNT) suspensions, and establish relationships between suspension media, EPD process conditions, microstructure of the deposits, and resulting electrical properties of the BNT films. Suspension stability of water, ethanol, acetic acid, and acetone-based media was analyzed in terms of zeta potential, particle size distribution, UV transmittance, and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. The highest absolute zeta potential values determined for acetone with I- 2 and acetic acid media are in good agreement with the high stability, small and narrow particle size distribution, and low UV light transmittance measured for these suspensions. Very high quality thick deposits were consequently achieved. However, it was demonstrated that aging of the acetic acid-based suspension have serious negative effects on the EPD process for BNT materials, including leaching of the metallic elements with a consequent modification of the material stoichiometry, change of the conductivity of the <b>suspension,</b> and <b>degradation</b> of the films microstructure. These facts severely restrict the use of acetic acid. Our results clearly indicate that, besides the stability of the suspension, the electrochemistry and aging behavior are key aspects for the EPD of functional oxides. Our systematic approach could be viewed as providing a set of guidelines for the development of EPD of other oxides...|$|R
40|$|An {{accelerated}} {{chemical stability}} study of Prednisone oral suspension has been performed during 6 months. A stability indicating chromatographic method {{was developed and}} validated according to the ICH guidelines by reversed phase using a Chromolith® C- 18 e monolithic column 4. 6 x 100 mm, water:tetrahydrofuran:methanol 73 : 23 : 4 v/v/v as mobile phase, UV detection at 243 nm and 1 mL/min flow rate. Prednisolone was used as internal standard. Prednisone drug substance was subjected to forced degradation by acid and basic hydrolysis and oxidation condition, UV-Vis radiation effect, temperature and relative humidity were studied to demonstrate the indicating capability of the chromatographic method. Two and five degradation products were detected at acid and basic forced degradation respectively. No degradation products were detected at the others studied conditions. One degradation product from Prednisone oral suspension was detected during the accelerated chemical stability study. The proposed method was adequate to determine Prednisone drug substance, Prednisone oral <b>suspension</b> and their <b>degradation</b> products.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of antigen processing in the rainbow trout gastrointestine {{was carried out}} to provide a rational basis {{for the design of}} oral delivery systems for protein antigens. Using in vitro systems involving isolated lumenal enzymes and gut cell <b>suspensions</b> the <b>degradation</b> of human gamma globulin (HGG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was analysed by Western blotting and laser densitometry. Proteolysis by lumenal enzymes was dependant on pH and temperature and serine proteases were found to be partly responsible for antigen degradation in the intestine. The extent of intracellular proteolysis depended on the antigen used and on the gut region from which the cells were isolated. To test the predictive value of results obtained from the in vitro studies, the processing of HGG in the digestive tract after oral administration was investigated. The findings indicated that different regions of the gut perform distinct bur complementary roles in proteolysis. Measurement of the uptake of HGG into the bloodstream of these fish by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting indicated that the nature of proteins. absorbed from the gut could be influenced by altering the conditions in the gastrointestine. After parenteral and oral immunisation of HGG the antibody response was investigated in plasma and in mucosal and biliary secretions and found that a fragment of HGG produced by partial digestion with intestinal enzymes was highly antigenic in trout. The methods developed to study antigen processing in the gut were applied to assess the potential value of modern enteric delivery systems in teleosts. Encapsulation of HGG in poly lactide-co-glycolide (PLG) microparticles partially protected HGG from degradation in the gut and increased its absorption into the bloodstream. A live attenuated strain of Aeromonas salmonicida was shown to adhere to and invade isolated trout enterocytes and Atlantic Salmon tissue culture cells using a range of light - and electron microscopical techniques. These results indicate that an investigation into antigen processing by the gut is a valuable preliminary step in the formulation of oral delivery systems for teleosts.

40|$|The work {{describes}} {{a study of}} the oxidation power of N-doped and undoped anatase TiO 2, as well as TiO 2 Degussa P 25 <b>suspensions</b> for photocatalytic <b>degradation</b> of the herbicides RS- 2 -(4 -chloro-o-tolyloxy) propionic acid (mecoprop) and 3, 6 -dichloro-pyridine- 2 -carboxylic acid (clopyralid) using visible and UV light. Undoped nanostructured TiO 2 powder in the form of anatase was prepared by a sol-gel route. The synthesized TiO 2, as well as TiO 2 Degussa P 25 powder, were modified with urea to introduce nitrogen into the structure. N-doped TiO 2 appeared to be somewhat more efficient than the starting TiO 2 (anatase) powder when visible light was used for mecoprop degradation. N-doped TiO 2 Degussa P 25 was also slightly more efficient than TiO 2 Degussa P 25. However, under the same experimental conditions, no degradation of clopyralid was observed in the presence of any of the mentioned catalysts. When the kinetics of mecoprop degradation was studied using UV light, more efficient were the undoped powders, while in the case of clopyralid, N-doped TiO 2 Degussa P 25 powder was most efficient, which is probably a consequence of the difference in the molecular structure of the two herbicides...|$|R
40|$|With {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) catalysts and also extend the light absorption towards the visible light region, three types of the lanthanide ion-modified titanium dioxide (Lnⁿ⁺-TiO₂) sol catalysts were prepared by a chemical method of coprecipitation–peptization. The microstructure and morphology of Lnⁿ⁺-TiO₂ sol samples were characterized by atom force microscope, particle size distribution, and X-ray diffraction measurements. The analytical results showed that these sol catalysts had better particles distribution and interfacial adsorption ability than the powder catalysts in <b>suspension.</b> The photocatalytic <b>degradation</b> of azo dye (X- 3 B) in Lnⁿ⁺+-TiO₂hydrosol reaction system was studied to determine photocatalytic activity of the crystallized Lnⁿ⁺-TiO₂sol catalysts. Both TiO₂and Lnⁿ⁺-TiO₂sol catalysts demonstrated higher photocatalytic reactivity than Deggusa P 25 TO₂powder catalyst significantly. The experiments also confirmed that the modification of TiO₂with lanthanide ions doping can improve the efficiency of interfacial adsorption and photocatalytic reactivity with azo dye. The photocurrent response of catalysts under visible light irradiation showed that the Lnⁿ⁺-TiO₂sol catalysts had significant absorption to visible light. Since this hydrosol reaction system using the Lnⁿ⁺-TiO₂sol catalyst has several advantages over most conventional powder reaction systems, it may provide a new approach for further development of photocatalytic reaction systems in the future.

40|$|An up-flow {{fixed bed}} reactor (UFBR) was {{established}} to investigate the biodegradation of fluorobenzene (FB) under a number of operating conditions, which included variation in the concentration of FB in the feed stream (up to 180 mg l− 1) and temporary <b>suspension</b> of feeding. <b>Degradation</b> of FB was followed {{for a period of}} 8 months under a continuous flow regime. During the operation of the UFBR, FB was never detected in the reactor effluent, being biodegraded by the microbial biofilm or adsorbed to the granular activated carbon (GAC). Biodegradation of FB was observed {{from the beginning of the}} reactor operation, and overall, it accounted for 50 % of the total amount fed to the bioreactor. High organic loads of FB (210 – 260 mg d− 1 dm− 3) were found to affect the biological removal efficiency, possibly due to an inhibitory effect caused by the higher FB concentrations fed to the bioreactor (149 – 179 mg l− 1). When FB feeding was suspended for 1 month, biodegradation continued, indicating that the adsorbed FB became bioavailable. Biofilm bacterial dynamics were followed throughout the UFBR operation by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and plate-counting techniques, showing that a quite stable community was found in the bioreactor, and this was mainly attributed to the high selective pressure exerted by the presence of FB...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} abundance, distribution, {{and degradation}} potential (in terms of degradation versus lack of degradation) for four xenobiotic compounds in an aerobic aquifer sediment {{have been examined}} in laboratory and field experiments. The xenobiotic compounds studied were benzene, toluene, o-xylene, and naphthalene (all at concentrations of approximately 120 micrograms/liter). The aerobic degradation experiments ran for approximately 90 days at 10 degrees C, which corresponded to the groundwater temperature. At {{the end of the}} experiment, the major part of the microbial biomass, quantified as acridine orange direct counts, was attached to the groundwater sediment (18 x 10 (6) to 25 x 10 (6) cells per g [dry weight], and only a minor part was unattached in the groundwater (0. 6 x 10 (6) to 5. 5 x 10 (6) cells per ml). Experiments involving aquifer sediment <b>suspensions</b> showed identical <b>degradation</b> potentials in the laboratory and in the field. However, laboratory experiments involving only groundwater (excluding aquifer sediment) showed less degradation potential than in situ experiments involving only groundwater, indicating that the manipulation or approach of the laboratory experiments could affect the determination of the degradation potentials. No differences were observed between the groundwater-only and the sediment compartments in the in situ experiments in the ability to degrade the compounds, but the maximum degradation rates were substantially lower in the groundwater-only compartment. Preparations used in laboratory experiments for studying the degradation potential for xenobiotic organic contaminants should contain sediment to obtain the highest numbers of bacteria as well as the broadest and most stable degradation.

40|$|Hollow microparticles have a {{range of}} {{potential}} applications in the area of controlled drug delivery systems as the empty core allows the encapsulation of {{a range of}} material in high concentrations. The object of this thesis is to investigate the synthesis of hollow microspheres for drug delivery systems by suspension polymerization. The hollow microspheres were subsequently modified for drug delivery purposes or to introduce bioactive functionalities. A simple process was developed to obtain hollow microspheres, utilizing an o/w suspension system with monomer droplets consisting of monomer and a solvent, which is miscible with the monomer but represents a non-solvent for the resulting polymer. Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was utilized as the building block {{for the majority of the}} studies, which were copolymerized with various other monomers to alter the properties of the hollow microspheres. The solvent butyl acetate enabled the precipitation of the polymer on the water-oil interface, therefore creating hollow spheres. Poly(EGDMA) microspheres were highly crosslinked and underwent only limited swelling. Crosslinking density was reduced by introducing methyl methacrylate (MMA) or tert-butyl methacrylate (tBuMA) as comonomer. The influences on particle size, shell thickness and core space by crosslinker, comonomers and solvent were thoroughly investigated. Hydrolysis of the poly(EGDMA-co-tBuMA) microspheres yielded pH-responsive particles, which showed different swelling depending on pH value. Bis(2 -methacryloyloxyethyl) disulfide was synthesized to replace the stable crosslinker EGDMA to form degradable hollow spheres using the same <b>suspension</b> technique. The <b>degradation</b> in a reductive environment was studied using dithiothreitol (DTT) solution.
