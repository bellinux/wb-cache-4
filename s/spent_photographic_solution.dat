In view of escalating cost of silver metal and the compelling need for pollution abatement, {{it is essential to}} recover silver from the fixer solution. During the processing of films, 20 - 25 % of silver is left in the black and white films. Whereas in the case of colour films essentially all silver is dissolved into the solution. Since, the silver concentration in these solution are very low (2 - 5 g/l) it is important to analyse the silver in the solution before and after recovery. Experiments were carried to analyse the silver contents of <b>photographic</b> <b>solutions</b> using cyclic voltammetric technique. Effect of silver concentrations as well as effect of sweep rates were found out in the quick estimation of silver in the <b>photographic</b> <b>solutions.</b> Compared with other methods, this voltammetric technique seems to give silver concentration of <b>photographic</b> <b>solutions</b> in short duration without affecting the nature of the solution...|$|R

These are often found in corrosive liquids such as acids. Possible ways of reducing or eliminating these metals include: 1. Review all procedures for elimination or reduction of quantities of metals used. The use of microscale equipment or increased instrumentation can reduce the quantities of waste generated. 2. Teaching labs can substitute less hazardous metals for those experiments involving heavy metals. Or a laboratory which brings the raw material {{through a series of}} steps to the product and then back to the raw material again can eliminate disposal of that metal. 3. Metals used as catalysts can be eliminated by simply allowing more time for the reaction to come to completion. 4. Precious and semiprecious metals can be precipitated out of solution.

The proposed method {{is based on the}} catalytic effect of Ag(I) on the oxidation reaction of new fuchsin by potassium peroxodisulfate in the presence of 1, 10 -phenantroline as an activator at pH: 5. 0. The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the change in absorbance at 547 nm using the initial rate method during the indicator reaction of 5 minute. The reaction rate variables like pH, reagent and activator concentrations and effect of reaction time and temperature were optimized in order to achieve the maximum analytical sensitivity. The experimental and theoretical detection limits of the developed method were found as 0. 475 µg L– 1 and 1. 50 µg L– 1, respectively.

Two classes of compounds were synthesised incorporating acyclic silver binding sites. The first class of compounds were 1, 3 dithiole- 2 -ones functionalised with (i) a silver binding chain, and (ii) an alkyl chain, the latter allowing a range of compounds to be synthesised of varying lipophilicity. These compounds were applied as silver ionophores in plasticised PVC membranes and incorporated in ion-selective electrodes. The newly synthesised ionophores were compared to silver ionophores in the literature and to those previously used by Kodak.

40|$|Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is an {{important}} technique for molecular analysis under ambient conditions, {{and the use of}} paper-based silver nanostructures as a disposable SERS substrate is an attractive option for low-cost, point-of-use analysis. However, the activity of pre-fabricated silver nanostructures is affected by tarnishing and necessitates either storage under inert gas conditions or use of a protective layer on the surface. But neither of these approaches are satisfactory in terms of cost and performance in real-world settings. To address this, we report a print-expose-develop process, based on silver-halide photography, to fabricate SERS active silver nanowire networks on demand using a desktop inkjet printer. This process involves only the printing of silver and halide salt solutions and obviates the need for complex colloidal ink formulation steps reported in earlier studies on inkjet printed SERS substrates. Significantly, the printed and photo-exposed silver halide films retain silver in a stable latent-image form for more than 1 year under ambient conditions.

There are photographers working in the areas of medical, wildlife, aerial, advertising, fine art, newspaper, and many other genres. This study aims to bring the photographer {{to the other side of}} the camera and to interrogate their working context. Sampling a cross-section of these North Queensland professional photographers, the study explores the nature and importance of their work. Fundamentally it also taps into, albeit in a heuristic manner, the critical and underlying question: ”What is it to be a photographer?” Initial interviews revealed a diversity of motivations, practices and working styles from commercial to aesthetically driven. The data from the interviews and observations of the photographers at work were used as a basis for photographic portraits within the context of their own image making either at their place of work or on location. Photographer subjects were placed in broad groups based on their level of experience or relationship to the profession allowing closer and more meaningful analysis of the research findings. In each case a unique creative <b>photographic</b> <b>solution</b> was sought as a direct response to these individual drivers. Not surprisingly, the final works are as eclectic in style as are the practices, circumstances, and personalities of the photographer subjects. The relevant photographic works provide insights into each photographer’s branch of their profession, their practice, and their personalities as integral elements in the crucible of creation. The thesis places these investigations within a broader context of the history of the photographic portrait and contemporary dialogue on photography and the photographer’s role. A review of current literature relating to photography’s place in the plastic and wider arts from photographers, photographic critics, and other commentators with an interest in photography, provide the foundation for this review. The methodology by which data was collected and the creative, semiotic and philosophic basis of the photography are articulated. A brief vignette introduces the reader to the life and photographic practice of each photographer subject. Images are included with the text to illustrate the context of, and in some cases, the background to, each image-making event. In turn the parameters of the image making are canvassed for each subject and the final photograph is presented. The dynamics of the public interface of the research are explored and articulated with commentary on the exhibition of works, and a profiling of the limitations of the study, future directions, and reflections and implications that might be drawn. ...|$|R

Although the positioning is generally achieved by simultaneously logging the flight path or directly recording the camera's position with a GNSS receiver, this approach does not allow to record the necessary roll, pitch and yaw angles of the camera. The latter are essential elements for the complete exterior orientation of the camera, which allows – together with the inner orientation of the camera – to accurately define {{the portion of the}} Earth recorded in the photograph. This paper proposes a cost-effective, accurate and precise GNSS/IMU solution (image position: 2. 5 m and orientation: 2 °, both at 1 σ) to record all essential exterior orientation parameters for the direct georeferencing of the images. After the introduction of the utilised hardware, this paper presents the developed software that allows recording and estimating these parameters. Furthermore, this direct georeferencing information can be embedded into the image's metadata. Subsequently, the first results of the estimation of the mounting calibration (i. e. the misalignment between the camera and GNSS/IMU coordinate frame) are provided.

After {{recovery from the}} anesthetic, dogs were housed in metabolism cages for 6 to 7 days for collection of blood, urine and feces. Blood 14 C concentrations declined slowly, with 2 apparent phases. Half-life values for the α and β phases were 1. 3 and 7. 2 hours for the 1 mg/kg dose and 1. 0 and 8. 0 hours for the 10 mg/kg dose, respectively. Excretion of 14 C was rapid initially, with 14. 6 % and 42. 4 % of the 14 C being excreted in 4 hours for the 1 and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. Values for urine, feces and total recovery of 14 C at 4 to 7 days were 34. 5 %, 7. 1 %, and 41. 6 % for a 1 mg/kg dose and 65. 7 %, 6. 1 %, and 71. 8 % for a 10 mg/kg dose. No 14 C was detected in the expired air. The concentration of 14 C in the skin 24 hours after iv dosing of 1 mg/kg [14 C]HQ was about 10. 4 % of the dose. The other tissues showed low concentrations of 14 C. After the oral administration of 50 mg/kg [14 C]HQ to dogs, blood 14 C concentrations declined slowly. Half-life values for the α and β phases were 0. 85 and 12. 5 hr, respectively. The urinary excretion pattern {{was similar to that}} seen after iv administration, with 62. 5 % of the dose being excreted after 4 hours. Values for urine, feces, blood, tissue, and total recovery of 14 C at 5 to 7 days were 80. 4 %, 3. 7 %, 0. 15 %, 2. 2 %, and 86. 5 %.

After dermal application of [14 C]HQ, no 14 C was detected in the blood. Urinary excretion of 14 C accounted for only 0. 03 % of the applied radioactivity at 2 days and 0. 04 % at 5 days. Urinary 14 C was still detectable at 5 days. The percutaneous absorption rate was about 0. 16 nmol/cm 2 /min (1. 1 µg/cm 2 /hr). Using these data to estimate human uptake, assuming immersion of both hands into a <b>photographic</b> developer <b>solution</b> containing HQ for 1 hour, about 0. 8 mg of HQ would be absorbed through the skin. These studies compare the metabolic fate of HQ by different routes of administration and show that HQ is poorly absorbed through the skin...|$|R
