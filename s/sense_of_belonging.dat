Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{multiple}} and simultaneous <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>of</b> Latin Americans {{in the north}} of England, a sparse migrant population characterised by a high degree of socio-cultural invisibility, i. e. lack of official recognition and limited cultural/ethnic organisation. It draws on a project conducted with 10 Latin American and Latino British families (totalling 30 adults and dependent children of 8 - 18 years of age) and 14 other informants and stakeholders in the Yorkshire and Greater Manchester regions. The paper analyses the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> everyday <b>belonging</b> <b>of</b> the adult participants and the role that conditions of socio-cultural invisibility play in their experiences. Significant here are the lack of ethno-cultural local spaces and reluctance to embrace pan-ethnic identifications, which bring to the fore the relevance of other local social contexts and of transnational ties as sites <b>of</b> everyday <b>belonging.</b> It is argued that by paying attention to the emotions and emotional compromises that constitute migrants’ <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> it is possible to develop nuanced insights into the diversity of ways in which migrants experience processes of incorporation and combine bonds to sending and receiving societies...|$|R

5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha Empire {{was founded}} in 1645 by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj of the Bhosle dynasty. Common {{elements}} among the citizens of Raja Shivaji's Maratha Empire were the Marathi language, the Hindu religion, a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging,</b> and a national feeling. Raja Shivaji led resistance efforts to free the Hindus from the Mughals and Muslim Sultanate of Bijapur and established rule of the Brahminical Hindus. This kingdom {{was known as the}} Hindavi Swarajya ("Hindu self-rule") in the Marathi language. Raja Shivaji's capital was located at Raigad.Raja Shivaji successfully defended his empire from attacks by the Mughal Empire and his Maratha Empire went on to defeat and overtake it as the premier power in India within few decades. A key component of the Maratha administration was the council of eight ministers, called the Ashta Pradhan (council of eight). The senior-most member of the Ashta Pradhan was called the Peshwa or the Mukhya Pradhan (prime minister). The Peshwa was the right-hand man of Raja Shivaji.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 High {{school is}} a time of {{transition}} for youth of all ethnic groups, but it is a particularly problematic time for African American youth in the United States. While many studies have evaluated the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> school <b>belonging</b> and underperformance <b>of</b> African American youth, less is known about the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> school <b>belonging</b> and success <b>of</b> the adolescent Black American and African Immigrant subgroups. This proposed quantitative pilot study's conceptual framework identifies and disaggregates the protective factors, individually and in combination, that contribute to a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> school <b>belonging</b> and school success for African Immigrant and Black American ninth grade students. First, it is important {{to examine the relationship between}} generational status, maternal status, maternal involvement in school and gender on the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> school <b>belonging</b> (proximal outcome) and school success (distal outcome). Secondly, this study will determine the relationship between <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> school <b>belonging</b> and school success for these two subgroups. Data collection strategies include surveys, grades, and attendance from 240 Black American and African Immigrant ninth grade students residing in Washington and California. With the overall goal of increasing the number of successful Black American and African Immigrant ninth grade students, this study aims to identify factors that have positive implications for school success...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a qualitative study of integration, {{identity and the}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> home and <b>belonging</b> <b>of</b> {{a small sample of}} young, first generation, Iranian, upper-middle class immigrants in Halifax, responding to the hypothesis that identity and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> home and <b>belonging</b> undergo major transformations through the process of integration. Twelve interviews were conducted covering language, education, employment, social and parental relations, community participation, ethno-cultural beliefs, dress code, sexuality, and gender identity. Using an intersectionality theoretical framework and a gender-based analysis, various psychological, ethno-cultural, gendered, aged, and class-based challenges in the process of integration, leading to identity transformations were explored and analysed in relation to <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> in Canada. The findings were then contextualised within the socio-cultural conditions of Halifax. This study concludes with a series of policy recommendations and suggestions for further research on young immigrants...|$|R

5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E

40|$|Although many {{scholars}} {{focused on the}} relationship between racial discrimination and different behavioral and psychological outcomes, {{there is a lack of}} large-scale studies giving detailed information on the different dimensions of racial discrimination and its impact on various outcomes. This study addresses this problem by analyzing data from a large-scale study (767 students, 47 schools) collected during the school year 2011 - 2012 and designed to study racism in Flemish secondary schools. A first part of the analysis is descriptive and focuses on the frequency of adolescents' experiences with discrimination, their attributions of such experiences (racial or not) and the perceived source of discrimination (teacher or peers). A second part of the analysis links the different dimensions of discrimination to students’ <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> school <b>belonging.</b> Belongingness is an important concept within a school context as it has a positive impact on a whole range of outcomes, such as study motivation and school misconduct. While there are many studies that focus on the impact <b>of</b> school <b>belonging</b> on different outcomes, little is known about the impact that discrimination has on the students’ <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> school <b>belonging.</b> Hence, the second part investigates to what extent experiences of (particular kinds) of discrimination in school impact on students' <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> school <b>belonging?</b> Based on preliminary multilevel analyses, the results show that the experience of discrimination has a negative impact on students' school belonging, but only in relationship to experiences of discrimination from teachers and not from peers. In addition, the underlying attribution of experienced discrimination does not impact on students' <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> school <b>belonging...</b>|$|R
