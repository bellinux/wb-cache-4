40|$|Cathodic {{protection}} {{has been}} proven {{to be one of}} the most widely applicable and cost-effective solutions for tackling steel corrosion in reinforced concrete. In this study, the possible use of carbon fibre composites, which are primarily used to strengthen concrete members, has been investigated as impressed current cathodic protection anodes. Carbon fibre anodes have been assessed in both concrete and calcium hydroxide solution. Two bonding mediums incorporating epoxy and geopolymer have also been investigated. The results demonstrate that epoxy resin can be used for bonding carbon fibre fabric anodes to reinforced concrete structures while geopolymer is more effective for bonding carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) rod into preformed grooves in the concrete surface. The dissolution of carbon fibre anode appears to stablise after a period of time, dependent upon the size and shape of the anode and applied voltage and current. Based on the present results, a maximum current density of 128 [*]mA/m 2 of reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>area</b> is recommended for the operation of CFRP fabric anode and 64 [*]mA/m 2 of reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>area</b> for that of CFRP rod anode...|$|E
40|$|Many {{concrete}} structures {{over the}} world have deteriorated through the corrosion of steel reinforcement. In concrete columns, corrosion often occurs preferentially {{on one side of}} the member, leading to unsymmetrical loss of <b>steel</b> <b>area.</b> For slabs, corrosion of bottom steel also results in reduction in steel reinforcement ratio. The objective of this research is to study the effectiveness of repairing deteriorated concrete columns and slabs with fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composite sheets. Using steel reinforcements with reduced cross sections, concrete columns and slabs are cast to represent members with corroded steel bars. This research focuses on the repair of columns (circular and rectangular) and slabs (one way and two way) with different FRP configurations. Circular and rectangular columns are retrofitted with horizontal and vertical FRP’s to study the strengthening effect. The columns are tested under uniaxial compression load. The failure mechanisms are reported. A simple analytical model to compute the failure load is also proposed. For circular columns, horizontal wrapping is found to be the most effective approach. For rectangular columns, one can either employ horizontal FRP alone or vertical FRP confined by external horizontal FRP. Slabs with reduced <b>steel</b> <b>area</b> are tested in both one way and two way bending. Various repair configurations are studied, and the cracking and failure mechanisms are reported. For one-way slab, the H-type configuration, with two FRP strips bonded on the two sides of the region with reduced <b>steel</b> <b>area,</b> is found to be the most effective. To predict the failure load of the strengthened member, a simple analytical approach based on existing debonding models has been developed. Predictions are found to be in good agreement with test results. For two-way slab, two sheets of FRP with bond length 300 mm bonded crossing each other at the centre of the slab is found to be more effective than the grid type with composite strips placed around the reduced steel region. In predicting the peak load of the retrofitted member, a simple analytical approach with assumed yield line pattern is also proposed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{temperature}} distribution of concrete filled steel tube reinforced concrete (CFSTRC) square short columns was analyzed. Test results of four CFSTRC square short columns {{were reported in}} this paper. The specimens exposed to the ISO- 834 standard fire without initial loads. The fire test lasted 180 minutes. The influential factors included the side length of cross-section, slenderness ratio and <b>steel</b> tube <b>area</b> ratio. Finite element method (FEM) simulation was used to calculate {{temperature distribution}} of CFSTRC square short columns at elevated temperature. The test {{results show that the}} larger side length of cross-section, the lower temperature inside the specimens with the same fire exposure time and <b>steel</b> tube <b>area</b> ratio and height of specimens. Under the same fire exposure time and side length of cross- section and <b>steel</b> tube <b>area</b> ratio, the slenderness ratio was larger, and the temperature inside the specimens was lower. With the same fire exposure time and side length of cross-section and slenderness ratio, the <b>steel</b> tube <b>area</b> ratio had slight influence on temperature distribution inside the specimens. The FEM simulation results agreed well with the experimental results. The FEM simulation was capable of calculating temperature distribution of CFSTRC square short columns with an accuracy that was sufficient for design purposes...|$|R

30|$|Chloride-induced {{corrosion}} of {{reinforcing bars}} {{is one of}} the major causes of deterioration of reinforced concrete structures, affecting structures’ useful service life. Load carrying capacity of a corroding member decreases with corrosion time due to progressive loss of <b>steel</b> <b>area,</b> damage propagation in the form of cracking and eventual spalling of concrete cover, and impairment of bond between steel reinforcement and concrete. As the reduction in load carrying capacity due to reinforcement corrosion compromises structural safety, corrosion damage has always been a concern. This has generated much interest in developing analytical approaches to predict residual strength of corroded members that may serve as tools to decide on appropriate course of action to ensure safety.|$|E
