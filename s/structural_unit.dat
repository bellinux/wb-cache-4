5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with <b>structural</b> <b>unit</b> , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} boron {{is dominated by}} its small atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic <b>structural</b> <b>unit</b> of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each <b>structural</b> <b>unit</b> of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions {{at the corners}} of a regular octahedron, with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms {{at the corners of}} an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reflect the {{so-called}} boron anomaly, three types of B-O <b>structural</b> <b>units,</b> namely, BO 3 / 2, BO 4 / 2 - and BO 2 / 2 O-, were considered for the BaO-B 2 O 3 glass. Two chemical equilibrium equations were established among the three B-O <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> {{taking into account the}} so-called boron anomaly. Based on the chemical equilibrium equations and the conservation of mass equation, the fractions of the three B-O <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> can be calculated for BaO-B 2 O 3 glasses. The required parameters and the contribution values of the three B-O <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> were obtained by fitting the equation with experimental data from the literature. Following this, the contributions of B 2 O 3 to the glass transition temperature (T-g) or thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) are expressed in terms of the weighted average of the T-g or TEC contributions of the three B-O <b>structural</b> <b>units.</b> As a result, new simulation procedures for T-g and TEC based on the contributions of the three B-O <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> were established for BaO-B 2 O 3 glasses. Comparisons were made between the calculation results for T-g/TEC obtained by the new simulation procedures with the experimental results from the available literature. It is shown that the predictions of the new simulation procedures are close to the experimental values...|$|R

40|$|The mean {{binding energy}} and the {{fluctuation}} between the <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> in chalcogenide glassy systems are estimated by using the Bond Strength-Coordination Number Fluctuation (BSCNF) model. Chalcogenide glasses can {{be considered to be}} formed by an agglomeration of <b>structural</b> <b>units.</b> For this kind of glasses, the <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> are connected to each other by weak intermolecular forces. From the results obtained in the present study, it is suggested that the binding energy estimated by the BSCNF model corresponds to the intermolecular forces between the <b>structural</b> <b>units.</b> The analysis by the BSCNF model also suggests that the viscous flow or the structural relaxation results by breaking the weaker parts of the bonds in the intermolecular connections.

25|$|In metal borides, {{the bonding}} of boron varies {{depending}} on the atomic ratio B/M. Diborides have B/M = 2, as in the well-known superconductor MgB2; they crystallize in a hexagonal AlB2-type layered structure. Hexaborides have B/M = 6 and form a three-dimensional boron framework based on a boron octahedron (Fig. 1a). Tetraborides, i.e. B/M = 4, are mixtures of diboride and hexaboride structures. Cuboctahedron (Fig. 1b) is the <b>structural</b> <b>unit</b> of dodecaborides, which have a cubic lattice and B/M = 12. When the composition ratio exceeds 12, boron forms B12 icosahedra (Fig. 1c) which are linked into a three-dimensional boron framework, and the metal atoms reside in the voids of this framework.|$|E

However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that [...] "improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form." [...] The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be [...] "merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing... formally longwinded and extremely conservative". After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; [...] "instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure."

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{the effects}} of iron ion intercalations on lead-tellurate glasses were {{investigated}} via FTIR, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopies. This homogeneous glass system has compositionsFeO·(100 −) [4 TeO·PbO], where[*]=[*] 0 - 60  mol%. The presented observations in these mechanisms show that the lead ions have a pronounced affinity towards [TeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units,</b> resulting in the deformation of the Te-O-Te linkages, and leading to the intercalation of [PbO] ([*]=[*] 3, 4) and [FeO] ([*]=[*] 4, 6) entities in the [TeO] chain network. The formation of negatively charged [FeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> implies the attraction of Pb ions in order to compensate for this electrical charge. Upon increasing the FeO content to 60  mol%, the network can accommodate an excess of oxygen through the formation of [FeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> and the conversion of [TeO] into [TeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units.</b> For even higher FeO contents, Raman spectra indicate {{a greater degree of}} depolymerization of the vitreous network than FTIR spectra do. The bands due to the Pb-O bond vibrations are very strongly polarized and the [TeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> convert into [TeO] units via an intermediate coordination stage termed "[TeO]" <b>structural</b> <b>units.</b> Our UV-Vis spectroscopic data show two mechanisms: (i) the conversion of the Fe to Fe {{at the same time as}} the oxidation of Pb to Pb ions for samples with low FeO contents; (ii) when the FeO content is high ([*]≥[*] 50  mol%), the Fe ions capture positive holes and are transferred to Fe ions through a photochemical reaction, while the Pb ions are formed by the reduction of Pb ions. DFT calculations show that the addition of FeO to lead-tellurate glasses seems to break the axial Te-O bonds, and the [TeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> are gradually transformed into [TeO]- and [TeO]-type polyhedra. Analyzing these data further indicates a gradual conversion of the lead ions from covalent to ionic environment. There is then a charge transfer between the tri- and tetracoordinated tellurium atoms due to the capacity of the lead-tellurate network to form the appropriate coordination environments containing <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> of opposite charge, such as iron ions, [FeO]...|$|R
