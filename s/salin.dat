25|$|Toungoo forces {{followed}} up on the retreating forces. Tabinshwehti himself led the navy while Bayinnaung commanded the army. The Confederation command, who had not expected a counteroffensive this deep into their own territory, were greatly concerned. They hastily planned to make a stand at <b>Salin</b> long {{enough for them to}} prepare their defenses farther (90km) north in Pagan (Bagan). They left Mingyi Yan Taing, son of Governor Sithu Kyawhtin of <b>Salin,</b> in charge of the fortified city. But the plan did not work. <b>Salin</b> fell in just three days (after a section of the walls was mined and brought down). Tabinshwehti appointed Shin Thiha, one of his servants since his birth, governor of <b>Salin</b> with the title of Sithu Kyawhtin II.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Upper Burma {{ceased to}} be a concern. The ousted {{governor}} of <b>Salin</b> Sithu Kyawhtin did raid <b>Salin</b> in late 1544/early 1545 but the attack was easily repulsed. King Hkonmaing died later in 1545 and the bickering between the House of Mohnyin and the House of Hsipaw broke out in full force. The rump Ava Kingdom was no longer in a position to challenge Toungoo.|$|E

25|$|At Ava, the Confederation {{appeared}} unsure how to respond. On one hand, {{they were}} unwilling to launch another full-scale invasion lest they be exposed to another counterattack. On the other hand, they were {{not yet ready to}} cede all of central Burma uncontested. When the dry season of 1544 arrived, they saw no Toungoo armies on the horizon, and ultimately decided on a limited attack across the new ill-defined border. In late 1544, they sent a small army (3000 troops, 300 horses) led by Sithu Kyawhtin I down the Irrawaddy. The Confederation army overran the Toungoo frontier garrisons at the border. At <b>Salin,</b> a senior official loyal to Sithu Kyawhtin I revolted, driving out Sithu Kyawhtin II (Shin Thiha). Sithu Kyawhtin I entered <b>Salin</b> unopposed.|$|E

25|$|<b>Salin</b> {{turned out}} to be the last battle of the war. After the {{successive}} battlefield defeats, the bickering between the Confederation's two main powers broke out in full force. Sawlon II of Mohnyin, who had only grudgingly agreed to Hkonmaing's takeover of the Ava throne, blamed Hkonmaing for the defeats, and now planned to put Sithu Kyawhtin I of <b>Salin</b> on the Ava throne. In April/May 1545, Sawlon II sent Sithu Kyawhtin with an army (5000 men, 800 horses, 60 elephants), which went on to occupy Sagaing, the city directly across the Irrawaddy from Ava. During the rainy season, c. September 1545, Hkonmaing died, and was succeeded by his son Narapati III. The new king promptly sent a mission to Pegu to secure friendly relations in exchange for his recognition of the new de facto border between the two kingdoms. Tabinshwehti accepted the offer.|$|E

25|$|In 1470, King Thihathura of Ava (r. 1468–80) {{appointed}} Sithu Kyawhtin, {{the general}} who {{put down the}} latest Toungoo rebellion, viceroy-general of the restive province. A distant member of the Ava royalty, Sithu Kyawhtin remained loyal to Thihathura’s successor Minkhaung II (r. 1480–1501), who was greeted {{with a wave of}} rebellions by lords of Yamethin (1480), <b>Salin</b> (1481) and Prome (1482). Sithu Kyawhtin died in action at Yamethin in 1481, and was succeeded by his son Min Sithu.|$|E
25|$|To be sure, this fortuitous {{takeover}} of <b>Salin</b> {{was backed by}} no additional Ava troops, and could not last. Sithu Kyawhtin II returned with a 7000-strong army (2000 horses, 15 elephants). Though his army was outnumbered more than two-to-one, Sithu Kyawhtin I chose to make a stand. But Salin's defenses were breached on the second day. Inside the city, Sithu Kyawhtin I fought on atop his war elephant, and even engaged Sithu Kyawhtin II, who was also on his war elephant. In the end, Toungoo troops won the battle. Sithu Kyawhtin barely escaped, fleeing to the Chin Hills.|$|E
25|$|Konbaung {{was only}} one among many other {{resistance}} forces, at <b>Salin</b> along the middle Irrawaddy and Mogaung in the far north, which had independently sprung up across panicked Upper Burma. Fortunately for the resistance forces, the Hanthawaddy command mistakenly equated their capture of Ava with the victory over Upper Burma, and withdrew two-thirds of the invasion force back to Pegu, leaving just a third (less than 10,000 men) for what they considered a mop-up operation. Moreover, the Hanthawaddy leadership was concerned by the Siamese annexation of the upper Tenasserim peninsula (present-day Mon State) while Hanthawaddy troops were laying siege to Ava.|$|E

25|$|In retaliation, the Confederation, now {{consisted}} of seven Shan states, led by King Hkonmaing launched a major land and naval invasion (16,000 army troops, 1000 horses, 120 elephants, 1200 naval troops, 30 large war boats, 30 fast war boats, and 50 cargo ships) on 7 December 1543. However {{they could not}} break through Toungoo defenses which included 9000 naval and 12,000 army troops, and Portuguese firearms, and were driven back after one month. Bayinnaung followed up on the retreating Confederation armies, which made a stand at the key town of <b>Salin</b> on the Irrawaddy. Bayinnaung took the town after a three-day battle, after which Toungoo forces occupied {{as far north as}} Pagan (Bagan).|$|E
25|$|The quick fall of <b>Salin</b> {{forced the}} Confederation armies to {{evacuate}} Pagan, and retreat farther north yet again. Toungoo forces now marched {{up to and}} took Pagan. Though Ava was now just another 160km away, Tabinshwehti was unwilling to overstretch, and stopped the advance. At the ancient capital, he was crowned in the full ritual and ceremony of the great kings of Pagan. In order to consolidate his rule, he received oaths of allegiance by the hereditary chiefs and governors from the region, and appointed his loyalists to rule key towns. He set up sentinel garrisons at the new border with Ava. The king and the main army returned south in July/August 1544.|$|E
25|$|By 1822, Burmese {{expansion}} into Manipur and Assam {{had created a}} long border between British India and the Burmese Empire. The British, based in Calcutta, supported rebels from Manipur, Assam and Arakan fleeing into British territory. Calcutta unilaterally declared Cachar and Jaintia British protectorates, and sent in troops. Cross border raids into these newly acquired territories from British territories and spheres of influence vexed the Burmese. Convinced that war was inevitable, Burmese commander-in-chief, Maha Bandula, became a main proponent of offensive policy against the British. Bandula {{was part of the}} war party at Bagyidaw's court, which also included Queen Me Nu and her brother, the Lord of <b>Salin.</b> Bandula believed that a decisive victory could allow Ava to consolidate its gains in its new western empire in Arakan, Manipur, Assam, Cachar and Jaintia, as well as take over eastern Bengal.|$|E

25|$|Toungoo went on {{to conquer}} all of Hanthawaddy by mid-1541, gaining {{complete}} control of Lower Burma's manpower, access to foreign firearms and maritime wealth to pay for them. And Tabinshwehti would use these new found assets for further expansions. By incorporating Portuguese mercenaries, firearms and military tactics to the Toungoo armed forces, Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung continued to grow as military leaders. The duo also benefited from having experienced former Hanthawaddy military commanders like Saw Lagun Ein and Smim Payu serve as their top military advisers and generals. With their help, Bayinnaung delivered key decisive victories at the Battle of Padaung Pass (1542) against Prome's ally Arakan and the Battle of <b>Salin</b> (1544) against the Confederation, enabling Toungoo to take over central Burma {{as far north as}} Pagan (Bagan). After Bayinnaung crushed Arakanese forces in April 1542, Tabinshwehti was so pleased with the victory that he made Bayinnaung the heir-apparent of the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{allies were}} {{initially}} unprepared when Toungoo forces renewed {{the war against}} Prome in November 1541. Due to poor coordination, the armies of the Ava-led Confederation and Arakan were driven back by better organized Toungoo forces in April 1542, after which the Arakanese navy, which had already taken two key Irrawaddy delta ports, retreated. Prome surrendered a month later. The war then entered an 18-month hiatus during which Arakan left the alliance, and Ava underwent a contentious leadership change. In December 1543, the largest army and naval forces of Ava and the Confederation came down to retake Prome. But Toungoo forces, which had now enlisted foreign mercenaries and firearms, not only drove back the numerically superior invasion force but also took over all of Central Burma up to Pagan (Bagan) by April 1544. In the following dry season, a small Ava army raided down to <b>Salin</b> but was destroyed by larger Toungoo forces.|$|E

This knocked two tenths off Shin Geum-Dan near-seven-year-old record. The time was the championship record for five years, after which it was broken by Finland's Riitta <b>Salin,</b> and remained the French record for the 400m for much longer and was only improved upon in 1987 by Marie-José Pérec. Duclos broke another world record at the European Championships, teaming up with Barnadette Martin, Eliane Jacq and rival Besson in the 4×400 metres relay to run a time of 3:30.8 minutes. However, the team recorded the same time as Britain's women's team and despite sharing the world record, were only the silver medallists at the competition. For these feats she was chosen as that year's L'Équipe Champion of Champions, becoming only the second female winner of the award after Marielle Goitschel.|$|E
