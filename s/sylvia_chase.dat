500|$|The video {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Annie Temple from Philadelphia Daily News {{said that the}} release was [...] "not so flattering" [...] and [...] "was a sloppy job". Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times said that [...] "the video is sometimes distracting and blurry, wonder what went wrong during recording. The angles are awkward, especially when the audience members are shown touching Madonna's hand. Was it really necessary to show a fan coming unannounced on the stage?" [...] Terry Atkinson from the same paper said, [...] "This follows the typical concert video format of putting you in the best seat {{in the hall and}} letting the aura of a superior performer encaptivate your senses." [...] <b>Sylvia</b> <b>Chase</b> from The Wichita Eagle said that [...] "seeing Madonna live in an arena and seeing her up, close and personal in the tour cassette is totally different. The energy, the movements, the provocationâ€”all captures you more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave it a positive review, stating [...] "filmed with abrupt, swooping camera movements that accentuate the singer's flouncing, slightly ungainly style of dancing, Madonna Live vividly captures the contradictory elements that have made the performer into a cultural icon in spite of a shrill, limited singing voice. In close-up, Madonna's provocative pouts, wiggles and come-hither glances become a more than half-deliberate burlesque of erotic centerfold photography. Both her post-disco music and defiant strut suggest a child's parody of grown-up posturing." ...|$|E
