Harvard law professor and future Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter argued for their innocence in a widely read Atlantic Monthly article that was later published in book form. Sacco and Vanzetti were scheduled to die in April 1927, accelerating the outcry. Responding to a massive influx of telegrams urging their pardon, Massachusetts governor Alvan T. Fuller appointed a three-man commission to investigate the case. After weeks of <b>secret</b> <b>deliberation</b> that included interviews with the judge, lawyers, and several witnesses, the commission upheld the verdict. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in the electric chair just after midnight on August 23, 1927. Subsequent riots destroyed property in Paris, London, and other cities.|$|E

[...] No indictment or presentment can be made except by concurrence of at least twelve of the jurors. The grand jury may accuse upon their own knowledge, but it is generally done upon the testimony of witnesses under oath and other evidence heard before them.

Only after registering this assurance did we proclaim to the world that law. Presently, we are repeating that procedure." [...] Amid protests that he was uneducated, Fehmi was appointed by Atatürk as the Finance Minister on 24 April 1922 and served until 2 January 1925. During his career as a Finance Minister, Fehmi managed to provide needed provisions of the Turkish army after Turkish War of Independence. After serving as Finance Minister for three years, Fehmi became the Minister of Agriculture between 22 November 1924 and 3 March 1925.|$|R

A definitive version was published in : Law and Language: Current Legal Issues Volume 15 Michael Freeman and Fiona Smith [URL] development of a de facto precedent in EU law has recently {{been the subject of}} significant academic debate, centring round questions of what it means for a supreme court to ‘make law’ and when it is possible to say that its decisions are ‘precedents’. While there is no official doctrine of precedent in EU law, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) does on occasion appear to regard its previous decisions as establishing law that should be applied in later disputes and commentators generally agree that it appears that the CJEU has introduced a system of precedent and ‘tied down’ national courts without establishing a formal hierarchy in the strict sense (see, in particular, the Köbler and Larsy decisions). However, there is one important aspect of the CJEU’s multilingual case law that has been largely ignored in such debates: the fact that that case law is drafted by jurists in a language that is generally not their mother tongue and undergoes many permutations of translation into and out of up to 23 languages. Furthermore, the authentic version of each judgment is generally a translation of the text deliberated on (in <b>secret</b> <b>deliberations)</b> by the judges. The process behind the production of the CJEU’s multilingual jurisprudence should not be ignored. Thus, this paper analyses the operation of the CJEU and investigates the, thus-far wholly ignored, linguistic element {{in the development of a}} de facto precedent in the case law of that court...|$|R
50|$|At {{the meeting}} of the estates which opened in Paris in October 1356 le Coq played a leading role {{and was one of the}} most outspoken of the orators, {{especially}} when petitions were presented to the dauphin Charles, denouncing the bad government of the realm and demanding the banishment of the royal councillors. Soon, however, the credit of the estates having gone down, he withdrew to his diocese, but at the request of the bourgeois of Paris he speedily returned. The king of Navarre had succeeded in escaping from prison and had entered Paris, where his party was in the ascendant; and Robert le Coq became the most powerful person in his council. No one dared to contradict him, and he brought into it whom he pleased. He did not scruple to reveal to the king of Navarre <b>secret</b> <b>deliberations,</b> but his fortune soon turned. He ran great danger at the estates of Compiègne in May 1358, where his dismissal was demanded, and he had to flee to Saint-Denis, where Charles the Bad and Étienne Marcel came to find him. After the death of Marcel, he tried, unsuccessfully, to deliver Laon, his episcopal town, to the king of Navarre, and he was excluded from the amnesty promised in the treaty of Calais (1360) by King John to the partisans of Charles the Bad. His temporalities had been seized, and he was obliged to flee from France. In 1363, thanks to the support of the king of Navarre, he was given the bishopric of Calahorra in the kingdom of Aragon, which he administered until his death in 1373.|$|R

The candidate takes the oath of office over an open copy of the Constitution next to a Holy Bible. The oath of office used is: [...] "I swear/promise to faithfully carry out the duties of the position of president of the Government with loyalty to the King; to obey and enforce the Constitution as the fundamental law of the State, as well as to keep in <b>secret</b> the <b>deliberations</b> of the Council of Ministers".|$|R

5000|$|Circa 1996, Laura Kriho was {{the sole}} juror holdout in a drug {{possession}} trial, one eventually declared a mistrial. Kriho was found in contempt of court and charged with perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} for learning from the Internet that the defendant could face a four- to twelve-year prison term if convicted, a fact that had not been disclosed to the jury by the court. Additionally, while not asked about her opinions about the fairness of the drug laws or her own prior legal history, she was prosecuted for obstruction of justice for failing to volunteer this information on her own. The trial court found [...] "that Kriho had intended to obstruct the judicial process and that her actions had prevented the seating of a fair and impartial jury", but after four years of legal battles the charges were eventually dropped after a district court ruled that her statements during <b>secret</b> jury <b>deliberations</b> could not be used against her. It has been argued that improved protection of the holdout juror is a necessary and critical component to the preservation of a defendant's right to a fair trial.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the first}} place, they oblige their {{servants}} {{to keep a}} journal or diary of all their transactions, public and private: they are bound to do this by an express covenant. They oblige them, as a corrective upon that diary, to keep a letter-book, in which all their letters are to be regularly entered. And they are bound by the same covenant to produce all those books upon requisition, although they should be mixed with affairs concerning their own private negotiations and transactions of commerce, or their closest and most retired concerns in private life. But as the great corrective of all, they have contrived that every proceeding in public council shall be written,--no debates merely verbal. The arguments, first or last, are to be in writing, and recorded. All other bodies, the Houses of Lords, Commons, Privy Council, Cabinet Councils for <b>secret</b> state <b>deliberations,</b> enter only resolves, decisions, and final resolutions of affairs: the argument, the discussion, the dissent, does very rarely, if at all, appear. But the Company has proceeded much further, and done much more wisely, because they proceeded upon mercantile principles; and they have provided, either by orders or course of office, that all shall be written,--the proposition, the argument, the dissent. This {{is not confined to}} their great Council; but this order ought to be observed, as I conceive, (and I see considerable traces of it in practice,) in every Provincial Council, whilst the Provincial Councils existed, and even down to the minutest ramification of their service. These books, in a progression from the lowest Councils to the highest Presidency, are ordered to be transmitted, duplicate and triplicate, by every ship that sails to Europe. On this system an able servant of the Company, and high in their service, has recorded his opinion, and strongly expressed his sentiments. Writing to the Court of Directors, he says, [...] "It ought to be remembered, that the basis upon which you rose to power, and have been able to stand the shock of repeated convulsions, has been the accuracy and simplicity of mercantile method, which makes every transaction in your service and every expenditure a matter of record." ...|$|R
