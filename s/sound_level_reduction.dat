40|$|Transportation noise {{contains}} significant {{low frequency}} components. It {{is difficult to}} sound insulate buildings against transportation noise because wall cavities are only effective in increasing sound insulation above the mass-air-mass resonance frequency. Stud walls can also have a significant structural resonance in this low frequency range, {{although it is not}} yet clear if this is significant in the field. This paper gives typical diesel electric locomotive traffic noise, road traffic noise, aircraft traffic noise and other rail traffic noise spectra. The paper examines the sound insulation of measured wall sound insulation spectra against these typical transportation noise spectra using A-weighted <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>reduction.</b> This will be compared to the Rw + Ctr and Rw values of the walls. Another problem with low frequency sound insulation is the large uncertainty in both laboratory and field measurements.

40|$|Background: Although {{noise is}} one of the leading work-related health risk factors for teachers, many nursery schools lack {{sufficient}} noise reduction measures. Methods: This intervention study evaluated the noise exposure of nursery school teachers when dropping DUPLO toy bricks into storage cases. Sound analyses of the impact included assessment of the maximum sound pressure level (LAFmax) as well as frequency analyses with 1 / 3 octave band filter. For the purpose of standardization, a customized gadget was developed. Recordings were performed in 11 cases of different materials and designs to assess the impact on <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>reduction.</b> Thereby, the acoustic effects of three damping materials (foam rubber, carpet, and PU-foam) were investigated. Results: The lowest LAFmax was measured in cases consisting of “metal grid” (90. 71 dB) or of a woven willow “basket” (91. 61 dB), whereas a case of “aluminium” (103. 34 dB) generated the highest impact LAFmax. The frequency analyses determined especially low LAFmax in the frequency bands between 80 and 2500 Hz in cases designs “metal grid” and “basket”. The insertion of PU-foam achieved the most significant attenuation of LAFmax (− 13. 88 dB) and, in the frequency analyses, the best sound damping. Conclusion: The dropping of DUPLO bricks in cases contributes to the high noise level in nursery schools, but measured LAFmax show no evidence for the danger of acute hearing loss. However, continuous exposure may lead to functional impairment of the hair cells and trigger stress reactions. We recommend noise reduction by utilizing cases of woven “basket” with an insert of PU-foam...|$|E

The results were analyzed to indicate how inlet aeroacoustic characteristics were affected by inlet design and operating conditions.

This is particularly true for translating centerbody inlets with the centerbody extended in the approach and landing position. Operation to simulated take-off incidence angles of 50 deg was demonstrated with good inlet performance.

40|$|Introduction: The {{number of}} hearing {{impairments}} in Sweden is increasing. The largest increase {{is seen in}} ages 25 - 44. There are reasons to believe that these impairments are noise induced. Leisure time noise is not controlled {{in the same manner}} that industrial noise is. An ongoing conflict between city council officials and rock club owners, musicians and music event organizers about sound levels at smaller live music clubs exceeding the national sound level restrictions created the need for an acoustic intervention project. The purpose of that project was to lower the sound levels without compromising the artistic freedom of the musicians. Aim: The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the technical and acoustical procedures as well as the results of a complete acoustic intervention in one small club, where live music was played. The author’s participation in the acoustic project will also be described. Research and data collection methods: This was an applied, intervention study implemented in an explorative way. Results: An acoustic renovation of a small live music venue was accomplished, with new wall and ceiling material installed. The sound system was replaced and the stage was enlarged. Sound pressure level measurements during concerts before and after the intervention showed a <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> of 9 dB. Discussion: This intervention project showed that it is possible to decrease sound levels during concerts, the direct sound from stage and the sound level variation in a typical small live music venue. However, there are probably several music clubs where this is not possible. Many live music clubs have such poor basic conditions that no amplified music should be allowed to be presented at all. There is a great need for prophylaxis and prevention, and research in the areas of hearing and sound, and that is a job well suitable for audiologists in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{harmful effects}} of {{aircraft}} noise, with respect to both comfort and occupational health, have long since been recognised, with many examples of sound control now implemented in commercial aircraft. However, the single engine light aircraft cabin is still an extremely noisy environment, which apparently has been side-lined by both cost and weight constraints, especially with respect to low frequency sound reduction. Consequently, pilots and passengers of these aircraft are still exposed to potentially damaging noise levels and hearing damage can only be avoided by {{the proper use of}} ear defenders. Minimisation of the noise around the occupants of the aircraft reduces the dependency of personal ear defenders and is conducive to a more comfortable, hygienic and less stressful environment. This thesis describes the basis of a theoretical and experimental project, directed at the design and evaluation of a practical active noise control (ANC) system suitable for a single engine light aircraft. Results from initial experiments conducted in a single engine aircraft demonstrated the viability of ANC for this application. However, the extreme noise, the highly damped cabin, the multiple tone excitation, the severe weight limitations and the requirement of air worthiness certification severely complicated the problem of achieving noise reduction throughout the entire aircraft cabin. Compromising the objective to only achieving local control around the occupants still presented difficulties because the region of attenuated noise around the error sensors was so small that a nearby observer experienced no <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> whatsoever. The objective was therefore to move the control zone away from the error sensor and place a broad envelope of noise reduction immediately around the occupant's head, through the use of virtual sensors, thus creating the perception of global noise control. While virtual sensors are not new (Garcia-Bonito et al. (1996)), they are currently limited to acoustic pressure estimation (virtual microphones) via the initial measurement of an observer / sensor transfer function. In this research, new virtual sensor algorithms have been developed to: 1. minimise the sound level at the observer location, 2. broaden the control region, 3. adapt to any physical system changes and 4. produce a control zone that may ultimately follow an observer's head The performance of the virtual sensors were evaluated both analytically and experimentally in progressively more complex environments to identify their capabilities and limitations. It was found that the use of virtual sensors would, in general, attenuate the noise at the observer location more effectively than when using conventional remotely placed error sensors. Such a control strategy was considered to be ideal for a light single engine aircraft, because it would only require small light speakers (possibly fitted into a head-rest) to achieve a broad control zone that envelopes the region around the occupants heads.

40|$|The {{reduction}} is discussed of the discrete tones generated by jet engines which {{is essential for}} jet aircraft to meet present and proposed noise standards. The discrete tones generated by the blades and vanes propagate in the inlet and exhaust duct {{in the form of}} spiraling acoustic waves, or spinning modes. The reduction of these spinning modes by the cancellation effect of the combination of two acoustic fields was investigated. The spinning mode synthesizer provided the means for effective study of this noise reduction scheme. Two sets of electrical-acoustical transducers located in an equally-spaced circular array simultaneously generate a specified spinning mode and the cancelling mode. Analysis of the wave equation for the synthesizer established the optimum cancelling array acoustic parameters for maximum <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> <b>reduction.</b> The parameter dependence of the frequency ranges of propagation of single, specified circumferential modes generated by a single array, and of effective cancellation of the modes generated by two arrays, was determined.

40|$|A {{method to}} reduce the {{acoustic}} noise generated by gradient systems in MRI has been recently proposed; such a method {{is based on the}} linear response theory. Since the physical cause of MRI acoustic noise is the time derivative of the gradient current, a common trapezoid current shape produces an acoustic gradient coil response mainly during the rising and falling edge. In the falling edge, the coil acoustic response presents a 180 degrees phase difference compared to the rising edge. Therefore, by varying the width of the trapezoid and keeping the ramps constant, it is possible to suppress one selected frequency and its higher harmonics. This value is matched to one of the prominent resonance frequencies of the gradient coil system. The idea of cancelling a single frequency is extended to a second frequency, using two successive trapezoid-shaped pulses presented at a selected interval. Overall <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> of 6 and 10 dB is found for the two trapezoid shapes and a single pulse shape, respectively.

40|$|Noise induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) {{is the most}} common {{occupational}} disease among workers in the mining industry. Previous studies conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have shown that approximately 90 % of coal miners and 49 % of metal/non-metal miners have a hearing impairment by age 50. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has determined that continuous mining machines rank first among all equipment in underground coal mining whose operators exceed 100 % noise dosage. The conveying system is one of the principal noise sources on continuous mining machines, due to metal on metal impacts that occur between chain flights and the conveyor deck. A highly durable polyurethane coating has been developed for the chain flights to decrease noise generated by these impacts. A continuous mining machine retro-fitted with coated flight bars has achieved overall <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>reductions</b> of 5 - 7 dB in a laboratory setting.

40|$|The paper reviews 50 {{years of}} {{research}} investigating jet noise reduction through fluidic injection. Both aqueous and gaseous injection concepts for supersonic and subsonic jet exhausts are discussed. Aqueous injection reduces jet noise by reducing main jet temperature through evaporation and main jet velocity through momentum transfer between water droplets and the main jet. In the launch vehicle environment where large quantities of fluid {{do not have to}} be carried with the vehicle, water injection is very effective at reducing excess overpressures. For in-flight use, aqueous injection is problematic as most studies show that either large quantities of water or high injection pressures are required to achieve noise reduction. The most effective noise reduction injection systems require water pressures above 2000 kPa (290 psi) and water-to-mainjet mass flow rates above 10 % to achieve overall <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> <b>reductions</b> of roughly 6 dB in the peak jet noise direction. Injection at lower pressure (roughly 1034 kPa or 150 psi) has resulted in a 1. 6 EPNdb reduction in effective perceived noise level. Gaseous injection reduces noise through jet plume modifications resulting from the introduction of streamwise vorticity in the main jet. In subsonic single-stream jets, air injection usually produces the largest overall <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> <b>reductions</b> (roughly 2 dB) in the peak jet noise direction. In dual-stream jets, properly designed injection systems can reduce overall <b>sound</b> pressure <b>levels</b> and effective perceived noise levels but care must be taken to choose injector designs that limit <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> increases at high frequencies. A reduction of 1. 0 EPNdB has been achieved with injection into the fan and core streams. However, air injection into dual-stream subsonic jets has received little attention and the potential for noise reduction is uncertain at this time. For dual-stream supersonic jets, additional research needs to be conducted to determine if reductions can be achieved with injection pressures available from current aircraft engines. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a weak sound {{radiating}} cell is proposed to reduce the low frequency radiated noise from structures. The cell consists of two coupled surfaces such that, when placed on a vibrating structure, {{the responses of the}} two surfaces are nearly out-of-phase and of equal strength over a wide frequency range. This structure response leads the cell to behave as an acoustic dipole and thus as a poor sound radiating source. The control of low frequency structurally radiated noise is then achieved by covering the structure with an array of these weak radiating cells, i. e. surface treatment. Thus, the surface treatment essentially transforms the response of the structure to that of a distributed array of dipoles yielding a low sound radiating structure. Theoretical models are developed to predict the performance of the cell. Experimental verification is performed for a single cell applied to a piston-like structure to demonstrate the concept on a simple radiating structure. The results demonstrated an overall <b>sound</b> power <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> of 5. 2 dB between 400 - 1600 Hz with maximum reductions over 30 dB at discrete frequencies. Finally, an array of weak radiating cells is experimentally applied to a more complex structure, a rectangular plate.

In this work, active robust feedback control of the noise due to this non-predictable excitation is investigated. ^ Both an analytical model and experimental investigations are used to determine the characteristics of the flow induced structural sound radiation problem. The problem is shown to be broadband in nature with large system uncertainties associated with the various operating conditions. Furthermore the delay associated with sound propagation is shown to restrict the use of microphone feedback. The state of the art control methodologies, μ synthesis and adaptive feedback control, are evaluated and shown to have limited success for solving this problem. ^ A robust frequency domain controller design methodology is developed for the problem of sound radiated from turbulent flow driven plates. The control design methodology uses frequency domain sequential loop shaping techniques. System uncertainty, <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> <b>reduction</b> performance, and actuator constraints are included in the design process.

The control performance in terms of <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> <b>reduction,</b> however, seems to be independent of the initial resonator-locations. Optimal solutions obtained from the SA approach are shown to outperform other existing methods for a TAR array design. Numerical simulations are systematically verified by experiments. Optimal locations are then synthesized, leading to a set of criteria, applicable to the present configuration, to guide engineering applications. It is concluded that the proposed optimization approach provides a systematic and effective tool to optimize the locations of TARs in noise control inside enclosures.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{reliable}} estimations of the impact sound insulation between rooms, {{it is necessary to}} know the acoustic performance of each element composing the floors. The contribution of the flanking transmissions, the attenuation of floating floors and the weighted normalized impact <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> of the basic structure need to be determined in order to apply the simplified calculation method according to the EN ISO 12354 - 2 standard. With the aim of verifying the range of validity of the calculation method proposed by the EN ISO 12354 - 2 standard for typical basic beam floor structures, a research based on on-site measurements was conducted. This paper provides an analysis in terms of spectrum trend, predicted average weighted normalized impact <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> and <b>reduction</b> of impact <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> obtainable with a generic floating floor typology. The study can represent a starting point for a correct estimation of the impact sound insulation in new buildings and renovation plans...|$|R
40|$|This Technical Memorandum (TM) {{discusses}} the harmonic and random plane acoustic waves propagating from inside a duct to its surroundings. Various duct surfaces are considered, such as rigid, flexible, and impedance. In addition, {{the effects of}} a mean flow are studied when the duct alone is considered. Results show a significant reduction in overall <b>sound</b> pressure <b>levels</b> downstream of the impedance wall for both mean flow and no mean flow cases and for a narrow duct. When a wider duct is used, the overall <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> (OSPL) <b>reduction</b> downstream of the impedance wall is much smaller. In the far field, the directivity is such that the overall <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> is reduced by about 5 decibels (dB) {{on the side of the}} impedance wall. When a flexible surface is used, the far field directivity becomes asymmetric with an increase in the OSPL on the side of the flexible surface of about 7 dB...|$|R
30|$|Charting the {{differences}} between measured levels and predictions for free-field sound propagation 6 highlights contingencies of source and receiver locations (e.g., their surrounding architectural and landform acoustics), as well as possible effects of environmental conditions during the survey (documented as described in “Research design and implementation: a comparative method for acoustical field survey at Huánuco Pampa” section). We use the measure of free-field propagation specifically because it assumes no acoustical interactions, the sum of which {{we expect to see}} in the difference between measured and predicted values. Without interactions between source and receiver, <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> would be expected to reduce as the square of the receiver’s distance from the source, per the discussion of direct sound dynamics in Howard and Angus [38, p. 279 – 81]. Surfaces in the path of sound propagation provide reflective reinforcement of <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> or damping <b>reductions</b> as a function of frequency (including phase interactions), material, and incidence angle; measured levels are assumed to be the composite result of these effects, including atmospheric/air absorption.|$|R
40|$|Active control {{solutions}} {{appear to}} be a feasible approach to cope with the steadily increasing requirements for noise reduction in the transportation industry. Active controllers tend to be designed with a target on the <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> <b>reduction.</b> However, the perceived control efficiency for the occupants can be more accurately assessed if psychoacoustic metrics can be taken into account. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate, numerically and experimentally, the effect of a feedback controller on the sound quality of a vehicle mockup excited with engine noise. The proposed simulation scheme is described and experimentally validated. The engine excitation is provided by a sound quality equivalent engine simulator, running on a real-time platform that delivers harmonic excitation in function of the driving condition. The controller performance is evaluated in terms of specific loudness and roughness. It is shown that the use of a quite simple control strategy, such as a velocity feedback, can result in satisfactory loudness reduction with slightly spread roughness, improving the overall perception of the engine sound.
