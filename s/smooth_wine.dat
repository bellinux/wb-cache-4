25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, <b>smooth</b> <b>wine</b> with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E
5000|$|To {{many in the}} 1st century BC, Caecuban was {{the best}} of all <b>wines,</b> <b>smoother</b> than Falernian <b>wine,</b> fuller than Alban wine, strong and intoxicating. It was a white wine which turned fire-coloured as it aged. Dioscorides {{describes}} it as glykys [...] "sweet". Athenaeus describes it as overpowering and strong, maturing only after many years time (Deipnosophistae, I.27a).|$|R
5000|$|Montepulciano ripens {{late and}} has a {{tendency}} to favor producing large yields. The grapes can be plump with a low skin to juice ratio. However, the skin has a fair amount of pigmented tannins and color producing phenols that with maceration can produce either a deep ruby colored wine or a pink Cerasuolo wine. Compared to most Italian varieties, Montepulciano has moderately low acidity and more mild (i.e. softer) than bitter edged tannins. Wine expert Oz Clarke describes Montepulciano as producing a [...] "round, plummy and weighty red with ripe tannins, good acidity and a low price tag." [...] Jancis Robinson evaluates Montepulciano as a [...] "promising variety" [...] that produces <b>smooth,</b> drinkable <b>wines</b> that can improve for three or four years after vintage.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} effect of the language used in a rating task on consumer’s preferences. Consumers who rated a product during while consuming it on fancy attributes (e. g., How velvety is the wine?) liked the product more than those who rated the same product on non-fancy attributes (e. g., How <b>smooth</b> is the <b>wine?).</b> In answering a rating question, consumers seem to engage in confirmatory hypothesis testing, which biases overall evaluations. Consumers seem unaware of the persuasive impact of scale labels and therefore do not activate any resistance that would occur in response to an explicit persuasive appeal...|$|R
5000|$|... "I Wish I Was in Glasgow" [...] {{was written}} by Connolly in 1983 and {{released}} on his album A Change Is As Good As Arrest. With the lines [...] "I would take you there and show you, but they've pulled the building down" [...] and [...] "they bulldozed it all to make a road", he laments that the section of Dover Street on which he was born, between Breadalbane and Claremont Streets, was demolished around a decade earlier. This version omits the first verse: Oh I wish I was in Glasgow / With some good old friends of mine / Some good old rough companions / And some good old <b>smooth</b> red <b>wine</b> / We could talk about the old days / And the shipyard's sad decline / And drink to the boys on the road. Also, {{on the rare occasions}} he performed the song live, prior to its inclusion here, friends became pals and and when I think about it became and any time it's in my mind.|$|R
5000|$|Port {{became very}} popular in England after the Methuen Treaty of 1703, when merchants were {{permitted}} to import it at a low duty, while war with France deprived English wine drinkers of French wine. Contrary to popular belief, Port was not created by British sailors by spiking the wine with brandy to avoid spoilage during the long voyage north. More accurately, British importers could be credited for recognizing that a <b>smooth,</b> already fortified <b>wine</b> that would appeal to English palates would coincidentally survive the trip to London. In 1678, a Liverpool wine merchant sent two new representatives to Viana do Castelo, north of Oporto, to learn the wine trade. While on a vacation in the Douro, the two gentlemen visited the Abbot of Lamego, who treated them to a [...] "very agreeable, sweetish and extremely smooth" [...] wine," [...] which had been fortified with a distilled spirit. The two Englishmen were so pleased with the product that they purchased the Abbot's entire lot and shipped it home.|$|R
