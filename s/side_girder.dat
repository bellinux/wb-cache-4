60|$|Above him {{he heard}} another snap, and the frail {{platform}} began to rock. Glancing over his shoulder, {{he saw that}} his companions were all safe upon the <b>side</b> <b>girder.</b> A strange line of terrified castaways they appeared as they clung in an ungainly row to the trellis-work of steel. But their feet were on the iron support. With two quick steps and a spring he was at their side. At the same instant the murderer, hammer in hand, jumped the gap. They had one vision of him there--a vision which will haunt their dreams--the convulsed face, the blazing eyes, the wind-tossed raven locks. For a moment he balanced himself upon the swaying platform. The next, with a rending crash, he and it were gone. There {{was a long silence}} and then, far down, the thud and clatter of a mighty fall.|$|E

5000|$|A {{single-sided}} front swingarm suspension {{was used}} on the Yamaha GTS1000, introduced in 1993. The GTS used the RADD, Inc. front suspension designed by James Parker. A single <b>sided</b> <b>girder</b> fork was use on the German Imme R100 motorcycle between 1949 and 1951, and the Vespa scooter has a single-sided trailing-link fork. More recently, between 1998 and 2003, the ItalJet [...] "Dragster" [...] scooter also used a single-sided swingarm suspension, though unlike the GTS1000 there was no upper control arm; {{the upper part of}} the suspension on the Dragster served only to transmit steering input.|$|R
5000|$|Three of the ships, HMS General Wolfe, Lord Clive and Prince Eugene, {{were to be}} {{converted}} to take the BL 18-inch guns that had originally been allocated to [...]The guns were mounted aft, permanently arranged to fire over the starboard beam. The mounting consisted of two massive <b>side</b> <b>girders</b> parallel to the barrel, between which the gun was slung. At the forward end was a support about which the gun could train in a limited arc, with a hydraulic cylinder providing ten degrees of traverse {{each side of the}} mounting center line. The gun was loaded at the fixed angle of 10 degrees, but firing was only allowed between 22 degrees and 45 degrees of elevation, to distribute the large firing forces evenly between the forward and after supports. The mounting was covered by a large non-traversing half-inch steel plate shield fixed to the deck.|$|R
40|$|In the modal {{analysis}} of cable-stayed bridges using the finite element approach, the single-girder model or the double-girder model is often adopted for modeling the bridge deck. These two models are simple {{and easy to}} embody in commercial software packages, but the warping stiffness (constant) of bridge deck cannot be properly taken into consideration. This paper thus presents a triple-girder model consisting of one central <b>girder</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>girders</b> symmetrically connected to each other by transverse links. The proposed triple-girder model can easily consider the warping stiffness and other section properties of the bridge deck, {{and at the same}} time keep the user-friendly features in the single-girder model. The Nanpu cable-stayed bridge, built recently in China, is then taken as a case study to verify the rationality of the proposed triple-girder model through a comparison with measured data. The study shows that the modal properties of the cable-stayed bridge obtained from the {{modal analysis}} using the triple-girder model are more reasonable and close to the measured data. Further studies of four more cable-stayed bridges in China highlight that the extent of the warping effect depends greatly on the type of bridge deck and on the type of bridge tower-cable system. A simple approach for estimating some section properties of typical open-section decks is also suggested to further facilitate the use of the triple-girder model.

50|$|None {{of these}} bridges {{are known to}} survive in their balloon form, {{although}} a girder from one was later re-used for bridge widening work (1861) across the Coity road near Bridgend and survived there. The Coity Road bridge had been built before this date, but was widened to accommodate the new Llynvi Valley Railway. One {{side of the bridge}} was moved outwards to accommodate a new siding and a balloon girder installed on that <b>side.</b> This <b>girder</b> (especially as it was installed after Brunel's death) is thought to have previously been used elsewhere on the SWR, although its original date and location is unknown.|$|R
50|$|It has {{history of}} series of delays since its inception. The {{irrigation}} component of this dam in Medak district {{is not yet}} implemented.On October 1999, 1 of 17 radial spillway gates failed on the Singur Dam in Andhra Pradesh,India. This failure occurred during initial filling of the reservoir when the water level was9.8 feet (3 meters) below design level. The gate became dislodged due to a detachment of theleft <b>side</b> trunnion <b>girder.</b> The right <b>side</b> arm supported the gate for 22 hours before becomingcompletely dislodged and washing away. The Andhra Pradesh State authorities attributedthe failure of the gate to inadequate welding between the trunnion girder and the tie flats(Mande et al., 2000).

The contents of the book are logically organized and divided into twenty-one chapters. The book covers structural arrangement with longitudinal and transverse framing systems based on the service load, and explains basic structural elements like hatch <b>side</b> <b>girders,</b> hatch end beams, stringers, etc. along with structural subassemblies like floors, bulkheads, inner bottom, decks and shells. It presents in detail double bottom construction, wing tanks & duct keels, fore & aft end structures, etc., together with necessary illustrations. The midship sections of various ship types are introduced, together with structural continuity and alignment in ship structures. With regard to construction materials, the book discusses steel, aluminum alloys and fiber reinforced composites. Various methods of steel material preparation are discussed, and plate cutting and forming of plates and sections are explained. The concept of line heating for plate bending is introduced. Welding power source characteristics, metal transfer mechanisms, welding parameters and their effects on the fusion zone, weld deposit, and weld bead profile are discussed in detail. Various fusion welding methods, MMAW, GMAW, SAW, Electroslag welding and Electrogas welding and single side welding are explained in detail. Friction stir welding {{as one of the}} key methods of solid state welding as applied to aluminum alloys is also addressed. The mechanisms of residual stress formation and distortion are explained in connection with stiffened panel fabrication, with an emphasis on weld induced buckling of thin panels. Further, the basic principles of distortion prevention, in-process distortion control and mitigation techniques like heat sinking, thermo-mechanical tensioning etc. are dealt with in detail. In its final section, the book describes in detail various types of weld defects that are likely to occur, together with their causes and remedial measures. The nondestructive testing methods that are most relevant to ship construction are explained. Lastly, a chapter on accuracy control based on statistical principles is included, addressing the need for a suitable mechanism to gauge the ranges of variations so that one can quantitatively target the end product accuracy...|$|R

50|$|When {{examined}} by the driver and fireman, one of the cast iron girders of the bridge {{was found to have}} fractured, unusually, near to one of the abutments rather than at the centre of the beam. The track was supported by a pair of identical girders with Barlow rails cut to length laid across the inner flange, with asphalted ballast on top, just below the sleepers. When Captain Henry Whatley Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate examined the fracture surface, he found it rusted over, but the evidence of those who had seen it first, showed just what had happened. The cast iron girder had broken vertically from an enormous defect in the web and flanges, where there was a complete gap between the <b>sides.</b> The <b>girder</b> was completely defective here, but why no one had spotted it before the accident remains a mystery. Tyler suggests that it may have grown from an internal void with time, simply because such a defect would surely have been discovered either by the foundry or the builders. The girder had been installed 23 years before, in 1837, and should have supported a central load of 90 tons if in good condition. The pair of girders should have supported a total load of 360 tons distributed over all the structure, and Tyler stated that the girder was much bigger than was needed for the job. The engine weighed 31 tons and the tender 18 tons.|$|R
40|$|The end {{corrosion}} {{in steel}} girders {{at the bearings}} due to joint leakage is a significant problem {{in many of the}} old bridges around the nation. This critical damage impairs the shear and bearing capacities of girders. Research has been conducted investigating a novel method for retrofitting the corroded ends of steel bridge girders using ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) encasings. The repair involves casting thin UHPC panels on each <b>side</b> of <b>girder</b> web. Shear studs welded to undamaged portion of the web and flange engage the UHPC panels and provide an alternate load path. This repair method is expected to be superior to the current practice of attaching steel cover plates. It can be easier to design and install, reduce obstruction to traffic during the repair, prevent future corrosion to the girder end, and reduce the total cost of repair. To investigate the effectiveness of the repair in recovering the capacity of the corrosion damaged girders, three large-scale experiments were performed on the undamaged, damaged and repaired rolled girders. It was found that a 1 3 / 4 -in. thick UHPC panel cast two-third of the height of the girder effectively restores the bearing capacity. A high fidelity finite element model was created from the results of the large-scale experiments. This model was then used to design eight repair techniques for full size plate and rolled girders with heavy corrosion damage. This innovative repair method may offer the bridge design community a superior alternative retrofit method for large scale application on the nation’s aging bridge infrastructure...|$|R

30|$|The {{results show}} that the damage of cutting one of the {{prestressing}} strands (girder PS- 2) resulted in 18.44  % loss in flexural capacity compared to that of the undamaged control girder (PS- 1). The CFRP repair of damaged girders (PS- 3 to PS- 10) restored their capacity and exceeded the capacity of the undamaged control girder PS- 1 by up to 37.63  %. The results also show that U-shaped discrete strips or wraps of CFRP sheets of girders PS- 3 to PS- 8 enhanced the flexural capacity even if the girders were not fully wrapped with continuous wrapping covering the entire <b>girder</b> <b>sides.</b> U-wrappings covered the entire girders (PS- 9 and PS- 10) using 2 layers of CFRP (soffit and U-wraps). However, the U-wraps applied to PS- 10 were overlapped by an inch (25.4  mm), whereas the U-wraps applied to PS- 9 were not overlapped. By comparing the two fully wrapped girders (PS- 9 and PS- 10), an increase in the flexural capacity was observed for the girder with an overlap of its wraps (PS- 10). That overlapping of transverse U-wraps is needed to develop proper continuity; even in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the fibers. That is in addition to overlapping the fibers along their length for lap splices, as indicated in ACI 440.2 R- 08.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the British high mast in its fully developed state at Cardington, and its operation, is abridged from Masefield.Mooring masts were developed {{to act as a}} safe open harbour to which airships could be moored or unmoored in any weather, and at which they could receive (hydrogen or helium) gas, fuel, stores and payload.The Cardington mast, completed in 1926, was an eight <b>sided</b> steel <b>girder</b> structure, 200 ft high, tapering from 70 ft diameter at ground level to 26 ft at the passenger platform, 170 ft from the ground. Above the passenger platform was the 30 ft of the conical housing for the mooring gear. A lower platform 142 ft above the ground accommodated searchlights and signalling gear in a gallery 4 ft wide.The top platform, at the height of 170 ft, from which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was 40 ft in diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet. The top rail of the parapet formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with the wind. An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, encircled by a stairway to provide foot access.The upper portion of the tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret surmounted by a truncated cone with its top 23 ft above the passenger platform. A three-part telescopic arm, mounted on gimbals, projected through an opening at the top, free to swing from the vertical in any direction up to 30 degrees of movement. The top of the arm consisted of a bell-shaped cup mounted to rotate on ball bearings.A cable extended through the bell-mouth which, linked to a cable dropped from airship to be moored, enabled the nose of the airship to be drawn down until a cone on the nose locked home into the cup and so secured the airship to the tower. The telescopic arm was then centred, locked in the vertical position, and made free to rotate on a vertical axis so the airship could swing, nose to tower, in any direction of the wind.In the machinery house {{at the base of the}} tower three steam-driven winches operated the hauling gear through drums 5 ft in diameter to give cable hauling speeds of 50 feet a minute.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According to {{the need}} of {{production}} and development, the coal unloading wharves of yihua harbor in the lower changjiang river need to be expanded and reconstructed. In the reconstruction, the main body can only be reinforced, not be dismounted, and the reconstruction project can not affect the unloading, {{so it is with}} great difficulty. The available plan of the reconstruction is researched and adopted. The inner force of crane girder and bridging beam is calculated by using the theory of elasticity support continuous beam. The piles are assigned with reason, the differential settlement between the new and the old building is nearly eliminated, and the bearing condition of the main structure is improved. So it is needless to carry through driving pile over water or subbottom reinforcing pile foundation under the cross frame of the former wharf. The key technology is boring a pile driving hole in added pile position on the wharf deck of the crane <b>girder</b> <b>side,</b> then to drive the precast piles through the hole {{on the deck of the}} wharf with the land vibrating pile driver. The strict restrict of driving piles on the water avoided, at the same time, the coal unloading is not affected. Pile driving on the wharf deck less difficult condition than that one on the water. The practice indicated that this methods is reliable. So it has great guidance meaning to the similar wharf reconstruction project, especially as some ones in which the bearing capacity of the piles can not meet the need under the cross bend frame...|$|R
