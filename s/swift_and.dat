5|$|Many of Tom Swift's fictional inventions {{describe}} actual {{technological developments}} or predate technologies now considered commonplace. Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers (1911) {{was based on}} Charles Parsons's attempts to synthesize diamonds using electric current. Tom <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> His Photo Telephone was published in 1912. Sending photographs by telephone was not fully developed until 1925. Tom <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> His Wizard Camera (1912) features a portable movie camera, not invented until 1923. Tom <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> His Electric Locomotive (1922) was published {{two years before the}} Central Railroad of New Jersey began using the first diesel electric locomotive. The house on wheels that Tom invents for 1929's Tom <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> His House on Wheels pre-dated the first house trailer by a year.Tom <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> His Diving Seacopter (1952) features a flying submarine similar to one planned by the United States Department of Defense four years later in 1956,. Other inventions of Tom's have not happened, such as the device for silencing airplane engines that he invents in Tom <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> His Magnetic Silencer (1941).|$|E
5|$|A Tom Swift media project {{finally came}} to {{fruition}} in 1983 when Willie Aames appeared as Tom Swift along with Lori Loughlin as Linda Craig in a television special, The Tom <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> Linda Craig Mystery Hour, which was broadcast on July 3. It was a ratings failure. In 2007, digital studio Worldwide Biggies acquired movie rights to Tom <b>Swift.</b> <b>and</b> announced plans to release a feature film and video game, followed by a television series. As of 2015, these plans had not come to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Swift did {{not fully}} embrace his popularity, but he enjoyed it. On his birthday, 30 November 1727, {{a large group of}} men came to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray and {{afterwards}} celebrate throughout the city. This gathering commemorated <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> his letters and also protested against the harsh British treatment of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 edition {{featured}} {{live performances}} from Times Square by Carrie Underwood, Miley Cyrus, and the Jonas Brothers. Fergie hosted concert segments from Hollywood, which also featured performances by Akon, Natasha Bedingfield, Sean Kingston, OneRepublic, Plain White T's, Taylor <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> will.i.am. Seacrest's increased role as host was recognized beginning on the 2009 edition, where the special was officially branded as Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest. It featured live performances by the Jonas Brothers, Taylor <b>Swift,</b> <b>and</b> Lionel Richie, with Kellie Pickler {{serving as a}} correspondent. Hollywood segments featured performances by Fall Out Boy, Jesse McCartney, Natasha Bedingfield, Ne-Yo, The Pussycat Dolls, Solange, Robin Thicke and will.i.am.|$|E

50|$|Taxonomists {{have long}} {{classified}} <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> treeswifts as {{relatives of the}} hummingbirds, a judgment corroborated by {{the discovery of the}} Jungornithidae (apparently swift-like hummingbird-relatives) and of primitive hummingbirds such as Eurotrochilus. Traditional taxonomies place the hummingbird family (Trochilidae) in the same order as the <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> treeswifts (and no other birds); the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy treated this group as a superorder in which the swift order was called Trochiliformes.|$|R

5|$|The {{flight of}} the Alpine chough is <b>swift</b> <b>and</b> acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high {{manoeuvrability}} is accomplished by fanning the tail, folding its wings, and soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{group have}} become friends with singer-songwriter Taylor <b>Swift,</b> <b>and</b> {{together}} they have visited Catalina and Maui, Hawaii. In {{the summer of}} 2015, Haim opened for Taylor Swift at select dates on The 1989 World Tour. The group were nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Danielle was injured in an accident just before the awards, but shortly afterwards tweeted that she was recovering.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} of the stockyards was due to both the concentration of railroads {{and the evolution of}} refrigerated railroad cars. Its decline was due to further advances in post-World War II transportation and distribution. Direct sales of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate trucking, made it cheaper to slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards. At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in the Yards in the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|In {{form and}} habits, however, {{they are very}} similar to both caprimulgiform group - or, at first glance, to small owls with huge eyes. The {{ancestors}} of the <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> hummingbirds, two groups of birds which are morphologically very specialized, seem to have looked very similar to a small owlet-nightjar, possessing strong legs and a wide gape, while the legs and feet are very reduced in today's <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> hummingbirds, and the bill is narrow in the latter.|$|R

5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E

5|$|Although dragonflies are <b>swift</b> <b>and</b> agile fliers, some predators {{are fast}} enough to catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E
5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine <b>Swift</b> <b>and</b> the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E
50|$|Resemblances between <b>swifts</b> <b>and</b> {{swallows}} {{are due to}} convergent evolution, reflecting similar life styles {{based on}} catching insects in flight.|$|R
50|$|John Thomas Bayley (August 1868 - after 1899), {{generally}} {{known as}} Tom Bayley, was an English professional footballer who played {{as a right}} back.

5|$|Jervis {{was also}} {{recognised}} by {{both political and}} military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy {{that made him a}} controversial figure. He took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. St Vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his <b>swift</b> <b>and</b> often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become <b>swift</b> <b>and</b> effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E
