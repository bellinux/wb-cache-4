40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, {{aerodynamic}} noise from a forward-facing step is numerically investigated for Reynolds number {{based on the}} step height, Reh= 8, 000 and flow Mach number, M= 0. 03. A three-dimensional flow over the forward-facing step is calculated by the incompressible large eddy simulation (LES), while its acoustic field is solved by the linearized compressible perturbed equations (LPCE). The space-time characteristics of the surface pressure over the step and the flow strucuture low-dimensionalized by a filtered proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method indicate two different noise generation mechanisms at St= 0. 1 & 0. 4 ~ 0. 8. The low frequency noise is generated by a flapping motion of <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer.</b> <b>The</b> high frequency noise is, however, generated by the breaking-off of <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer,</b> due to <b>the</b> Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. A dominant noise source for the forward-facing step with an extended span {{will be expected to}} be around the step-corner (step front-face and leading-edge over the step) rather than near <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> reattachment point because the spanwise coherence length for <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> flapping mode is much longer than that for <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> breaking-off mode...|$|R

40|$|Turbulence {{suppression}} in {{the near}} field of a free shear flow under controlled excitation is investigated in four circular jets, a plane jet, and a plane mixing <b>layer.</b> <b>The</b> suppression {{is a consequence of}} an excitation-induced modification of <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> structure and occurs at the excitation frequency corresponding to the maximally unstable disturbance frequency of <b>the</b> initial free <b>shear</b> <b>layer.</b> <b>The</b> most pronounced suppression occurs when <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> is excited at a frequency 40 % higher than the natural roll-up frequency.

40|$|When a stably {{stratified}} density interface {{is embedded}} in a region of strong velocity shear, hydrodynamic instabilities result. These instabilities {{lead to the development}} of a turbulent flow in which vertical mixing of the density field takes place. Much previous research in the field of stratified shear instability has concentrated on what has become the canonical mode in such flows – the Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability. This is one of two instabilities that are present in what is termed the symmetric case, where the centres of <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> and density interface coincide.

For array measurements {{in this type}} of tunnels the acoustic array is typically placed outside the flow field - beside or above the test section.

40|$|Abstract: To {{model the}} regular spacing of the thrust faults in duplexes we subject {{a single layer}} {{embedded}} in an overlying viscous fluid, and an underlying rigid medium, to combined layer-parallel shortening and <b>shear.</b> <b>The</b> <b>layer</b> is a rigid-plastic solid at yield. A cusp introduced as a small perturbation on <b>the</b> upper <b>layer</b> interface perturbs <b>the</b> flow. <b>The</b> lower <b>layer</b> interface is weak and remains fiat throughout the deformation, whereas the upper interface is deformable and can assimilate both weak and strong conditions. If the upper interface is strong it folds into a broad open fold.

40|$|When a {{horizontal}} cover plate is placed above a cavity, the mechanism leading to enhanced self-sustained oscillation within the cavity is investigated by experiment at a Reynolds number Re-theta o = 171 +/- 5. As {{the leading edge}} of the cover plate is located right above the most sensitive region of <b>the</b> cavity <b>shear</b> <b>layer,</b> <b>the</b> oscillating amplitude of shear layer instability is enhanced most effectively. However, this effectiveness decreases when {{the leading edge of}} the cover plate moves further downstream of the cavity. Three mechanisms are found to possibly modify <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> instability across <b>the</b> cavity. First of all, insertion of {{a horizontal}} cover plate above the cavity does impose a favourable streamwise pressure gradient that accelerates the flow across the cavity. This flow acceleration increases the amplification rate of <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> instability. Second, <b>the</b> boundary <b>layer</b> characteristics (both <b>the</b> frequency band and the fluctuating amplitude) may also provide another opportunity to perturb <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> instability. Third, <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> is deflected into the cavity and leads to strong feedback. In the present study, all three mechanisms are equally important when {{the leading edge of the}} cover plate is positioned above the cavity mouth. However, when the leading edge of the cover plate is located downstream of the cavity, the first and the second effects diminish.

40|$|When a {{free jet}} (or open jet) {{is used as}} a wind tunnel to {{simulate}} the effects of flight on model noise sources, it is necessary to calibrate out the effects of <b>the</b> free jet <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> on <b>the</b> transmitted sound, since <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> is absent in the real flight case. In this paper, a theoretical calibration procedure for this purpose is first summarized; following this, the results of an experimental program, designed to test the validity of the various components of the calibration procedure, are described.

A <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> is formed at the boundary between the incoming flow and the ambient fluid in the compartment. The impingement of <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> on <b>the</b> opposite wall of the compartment gives rise to periodic vortex formation and highly organized oscillations in <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer.</b> When a density interface is present inside the compartment, resonance conditions were set up when the oscillations of the internal standing waves were “locked in” with <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> oscillations.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{numerical}} investigation of <b>the</b> free <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> effects under various situations: the variation in <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> thickness, in <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> shape, in <b>the</b> flow speed, in the source frequency and in the flow type (averaged mean flow including non parallel flow effects or turbulent flow). In this way, a systematical and detailed analysis of <b>the</b> free <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> effects is provided with {{the evaluation of the}} state of the art correction method (Amiet's apporach). Using a hybrid Computational AeroAcoustics method, the mean flow gradient effects and the turbulence effects were treated seperately to study their influences on both two-dimensional and three-dimensional sound propagation. These results offer insights into the variation of <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> effects with each parameter. The correction method (Amiet's approach) is proven to be efficient in 2 D and specific 3 D (planar <b>shear</b> <b>layer)</b> situations. <b>The</b> error due to <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> shape in 3 D can be avoided by locating the microphones outside the aforementioned "dangerous area". The position of such a "dangerous area" is found to be related to the size of the nozzle geometry...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} for calculating mixing and chemical reactions in {{the limit of}} infinitely fast chemical kinetics and negligible heat release, in fully developed turbulent <b>shear</b> <b>layers.</b> <b>The</b> model {{is based on the assumption}} that the topology of the interface between the two entrained reactants in <b>the</b> <b>layer,</b> as well as the strain field associated with it, can be described by the similarity laws of the Kolmogorov cascade. The calculation yields the integrated volume fraction across <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> occupied by <b>the</b> chemical product, as a function of the stoichiometric mixture ratio of the reactants carried by the free streams, the velocity ratio of <b>the</b> <b>shear</b> <b>layer,</b> <b>the</b> local Reynolds number, and the Schmidt number of the flow. The results are in good agreement with measurements of the volume fraction occupied by the molecularly mixed fluid in a turbulent <b>shear</b> <b>layer</b> and <b>the</b> amount of chemical product, in both gas phase and liquid phase chemically reacting shear layers...|$|R
