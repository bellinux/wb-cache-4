40|$|This NebGuide {{contains}} {{information on}} understanding the basis aspect of hedging. The producer {{who wants to}} employ hedging as a marketing alternative needs to understand 2 ̆ 2 basis. 2 ̆ 2 Hedging as used here is the selling of a futures contract to establish a price for a commodity the producer has on hand that will be sold at some later date. An example is corn held in storage in November that the producer plans to sell in May. This is formally known as a <b>selling</b> <b>hedge.</b> In hedging the producer is establishing in advance the price he will receive when the grain is sold and the hedge is lifted. The price that is received when the commodity is sold on the futures market is not the actual price the producer will ultimately receive. The futures price is the Chicago price for grain, not the Nebraska price, therefore {{there will be an}} adjustment made in the Chicago price. This adjustment is the 2 ̆ 2 basis. 2 ̆ 2 The basis can cause the producer to either gain an additional profit or to receive a lower price for his product than he anticipated when the hedge wa...|$|E

The {{data were collected from}} observation of olein price fluctuation in Jakarta Future Exchange. Fundamental analysis, technical analysis and basis were used to analyze the data. The patterns of olein price movement in future market which can be identified are double top (reversal pattern), uptrend and downtrend. Price fluctuation of domestic olein caused by bargaining aspect, namely supply through production and demand, covering: olein consumption, olein export, and olein stock. From technical analyze of exponential moving average (EMA) 5120, it can be used as an instrument to observe price trend, where volatility in JulyDecember is high risk, relative strength index (RSI) shows a position of over-sell, and moving average convergence devergence (MACD) shows a trend toward bearish, and more clearly result of the daily price during the next three months is obtained by predicting the price using autoregresive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method, and the result, the daily price of olein in next month trend to decrease. The base on spot price and future price is weak basis, and it means that the different price between the future market and spot market is increasing. And positive basis value means that it is in inverted market condition. And hence, hedging for several next months (up to the 13 th day or which will due in May 2005), it can be conducted by the producer by taking an action of <b>selling</b> <b>hedge...</b>|$|E

Trading hedged corn When I tell my audience at Gold Standard University Live that huge quantities of commodities are bought and sold every day without any reference to the price, my words are received with an incredulous silence. It appears incredible to the uninitiated that the price risk can be neatly side-stepped. I have to explain to my listeners that when the professional grain trader gives an order to buy or sell corn, he may be unaware whether the price of corn is up or down. He doesn’t care. He is buying and <b>selling</b> <b>hedged</b> corn, and he takes his clues from the basis, not the price of corn itself. He has replaced price risk with basis risk which he knows how to handle as its behavior is less erratic and more predictable.

40|$|The {{emerging}} markets for credit derivatives have improved the liquidity of bank assets by providing banks with various new possibilities for <b>selling</b> and <b>hedging</b> their risks. This paper examines {{the consequences for}} banking stability. In a simple model where liquidation of bank assets is costly, we show that increased asset liquidity benefits stability by encouraging a representative bank to reduce the risks on its balance sheet. Stability is further enhanced because the bank can now liquidate assets in a crisis more easily. However, we find that these stability effects are counteracted by increased risk-taking by the bank. Overall, stability actually falls because the improved possibilities for liquidating assets in a crisis make a crisis less costly for the bank. The bank therefore takes on an amount of risk that more than offsets the initial positive impact on stability...|$|R

30|$|This study’s {{findings}} further buttress {{the fact}} that oil price uncertainty {{is a major concern}} to oil and gas company stock holders and management. We therefore recommend that Nigerian oil companies embrace the benefits of oil price hedging and energy risk management. Studies such as Jin and Jorison (2006) and Altuntas et al. (2017) highlight a major possible down side of hedging as having a negative relationship with firm value. Altuntas et al. (2017) did note its relevance in mitigating the negative effect of cash flow volatility.

40|$|Because agency {{considerations}} {{have been}} such a prominent feature of the capital structure literature, we also introduce agency conflicts into our analysis by calculating {{the value of the}} debt that, instead of maximizing the total value of the levered firm, maximizes the utility of a risk-averse manager. This appendix describes an expanded version of the model in the main text that incorporates decisionmaking by a risk-averse manager and reports implied optimal capital structures, from the manager’s perspective, for the typical firm and for the individual firms examined in the main text. C. I. A dynamic model of capital structure choice with a risk-averse manager The model we use is based on Ju (1998, 2001). In this model, the firm issues debt with a maturity of T, which pays a continuous, constant (tax-deductible) coupon. The manager’s wealth at time zero is divided between non-firm wealth and his stake in the firm, which consists of equity shares and standard European call options on the firm’s shares, which expire at time Tu. The manager cannot <b>sell</b> or <b>hedge</b> his shares or options. For simplicity, it is assumed that the manager’s non-firm wealth grows at the risk-free rate, r, and is therefore uncorrelated with the value of the manager’s stake in the firm. The manager’s utility is given by a CRRA utility function that is defined over his entire wealth. The value process of the firm’s assets (that is, the value of the cash flows from operations) follows geometric Brownian motion. The model is in continuous time with 0 < T < T. At time zero the value of the firm’s assets is u V (0.) Without debt in its capital structure, the firm’s capital consists of N NL shares of stock with a total market value of E () ...|$|R

First, if there are too few non-redundant derivative markets, a competitive market equilibrium allocation of securities price risks is typically constrained Pareto inefficient. This financial economic result means that for typical economies, a regulator can in principle improve social welfare by financial market interventions. Second, introducing some but not enough non-redundant derivatives markets has indeterminate normative consequences for the allocation of securities price risks.

The interpretation of information {{is the foundation of}} all prudent investment decisions; thus, an efficient capital market depends on the proper disclosure of information. Hedge funds heavily influence and play an integral role in the proper functioning of capital markets. For the markets’ benefit, hedge funds must publicly disclose their investing activity, which consists of long positions, like buying stock to sell later, and short positions, like short <b>selling.</b> However, while <b>hedge</b> funds are obligated to disclose their long positions on Form 13 F, there is no equivalent obligation to disclose short positions.

40|$|The {{treasurer}} of a multi-national corporation can hedge {{to protect his}} corporation against an impending currency devaluation or revaluation. He can cover a future period, τ, now, without covering any intervening periods, by selling the suspect currency forward for τ periods and buying it forward for τ - 1 periods. There are generally no external economies resulting from hedging {{for more than one}} period at a time so that the problem is formulated to analyze each period separately. The cost of hedging (for corporate sized amounts) appears to be linear so the hedging price for each period is treated as a constant. Given current costs, expectations of costs, and expectations of probable devaluations or revaluations, should the treasurer now contract to hedge a particular period or should he wait? (The aggregation of the past and current hedge decisions constitutes the intervals to be hedged now.) Each of these hedge or wait decisions is formulated as a dynamic program. This dynamic program fortunately distills down to a very simple decision rule of comparing the expected cost of hedging with a constant for that period when unhedging is permitted. Even when the spread between the buying and selling rates is significant, there will be a need to solve numerically a dynamic program for {{only a few of the}} periods. We present and analyse four situations: 1. Hedging with no unhedging. 2.
