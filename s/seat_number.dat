2500|$|Reunited {{with his}} Knights, Arthur meets Tim the Enchanter who warns {{them of the}} danger of a killer rabbit. When the rabbit bites a knight's head off, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, {{knocking}} down a nearby hill and revealing that the [...] "evil rabbit" [...] was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. (The letters are based on the seat numbering system used by each theatre. [...] They are changed from performance to performance to discourage audience members from intentionally booking any of the possible seats. [...] The seat is typically on the aisle in one of the first few rows nearest the orchestra. In the Broadway production and on the tour it is either A101, B101, C101 or D101; i.e., Seat 101 – which is house right of the center aisle – of Rows A, B, C, or D. [...] In the West End Production a word is revealed – DONE, CONE or BONE, referring to D1, C1 and B1 respectively.) After pondering the final clue, Arthur admits that they're [...] "a bit stumped with the clue thing" [...] and asks God to [...] "give them a hand". A large hand points to the audience and Arthur realises that the letters and numbers refer to a <b>seat</b> <b>number</b> in the audience. The grail is [...] "found" [...] (with some sleight of hand) under the seat and the person sitting in the seat is rewarded with a small trophy and a polaroid photo. ("The Holy Grail"). Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake, who reveals that her name is Guinevere; Lancelot marries Herbert (who finally has a chance to sing); and Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in musical theatre. Herbert's father attempts to interrupt the finale and stop all of the [...] "bloody singing", but is hit over the head with a shovel by Lancelot, a nod to [...] "He is Not Yet Dead". [...] ("Act 2 Finale/Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Company Bow)").|$|E
