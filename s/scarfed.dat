40|$|Adhesively bonded <b>scarf</b> repairs are the {{preferred}} method for repairing composite structures, limited mainly {{by the amount}} of material removal associated with <b>scarfing.</b> In addition to the high strength restoration, <b>scarf</b> repairs also enable recovery of the original external surface as required by aerodynamic and/or external mould line considerations. However, <b>scarf</b> repairs almost inevitably result in the removal of undamaged material {{to make way for the}} <b>scarf</b> insert. This can be a particularly significant issue for thick structures, because the <b>scarf</b> length can vary between 20 and 100 times the thicknesses of the parent structure. In this investigation, an optimisation method has been developed for determining the optimum repair shapes for a given biaxial loading condition. The optimum <b>scarf</b> shape is determined by numerically solving the resulting non-linear differential equation governing the <b>scarf</b> angle.

60|$|In {{the year}} 1710, a gentlewoman lost about six pounds' worth of Flanders lace, and inasmuch {{as it was}} a present made to her husband, she was {{concerned}} as much {{as if it had been}} of twenty times the value; and a lady of her acquaintance coming to visit her, to whom she unfolded, among other things in discourse, this little disaster, the lady, smiling, replied with this question, Did you never hear, madam, of Mr. Duncan Campbell? It is but making your application to him, things that are lost are immediately found; the power of his knowledge exceeds even the power of laws; they but restrain, and frighten, and punish robbers, but he makes thieves expiate their guilt by the more virtuous way of turning restorers of the goods they have stolen. Madam, rejoined the losing gentlewoman, you smile when you tell me this; but really, as much a trifle as it is, since it was a present to my husband, I cannot help being sensibly concerned at it, a moment's disappointment to him in the least thing in nature, creates in me a greater uneasiness than the greatest disappointment to my single self could do in things of moment and importance. What makes me smile, said the lady, when I speak of it, or think of it, is the oddness and peculiarity of this man's talent in helping one to such things; but, without the least jest, I assure you, that I know, by experience, these things come within the compass of his knowledge; and I must seriously tell you, for your farther satisfaction, that he has helped me, and several of my friends, to the finding again things lost, which were of great value. And is this, without laughing, true? said the losing fair, very gravely and demurely, like a person half believing, and desirous to be fully confirmed in such a belief. The lady she advised with did then ascertain her of the truth of the matter, alleging that, for a single half-guinea, he would inform her of her things, and describe the person that conveyed them away. No sooner was this gentlewoman convinced, but she was eager for the trial; solicited her friend to conduct her to Mr. Campbell, and, upon the first word of consent, she was hooded and <b>scarfed</b> immediately, and they coached it away in a trice to Mr. Campbell's house, whom they luckily found within.|$|E

50|$|Wooden planks can be <b>scarfed</b> into a strake by {{suitably}} tapering {{the thickness}} of the adjoining ends. Traditionally, the adjoining faces were coated with mixed white lead and grease, then held together with copper rivets. It was important to not have the plank end as thin as a feather edge and to have the outboard thin edge at the after end of the joint. In later times, after adhesives had been developed by the aircraft industry, the joint might be made with resin glue and no rivets. In heavier carvel work, the joint would be a butt, riveted to a butt strap. Even large clinker vessels had <b>scarfed</b> strakes as in this form of construction; the strakes contribute a significant proportion of the structural strength of the boat as well as keeping it water-tight.|$|E
40|$|<b>Scarf</b> joints are an {{effective}} method of bonding thick composite laminates for {{applications such as}} the repair of composite aircraft structures. However, concerns remain about their damage tolerance characteristics. Typically composite <b>scarf</b> repairs to aircraft structures require use of hand tools or rudimentary jigs. If the <b>scarf</b> is incorrectly prepared, this may cause a profile deviation to the joint, affecting the bond line stresses and in turn, reducing the residual strength of the joint or repair. The subject of this work examined the sensitivity of composite <b>scarf</b> joints to machining profile deviation and artificial disbond, when subject to static tensile load. Tensile test specimens were prepared with two different configurations of <b>scarf</b> for representing an undercut or imprecise <b>scarf</b> typical of a machining error. In addition, sensitivity of the <b>scarf</b> joints {{in the presence of}} an artificial disbond was also tested. Results indicated that for the specimens tested, the <b>scarf</b> is relatively insensitive to minor profile deviation, but highly sensitive to an artificial disbond. Experimental results were also compared with finite element analysis...|$|R

With the aid of elastic-plastic analyses, a critical assessment of the current design methods has been carried out, with major emphasis being placed on the stress/strain concentration along the bondline. It is proposed to replace the shear stress criterion with the maximum strain criterion. Comparison with experimental results confirmed that the new approach provides an improved first-order prediction of repair efficiency of <b>scarf</b> repairs...|$|R
