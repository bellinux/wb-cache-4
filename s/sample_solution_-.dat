In this work previous static and flow injection voltammetric methods for the determination of phosphate and silicate {{have been developed for}} the determination of total phosphate and soluble silicate in commercial washing powders. The method is based on the electrochemical reduction of heteropoly acids at + 0. 3 v. (vs. SCE) at a glassy carbon electrode. Anionic detergents are a constituent of washing powders and are found to reduce markedly the differential pulse voltammetric peak currents obtained for 12 -molybdophosphate and 12 -molybdosilicate in aqueous solutions.

To prepare the FRAP reagent, 0.1  mM acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 10  mM 2, 4, 6 -tripyridyl-s-triazine (TPTZ) in 40  mM HCl, and 20  mM FeCl 3 · 6 H 2 O were mixed together in a ratio of 10 : 1 : 1 (v/v/v).

This arrangement avoids several disadvantages associated with metal-coated nanoelectrospray emitters.

Then 1.80  mL of a mixture of acetone (as the disperser solvent; 1.68  mL) and chloroform (as the extraction solvent; 120  μL) was rapidly injected into the <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> using a syringe, and a stable cloudy solution (water, acetone, and chloroform) was obtained.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the maximum applicable volume of <b>sample</b> <b>solution,</b> the effect of change in the volume of <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> passed through the column on the retention of analytes was investigated; 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000  mL of <b>sample</b> <b>solutions</b> containing 20  μg of Cd, Cu, and Pb were passed through the column.

40|$|There {{is a great}} {{demand for}} standardising {{biodiversity}} assessments {{in order to allow}} optimal comparison across research groups. For invertebrates, pitfall or flight-interception traps are commonly used, but <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> differs widely between studies, which could influence the communities collected and affect sample processing (morphological or genetic). We assessed arthropod communities with flight-interception traps using three commonly used <b>sampling</b> <b>solutions</b> across two forest types and two vertical strata. We first considered the effect of <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> and its interaction with forest type, vertical stratum, and position of sampling jar at the trap on sample condition and community composition. We found that samples collected in copper sulphate were more mouldy and fragmented relative to other solutions which might impair morphological identification, but condition depended on forest type, trap type and the position of the jar. Community composition, based on order-level identification, did not differ across <b>sampling</b> <b>solutions</b> and only varied with forest type and vertical stratum. Species richness and species-level community composition, however, differed greatly among <b>sampling</b> <b>solutions.</b> Renner solution was highly attractant for beetles and repellent for true bugs. Secondly, we tested whether <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> affects subsequent molecular analyses and found that DNA barcoding success was species-specific. Samples from copper sulphate produced the fewest successful DNA sequences for genetic identification, and since DNA yield or quality was not particularly reduced in these samples additional interactions between the solution and DNA must also be occurring. Our results show that the choice of <b>sampling</b> <b>solution</b> should be an important consideration in biodiversity studies.

40|$|Background: Heavy metals, even at low concentrations, are {{harmful to}} human health and environment. Cadmium as a heavy metal is highly toxic and can cause serious threat to living organisms. This {{research}} was designed to evaluate the adsorption potential of modified magnetic iron nanoparticles by 2 -(5 -bromo- 2 -pyridylazo) - 5 -diethylaminophenol ligand {{for the removal of}} cadmium ions from water solutions. Methods: This study was conducted in Ilam Branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran, in 2014. Modified magnetic iron nanoparticle was used as adsorbent for the removal of cadmium from aqueous solution. In batch extraction, the effects of parameters like pH of <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> (3. 0 <b>-</b> 11. 0), initial metal concentrations (50 - 300) mgL- 1), contact time (1. 0 - 10 min) and adsorbent dose (10. 0 - 60. 0 mg) were studied on the adsorption process. Modified magnetite nanoparticle was presented as the adsorbent for the removal of cadmium ions from aqueous samples and later was confirmed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: The adsorption of cadmium ions on modified magnetite nanoparticles strongly depends on pH. The experimental isothermal data were analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The removal process followed the Langmuir isotherm. Maximum adsorption capacity for the adsorption of cadmium ions by the sorbent was 24. 09 mgg- 1. Conclusion: The method was successfully applied to adsorption of cadmium in water samples with satisfactory results. Other advantages include high capacity, good stability and fast adsorption kinetics. High pre-concentration factor was obtained easily by this method (120) and low analysis cost. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT − The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of sample preparation, HPLC conditions and peak measurement methods upon determining progesterone content of poly-d,l-lactide-co-glycolide microspheres. A series of the microspheres with different formulations was first prepared. To determine their actual drug contents, the microspheres were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and diluted with various amounts of methanol to precipitate the polymer. After removal of poly-meric precipitates, the filtrates were subject to HPLC analysis under versatile experimental conditions. Interestingly, the composition of a <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> (e. g., the ratio of methanol to tetrahydrofuran) affected the magnitudes of both peak front-ing and peak broadening of progesterone. Its peak became broader and more asymmetrical at lower methanol:tetrahy-drofuran ratios. Furthermore, its peak height was influenced by the proportion of tetrahydrofuran in a <b>sample</b> <b>solution.</b> Such problems encountered with tetrahydrofuran were exacerbated when a larger volume of the <b>sample</b> <b>solution</b> was injected onto an analytical column. Under our experimental conditions a peak area measurement provided more accurate and reliable determination of progesterone content in various microspheres than a peak height determination. Optimizing the com-position of a <b>sample</b> <b>solution,</b> HPLC chromatographic conditions and peak analysis methods was a prerequisite to an accu-rate determination of progesterone encapsulated within microspheres.
