5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, {{and then to}} fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass <b>supportable</b> by degeneracy pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon and magnesium, may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon. Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E

25|$|Since 1998, the DNA {{profiling}} system supported by The National DNA Database in the UK is the SGM+ DNA {{profiling system}} that includes 10 STR regions and a sex-indicating test. STRs do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar {{power of discrimination}} (1 in 1013 for unrelated individuals if using a full SGM+ profile). Figures of this magnitude are {{not considered to be}} statistically <b>supportable</b> by scientists in the UK; for unrelated individuals with full matching DNA profiles a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered statistically <b>supportable.</b> However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source of incorrect DNA profiles and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, chimerism is one such instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.|$|E
25|$|AH-1 Cobras {{continue}} to operate with the U.S. Marine Corps. USMC Cobras were also used in operations throughout the 1990s. USMC Cobras have also served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and in Operation Iraqi Freedom in the conflict in Iraq. While new replacement aircraft were considered {{as an alternative to}} major upgrades of the AH-1 fleet, Marine Corps studies showed that an upgrade was the most affordable, most <b>supportable</b> and most effective solution for the Marine Corps light attack helicopter mission.|$|E
25|$|On July 6, 2006, the Federal Electoral Institute {{announced}} the official vote {{count in the}} 2006 presidential election, resulting in a narrow margin of 0.58% for Calderón over his closest contender, PRD candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador. However, López Obrador and his coalition alleged irregularities {{in a number of}} polling stations and demanded a national recount. Ultimately, the Federal Electoral Tribunal, in a unanimous vote, declared such a recount to be groundless and unfeasible and ordered a recount of those with <b>supportable</b> allegations, or about 9.07% of the 130,477 polling stations.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, <b>supportable</b> solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered {{the lives of our}} sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step toward}} achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope.|$|E
25|$|In October 1989, Rockwell International (Space Systems Division) began {{a year-long}} {{contracted}} effort managed by Langley Research Center {{to perform an}} in-depth study of PLS design and operations with the HL-20 concept as a baseline for the study. Using a concurrent engineering approach, Rockwell factored <b>supportable,</b> efficient design and operations measures into defining a detailed, cost-effective design along with a manufacturing plan and operations assessment. A key {{finding of this study}} was the realization that while design and technological factors could reduce costs of a new manned space transportation system, further significant savings would be possible only if a new operations philosophy were adopted which treated PLS {{in a manner similar to}} an operational airliner rather than a research and development space vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal only hears appeals from {{decisions}} of the High Court made when the latter is exercising original criminal jurisdiction. In other words, matters heard by the High Court on appeal from the State Courts cannot be further appealed to the Court of Appeal, though questions of law may be reserved for determination by the Court (see below). A person convicted in the High Court can appeal against the conviction, the sentence or both, unless he or she pleaded guilty in which case only an appeal against the extent or legality of the sentence is permitted. In the latter situation, the Court of Appeal may nonetheless permit the person who pleaded guilty to appeal against conviction if it believes that {{this is in the}} interests of justice. The Public Prosecutor may appeal against an acquittal or the sentence imposed on an accused person. The Court is entitled to summarily reject an appeal if the grounds of appeal do not involve any question of law, the conviction is <b>supportable</b> by the evidence, and {{there is nothing in the}} circumstances of the case which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the conviction was right or leads the Court to think the sentence should be reduced. The summary rejection of an appeal may only be done upon the unanimous decision of the Judges of Appeal.|$|E
500|$|Events soon {{polarized}} {{the state}} of Virginia on the school segregation issue. On July 12, Judge John Paul, Jr., of the Western District Court of Virginia ordered the racial integration of public schools in Charlottesville, Virginia. On July 31, Eastern District Court of Virginia Judge Albert V. Bryan, Sr., ordered the racial integration of public schools in Arlington County, Virginia. The rulings sparked additional lawsuits against segregated school districts across Virginia. The rulings also widened the split in the pro-segregation forces, with the more extremist supporters now arguing that the Gray Commission proposals were no longer an option and that only [...] "massive resistance" [...] and a plan implementing interposition were <b>supportable.</b>|$|E
500|$|On December 18, 1895, Congress {{approved}} $100,000 for the United States Commission on the Boundary Between Venezuela and British Guiana. It {{was formally}} established on 1 January 1896. Historian George Lincoln Burr, {{who contributed to}} the Commission's historical research, argued shortly after the Commission concluded its work that it made a major contribution to clarifying issues of historical fact in the dispute. The Commission's work, he wrote, helped the disputing parties to focus on issues of fact <b>supportable</b> by evidence (as opposed to mere assertions), and in addition, {{by the time the}} Arbitration process was under way, the Commission's own view of historical facts was largely accepted by the parties, [...] "so that their main issue [...] now in the main one of law, not of fact." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 19, 2014, Bethesda {{revealed}} {{that access to}} a beta version of Doom 4, titled Doom, would be available for those who pre-ordered [...] {{on any of the}} <b>supportable</b> platforms. Those players were also eligible for selection to participate in the game's multiplayer-only limited alpha, which ran between December 3 and 6, 2015. The beta began on March 31, 2016, and ended on April 3. It was followed by an open beta, which started on April 15, 2016, and ended on April 17. Doom was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 13, 2016, worldwide; an exception was Japan, where it was released on May 19. It is also {{the first game of the}} Doom franchise to be released as uncensored in Germany. Bethesda partnered with Schmidt Peterson Motorsports for a special promotion that had Mikhail Aleshin driving a Doom-styled car at the Indianapolis 500 racing competition.|$|E

[...] For the most part, Castel concludes that Reynolds’ specific charges were not <b>supportable</b> and notes that Reynolds in 1887 effectively recanted the most serious charges. [...] Referring to his public charges, Reynolds wrote, [...] "It is against all the canons of history that, made in a heated controversy, they should be used, or even referred to, in stating ‘’facts’’ of that campaign itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vitalism is the view, {{rejected}} by mainstream biologists since the 19th century, {{that there is}} a life-force (called the [...] "vis viva") that has thus far been unmeasurable scientifically that gives living organisms their [...] "life." [...] Vitalists often claimed that the vis viva acts with purposes according to its pre-established [...] "form" [...] (see teleology). Examples of vitalist philosophy are found in many religions. Mainstream biologists reject vitalism {{on the grounds that it}} opposes the scientific method. The scientific method was designed as a methodology to build an extremely reliable understanding of the world, that is, a <b>supportable,</b> evidenced understanding. [...] Following this epistemological view, mainstream scientists reject phenomena that have not been scientifically measured or verified, and thus reject vitalism.|$|E
2500|$|Miller et al. {{provide an}} {{excellent}} example and explication {{of the use of}} meta-analysis examining treatment outcome research, incorporating the principles of rigorous empirical research from the strong end of the continuum of levels of evidence. This textbook also explicates how the research included was selected (e.g. controlled study looking at two different approaches, appearing in a peer reviewed journal, sufficient power to find significant differences if they occurred) and how each study was checked for validity (how was the outcome measured?) and reliability (did the research do what they said they did?), etc. to create a Cumulative Evidence Score weighted by the quality of the study (and not by the outcome) such that better studies with [...] "stronger designs" [...] and better methodological quality ratings carry more weight than weaker studies. The results lead to a rank ordering of the 48 treatment modalities included and provide a basis for selecting <b>supportable</b> treatment approaches beyond anecdotes, traditions and lore.|$|E
2500|$|Rawlinson {{argued that}} Christianity could {{not succeed in}} China if it was {{identified}} with either imperialist domination or capitalist exploitation. In particular, {{he pointed out that}} it was [...] "somewhat humiliating" [...] to force China to grant permission for [...] "Christian aliens" [...] to build churches and propagate their religion under protection of extraterritoriality. [...] He welcomed Chinese colleagues into the leadership of Christian institutions and supported the anti-imperialist program of the Chinese Nationalist Party. The spread of Marxism raised serious questions, however. Rawlinson approved the egalitarian social aims which Chinese communists announced while condemning their violent methods. [...] In 1934, the Chinese Recorder ran a series of articles on [...] "The Challenge of Communism," [...] the title of a missionary conference. Rawlinson conceded that if it sought a [...] "juster and more equitable social order," [...] communism was <b>supportable.</b> In that year, Chiang Kai-shek launched his New Life Movement as an answer to communism's social appeal. Rawlinson applauded, but looked to the Rural Reconstruction Movement for a Christian approach to the problems of China's rural majority. Rawlinson's June 1934 editorial, [...] "Beyond Communism," [...] reminded readers that as doctrine Christianity was [...] "adverse" [...] to capitalism but in fact had accommodated to it easily enough. Now Christianity found that communism had [...] "stolen its thunder," [...] for Christianity had never set out to [...] "change the entire lot of the underprivileged as communism has." [...] Christianity was preferable to communism but had to prove itself in action.|$|E

60|$|True, as to 'perfection' and so forth, answer we; true enough!

He abandoned himself to the half-belief that something of his father dwelt yet on earth--a ghostly voice, audible to the ear of his own flesh and blood.
