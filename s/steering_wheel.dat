5|$|International: sedans and Sportwagons entered {{production}} in mid-March 2009. Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V alloy wheels, front foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered trim and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front grille, leather seat trim and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E
5|$|Minor {{changes for}} the 2014 model year include a manual release for the charge port door {{in place of the}} {{electronically}} activated door found on previous models, and the addition of two new paint colors. A leather wrapped <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> becomes standard.|$|E
5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to {{look into}} a corner using a new head {{tracking}} feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E

5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{just two}} years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden {{unveiled}} the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and allowed Holden to gauge public reaction to its styling. Much of the Torana's styling drew on the essence of the VE's design. Some production-ready components even carried over from the TT36 including the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> the window and rear-view mirror switch cluster and the handbrake lever.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
50|$|Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering)</b> is {{available}} {{as an option}} on 2000 and 4000 series machines.The electronic system has 5 modes of operation, and only allows four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> below 20 km/h.|$|R

5|$|Changes to 2014 {{model year}} vehicle include driver and front {{passenger}} heated seats, CHAdeMO DC quick charge port, battery warming system, heated side view mirrors, rear door speakers, 8A/12A switchable Level 1 charging cable (approximate charge time from near empty to fully charged - 22 hours for 8 amp/14 hours for 12 amp), charge port lamp, leather-covered <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and shift knob, passenger-side vanity mirror with lid, numerous decorative color/trim upgrades, aluminum wheels, front fog lights, new {{daytime running lights}} (DRL), black-out door sash trim, US $6,130 lower price before incentives.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|David {{begins by}} sending poison pen letters to Nick's wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), which state that Nick {{is having an}} affair. Nick realises David is behind the letters. Price told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) his {{character}} panics and becomes annoyed. Nick is arrogant to his actions and believes David will just forgive him because they are related. He then tells David that they should discuss the affair with Kylie and move on. Price explained that David is worried that Kylie will feel betrayed he knew all along and does not want her to leave him. He decides he must stop Nick and grabs the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and causes a car crash. Price believed David {{was not trying to}} murder Nick, just prevent him from contacting Kylie.|$|E

5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a three-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E
5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the car crashes and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E
50|$|The Gran Turismo {{official}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> (such as the GT FORCE or Driving Force, see {{the trademark}} symbols difference) are {{a series of}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> designed by Logitech (a.k.a. Logicool in Japan) in collaboration with Polyphony Digital. These racing games controllers are designed to be used with the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 systems but later models can be used on PC as well due to their USB connection.|$|R

5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|Spottiswoode {{tried to}} {{innovate}} {{in the action}} scenes. Since the director felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the remote-controlled car, which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> on the back seat. The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing {{a member of the}} public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
50|$|Early Formula One cars used <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> taken {{directly}} from road cars. They were normally made from wood (necessitating {{the use of}} driving gloves), {{and in the absence}} of packaging constraints they tended to be made as large a diameter as possible, to reduce the effort needed to turn. As cars grew progressively lower and cockpits narrower throughout the 1960s and 1970s, <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> became smaller, so as to fit into the more compact space available.|$|R

50|$|The XLi {{version was}} basic with no tach, and power {{steering}} was an option. The GLi had power steering, four arm <b>steering</b> <b>wheels,</b> trunk and gas cap remote opening; and three pointed rear seat belts standard. Finally, the LEi {{had all the}} equipment and AC; tachometer; rear seat belts, 175/70 13 tires, with power door locks, power windows with driver's side auto down, and four arm <b>steering</b> <b>wheels.</b> It was offered with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic.|$|R
5|$|Visually {{based on}} cruise ship members, the five Bon Voyage cover sleeves feature {{different}} images all photographed by Kazuyoshi Shimomura. The CD cardboard sleeve has Koda squatting and holding onto {{a cruise ship}} steering wheel; the jewel case has Koda holding a life buoy. The CD and DVD cardboard sleeve has a close-up shot of Koda wearing a captain's uniform; the jewel case has Koda posing {{on top of a}} life buoy. The Blu-ray cardboard sleeve and jewel case has Koda posing with a pair of binoculars, while the Fan Club edition has a close-up of Koda sitting down holding a cruise ship <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The digital release uses the CD and DVD close-up shot. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by members of United Lounge Tokyo, and each booklet from the five format features different images of Koda.|$|E
5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the flaws and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named {{the same as a}} standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss {{due in part to the}} financial failure of the game.|$|E
5|$|Gutiérrez lost ninth {{position}} on lap 30 {{when he was}} passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water {{on the inside of}} the pit lane straight and used DRS. Vettel made his second pit stop for intermediate tyres that lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams cars. Button recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth {{position on}} the lap. Button made a second pit stop for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; it took longer than expected because his pit crew changed his <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> and he came out behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton; Rosberg made his second pit stop (for new intermediate tyres) on lap 33, and came out behind Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced understeer and spun 360 degrees after running onto the run-off area. Hamilton made a pit stop at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36. Ricciardo took the lead until his pit stop during that lap and came out behind the two Mercedes drivers, Vettel and Button.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "SideWinder" [...] {{describes}} {{many types}} of Microsoft's PC game controllers including joysticks, gamepads and <b>steering</b> <b>wheels.</b> Several types of joysticks were made, including the Force Feedback 2, the 3D Pro, and the regular SideWinder joystick. Also, several types of gamepads were made, such as the original game port version, a plug-and-play game port version, and the USB version. <b>Steering</b> <b>wheels</b> are the Precision Racing Wheel and the Force Feedback Wheel variants which include throttle and brake pedals.|$|R
