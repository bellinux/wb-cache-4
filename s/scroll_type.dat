40|$|The <b>scroll</b> <b>type</b> of {{compressor}} {{is becoming}} popular and {{widely used in}} refrigeration and air conditioners. But it is time consuming to design and manufacture the compressor since its components are of complex shape and of high precision requirements. This paper presents a concurrent engineering approach to computer-aided design and manufacturing of the compressor. The authors use C programming and Pro/ENGINEER as engineering tools to implement the proposed approach and associated design development. A visualised solid model of the compressor was developed. The solid model designed was enhanced by use of an optimisation system. Finite element analysis and an expert system were used to study the model, which is useful for {{improving the quality of}} manufacturing and assembly accuracy at the later stages. Manufacturability, process planning and NC tool path code generation are included in the approach. Concurrent engineering concepts were used throughout the design and manufacturing processes. # 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{unidirectional}} coupling {{scheme is}} investigated in double <b>scroll</b> <b>type</b> chaotic oscillators that reveal interesting multiscroll dynamics. Instead of using self-oscillatory systems, in this scheme, double scroll chaos from one oscillator is forced into another similar oscillator in a resting state. This coupling scheme is explored in the Chua oscillator, a modified Chua oscillator and the Lorenz oscillator. We have modified the Chua oscillator by simply changing its piecewise linear function {{a little bit}} and thereby derived a new 3 -scroll attractor. We have observed 4 -scroll, 6 -scroll attractors in the driven Chua oscillator and the modified Chua oscillator respectively in an intermittency regime of weaker coupling. We have extended the coupling scheme to the Lorenz system when even more interesting multiscroll dynamics (3 -, 4 -, 5 -, 6 –scroll) is observed with decreasing coupling strength. It appears as if a hidden multiscroll structure unfolds with weakening coupling interactions. One after another additional scroll appears in the driven Lorenz system when the coupling strength is gradually decreased in the weaker coupling regime. The origin of such multiscroll dynamics is explained using eigenvalue analysis and a bifurcation diagram. A schematic diagram of the multiscrol...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} aims {{to analyze}} micro-CHP units based on Rankine cycles. Two types of expander are considered: {{a small scale}} inward flow radial turbine and a volumetric <b>scroll</b> <b>type</b> expander. This latter, should allow to overcome the limitation imposed by a standard steam-turbine that arise when the required shaft-power is very low. Moreover, the scroll expander will also allow to easily treat wet steams, which must be avoided when considering a turbo-expander. The final aim is to deduce {{which one of the}} two types of expander is more suitable, with a specified target performance and the availability of a certain hot source. In order to define the thermodynamic expansion process, the analysis uses a onedimensional model of the radial turbine, previously developed by the authors, and of an estimation of the scroll expander efficiency. Also, the analysis is carried out for different working fluids, such as water, and two organic fluids, cyclohexane and toluene. Through the discussion of the results, for a specified set of constraints (e. g. expander inlet temperature, temperature of condensation, expander geometrical parameters) it is possible to deduce important indications on the most suitable expander for a given cycle layout...|$|E

The miniature scroll pump will also be fabricated using X-ray lithography producing arrays of scroll stages about 3 mm in diameter. The target detection range for the mass spectrometer is 1 to 300 atomic mass units (AMU) with are solution of 0. 5 AMU.

40|$|Abstract. The {{carbon dioxide}} (R- 744) {{as a natural}} {{refrigerant}} has been an attractive alternative refrigerant to replace HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerants currently used in air conditioning systems, due to the environmental concerns. Because new compressors with CO 2 {{are going to be}} operated under the high pressure, the tribology of sliding surfaces in the compressor becomes very important. To develop new compressor, especially <b>scroll</b> <b>type,</b> the friction and wear characteristics of sliding surfaces between a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll in the scroll compressor were investigated in this paper. The sliding tests of pin-on-disk type were carried out between scroll surfaces under various sliding speeds, normal loads, surface roughness, and refrigerant pressures. Two types of lubricants were used, namely POE (polyol ester) oil and PAG (polyalkylene glycol) oil. The friction forces, wear amounts and surface temperatures were monitored during the tests. Test results showed that the wear amounts increased with increasing normal load and rotating speed, and also decreased with decreasing surface roughness. Also, the results of the sliding tests showed that using PAG oil has an advantage over POE oil in CO 2 environment. As the pressure of CO 2 refrigerant became higher, the amount of wear and coefficient of friction became larger in CO 2 /POE mixed environment, but wear and friction remained constant in CO 2 /PAG mixed environment. The wear coefficients in CO 2 /PAG and CO 2 /POE mixed environment were 8. 60 × 10 - 9 ㎣ /N·m and 2. 35 × 10 - 8 ㎣ /N·m, respectively...|$|E

Namely, {{it is important to}} investigate coupled chaotic systems. Cellular Neural Networks (CNN) was proposed by Chua and Yang [1][2] in 1988. It is mutual coupling neural networks. These are easy to make an integrated circuit and these are parallel processing system. Therefore, many researchers investigate about CNN. As one of these studies, CNN using two kinds of cloning templates [3] has been investigated. Mainly, this system as coupled oscillatory system was investigated. Normally, oscillatory phenomena could not be observed in typical CNN. This CNN can be observed oscillatory phenomena. However, chaotic phenomena could not be observed. On the other hand, three cells of CNN generates chaos is reported [4]. Three cells are set different cloning templates. A double <b>scroll</b> <b>type</b> attractor is observed.

40|$|Oil in {{circulation}} in refrigeration systems generally degrades their thermodynamic and reliability performance. The {{vast majority of}} compressors used in the residential, automotive and light commercial air conditioning and refrigeration use pressure actuated reeds as the discharge valves. These valves are the gateway for the oil to leave the compressor {{to the rest of}} the system. This work is focused on the breakup process of the film that is formed between a reed valve and its seat. Emphasis is given on visualization of the breakup pattern and determination of the critical valve lift and velocity at which the film breaks during typical compressor operation. Preliminary experiments were carried out outside of the compressor environment, using a typical valve plate from a reciprocating compressor for household refrigerators. Observations of the breakup pattern show that the liquid film does not remain continuous until breakup into ligaments and droplets. In fact the stretched liquid film is first broken up into equally spaced liquid columns and then by means of the drag force promoted by the vapor flow due to the pressure difference it is blown away from the valve edge and starts the atomization process into a fine mist. Additional experiments were also carried out with two different oil viscosities (32 cSt 2 ̆ 6 120 cSt), and four different operating frequencies ranging from 30 Hz- 60 Hz in a <b>scroll</b> <b>type</b> compressor operating under typical residential air conditioning conditions.

40|$|Development of {{innovative}} thermodynamic cycles {{is important for}} the efficient utilization of low-temperature heat sources such as solar, geothermal, and waste heat sources. Binary mixtures exhibit variable boiling temperatures during the boiling process, which leads to a good thermal match between the heating fluid and working fluid for efficient heat source utilization. This study presents a theoretical and an experimental analysis of a combined power/cooling cycle, which combines the Rankine and absorption refrigeration cycles, uses ammonia-water mixture as the working fluid and produces power and refrigeration, while power is the primary goal. This cycle, also known as the Goswami Cycle, {{can be used as a}} bottoming cycle using waste heat from a conventional power cycle or as an independent cycle using low to mid-temperature sources such as geothermal and solar energy. A thermodynamic analysis of power and cooling cogeneration was presented. The performance of the cycle for a range of boiler pressures, ammonia concentrations, and isentropic turbine efficiencies were studied to find out the sensitivities of net work, amount of cooling and effective efficiencies. The thermodynamic analysis covered a broad range of boiler temperatures, from 85 °C to 350 °C. The first law efficiencies of 25 - 31 % are achievable with the boiler temperatures of 250 - 350 °C. The cycle can operate at an effective exergy efficiency of 60 - 68 % with the boiler temperature range of 200 - 350 °C. An experimental study was conducted to verify the predicted trends and to test the performance of a <b>scroll</b> <b>type</b> expander. The experimental results of vapor production were verified by the expected trends to some degree, due to heat transfer losses in the separator vessel. The scroll expander isentropic efficiency was between 30 - 50 %, the expander performed better when the vapor was superheated. The small scale of the experimental cycle affected the testing conditions and cycle outputs. This cycle can be designed and scaled from a kilowatt to megawatt systems. Utilization of low temperature sources and heat recovery is definitely an active step in improving the overall energy conversion efficiency and decreasing the capital cost of energy per unit...|$|E
40|$|Experimental Studies of Human-Computer Interaction: Working {{memory and}} mental {{workload}} in complex cognition Complex cognition is readily described as cognitive tasks requiring {{the coordination of}} multiple steps of processing or tasks exceeding short term memory capacity. Similarly, mental workload may {{be described as the}} use and temporary expenditure of a finite amount of information processing capacity. In the current study, consisting of eight experiments, the mental workload of complex cognition was manipulated through variations in the mode of presentation (Study I) with the information being presented either printed on paper or displayed on a computer screen as well as through variations in page layout (Study II) with the information being presented, either using a page layout designed to fit the computer screen or on a long page of <b>scroll</b> <b>type.</b> In Study III, the short-term memory demands of the complex cognitive tasks themselves were explored. The aim of the experiments was to investigate the effect of onscreen vs. paper presented materials on complex problem solving (Study I), the effect of page layout of onscreen presented materials on mental workload (Study II), and the configuration of short-term memory demands of complex problem solving (Study III). The principal findings of the three studies may be summarized by the following points: · Both Consumption- and Production of information is more effective when information is presented on paper rather than displayed on a computer screen (Study I). · Consumption of information generates less mental workload when the page layout is adapted to fit the computer screen (Study II: Experiments 1 & 2). · Problem solving processes, including both Consumption and Production of information, may be described both in terms of their reliance on either ST-WM or LT-WM (Study III: Experiments 1, 2 & 3) and in terms of their reliance on specific ‘slave-systems’ of the tripartite model (Study III: Experiments 1 & 3). Taken together, Studies I and II show that the presentation of information on screen, versus in printed form, exerts detrimental effects on human information processing and that some of those effects may be attributed to differences in the navigational properties of the two media. In addition, Study II demonstrated that an adaptation of the page layout of the presented material so that it fitted its intended media, mental workload may be alleviated. Finally, the results of Study III showed that, {{in order to understand the}} memory demands of complex cognition, it is necessary to include elements of both the ST- and LT-WM paradigm of Ericsson & Kintsch and the tripartite model of Baddeley & Hitch.

Low-dimen-sional feature vectors based on histogram of optical flows from each screen recording were used in our study. The first set of experiments investigated if these low-dimensional features can be used to recognize the type of interaction taking place in a particular recording and we found that linear SVM could suc-ceed in achieving this with an accuracy of 91 % on 5 test users. The second set of experiments explored if classifiers trained on different types of recordings can be used to verify user identity. The results indicated that SVMs trained on Scrolling recordings can achieve moderately low FAR and FRR error rates of 20. 7 % and 12. 4 %, respectively.
