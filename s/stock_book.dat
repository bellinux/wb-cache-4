50|$|In 1609, {{there were}} 37 {{families}} living in Altenglan and thus, the village had roughly 100 inhabitants. There was {{a drop in}} population, however, even before the Thirty Years' War, likely due to the Plague and other epidemics, and there were only 30 families living in Altenglan by 1630. Fewer than ten villagers survived the Thirty Years’ War, but repopulation came with newcomers, although this was interrupted, and perhaps even reversed, by King Louis XIV’s wars of conquest. There was an upswing in numbers early in the 18th century. At {{the time when the}} 1749 <b>stock</b> <b>book</b> was compiled, some 50 families lived in Altenglan and thereby some 200 inhabitants.

50|$|The {{original}} {{settlement of}} Altenglan stretched along the higher {{parts of the}} left banks of both the Glan and the Kuselbach, along today’s Glanstraße from the graveyard with the old church to the T-junction formed by today’s Bahnhofstraße. This can clearly {{be seen in a}} <b>stock</b> <b>book</b> compiled in the mid-18th century. Other settlements on Bahnhofstraße had also already arisen by the 18th century. The last house before the bridge was the one that is now the rectory, and across the bridge (known as the Pfarrbrücke - “Parochial Bridge” - or the Schmiedebrücke - “Smithy Bridge”) stood a smith’s workshop. Likewise already standing by the 18th century were houses in the area of today’s Ringstraße, which the <b>stock</b> <b>book</b> describes as a gemeiner Weg - “common way”. Thus, a big triangle stretching back from the forks of the Glan and Kuselbach was settled at the time when the original cadastral survey was done in 1848. The settlement began to spread out in the 19th century towards Eckstraße and Tränkstraße, towards Neuwiesenstraße and today’s Schulstraße. In the early 20th century, houses were built on Kuseler Straße. Altenglan station was built in 1868 along with the railway line between Kusel and Landstuhl. New, bigger residential areas arose after the Second World War west of Bahnhofstraße (Bildstock, Am Köpfchen, Gartenstraße) and to the side of Kuseler Straße (Alte Straße, Am Heiligen Spiegel, An den Rödwiesen). A new rectory was built in 1934 on Kuseler Straße, after the old one had been sold. The town hall, in its original form, the then municipality had built after the Second World War. Expansions took place after the founding of the Verbandsgemeinde. Most of the shops, supermarkets, banks and inns stand on the main street along with Austraße, and on Glanstraße, while the school with its gymnasium and event hall and the Verbandsgemeinde administration building (town hall) stand on Schulstraße. Adjoining the school (Gustav-Schäffner-Schule, a Regionale Schule) is a sporting ground. The sport and leisure swimming pool lies east of the village off the main road going towards Bosenbach. The mediaeval church {{stands in the middle of}} the graveyard in the village’s northeast at the end of Glanstraße and across Kuseler Straße.|$|E
50|$|Altenglan’s ﬁrst known {{municipal}} charter {{dates from}} 1567, and was renewed in 1581. At {{the time of}} the 1609 ecclesiastical Visitation, there were 37 families in the village. As a result of the Plague, the population shrank greatly even before the Thirty Years' War broke out. According to the Huberweistum, a 1630 Weistum (a Weistum - cognate with English wisdom - was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times), there were then only 30 families still living in the village. That same year, Imperial troops plundered Altenglan. As in the whole swathe of countryside around Kusel, especially because of the wartime events of 1635, very few people in Altenglan survived this frightful war, and almost all the houses had been destroyed. For a long time, it was not even worth the trouble of holding church services in the church. Even after the population had built itself back up somewhat through newcomers to the village, there was more war, this time King Louis XIV’s wars of conquest. About 1680, Altenglan was said to be “burnt”. Nevertheless, during the 18th century, the population once again rose quickly by both migration to the village and natural growth, and according to the 1742 <b>stock</b> <b>book,</b> there were once more 47 houses in the village.|$|E
50|$|Perseverance was rebuilt as the Inspection Car {{for the use}} of the Victorian Railways' Commissioner (at {{the time}} there was only one), with {{capacity}} for 28 staff members. Like Enterprise it was entirely cleared out, but it underwent some structural changes as well. The window arrangement was changed with many paired windows joined into a single frame, to give a better view for railway staff. Although it is not clear, the following assumes that like Enterprise, the diagram was flipped when transcribed to the 1904 rolling <b>stock</b> <b>book</b> and the corridor shown at the bottom of the image is the same as that previously at the top. With that in mind, from the former Smoking end changed from 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1 to 1(1+1), 1(2), 1(3), 1, 1 (former 3), 2, 2, 3, 1+2(3), 1(2), 1(1+1). The former smoking end interior was replaced with an 10-seater saloon area; the centre of the carriage was replaced with a kitchen and lavatory, and the former ladies' end of the car was fitted with a 24 ft saloon with six chairs, four couches and an extending table, for a total capacity of 18. No formal sleeping facility was provided, though the couch pairs could have been used as beds. The car was renamed Norman on 20 January 1921, after the then-former Chairman of Commissioners, Mr. C. E. Norman; and around the same time extra chairs were added raising capacity to 30.|$|E
