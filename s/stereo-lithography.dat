40|$|The {{triangulation}} of boundary representation geometries (BRep geometries) is neccessary {{for display}} generation, <b>stereo-lithography</b> applications and also {{finite element mesh}} (FE mesh) generation. The accuracy of the tesselation is of great significance not only for <b>stereo-lithography</b> and rendering algorithms but also for FE mesh generation, since even minor simplifications of the geometry of the solid can lead to large errors in the FE computation. We therefore turn our attention to a new incremental algorithm for the accurate triangulation of meshes of trimmed parametric surfaces. Instead of triangulating each face seperately, {{the faces of the}} solid are glued and triangulated together according to the neighbourhood information of the BRep. By this procedure, glueing together faces with different triangulations is avoided. Another advantage of the algorithm is that the error between the linear approximation of the boundary and the boundary itself is controlled step by step until it lies within a predefined tolerance: Because the algorithm is fully incremental, later improvements of this tolerance can be easily added. The techniques we used to produce a robust implementation of this algorithm under finite precision arithmetic are reported...|$|E

Rapid prototyping of gears with complex tooth forms is {{possible with the}} use of modern methods. One of such methods is the <b>stereo-lithography,</b> where a pattern is obtained as a result of resin curing with laser beam. Patterns of that type are applicable in precision casting. Removing of stereo-lithographic pattern from foundry mould requires use of high temperatures. Resin burning would generate significant amounts of harmful gases. In case of a solid stereo-lithographic pattern, the pressure created during gas burning may cause the mould to crack. A gas volume reduction may be achieved by using patterns of honeycomb structure. However, this technique causes a significant worsening of accuracy of stereo-lithographic patterns in respect of their dimensions and shape. In cooperation with WSK PZL Rzeszów, the Machine Design Department of Rzeszow University of Technology carried out research on the design of hybrid stereo-lithographic patterns. Hybrid pattern consists of a section made by stereo-lithographic process and a section made of casting wax.

It is important that the aerosols containing the medications effectively reach the alveolar zone of the lungs. A certain part of the dose will deposit {{on the walls of the}} extra-thoracic airways (mouth-throat zone). This passage has a highly irregular shape with a mouth section, a 90 degree bend and the passage through the vocal cords. When the air enters the mouth by inhalation it passes through the pharynx and enters the trachea via the larynx which contains the epiglottis and the vocal cords. The severe constriction caused by the vocal cords causes the flow to accelerate resulting in a laryngeal jet. From CT-scans, taken at every 0. 5 mm of several human subjects during the inspiration phase of the inhalation cycle, an “idealized ” geometry of the human upper airways was created. From this non-scaled geometry a “negative ” kernel was generated by use of <b>stereo-lithography.</b> Then, a non-transparent silicone mould was fabricated wherein a low-melting point alloy was poured.

"Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 109 [...] 111) EDM {{is widely}} accepted in tool and die industries for its versatility in machining hardened steels. Its ability to machine heat treated hardened steels eliminates the conventional method of heat treatment after machining {{which results in}} distortions. However one draw back of the EDM process, which makes its uses limited, is the high cost and time for the electrode manufacture. The die sinking EDM process employs complex shaped electrodes which require specialized machining operation and often results in high lead times.

Rapid prototyping of the electrode models and electroforming with copper is a fervently studied method of producing cost effective electrodes.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{production}} of complex components {{with little or}} no machining by powder metallurgy (PM) techniques has brought in injection moulding {{as one of the most}} popular processing techniques. The tools and dies required for injection moulding are themselves complex and in order to process these, the technology of rapid prototyping (RP) or solid free-form fabrication (SFF) etc. has come into vogue. Essentially, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the required free-form is created and converted into STL (after the process Stereo Lithography for which 3 D systems developed this format) format. The latter is sliced into thin cross-sectional layers and the output is fed to the rapid prototyping machine which then builds the free-form, one layer atop another. The free-form is then sintered to yield the final product. During the past decade, RP has evolved into a class of technologies such as <b>stereo-lithography</b> (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), solid ground curing (SGC), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), fused deposition modelling (FDM), inkjet printing, etc. Not only can solid free forms be fabricated using these techniques, but functionally gradient materials (FGM) with properties varying from the surface to the interior, as well as composite materials, can also be advantageously made. The RP techniques are extensively used in processing ceramics and ceramic-polymer composites. The most popular techniques for metal powders are FDM and SLS. The latter often uses metal powders along with polymers. Complex shapes such as gears, turbine blades, etc. are produced. The technology however is in the early stages as far as Powder Metallurgy applications are concerned. It poses considerable challenges to the powder producers who are likely to concentrate on production of inks, gels, pastes and powder blends etc. in the future, which are required as feed materials for the RP techniques. The other feed materials which need to be developed will be in the form of metal powder-polymer blends, wires, rods, granules etc. The present paper discusses various RP processes and their applications to fabrication of automotive PM components...|$|E

An enabling technology which can build, repair or reconfigure components layer by layer or even pixel by pixel with appropriate materials to match the performance will enhance the productivity thus reduce energy consumption. Innovative product such a metallic composites with negative co-efficient of thermal expansion has already been demonstrated. The capability to form a three-dimensional object directly form digital data reduces many intermediate steps in manufacturing and, therefore, potentially an attractive and economic fabrication method. This is very suitable for low volume manufacturing. The major challenge for design of additive manufacturing machine is on line “Quality assurance” due to its application in low volume manufacturing. Statistical quality control is not applicable due to low volume. Moreover, any new innovative product has to go thorough a long process of certification before adaptation, especially for Aerospace and medical device industry. This paper presents the design methodology for Smart Metallic Additive Manufacturing System (s-AMS). In-situ optical diagnostics and its capability to integrate with the process control is a prudent alternative. The two main groups of AM are powder bed (e. g. Laser Sintering) and pneumatically delivered powder (e. g. Direct Metal Deposition [DMD]) to fabricate components. DMD enables one to deposit different material at different pixels with a given height directly from a CAD drawing. The feed back loop also controls the thermal cycle. New optical Sensors are being developed to control product health and geometry using imaging, cooling rate by monitoring temperature, microstructure and composition using optical spectra. Ultimately these sensors will enable one to “Certify as you Build”. Recently the author and his group have developed a technique to analyze the plasma spectra to predict the solid-state phase transformation, which opens up the new horizon for the materials processing and manufacturing. Flexibility of the process is enormous and essentially it is an enabling technology to materialize many a design. Conceptually one can seat in Houston and fabricate in Haifa. This paper discusses the in-situ diagnostic methods and its integration {{in the design of}} the machine...|$|E
