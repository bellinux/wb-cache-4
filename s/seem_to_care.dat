5|$|The {{episode was}} pitched and written by John Swartzwelder. The writing staff {{had to find}} a new angle for Homer's weight problems, as the idea had been used several times before.

5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

25|$|One {{issue is}} {{speeding}} resulting in safety concerns. From {{late at night}} to the early morning, {{in order to make}} more rounds during their shifts to earn more, drivers may risk speeding - especially on red minibuses. The government is trying to counter this by installing large, passenger-visible speedometers inside some minivans. This may be effective in some areas, however for the most part, most passengers do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care,</b> or in some cases even prefer the light buses to speed.|$|E
25|$|People may compete over {{getting the}} {{benefits}} of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.|$|E

25|$|Genie quickly began {{growing and}} putting on weight and {{steadily}} became more confident in her movements, and by December she had good eye–hand coordination and was much better at focusing her eyes. She rapidly developed a sense of possession, hoarding objects to which she took a liking for reasons doctors did not know, and became extremely upset if someone touched or moved anything she collected. She took all kinds of items but particularly sought colorful plastic objects, which doctors speculated was due to these having been the items she had access to as a child, {{and she did not}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> whether they were toys or ordinary containers but especially sought out beach pails. During {{the first few months of}} her stay, giving her one of these objects could bring her out of a tantrum.|$|E
25|$|Capcom later {{released}} Final Fight 2 in 1993, {{a sequel}} created {{specifically for the}} SNES. In this installment, Guy's sensei, Genryusai and his daughter Rena (Guy's fiancee), are kidnapped by the new incarnation of Mad Gear. In the game's story, Guy is off on a training mission and is unable to rescue his fiancee and master. Instead, the game features Guy's sister-in-law, Maki Genryusai, who has also been trained in the same fighting style, and Carlos Miyamoto, a South American swordsman. Guy only makes an appearance {{in the end of}} the game, although the game does feature power-up icons shaped after his character. In Final Fight 3, released in 1995, Guy finally returns to Metro City and teams up with Haggar to rid Metro City of the Skull Cross gang, the latest gang to try to pick up where Mad Gear had left off. They are joined by Metro City SCU officer Lucia Morgan and former gang member who double crossed the gang, Dean (who wanted revenge when Skull Cross murdered his family). The four succeed, and are able to rid Metro City of the criminals. Metro City is left in shambles, but Guy does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care,</b> and leaves that to Haggar.|$|E

500|$|Near {{the end of}} the project, Moore {{realized}} that the story bore some similarity to [...] "The Architects of Fear", an episode of The Outer Limits television series. The writer and Wein argued over changing the ending, and when Moore refused to give in, Wein quit the book. Wein explained, [...] "I kept telling him, 'Be more original, Alan, you've got the capability, do something different, not something that's already been done!' And he didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> enough to do that." [...] Moore acknowledged the Outer Limits episode by referencing it in the series' last issue.|$|E
500|$|G4 TV stated, [...] "It's {{the best}} {{original}} (nonport) GBA RPG to date", while GamePro {{called it a}} [...] "huge, fantastic, creative, and wickedly fun RPG that doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> that it's 'just' on a GBA". Game Informer called Golden Sun [...] "a visual treat", and said that its graphics [...] "would have amazed Super Nintendo owners back in the day". Noting the game's similarity to previous Japanese role-playing games, the reviewers {{believed that it was}} [...] "easily the best original RPG on the GBA", and the [...] "new ruler in the GBA RPG realm". Advance compared the game to the Pokémon series, and considered its graphics [...] "luscious" [...] and sound [...] "incredible [...] cinematic". Despite describing its plot as [...] "Cliche City", the magazine hailed the game as [...] "the best handheld role-player ever".|$|E
500|$|A {{handsome}} riverboat gambler, Gaylord Ravenal, {{appears on}} the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia ("Nolie") Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap'n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (Parthy).

He replies that there are [...] "lots like [...] on the river." [...] As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice.

500|$|The {{series was}} met with many {{positive}} reviews. Reviewers praised the series' vibrant graphics, high-quality sound, and varied, refined RPG gameplay, with particular optimism on the Djinn-based gameplay system and Battle aspect {{despite the fact that}} the original two games were limited to the 32-bit cartridge. GamePro raved that Golden Sun was [...] "A huge, fantastic, creative, and wickedly fun RPG that doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> that it's 'just' on a GBA," [...] while they praised that The Lost Ages eye-popping magic effects are beautiful even by console standards. IGN, meanwhile, praised the plot's intricate structure, saying that it [...] "has been so tightly integrated into every ounce of the adventure... such a rich and deep plot that it's almost easy to get lost if you're not paying attention." [...] 1UP praised Dark Dawn as being a huge step forward in terms of pacing and graphics compared to the previous games.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, the United States Forest Service {{started a}} program to set aside [...] "primitive areas" [...] in the {{national}} forests to protect wilderness while opening it to use.

[...] Beginning in 1925, he served as secretary of the Joint Committee on the Recreational Survey of Federal Lands, a position he held until 1930. [...] Composed of members of both the NPA and the USFS, the committee sought a separate national recreation policy that would distinguish between recreational and preservation areas. [...] The NPA and Yard were both criticized by activists who feared that the association would be eclipsed by the Forest Service's own program goals. [...] Yard at times felt isolated and under-appreciated by his peers. [...] He wrote in 1926, [...] "I wonder whether I'm justified in forcing this work upon people who <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> so little about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Mau {{first visited}} Hawaii in 1973, and McCoy {{introduced}} him to Ben Finney. Later, Finney suggested to the Polynesian Voyaging Society that they should try to recruit Mau for their Hōkūle‘a project, since no Hawaiian traditional navigators remained. The project goal was {{to test the hypothesis}} that Polynesians made intentional non-instrument voyages across the Pacific. Tevake, a renowned Polynesian navigator, had died in 1970 and only six others were known. Navigators were reluctant to release their sacred knowledge to [...] "outsiders". At the time, Mau was just 41 years old and the youngest navigator out of the group. Mau feared that traditional navigation would die in his own culture, just as it had in Hawaii. He had tried to teach the young men of Satawal the skills passed on to him, but he was not optimistic. The members of the younger generation were too busy with school and too attracted to Western culture to undertake the rigorous course of study and apprenticeship. Further, Mau's people did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> that traditional navigation was dying and could be lost forever.|$|E

500|$|The {{manuscript}} is a {{quarto volume}} written on paper in 223 leaves; since it also contains random items {{not connected to}} the Chronicle itself (for example, poems and health advice), it was clearly a commonplace book. Still, {{the majority of the}} content makes up what has become known as the Chronicle of London, and ranges from the accession of Richard I to the deposition of Edward IV. It is predominantly London-centric, particularly pertaining to major political events such as the rebellion of Jack Cade in 1450 and the resultant 'harvest of heads' on London Bridge Gate, as the chronicle calls it. It has been suggested, in fact, that the level of detail with which it describes the revolt indicates that the author witnessed it first-hand. The chronicler likewise discusses the [...] "trayturly" [...] murder of James I of Scotland in 1437 amidst a discussion of London business, and on occasion demonstrates humour, if a politically-motivated form of it. Occasionally the author reveals a mildly sardonic view of the then king, Henry VI, although generally, [...] "the chronicler does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> at all" [...] about the king (unlike, say, the author of Bale's Chronicle).|$|E
500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care,</b> after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>care.</b> It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E
