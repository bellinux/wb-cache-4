50|$|There are {{currently}} three known types of photoreceptor cells in mammalian eyes: rods, cones, and photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. The two classic photoreceptor cells are rods and cones, each contributing information {{used by the}} visual system to form {{a representation of the}} visual world, <b>sight.</b> The <b>rods</b> are narrower than the cones and distributed differently across the retina, but the chemical process in each that supports phototransduction is similar. A third class of mammalian photoreceptor cell was discovered during the 1990s: the photosensitive ganglion cells. These cells do not contribute to sight directly, but are thought to support circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were many}} {{heliograph}} types. Most heliographs were variants of the British Army Mance Mark V version (Fig.1). It used a mirror {{with a small}} unsilvered spot in the centre. The sender aligned the heliograph to the target {{by looking at the}} reflected target in the mirror and moving their head until the target was hidden by the unsilvered spot. Keeping their head still, they then adjusted the aiming rod so its cross wires bisected the target. They then turned up the sighting vane, which covered the cross wires with a diagram of a cross, and aligned the mirror with the tangent and elevation screws so the small shadow that was the reflection of the unsilvered spot hole was on the cross target. [...] This indicated that the sunbeam was pointing at the target. The flashes were produced by a keying mechanism that tilted the mirror up a few degrees at the push of a lever {{at the back of the}} instrument. If the sun was in front of the sender, its rays were reflected directly from this mirror to the receiving station. If the sun was behind the sender, the <b>sighting</b> <b>rod</b> was replaced by a second mirror, to capture the sunlight from the main mirror and reflect it to the receiving station. The U. S. Signal Corps heliograph mirror did not tilt. This type produced flashes by a shutter mounted on a second tripod (Fig 4).|$|R
5000|$|The use of triangles to {{estimate}} distances dates to antiquity. In the 6th century BC, about 250 {{years prior to}} the establishment of the Ptolemaic dynasty, the Greek philosopher Thales is recorded as using similar triangles {{to estimate}} the height of the pyramids of ancient Egypt. He measured the length of the pyramids' shadows and that of his own at the same moment, and compared the ratios to his height (intercept theorem). Thales also estimated the distances to ships at sea as seen from a clifftop by measuring the horizontal distance traversed by the line-of-sight for a known fall, and scaling up to the height of the whole cliff. Such techniques would have been familiar to the ancient Egyptians. Problem 57 of the Rhind papyrus, a thousand years earlier, defines the seqt or seked as the ratio of the run to the rise of a slope, i.e. the reciprocal of gradients as measured today. The slopes and angles were measured using a <b>sighting</b> <b>rod</b> that the Greeks called a dioptra, the forerunner of the Arabic alidade. A detailed contemporary collection of constructions for the determination of lengths from a distance using this instrument is known, the Dioptra of Hero of Alexandria (c. 10-70 AD), which survived in Arabic translation; but the knowledge became lost in Europe. In China, Pei Xiu (224-271) identified [...] "measuring right angles and acute angles" [...] as the fifth of his six principles for accurate map-making, necessary to accurately establish distances; while Liu Hui (c. 263) gives a version of the calculation above, for measuring perpendicular distances to inaccessible places.|$|R
5000|$|A joint {{production}} program was undertaken after the Winchester design passed United States Army Ordnance Department tests in 1878. Springfield Armory assembled rifles from Winchester actions and hardware with barrels and stocks manufactured at the armory. <b>Sights,</b> cleaning <b>rods,</b> and stock hardware were {{nearly identical to}} contemporary production for the single-shot [...] "trapdoor" [...] Springfield Model 1873. The Army ordered 513 Hotchkiss First Model Rifles for infantry units stationed on the western frontier including Texas and Fort Abraham Lincoln in the Dakota Territory. Springfield subsequently modified 501 of these rifles to First Model and Second Model Carbines for testing by cavalry units. Carbines have a shorter barrel and stock and the rear sight is marked HC for Hotchkiss Carbine. The United States Navy ordered 1,474 First Model Rifles with 28.75 in barrels rather than the 32.25 in barrels on Army rifles.|$|R
40|$|Cone photoreceptors mediate {{daylight}} and bright light vision {{and are thus}} critical to human <b>sight.</b> <b>Rods</b> outnumber cones in most mammalian retinas and this has hindered the study of cone function at the molecular and biochemical level. Cones comprise just 3 % of the retina in mouse, the only mammalian system {{for the study of}} experimental gene modification within an intact system. A mouse null for the transcription factor neural retina leucine zipper protein (Nrl) generated by Alan Mears and Anand Swaroop showed promise as having a cone-enriched retina. However, the issue of whether these photoreceptors were cones or cone-rod intermediates was left unresolved. The first part of this thesis provides a thorough characterization of Nrl −/− mouse photoreceptors. Immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, Western blot analysis, and electroretinography were used to characterize the protein expression, ultrastructure, morphology, and function of Nrl−/− mouse photoreceptors. The results of these experiments support the conclusion that Nrl −/− mouse photoreceptors are cones and not cone-rod intermediates. ^ Cone photoreceptors typically recover from light stimulation faster than rods. However, the molecular details of cone light response inactivation are not well understood. In the second part of this thesis the role of the G-protein coupled receptor kinase Grk 1 in cone opsin phosphorylation and cone response recovery was investigated in suction pipette recordings from single Nrl−/−-Grk 1 −/− and Nrl−/− mouse photoreceptors. Nrl−/− photoreceptor light responses recover more rapidly than wt rods. Like wt mouse cones, both short-wave (S-opsin, λ max= 360 nm) and mid wave (M-opsin, λmax∼ 510 nm) sensitive cone pigments are found to be functionally coexpressed in Nrl−/− mouse photoreceptors. Functional coexpression of S- and M-opsins with their distinct absorption maxima allowed the recording of dim flash responses of photoreceptors driven exclusively by either opsin. Grk 1 was found to be essential for normal inactivation of both S- and M-opsins of mouse. However, the inactivation of the M-pigment response was much more delayed by the absence of Grk 1, revealing a relatively effective, Grk 1 -independent inactivation pathway for S-opsin. ...|$|R
50|$|Automatic levels {{make use}} of a {{compensator}} that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument (to within maybe 0.05 degree). The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and doesn't have to relevel it carefully each time he <b>sights</b> on a <b>rod</b> on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod to the actual amount of motion instead of leveraging the tilt over the sight distance. Three level screws are used to level the instrument.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, the Soviet Union {{captured}} {{millions of}} Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles and re-furbished them in various arms {{factories in the}} late 1940s and early 1950s. These rifles, referred to by collectors as RC ("Russian Capture") Mausers, can be identified by an [...] "X" [...] stamp {{on the left side}} of the receiver. The Soviet arsenals made no effort to match the rifle's original parts by serial number when reassembling them, and some metal parts (the cleaning <b>rod,</b> <b>sight</b> hood, and locking screws) omitted after rebuilding, and instead were melted down and recycled, presumably with the other parts that weren't suitable for re-use.Many of these rifles (along with the Mosin-Nagant rifle) served in conflicts after World War 2.|$|R
5000|$|When {{using an}} optical level, the {{endpoint}} {{may be out}} of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. Turning is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location. To [...] "turn" [...] the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed. The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor {{will not be able to}} <b>sight</b> the <b>rod</b> and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to 25 feet high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.|$|R
40|$|Sensor-based {{planning}} for rod-shaped robots {{is necessary for}} the realistic deployment of noncircularly symmetric robots into unknown environments. Whereas circularly symmetric robots have two-dimensional Euclidean configuration spaces, planar rod robots posses three degrees-of-freedom, two for position and one for orientation, and hence have a three-dimensional configuration space, (2). In this work, we define the rod hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (rod-HGVG) which is a roadmap of the rod's configuration space. Prior work in Voronoibased roadmaps use a retraction of the robot's free space to define the roadmap; here, we break a part the robot's free space into regions where fragments of the roadmap are defined and then connect the fragments. The primary advantage of the rod-HGVG is that it is defined in terms of workspace distance measurements, which makes it amenable to sensor-based planning. This paper also includes a numerical procedure that generates the rod-HGVG edge fragments using only information that is within line of <b>sight</b> of the <b>rod</b> robot. It is worth noting that this procedure does not require an explicit definition of configuration space, i. e., this procedure constructs a roadmap of rod configuration space without ever constructing the configuration space itself.
