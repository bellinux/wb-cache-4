Phase 1 Was completed in 2002 and involved updating equipment technology to have automated and remote operation capabilities. Phase 2 was completed in 2004-05 and focused on regulating waste that enters the dam and could damage the machines. This included adding [...] "trash-rack cleaning machine, sluice gate and trash racks" [...] to filter out trash that flows through the river into the dam. Phase 3 {{is scheduled to be}} finished in 2017 and includes a final restoration of the units including, [...] "new runner, rewinding the generator, stator restack, converting rotating exciter to <b>static</b> <b>excitation</b> and refurbishment of wicket gates." [...] As part of the remodeling of the plant a computer model was created to determine the optimal size and shape of the turbines to ensure maximum productivity from the plant.

40|$|Time‐modulated arrays exploit {{time as an}} {{additional}} degree of freedom [1] where a set of radio‐frequency (RF) switches are used to modulate the <b>static</b> <b>excitations</b> to arbitrarily shape the radiation pattern. Firstly, time‐modulation has been considered for the synthesis of radar array to obtain low and ultra‐low sidelobe patterns [2]. Unfortunately, the periodic on‐off of the RF switches causes the generations of undesired radiations, the so‐called sideband radiation (SR) [3], which represents a loss of the radiated power. Such a drawback has limited the use of time‐modulated array in real world applications. This is the author's version of the final version available at IEEE...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} towards the use of time‐modulated arrays (TMAs) thanks to the simplicity in reconfiguring the average pattern of the antenna just modifying the on‐off sequence controlling a set of radio‐frequency (RF) switches. TMAs have been originally introduced for the generation of low and ultra‐low sidelobe patterns for radar arrays [1] thus avoiding the implementation of impracticable excitation tapering with high dynamic range ratios. However, they haven’t received a large diffusion because of the power losses due to the generation of harmonic radiation at multiples of the time‐modulation frequency. As a matter of fact, the periodic modulation of the <b>static</b> <b>excitations</b> causes a shift of the radiated power in the sideband radiation (SR) [2] with a consequent reduction of the directivity of the pattern at the carrier frequency...|$|R

However, an improved brushless excitation system is in operation on some commercial power plants (36 MVA, 93. 75 rpm & 52 MVA, 166. 67 rpm) with grid-assisting performance beyond the conventional static system. The convenional diode bridge is replaced with a remote-controlled thyristor bridge on the shaft. If wireless communication is not allowed, a control signal through brushes should be employed instead. The thesis explores the expected new era for large brushless hydrogenerators. The proposed brushless system have benefits of reduced regular maintenance due to elimination of brushes and reduced unscheduled maintenance due to redundancy; causing a redused cost-of-energy. A six-phase exciter design with a hybrid-mode thyristor bridge interface leads to improved fault-tolerance, better controllability, minimized torque pulsations and reduced armature currents of the exciter. Excitation boosting (EB) capability {{is included in the}} brushless system without additional components or circuitry, contrary to the <b>static</b> <b>excitation</b> system.

40|$|The {{approach}} for {{the description of}} the DNA conformational transformations on the mesoscopic scales in the frame of the double helix is presented. Due to consideration of the joint motions of DNA structural elements along the conformational pathways the models for different transformations may be constructed in the unifying two-component form. One component of the model is the degree of freedom of the elastic rod and another component [...] the effective coordinate of the conformational transformation. The internal and external model components are interrelated, as it is characteristic for the DNA structure organization. It is shown that the kinetic energy of the conformational transformation of heterogeneous DNA may be put in homogeneous form. In the frame of the developed approach the <b>static</b> <b>excitations</b> of the DNA structure under the transitions between the stable states are found for internal and external components.

40|$|The Norwegian Network Code FIKS {{from the}} Norwegian Transmission System Operator (TSO) Statnett, states that {{synchronous}} generators ≥ 25 MVA {{must have a}} <b>static</b> <b>excitation</b> system. It also includes requirements on the step time response and the available field winding ceiling voltage of the excitation system. An improved brushless excitation system is in operation in some pilot power plants. A rotating thyristor bridge is controlled via Bluetooth. The step time response is as fast as conventional <b>static</b> <b>excitation</b> systems. However, a ceiling voltage factor of 2 requires the thyristor bridge to operate at firing angles about 60 degrees. High torque pulsations, low power factor and low utilization of the exciter is the end result.

Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Static</b> current-compounding <b>excitation</b> schemes that provide an isolated synchronous generator with a field current that increases both with increasing load and with worsening power factor have been in existence for many years.
