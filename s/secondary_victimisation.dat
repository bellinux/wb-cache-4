40|$|This {{qualitative}} retrospective {{descriptive study}} explored English and Australian secondary victims of homicidenarrativesof {{their experiences in}} order to identify and delineate their post homicide support needs. This thesis is a study of the experiences of support proffered to secondary victims of homicide in England and Australia, and their perceptions of the nature of that support. The support included, but was not limited to, support needs emanating from within the criminal justice system. The study also documented the support secondary victims of homicide experienced in totality in order to develop an evidence base from which to better understand the sources of support available to the victims. Underpinned by a range of social theories including the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) health construct, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, and contemporary grief, trauma, and victimology theories, this descriptive study relied on constant comparisons to analyse the content of 28 face-toface semi-structured interviews. A systematic in-depth review of data revealed that the relative rate at which people affected by homicide discussed helpful support, be it from their existing social support network or beyond their formal support network, was almost equal, and the majority of all support was described as helpful. However, analysis at the intermediate and personal level (meso and micro levels) identified some support sources were reported as being significantly more helpful than others. The results documented the demographic profile of the secondary victims of homicide, the circumstances surrounding their experiences of homicide and the sources of support they identified, the number of times each was mentioned {{and the nature of the}} support experience described i. e. how effective the support experienced was based on if it was described as helpful or unhelpful. The specific supportive relationships identified were grouped into sources, systems, and networks. Four themes emerged from the study that suggest that people in supportive roles must be mindful that homicide experiences are complex and elongated, random acts of kindness are profoundly helpful, family and friends feature strongly in discussions of support, and any support must be provided in a holistic manner. Analysis of the data at the network level (the macro level) revealed that the formal and social support networks featured strongly. However, further scrutiny revealed support provided by the social support network was described as unhelpful in significantly less instances than that provided by the formal support network. Analysis of support systems data (the meso level) revealed that support provided by friends, community and family was consistently referred to as helpful, whereas support provided by therapeutic, justice and public support systems was regularly described as unhelpful. Examination of the data in relation to each of the identified sources of support revealed that those most helpful for secondary victims of homicide were educational facilities, other victims of the offender, generic grief support, children and work places. Support from the forensic mental health services, the offender, the associates of the offender, organisations, post court services, and generic therapeutic services were commonly described as unhelpful. The findings also documented that secondary victims of homicide experience an array of supportive experiences over many years whilst dealing with a multitude of personal, emotional, and psychosocial stressors that arise out of their unique and complex circumstances and experiences of victimisation. The results of this research conclude that the established presence of high levels of trauma and complicated grief in this population may make them more vulnerable to subsequent experiences of trauma and injustice, accounting for why unhelpful experiences of support (<b>secondary</b> <b>victimisations)</b> described in this study were particularly harmful, despite the overall relatively high prevalence of helpful experiences of support. This study also deconstructed the concept of ‘support’ for secondary victims of homicide, identifying nine support systems, which involved a range of 35 support sources available to secondary victims of homicide. Having identified these support systems and sources, this study went on to explore the helpfulness of these supports to secondary victims of homicide. Finally, a model is proposed to identify, and delineate three dynamic dimensions of post homicide support, the buffering factors (needs), structural supports available (resources), and the type and nature of support provided (functions). Suggestions put forward by the participants are presented and several recommendations are proposed on to how to better support secondary victims of homicide...|$|R

Building on a previous theoretical and empirical research (within {{the framework of a}} larger research project on 'Victims and Corporations'), these Guidelines provide an overview of the minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime established by the Directive (§ I), with specific respect to the peculiarities and problems related to corporate violence victimization, i. e. to criminal offences committed by corporations {{in the course of their}} legitimate activities, which result in harms to natural persons’ health, integrity or life, and whose victims experience a whole range of distinctive risks of <b>secondary</b> and repeat <b>victimisation,</b> of intimidation and retaliation, as well as of harm to their dignity and private and family life. An overview of the harms and risks suffered by these victims is therefore indispensible in view of a competent and effective individual assessment of their specific protection needs (§ II). The usually collective dimension of corporate violence victimization, together with the frequently long latency periods which characterize the onset of the harmful effects, and with the recurrence of scientific uncertainty about causal links and, in some cases, about the meaning and relevance of symptoms experienced by victims, all add to the greater difficulty in identifying and recognizing these victims and their status as such, so that specific guidelines are provided with this respect (§ III). Due to the same factors, these victims also present peculiar needs for information (§ IV), as well as for protection from secondary and repeat victimization, from intimidation and from retaliation, including against the risk of emotional or psychological harm (§ V), as well as against risks for their privacy, their personal integrity and personal data (§ VI). Further guidelines are specifically addressed at tackling, as far as possible, the difficulties corporate violence victims experience in getting adequate and economically sustainable legal assistance (§ VII), in accessing criminal justice and in participating, in an informed and effective way, in criminal proceedings, as well as in achieving a decision on compensation from individual and corporate offenders (§ VIII). Corporate violence victims’ possibilities to access specific restorative justice programmes are also addressed (§ IX), together with law enforcement agents’ duties in providing information and advice about available support services, in a country where no specific victim support services have, as yet, been provided for (§ X). The importance of training for police officers, judges and prosecutors is also addressed, with specific attention to the available channels for the implementation of adequate and specific trainings aimed at tackling corporate violence victims’ criticalities and needs (§ XI). Finally, specific attention is paid to possible critical issues, as well as general principles, related to the integration of such an innovative EU discipline within the Italian legal framework (§ XII) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} shinkokuzai first entered into Japanese {{law in the}} early Meiji period. The 1870 {{criminal}} code Shinritsu Kōryō (新律綱領), though it {{did not use the}} term directly, stated that the prosecution of a number of violent offences between husband and wife depended on a complaint by the person in question. The phrase used to express this condition, [...] wo mate, is probably the origin of the modern term shinkokuzai; mizukara tsugeru (to inform personally) contains two of the same kanji used to write shinkokuzai. The draft criminal code of November 1877 used the term shinkokuzai directly in the definitions of various offences. Under modern Japanese law, sexual offences such as simple rape or indecent assault are categorised as shinkokuzai, lest a prosecution against the victim's will result in <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> or infringement of privacy.|$|E

Dr Lisa Miller (JAVMA News, 2004) Veterinarians and veterinary nurses, along with other health care professionals, may experience compassion fatigue as a result of continued exposure to the traumatic events their patients and families experience. Also called secondary traumatic stress (STS) or vicarious traumatisation, the result can be a falling off in professional capabilities, emotional exhaustion, distress and burnout. This phenomenon is not only experienced by professional “helpers and carers”, but also by non-professional care-givers and volunteers. Compassion fatigue has been defined as “the emotional burden that health care providers may experience as a result of overexposure to traumatic events that patients are experiencing ” (Schwam, 1998). An earlier term used to describe this phenomenon was <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> (Figley, 1982).

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of binge drinking behaviour and ambivalent sexism on attitudes towards hypothetical victims and perpetrators of acquaintance rape. Design/methodology/approach – The research sample comprised 189 students. All were provided with a fictional rape scenario, depicting varying levels of perpetrator intoxication or varying extents to which an intoxicated victim was able to recall providing consent. Participants were then asked to rate their opinions of victim and perpetrator responsibility. They also completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), the Attitudes towards Rape Victim Scale (ARVS), and a measure to assess respondent binge drinking behaviour. Findings – Respondents attributed more responsibility to intoxicated victims of acquaintance rape than victims who were not intoxicated. Respondents classified as non-sexist had more victim empathy than respondents classified as ambivalent sexists. Respondents' binge drinking behaviour did not impact on attributions of victim responsibility. Research limitations/implications – Fictional rape scenarios are utilised in the current research. The research literature highlights the difficulties posed by the presence of uncontrolled variables (such as the description of the victim) within hypothetical scenarios. The findings reported here should therefore be generalised with caution. Recommendations for future research are suggested. Practical implications – The study has practical implications in developing an understanding of legal decision making and factors influencing the potential <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> of victims. Originality/value – The paper adds to the current literature in attempting to explore the influence of respondents' binge drinking behaviour on attitudes towards intoxicated victims...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} said that the victim of a sexual assault is {{actually}} assaulted twice- once by the offender and once by the criminal justice system. ” 1 South Africa’s rape shield provision is contained in section 227 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 2 The purpose of its enactment is to protect a complainant in a sexual offence matter from <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> during the trial as far as possible, by restricting the type of evidence that is admissible and the circumstances under which such evidence can be found to be admissible. This rationale has come under attack for its effect on the fair trial rights of the accused. There has been no challenge to the constitutionality of section 227 before a court yet. However, there are numerous rumblings of discontent at the consequences of a provision that restricts evidence that could be necessary to prevent a wrongful conviction. This paper seeks to consider the constitutional debates surrounding section 227 and to determine whether, {{to the extent that they}} may prove to be constitutionally problematic, the potential constitutional challenges are justifiable under a limitations analysis. It is impossible to engage with the constitutionality of section 227 without first discussing the rationale behind rape shield laws in general. The structure of the paper is therefore as follows: firstly, the history and purpose of rape shield laws will be investigated, and secondly, the history of section 227 under South African law will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{reality of}} rape {{as a direct}} form of contact crime remains deeply entrenched in South African communities, despite {{numerous}} efforts from various governmental stakeholders to curb this heinous crime. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act (32 of 2007), came into effect in 2007 as a strategic approach to prevent <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> of a victim of sexual offence through the Criminal Justice System (CJS). One of the strategies employed in the aforementioned Act, is the compulsory Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing of alleged sex offenders. The compulsory HIV testing of an alleged sex offender evoked controversy pertaining to its efficiency and the human rights violations that might be incurred upon the alleged accused. This article will highlight the subjective perceptions of adult female rape survivors towards their rights {{and the rights of}} alleged sex offenders following rape. The research was conducted at four Thuthuzela Care Centres (TCCs) in the Gauteng province, which are one stop multi-disciplinary state-owned facilities providing medico-legal services for victims of sexual offences in South Africa.

40|$|The EU 2012 Directive on victim rights voices some {{concerns}} {{with regard to}} restorative justice, which are shared by victimologists, practitioners and policy-makers alike, mostly being concerned with the question whether restorative justice approaches lead to <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> and whether restorative justice is really implemented with a central concern for {{the position of the}} victim. This presentation first reviews the existing literature with regard to both victims’ experiences more generally and restorative justice more specifically. It then discusses the results of an empirical research carried out in Austria, Finland and the Netherlands where restorative justice is implemented from an offender-, more neutral and victim-oriented point of view. Using the same questionnaire when interviewing victims, the results in the three countries point to both similarities and differences such as satisfaction of victims and the importance of the regulatory framework, with the most striking outcome being that the institutional setting does {{make a difference in the}} sense that victims seem to agree with what they get: when it is a diversionary scheme they believe the outcome should affect the judicial proceedings; when it is complementary victims focus more on the importance of the communication process. Interviews with both victim support and restorative justice practitioners show that both these groups of actors have an important influence on the way the practices are implemented and that generally restorative justice seems to be more available to offenders than to victims. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDThe thesis {{draws on}} the author's own {{contribution}} to a co-authored text Wolhuter, et al, 2009), which was aimed at introducing students to the legal landscape pertaining to victims' rights in England and Wales. All the arguments presented and issues addressed in this contribution constitute the author's own work, and were developed without any form of collaboration with the co-authors. While the thesis incorporates the basic issues that arose for consideration in the author's contribution to this text, it goes beyond this contribution to develop a systematic framework for the recognition of enforceable victims' rights flowing from the overarching rules of EU law. The thesis explores {{the extent to which}} the entrenchment in English law of enforceable rights for victims of crime in general, and socially unequal victims in particular, will reduce <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> at the hands of criminal justice agencies. The absence of such rights in English law constitutes a significant lacuna in the state’s responses to victims, particularly in light of the recent recognition of enforceable victims’ rights in EU law. The thesis accordingly seeks to contribute to the generation of a victims' rights discourse in the UK, with the aim of encouraging the introduction of enforceable rights for victims. To this end, it engages in a comparative analysis of victims' rights in EU law, European human rights law and American law. It contends that the United Kingdom ought to agree to be bound by the Draft Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime (2011, the "Victims' Directive"), which will render the victims' rights enshrined therein directly enforceable in national courts. In addition, it considers each of the rights in the Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings (2001 / 220 /JHA), and its prospective successor, the Victims' Directive, including the rights to information, respect and recognition, protection, participation and compensation, pointing to ways in which these rights may be given full effect in English law. In particular, the thesis advocates the recognition of active victim participation to empower victims in the pre-trial and trial processes. It maintains that the models of active victim participation in German and Swedish law, namely auxiliary prosecution and victims’ lawyers, reduce <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation,</b> particularly for vulnerable victims of serious offences, and ought to be introduced in English law. The thesis also evaluates the position of socially unequal victims, namely women victims of gender-based violence, minority ethnic victims of racially and religiously motivated crime, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ("LGBT") victims of homophobic and transphobic crime, and victims of elder abuse. It locates these victims within the framework of international and European human rights law, and recommends reforms to English law that would facilitate and enhance their exercise of the victims' rights that it advocates. The thesis concludes by delineating the contours of a victims' rights' model, which encompasses the recognition of victims' rights as enforceable human rights, the correlation of these rights with the right to freedom from discrimination, and the introduction of active procedural rights in the pre-trial and trial processes...|$|E
40|$|Domestic Violence is well {{described}} as being a pervasive problem, affecting women from all sectors of society. Levels of domestic violence reflect a problem that has been entrenched in society, perpetuated by tradition, culture and gender norms, and with it being exacerbated by the effects of apartheid. Due to {{the enormity of the}} problem, the South African government has committed itself to the eradication of violence against women through the ratification of international treaties and the reformulation of legislation to protect women. The Human Rights Watch report of 1995 indicated that although legislation was in place, it was ineffective as women were not aware of it and the criminal justice system subjected women to <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> due to the attitudes of officials. The Domestic Violence Act No. 116 of 1998 was developed through a process of civil society participation, taking into account the experiences of women. The Act was thus heralded as comprehensive in nature, aiming to provide women with “maximum protection”. The aim of this research study was to evaluate the impact of the Act by describing and examining the experiences of women a year before and a year after the implementation of the Act. The study was conducted in an urban (Bellville) and a rural (Paarl) area in the Western Cape. The study combined both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. The quantitative study reviewed court records by randomly sampling a of court records of applications for a Protection Order during the year before and the year after the implementation of the Act. A total of 1 044 court records were reviewed, made up by 28...|$|E
40|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> {{suffered}} {{by women in}} sexual assault court cases is well documented and {{is a factor in}} women 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance to report sexual assault. Over recent years, state, territory and national governments have attempted to minimise the negative impacts of the law. Tasmania, for example, has introduced initiatives to increase access to Legal Aid and court support for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. The ACT has offered specialist training to police, prosecutors and victim support workers, with new legislation in 2008 providing victims with improved protection during the court process. In NSW, the Attorney-General 2 ̆ 7 s Criminal Justice Sexual Offences Taskforce developed 70 recommendations on ways to improve the responsiveness {{of the criminal justice system}} to victims of sexual assault. These government initiatives affirm a general awareness that women 2 ̆ 7 s experience of the criminal justice system must improve if more women are to pursue justice through the courts. This Wrap examines one initiative to improve women 2 ̆ 7 s experience the criminal justice system through the provision of support for victims throughout the process. It is informed by consultations with sexual assault counsellors who have worked extensively in helping women navigate the legal system, and by other key informants. It draws on their expertise to distil strategies for effective practice. The case studies at the end of this publication illustrate a range of initiatives designed to improve justice outcomes for victims of sexual assault. The role sexual assault services play in the legal process in each state is summarised in Web Appendix 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} about employers' liability to protect the mental welfare of employees alongside their physical health. The need for protection is demonstrated in several ways. Firstly, the introduction examines the statistical evidence of harassment {{in the workplace and}} its effect on its victims. Secondly, data was collected from nine participants who had taken their employer to court claiming that they had been bullied out of their jobs. These documents which were supplemented in some cases by personal statements, were analysed using the Glaser and Strauss Grounded Theory method tempered with Case Study method. Ethical issues coming to the fore during data collection supplied additional material for a chapter which eflects on problems researchers will encounter when working with vulnerable research participants. Analysis showed the importance of social support for victims and implicated the role the trade unions, the medical and legal professions plays in <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation</b> for victims of workplace bullying. A review of existing legislation was conducted to determine if internal voluntary guidelines or new legislation would give best protection. Employer-led bullying was identified as the form on which internal guidelines have no impact. Workplace bullying was always found to be morally wrong and the issue of what is legally right but not morally right was discussed. The findings emerging from the analysis together with recommendation to place protection of harassment at work within Health and Safety policies was presented to opinion makers to gauge the level of interest in the investigator's recommendation that European Union Health and Safety officials should take the lead in advancing legislative change outlawing workplace harassment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundVictims who are {{involved}} in a compensation processes generally have more health complaints compared to victims who are not involved in a compensation process. Previous research regarding the effect of compensation processes has concentrated on the effect on physical health. This meta-analysis focuses on the effect of compensation processes on mental health. MethodProspective cohort studies addressing compensation and mental health after traffic accidents, occupational accidents or medical errors were identified using PubMed, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Relevant studies published between January 1966 and 10 June 2011 were selected for inclusion. ResultsTen studies were included. The first finding was that the compensation group already had higher mental health complaints at baseline compared to the non-compensation group (standardised mean difference (SMD) =− 0. 38; 95 % confidence interval (CI) − 0. 66 to − 0. 10; p=. 01). The second finding was that mental health between baseline and post measurement improved less in the compensation group compared to the non-compensation group (SMD=− 0. 35; 95 % CI − 0. 70 to − 0. 01; p=. 05). However, the quality of evidence was limited, mainly because of low quality study design and heterogeneity. DiscussionBeing involved in a compensation process is associated with higher mental health complaints but three-quarters of the difference appeared to be already present at baseline. The findings of this study should be interpreted with caution because of the limited quality of evidence. The difference at baseline may be explained by a selection bias or more anger and blame about the accident in the compensation group. The difference between baseline and follow-up may be explained by secondary gain and <b>secondary</b> <b>victimisation.</b> Future research should involve assessment of exposure to compensation processes, should analyse and correct for baseline differences, and could examine the effect of time, compensation scheme design, and claim settlement on (mental) health...|$|E
