"So off I sot, {{and there}} wos a crowd o' {{about two hundred}} miners round a tree; and, jest as I come up, <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> puttin' the rope round the neck of a poor wretch of an old grey-haired red-skin, whose limbs trembled <b>so</b> that <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> scarce able to hold him up.|$|R

[...] "I knowed a set o' young fellers as banded theirselves together, and swore they'd go through fire an' water, thick an' thin, but they'd niver turn {{back from the}} face o' danger {{wherever}} <b>they</b> met it. <b>So,</b> one day <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> crossin' a river on the ice, an' the first on 'em fell in, an' wos carried away by the current; an' what does the second do, but he walks straight into the hole, an' wos drowned too; an' the nixt wos goin' to foller, when the old warriors ran at him an' forced him back. If they hadn't stopped him, I do b'lieve--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "They {{was pretty}} {{vigorous}} w'en <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> at it, sir," [...] said Disco, {{in reference to}} supper, observing that his companion {{looked up from his}} book, [...] "but <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> sooner done than I had expected." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay," [...] remarked Joe, [...] "after the waller dries, {{it becomes}} a ring o' greener grass than the rest o' the plain, as ye see. 'Tis said the first hunters used to wonder greatly at these myster'ous circles, and they invented all sorts o' stories to account for 'em. Some said <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> fairy-rings, but at last they comed to know <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> nothin' more nor less than places where buffaloes wos used to waller in. It's often {{seemed to me that}} if we knowed the raisons o' things we wouldn't be so much puzzled wi' them as we are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, that's true," [...] {{observed}} Bounce; [...] "some o' {{the whites}} in them parts {{is no better}} nor they should be. They treats the poor Injuns as if <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> dogs or varmints, an' then they're astonished if the redskins murder them out o' revenge. I know'd one feller as {{told me that when}} he lived on the west side o' the mountains, where some of the Injuns are a murderin' set o' thieves, he niver lost a chance o' killin' a redskin. Of course the redskins niver lost a chance o' killin' the whites; an' <b>so</b> <b>they</b> come to sich a state o' war, that they had to make peace by givin' them no end o' presents o' guns an' cloth an' beads--enough to buy up the furs o' a whole tribe." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Still a-bed!' {{replied the}} boy. 'I wish <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> still a-bed. They're very noisy a-bed; all calling for their boots at once. I thought you was the Paper, and {{wondered}} why you didn't shove yourself through the grating as usual. What do you want?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's how it is," [...] {{continued}} Bounce; [...] "an' that bein' the case, savages always invariably thinks o' {{number one}} before they thinks on anythin' else. Now, as men judges theirselves <b>so</b> <b>they</b> judges of others--that's a fact, as all feelosophy has preclaimed, an' all experience has pruven. Wot then? Why, them savages 'll think I've cleared off--made tracks-- thankful to git away {{with my own}} skin whole, and carin' no more for my comrades than if <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> <b>so</b> many stumps. Thinkin' that, of coorse they'll think it's o' no use to try to cross the river and give chase, 'cause I've got a long start o' 'em, an' so, d'ye see, they'll give me up an' think no more about me. Good! very good! But p'r'aps it's jest poss'ble that feller whose paw I tickled may sometimes recall me to mind." ...|$|R

If <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> paupers, it wouldn't {{be a big}} sum for 'em to give out o' any pocket-money they might chance to git from their pauper friends, but they're well-dressed people, Dick, and they seems to be well off! Four an' fourpence a year! think o' that--not to mention the {{deduction}} w'en they goes {{for a month or}} two to the country each summer. Four an' fourpence a year, Dick! Some of 'em even goes so low as a halfpenny, which makes two an' twopence a year--7 pounds, 11 shillings, 8 pence in a seventy-year lifetime, Dick, supposin' their liberality began to flow the day <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> born!' ...|$|R

"Faix, that's true," [...] replied Jerry; [...] "there's two {{philosophers}} aboord of {{this here}} light, an' the luminous power of our united intellicks {{is so strong}} that I've had it in my mind more than wance to suggest that if <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> to hoist you and me to the masthead together, the Gull would git on first-rate without any lantern at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Them old things," [...] said he, [...] "never bust. I've been forty years, off an' on, {{in these}} parts, an' I've always obsarved that old irons o' that sort don't bust; cause why? they'd ha' busted w'en <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> new, if they'd bin goin' to bust at all. The fact is, they can't bust. They're too useless even for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{object to}} givin' dogs names on principle. It's {{too much like}} treatin' them as if <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> Christians; and, you know, they couldn't be Christians {{if they wanted to}} ever so much. Besides, wotever name you gives 'em, there must be so many other dogs with the same name, that you stand a chance o' the wrong dog comin' to 'e ven you calls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why? {{because from}} my {{earliest}} years I always {{was fond of}} animals. No matter what sort <b>they</b> <b>wos,</b> I liked 'em all--birds an' beasts an' fishes, flyers and creepers, an' squeakers and flutterers," [...] said the boy, clasping both hands over one knee, and rocking himself to and fro on the counter, while he gazed into the owl's face with the air of one whose mind is rambling far away into the remote past.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure? In coorse I is--sartin sure. Didn't he lamp two on 'em with a rope's-end once till <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> fit to bust, and all for nothin' but skylarkin'? They'll all go in {{the same}} boat with me, 'cept perhaps the cook, who is named Baldwin. He's a cross-grained critter, an'll stan' by the cap'en through thick an thin, an' so will the carpenter--Box they call him--he's dead agin us; but that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I axe your pardon, sir," [...] {{said the}} man, a little abashed by Will's grave manner; [...] "didn't know <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> friends of yours. No offence, I 'ope.

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] remarked Buzzby, as {{he stood}} with folded arms by the capstan, [...] "many and many a good ship has {{been sent to the}} bottom by that same. I've see'd a brig, with my own two eyes, {{squeezed}} together a'most flat by two big floes of ice, and after doin' it they jist separated agin an' let her go plump down to the bottom. Before she was nipped, the crew saved themselves by jumpin' on to the ice, and <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> picked up by our ship that wos in company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I dunno," [...] {{rejoined the}} farrier, [...] "it don't seem nateral for white men to quarrel {{with each other}} about the way to treat an Injin, and that Injin lyin' in ambush to shoot 'em both. And ef gov'ment would only make up its mind how to treat 'em, instead of one day pretendin' to be their 'Great Father' and treatin' them like babies, and the next makin' {{treaties}} with 'em like as <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> forriners, and the next sendin' out a handful of us to lick ten thousand of them--Wot's the use of ONE regiment--even two--agin a nation--on their own ground?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Both,' replied Sam; 'easy shavin' was his natur', and cuttin' and curlin' was {{his pride}} and glory. His whole delight wos in his trade. He spent {{all his money}} in bears, and run in debt for 'em besides, and there <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> a {{growling}} avay down in the front cellar all day long, and ineffectooally gnashing their teeth, vile the grease o' their relations and friends wos being re-tailed in gallipots in the shop above, and the first-floor winder wos ornamented vith their heads; not to speak o' the dreadful aggrawation {{it must have been}} to 'em to see a man alvays a walkin' up and down the pavement outside, vith the portrait of a bear in his last agonies, and underneath in large letters, [...] "Another fine animal wos slaughtered yesterday at Jinkinson's!"

6000|$|Mr Sloppy having shaken {{his head}} to a {{considerable}} extent, proceeded to remark that he thought Johnny 'must have took 'em from the Minders.' Being asked what he meant, he answered, them that come out upon him and partickler his chest.

Pressed to fall back upon a nominative case, he opined that <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> about as red as ever red could be. 'But as long as they strikes out'ards, sir,' continued Sloppy, 'they ain't so much. It's their striking in'ards that's to be kep off.' ...|$|R

A brig saw 'em at daylight, {{but just}} as <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> being picked up, one wos so {{exhausted}} he slipped off the wreck an wos drownded. 'Nother time," [...] continued Moy, as he paced slowly to and fro, [...] "we seed a corp float past, and tried to 'ook it with the boat-'ook, but missed it. It wos on its face, and we could see it 'ad on a belt and sheath-knife. There wos a bald spot on the 'ead, and the gulls wos peckin' at it, so we know'd it wos dead--wery likely a long time." ...|$|R
