5|$|During the battle, Oryol was {{probably}} hit by five 12-inch, two , nine , thirty-nine 6-inch shells, and 21 smaller rounds or fragments. Although {{the ship had}} many large holes in the unarmored portions of her side, she was only moderately damaged as all of the four (one 12-inch and three 6-inch) shells that hit her side armor failed to penetrate. The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret had been struck by an 8-inch <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck {{the roof of the}} rear 12-inch turret and forced it down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8-inch shells and one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire. Another turret had been damaged by a 12-inch <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> struck its supporting tube. Splinters from two 6-inch shells entered the conning tower and wounded Yung badly enough that he later died of his wounds. Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Self-decoration is {{employed}} by animals in different groups, including decorator crabs, which attach materials from their environment, {{as well as}} living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese hermit crab, Eupagurus constans, has the hydroid Hydractinia sodalis growing all over the <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> it lives in. Another hermit crab, Eupagurus cuanensis, has the aposematic orange sponge Suberites domuncula which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.|$|E
5|$|Ancona {{was quickly}} readied for combat when Italy {{declared}} {{war against the}} Austrian Empire in the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. The following month, she joined the Italian fleet at the Battle of Lissa. She was stationed in the van of the Italian fleet, which became separated {{from the rest of}} the fleet. Ancona was damaged by Austrian shellfire, including one <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> started a fire. Her career was uneventful after the war, resulting from a combination of the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was eventually sold for scrapping in 1903.|$|E

50|$|These small snails {{are quite}} distinctive, {{because they have}} <b>shells</b> <b>that</b> are sinistral, which means that if you hold the <b>shell</b> such <b>that</b> the spire is {{pointing}} up, then the aperture is on the left-hand side.|$|R
5|$|The spire is a {{protruding}} {{part of the}} <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> {{includes all}} of the whorls except the largest and final whorl (known as the body whorl). It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails, such as the closely related and larger goliath conch, Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil. In L.gigas, the glossy finish or glaze around the aperture of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink. It may show a cream, peach or yellow colouration, {{but it can also}} sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta, shading almost to red. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is thin and a pale brown or tan colour.|$|E

In a new subplot, Grimsby holds a contest inviting all the princesses in the land for a singing competition for Eric to choose his bride; Ariel cannot sing, but she dances for Eric, and he chooses her. Ariel also has {{a more active role in}} the final battle, where she is the one who defeats Ursula by destroying her Nautilus <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> contains her power.|$|E
5|$|Thulium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tm and atomic number 69. It is the thirteenth and third-last {{element in the}} lanthanide series. Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the nearly full 4f <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> results. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|During {{this second}} tour, Schwarzkopf noted two {{incidents}} which haunted him. On February 17, 1970, {{two men in}} C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> had been ordered by Schwarzkopf, but which had struck a tree near their position {{on its way to}} a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim which Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back out of the field, one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing he would set off another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar <b>Shell)</b> <b>that</b> was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E
5|$|On 4 December 1915, Gellibrand {{received}} a promotion to lieutenant colonel, {{and was given}} command of the 12th Infantry Battalion, the 1st Division's Tasmanian battalion, then resting on Lemnos. It {{did not return to}} Anzac, which was evacuated on 20 December 1915. Instead, the battalion returned to Egypt, arriving at Alexandria on 6 January 1916. Gellibrand would not lead it into battle. On 1 March 1916 he was again promoted, this time to full colonel and temporary brigadier general, and given command of the 6th Infantry Brigade, on the specific request of Legge. Apparently Gellibrand had greatly impressed Legge during his time as AA & QMG of the 2nd Division. The 6th Infantry Brigade sailed for the Western Front just a few days later, on 19 March 1916, and entered the line there on 10 April. On 31 May, Gellibrand was wounded by a German <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> had landed close to his headquarters and was evacuated to England, returning on 28 June. The brigade fought at Pozières, where it performed well in the attack on 4 August. He was mentioned in despatches once more.|$|E

5|$|Sodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolNa (from Latin natrium) and atomic number11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, {{because it has}} a single electron in its outer <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion—the Na+ cation. Its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Tilbury {{continued}} {{to function as}} a mobilisation store and, after the outbreak of the First World War, it was used to house up to 300 transit soldiers and to supply the new army camps established at Purfleet and Belhus Mansion. It was initially manned by the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers until 1916, and by various reserve units {{for the rest of the}} war. The fort itself was used to store munitions while a depot for remounts was built just to the west; a pontoon bridge was built across the Thames for troop movements, guarded by the fort's guns. Until 1917, also used to house the headquarters of several infantry battalions. Electric lighting was installed, and a narrow-gauge railway and a steam crane on the quay were added to help to move material in and out of the fort. After the Zeppelin raids of June 1915, anti-aircraft guns and searchlights mounted at the fort and they played a role in the shooting down of the German Navy Zeppelin, L15, although it is disputed as to which site in the area fired the <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> brought down the airship.|$|E
5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein <b>shell</b> <b>that</b> surrounds and encloses various enzymes. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments, present in magnetotactic bacteria, that contain magnetic crystals.|$|E
