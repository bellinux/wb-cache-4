This has {{included the following}} species, each of which represents the sole British record: Ancient murrelet, eastern phoebe and eastern towhee. Records of bimaculated lark, American robin and common yellowthroat were also firsts for Britain (American robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> records, a Rüppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced bunting in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the track}} dried up despite a light rain shower before the second {{practice}} session and drivers recorded more lap times {{to make up for}} the lack of running in the first session. Some drivers also went off the circuit. Alonso set the fastest lap of the day with a time of 1:16.265; Massa finished with the third-fastest time. The two Red Bull drivers were <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> (with Vettel ahead of Webber). All of the top four quickest drivers set their fastest lap times on the super-soft dry compound tyre. Rosberg was fifth-fastest (despite damaging his front wing after he collided with a kerb bollard), ahead of his Mercedes teammate Michael Schumacher in sixth. Hamilton, Kubica, Barrichello and Hülkenberg followed in the top ten. A heavy rain shower hit the circuit on Saturday morning which stopped before the final practice session started. Drivers were initially forced to use intermediate tyres before switching later to dry-weather conditions and the teams worked on car set-up for qualifying. Vettel set the fastest lap, a 1:15.503; Webber finished with the third-fastest time. They were separated by the Ferrari drivers in <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> (with Alonso ahead of Massa). Rosberg duplicated his second-session result in fifth, with Hamilton in sixth. Schumacher, Barrichello, Kubica and Hülkenberg completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Sutil was unable to record a lap time when his Force India's driveshaft broke though he managed to return to his garage and lost 45 minutes of running.|$|E

5|$|The West Indies' {{inconsistent}} performances {{saw them}} dominate one Test, only to play poorly and lose the next.

Cork contributed greatly to England’s <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> Test victories, taking 7/43 in the second Test and a hat-trick in the fourth in claiming the wickets of Richardson (bowled), Junior Murray (LBW) and Carl Hooper (LBW). The remaining two Tests were dominated by the batsmen, with five centuries being scored. The series finished 2–2, with the West Indies retaining the trophy.|$|E

Lettering and numerals for both Caledonian blue and crimson lake liveries were in a newly created style of unshaded sans-serif.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurids walked {{exclusively}} on their hindlimbs, so their leg bones were massive. In {{contrast to the}} forelimbs, the hindlimbs were longer compared to body size {{than almost any other}} theropods. Juveniles and even some smaller adults, like more basal tyrannosauroids, had longer tibiae than femora, a characteristic of fast-running dinosaurs like ornithomimids. Larger adults had leg proportions characteristic of slower-moving animals, but not to the extent seen in other large theropods like abelisaurids or carnosaurs. The third metatarsals of tyrannosaurids were pinched between the <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> metatarsals, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus.|$|E

5|$|Illingworth took 4/92 in South Australia's first innings but was no-balled a {{total of}} three times by Egar and Ryan. Illingworth was called on each of the {{occasions}} by the umpire standing at square leg. He was called twice by Egar on the <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> deliveries of his eleventh over, and once by Ryan on the sixth ball of his fourteenth over. In the same fourteenth over, Illingworth had dismissed former Pakistani Test batsman Duncan Sharpe and Australian Test wicket-keeper Barry Jarman from the first and fourth deliveries respectively. This broke a 97-run stand between Sharpe and Ian Chappell, before Jarman was removed for a duck. After 17 more runs were added, Illingworth had Chappell caught behind for 127. South Australia eventually finished at 392.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, Angel {{escaped from}} a beachside hotel before its {{demolition}} {{in front of}} a crowd of about 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the window of the room in order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> floors of the building.|$|E
