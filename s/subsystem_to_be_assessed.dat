40|$|As {{the launch}} of LISA Pathfinder (LPF) draws near, more and more effort is being put in to the {{preparation}} of the data analysis activities that will be carried out during the mission operations. The operations phase of the mission will be composed of a series of experiments that will be carried out on the satellite. These experiments will be directed and analysed by the data analysis team, {{which is part of the}} operations team. The operations phase will last about 90 days, during which time the data analysis team aims to fully characterize the LPF, and in particular, its core instrument the LISA Technology Package. By analysing the various couplings present in the system, the different noise sources that will disturb the system, and through the identification of the key physical parameters of the system, a detailed noise budget of the instrument will be constructed that will allow the performance of the different <b>subsystems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> and projected towards LISA. This paper describes the various aspects of the full data analysis chain that <b>are</b> needed <b>to</b> successfully characterize the LPF and build up the noise budget during mission operations. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Current {{military}} {{communication network}} is a gen-eration old {{and is no}} longer effective in meeting the emerging requirements imposed by the next generation military embedded applications. A new communication network based upon Full Duplex Switched Ethernet is proposed in this paper to overcome these limitations. To allow existing military <b>subsystems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easily supported by a Switched Ethernet network, our proposal consists in keeping their current centralized communication scheme by using an optimized master/slave transmission control on Switched Ethernet thanks to the Flexible Time Triggered (FTT) paradigm. Our main objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the performance of such a proposal and estimate the quality of service we can expect in terms of latency.
