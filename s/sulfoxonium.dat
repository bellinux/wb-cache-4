500|$|Use of a <b>sulfoxonium</b> allows more facile {{preparation}} of the reagent using weaker bases as compared to sulfonium ylides. (The difference being that a <b>sulfoxonium</b> contains a doubly bonded oxygen whereas the sulfonium does not.) [...] The former react slower due to their increased stability. In addition, the dialkylsulfoxide by-products of <b>sulfoxonium</b> reagents are greatly preferred to the significantly more toxic, volatile, and odorous dialkylsulfide by-products from sulfonium reagents.|$|E

40|$|The {{functionalization}} of carbon-hydrogen {{bonds in}} non-nucleophilic substrates using α-carbonyl <b>sulfoxonium</b> ylides {{has not been}} so far investigated, despite the potential safety advantages that those reagents would provide over diazo compounds or their in situ precursors. We describe the cross-coupling reactions of <b>sulfoxonium</b> ylides with C(sp 2) -H bond of arenes and heteroarenes {{in the presence of}} a rhodium catalyst. The reaction proceeds by a succession of C-H activation, migratory insertion of the ylide into the carbon-metal bond and protonation, the last step being turnover-limiting. The method is applied to the synthesis of benz[c]acridines when allied to an iridium-catalyzed dehydrative cyclization...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part enantiomerically pure acyclic and cyclic allylic sulfoximines were {{transformed}} to the corresponding alpha-titanated compounds and reacted with N-tert-butylsulfonyl a-imino ethyl ester to give acyclic and monocyclic protected alpha-amino acid esters in yields of 32 - 97 %. In all cases the alpha-amino acid esters were formed in a highly regio and diastereoselective fashion (>= 98 % de). The amino alkylation of cyclic allylic sulfoximines with N-tert-butylsulfonyl alpha-imino ethyl ester provided mixtures of E and Z-konfigured monocyclic alpha-amino acid derivatives. Both diastereomers were formed highly diastereoselective (>= 98 % de). The stereoselective formation of the products could be explained assuming a six-membered transition state model. The four step synthesis of N-tert-butylsulfonyl alpha-imino ethyl ester was optimized so that the overall yield could be raised from 20 % to 63 %. The E and Z-konfigured monocyclic alpha-amino acid derivatives were treated with Me 3 OBF 4 to give the corresponding 1 -alkenyl dimethylamino <b>sulfoxonium</b> salts in excellent yields of 93 - 96 %. The obtained 1 -alkenyl dimethylamino <b>sulfoxonium</b> salts were transformed via intramolecular nucleophilic substitution with either DBU or lithium-tert-butyl amide in good yields of 76 - 81 % to D 3 a, 4 -unsaturated bicyclic proline analogues. The cyclization reaction starts with a base induced isomerization of the 1 -alkenyl dimethylamino <b>sulfoxonium</b> salts to the novel 2 -alkenyl dimethylamino <b>sulfoxonium</b> salts. Then the nucleophilic substitution occurs under formation of the unsaturated bicyclic proline derivatives and N,N-dimethylphenylsulfinamide of >= 99 % ee. The obtained yields were {{in a range of}} 74 - 76 %. Finally, cleavage of the protecting group with anhydrous triflic acid furnished the fused bicyclic proline analogue containing an unsaturated six-membered ring in a high yield of 83 %. In the second part the attempt to prepare an axial chiral vinylic sulfoximine on Merrifield resin failed because in all steps the conversion of the starting material was not complete. Therefore a mixture of at least four different compounds remained on solid support after three steps and it was impossible to calculate the equivalents of reagents used in the next transformation accurately. At this point the project was stopped. In a second approach (+) -(aS,SS) -(S-(4 -tert-butyl-cyclohexylidene methane) -(N-(2 -hydroxy ethyl) -S-phenyl sulfoximine was synthesized in solution in 47 % and >= 98 % de. The plan was to heterogenize this compound in enantiomerically pure form on a silyl chloride resin. Four different approaches were tried to fix the compound to solid support but in all cases the loading was only 21 - 25 %. In a control experiment a literature known compound was heterogenized successfully. Because of the low loadings also this project was cancelled...|$|E
40|$|The mansucript is {{an update}} {{to the earlier}} Science of Synthesis {{contribution}} describing methods for the in situ generation of thiocarbonyl ylides and Corey-Chaykovski reagents (sulfonium and <b>sulfoxonium</b> methanides). Whereas thiocarbonyl ylides react as electron rich 1, 3 -dipoles, Corey-Chaykovski reagents act as methylidene transferring agents. The most relevant application of thiocarbonyl ylides relates to the synthesis of tetrahydrothiophene (thiolane) and 1, 3 -dithiolane derivatives via [3 + 2] cycloadditions with electron deficient C,C and C=S dipolarophiles, respectively. In the recent decade, Corey-Chaykovsky reagents were widely applied for cyclopropanation, epoxidation, aziridination {{as well as for}} diverse heterocyclization reactions. In all cases, asymmetric versions of the applied protocols is of great interest...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} new results {{obtained}} in our investigations of Rh-catalyzed C 1 (co) polymerization reactions using carbene units as monomers. We demonstrate here, {{for the first}} time, the use of transition metal catalysts in carbene polymerization using sulfur ylides as the carbene monomer precursors. Furthermore, we show {{that it is possible}} to generate unique diblock copolymers from <b>sulfoxonium</b> ylides and diazoesters as the respective carbene monomer precursors. This constitutes an entirely new approach to the synthesis of functional copolymers. The copolymerization reactions were successful, and high-Mw poly(methylene) -poly(ester carbene) copolymers were obtained with a diblock-syndiotactic microstructure in decent yields. These copolymers can be used as blending agents to mix polyethylene or polymethylene with poly(ethyl 2 -ylidene-acetate). The copolymer properties are highly dependent on the functional-group content. Model studies and investigations on the influence of the catalyst structure on the obtained polymer yields provide insights into the catalyst activation and deactivation processes operative under the applied reaction conditions...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} includes five {{research projects}} on the polyhomologation reaction for synthesis of carbon backbone polymers. In chapter 1, an overview is provided on the polyhomologation reaction. The reaction builds linear sp 3 carbon chains one carbon {{at a time}} using an organoborane catalyst. The traditional method is a living polymerization using <b>sulfoxonium</b> ylides under anhydrous conditions. The newly developed aqueous method is a polymerization of <b>sulfoxonium</b> salts in an aqueous base. Chapter 2 develops the synthesis of telechelic polymers including ω-hydroxyacid esters, α,ω-diols and α,ω-diacids using the aqueous polyhomologation reaction with control of chain length and PDI. These polymers were used as macromonomers to produce long-chain aliphatic polyesters. The obtained polyesters have thermal and mechanical properties indistinguishable compared to related materials derived from biomass. Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of a gradient ersatz ethylene–propylene copolymer using the traditional polyhomologation reaction. A new and convenient source of the ethylide monomer was developed for the introduction of methyl branch on the polymer backbone. The gradient copolymer contains a gradual change of methyl branch content along the polymer chain. Chapter 4 focuses on the precise monomer insertion on a carbon chain using a sulfonium benzylide. The polymerization and validation protocols were established to demonstrate the precise insertion. A thermally more stable benzylide needs to be developed to complete this study. In chapter 5, three 9 -borafluorene derivatives are designed and evaluated {{in search of a}} single-site catalyst for the polyhomologation reaction. The catalyst is being developed for the synthesis of the yet unknown polyethylidene. Computational studies indicated a preferred 1, 2 -migration of the sp 3 over sp 2 carbon when an electron-withdrawing group is installed on the aromatic rings at the ortho position to boron. Experimental studies revealed the presence of competing sp 2 carbon migration due to the required high reaction temperature from the high activation energy of 1, 2 -migration. A side reaction produced ethylidene–methylidene copolymers rather than polyethylidene due to the competing decomposition of ethylide. In chapter 6, an air-stable borane initiator was provided for convenient use in the polyhomologation reaction. Polymer molecular weight and polydispersity are well controlled using the amine–borane complex...|$|E
