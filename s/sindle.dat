The hulls were readily available, had low maintenance costs, and were capable of planing under the right conditions. The design worked exceptionally well, and Siddons, {{with the help of}} Harry <b>Sindle,</b> {{created the first}} of the Jet 14 boats.|$|E
5000|$|Located at 117 Main Street in Lincoln Park, the Terhune Benjamin House is a Federal Period {{house with}} a Dutch gambrel roof which predates the American Revolutionary War. Records from the Preakness Reformed Church show that the home passed in {{ownership}} from owner Albert Terhune to the Morris Canal Company sometime after 1820. [...] In 1829, the Morris Canal Company constructed inclined planes at Bloomfield, Pompton, Montville, and Booneton. By 1845, the Morris Canal Company had sold the home and adjacent lands to David Benjamin. Benjamin operated a sawmill at the site, using the 56-foot fall of water at the adjacent Morris Canal incline plane 10 East. Prior to 1901, Thomas <b>Sindle</b> and George Francisco purchased the home.|$|E

[...] Its isolated nature, being set away from populated places and major roads, has led to several cases of suicides at the monument, most recently in 2009. [...] Occult acts are known to take place on occasion there. The monument is also popular with paranormal investigators visiting to investigate reported paranormal activity at the site. Witnesses claim to have seen bricks thrown from above, heard ghostly shouts, and intrigue surrounds the myth that the folly {{may have been used}} by smugglers.|$|R

50|$|In {{the past}} Mokroluh was an agrarian village; its {{inhabitants}} worked the land, raised cattle and produced shingles (<b>sindle),</b> spinning wheels (kolovratky), and wooden tools. The 1355 report mentions a village mill, confirming {{that the population}} grew cereals. In the 1330’ the first church was built in Mokroluh and {{it has its own}} pastor. At the end of the 16th century, Mokroluh was a medium-sized village with a vassal population only. The village was caught in a great fire in 1723; however shortly after the fire there were already 52 new homes built. Village artisans soon included blacksmiths and wheel makers. In the middle of the village on a relatively busy road, there was built a blacksmith and carriage workshop. It was a large building used for changing, resting and treating of the horses pulling carriages. The carriage workshop became popular among riders (rurman) because it was also an inn. A replica of Mokroluh's carriage workshop today stands in the open-air museum in Svidnik.|$|E
