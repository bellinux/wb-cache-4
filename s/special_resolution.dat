25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007, which resulted from insufficient consumer financial {{protection in the}} US, conflicts {{of interest in the}} credit rating agency industry, and defective transparency requirements in derivatives markets, triggered a massive rise in corporate insolvencies. Contemporary debate, particularly in the banking sector, has shifted to prevention of insolvencies, by scrutinising excessive pay, conflicts of interest among financial services institutions, capital adequacy, and the causes of excessive risk taking. The Banking Act 2009 created a special insolvency regime for banks, called the <b>special</b> <b>resolution</b> regime, envisaging that banks will be taken over by the government in extreme circumstances.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main reason}} to control directors’ power over share allottments and issues {{is to prevent}} shareholders’ rights being watered down if new shares are created. Under CA 2006 section 561, {{existing}} shareholders have a basic pre-emption right, to be offered any new shares first in proportion to their existing holding. Shareholders have 14 days {{to decide whether to}} buy. There are a series of exceptions under CA 2006 sections 564-567, for issuing bonus shares, partly paid shares, and employee shares, while private companies can opt out of pre-emption rules altogether. Furthermore, by <b>special</b> <b>resolution</b> (a three-quarter majority vote) under CA 2006 sections 570-571, shareholders may disapply pre-emption rights. In practice, large companies frequently give directors ad hoc authority to disapply pre-emption rights, but within the scope of a ‘Statement of Principles’ issued by asset managers. At present, the most influential guide is the document by the Institutional investors’ Pre-emption Group, Disapplying Pre-emption Rights: A Statement of Principle (...) [...] This suggests that the general practice is to disapply the pre-emption rights on a rolling basis for routine share issues (e.g. shares subject to a clawback) at no more than 5% of share capital each year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary goal}} [...] of Thiers in 1873 was {{to pay off}} the debt to Germany, to {{liberate}} the last French territory occupied by the Germans.

He made agreements with the major fifty-five banks of Eurooe, and issued bonds which, based on the good credit of France, brought in more than the amount required. Thiers signed a new convention with Germany on 15 March 1873, calling for the Germans to leave [...] the last four French departments they held, Ardennes, Vosges, Meurthe-sur Moselle and Meuse by July 1873, two years ahead of schedule. Germany retained only the fortress of Verdun, and the territory of a radius of three kilometers around it. The National Assembly voted a <b>special</b> <b>resolution</b> to thank Thiers for liberating French territory ahead of schedule. The right wing deputies [...] abstained, but it passed with the full support of the republicans. After the resolution passed, Thiers was congratulated by his longtime friend and ally, Jules Simon: [...] "Now you just have to name a successor." [...] Thiers responded, [...] "but there's no one!"
