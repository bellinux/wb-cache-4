This angered Starkad {{so much that}} he enlisted at the Swedish king Halfdan's (Haldanus) court instead. However, when he learnt that Helga, Ingild's sister, was about to marry a lowly goldsmith, Starkad {{appeared}} in disguise and castrated the goldsmith. He gave Helga a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> her face and lambasted her. Then he returned to Sweden and king Halfdan.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 UEFA Champions League Final was {{the first}} all English club final in European Cup/Champions League history, and was played out between Manchester United and Chelsea {{in front of a}} packed-out Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. United took the lead midway through the first half when Cristiano Ronaldo's header met Wes Brown's cross and bounced into the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of Petr Čech's goal. Poor defending, however, enabled Frank Lampard to equalise in the last minute of the first half. Although both sides created chances, the scoreline remained 1–1 until the end of extra time, and penalties loomed. Didier Drogba became the second player to be sent off in a European Cup/Champions League final in the second period of extra time for a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> Nemanja Vidić. Extra time finished and a penalty shoot-out was to decide it. Both teams scored their first two penalties, but Cristiano Ronaldo's shot was saved by Petr Čech. For Chelsea's last penalty, however, captain John Terry slipped as he was taking the shot, and the ball hit the outside of the post and flew helplessly wide. In the second round of sudden death, Ryan Giggs successfully converted his penalty before Edwin van der Sar won the Champions' League for United by saving Nicolas Anelka's effort.|$|E
25|$|United had {{the run of}} {{the play}} {{in the first half of}} the final, {{dominating}} Chelsea in terms of possession, and took the lead in the 26th minute through a Cristiano Ronaldo header off a Wes Brown cross. However, in the last minute of the first half, a ball into the United box was deflected to Frank Lampard, who capitalised on a slip by Van der Sar to equalise for the Londoners. The second half was much more even, but no further goals were scored and the match went to extra time. Midway through the second half of extra time, a large incident involving Carlos Tevez and John Terry kicked off. In the ensuing melée, the referee spotted a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> Nemanja Vidić by Didier Drogba, and had no hesitation in sending the Ivorian international off. Despite the man advantage, United were unable to find a winner and the match went to penalties. Both teams converted their first two penalties, but then the most unlikely of players missed his – Cristiano Ronaldo, who stepped up with his usual self-confidence, could only stare on as Petr Čech saved his shot. Just when the match looked lost, John Terry stepped up for the Blues, only for his standing foot to give way as he struck his shot and the ball hit the post. This took the match to sudden death penalties, though only two further rounds were required. Ryan Giggs scored United's seventh penalty, meaning that Nicolas Anelka had to score in order to keep Chelsea in the game. His shot, however, was poorly struck, and at the perfect height for United's Dutch goalkeeper to save, granting United their third European Cup title.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers gave Begin Again {{three out}} of four stars, praising the [...] "subtle magic" [...] of the lead actors' {{performances}} and Carney's creation of [...] "surreal, enchanting loveliness" [...] without being overly sentimental. Ian Freer of Empire awarded the film four out of five stars, describing it as [...] "lovely stuff, winningly played, open-hearted and guaranteed to <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> a smile on a balmy summer night." [...] In a review for Variety, Peter Debruge wrote that [...] "Gregg Alexander's music is undeniably the best thing" [...] about the film, which [...] "lays emotions on the line and then drives them home with music." [...] The Hollywood Reporters David Rooney praised the [...] "disarming emotional candor and intimacy" [...] of Carney's script and the chemistry between Knightley and Ruffalo, while David Edelstein of New York enjoyed Ruffalo's [...] "very funny" [...] performance and Knightley's [...] "surprisingly sweet singing voice".|$|E
500|$|Setting {{the opera}} in Japan, an exotic locale {{far away from}} Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British {{politics}} and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, [...] "The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> an existing institution." [...] G. K. Chesterton compared it to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels: [...] "Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... I doubt {{if there is a}} single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth." [...] Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales, including The Gondoliers, Utopia Limited, and The Grand Duke.|$|E

500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you have the good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> the face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E

Police officers are most often suspected of traffic related crimes (endangering road safety, vehicular collisions etc.) which constitute approximately 50% of all cases. These types of cases were also the most likely to be dismissed before proceeding to the prosecutor for consideration.

2500|$|The opera {{is named}} after the Emperor of Japan using the term mikado (御門 or 帝 or みかど), {{literally}} meaning [...] "the honourable gate" [...] of the imperial palace, referring metaphorically to its occupant and to the palace itself. [...] The term was commonly used by the English in the 19th century but became obsolete. To {{the extent that the}} opera portrays Japanese culture, style and government, it is a fictional version of Japan used to provide a picturesque setting and to capitalise on Japonism and the British fascination with Japan and the Far East in the 1880s. Gilbert wrote, [...] "The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> an existing institution."

[...] Although Isherwood praised most of the cast, he noted that the musical [...] "does have a few dead spots in its brisk 90-minute running time....
