5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles <b>snapped</b> <b>his</b> fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season with the Grizzlies, Gasol became the first foreign player to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, and {{was named to the}} NBA All-Rookie First Team. He {{averaged}} 17.6points and 8.9rebounds per game, and was also the only team member to play in all 82 games that season. Gasol led the team in scoring (19.0 points per game) in his second year with the Grizzlies, and {{for the second year in}} a row, played in all 82 games. Gasol missed the first game of his career, during his third year, with a foot injury on April 5, 2004, which <b>snapped</b> <b>his</b> string of 240consecutive games played. He grabbed the 1,500threbound of his career on November 12, 2003, against the Orlando Magic and scored his 3,000thcareer point on October 31, 2003, against the Boston Celtics. Despite having 22 points in Game 4 against the San Antonio Spurs, the highest by a Memphis players in the playoffs, his team was eliminated in the first round, not winning a single game against San Antonio. This was both the Grizzlies and Gasol's first trip to the NBA Playoffs. He scored 31points and blocked four shots on January 11, 2005, against the Indiana Pacers to earn 5,000points and 500blocks in his career, becoming the 10th fastest player to reach 5,000 points/500 blocks since 1973–74. He also helped his team make it to the playoffs for the second time in his career, but they were eliminated in the first round and did not win a single game against the Phoenix Suns.|$|E
5|$|On November 14 VanVleet tallied 7 steals in {{the opener}} against New Mexico State, which tied a school record. On December 3, against #25 Utah VanVleet, helped Wichita State recover from a 9-point deficit in the final 2:45 of {{regulation}} with 8 points (including two three-point shots in the final 1:15) and an assist on a three-point shot, but with 7 seconds remaining in overtime and Wichita trailing by one, he missed {{the front end of}} a one and one. In his return visit to Chicago and the Gentile Center to play Loyola on January 11, he again was perfect from the field with a 5-for-5 performance and added a career-high tying 10 assists (as well as 6 rebounds and 3 steals) for his first career double-double. VanVleet, however, <b>snapped</b> <b>his</b> perfect streak of 20 free throws made in his home state with a 3-for-4 performance. In the rematch against Loyola on January 28, VanVleet posted a career-high 27 points. On February 7, VanVleet posted the first triple double for Wichita State Shockers men's basketball in 43 years with a 10-point 10-rebound 11-assist 4-steal performance against Missouri State. On February 16, VanVleet was Missouri Valley Conference Co-Player of the Week (with Seth Tuttle). On February 26, VanVleet broke the all-time Wichita State career assist record against Evansville with 431 assists, surpassing Warren Armstrong who had 429 and Toure Murry who had 430. VanVleet was one of 17 finalists for the Cousy Award. The Shockers defeated Northern Iowa on February 28 to win the Missouri Valley Conference regular season title. In the opening game of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament for the Shockers, VanVleet matched a career high with 27 points against Indiana. He finished the tournament with 17-point and 25-point performances against #2-seeded Kansas and #3-seeded Notre Dame, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{starting}} pitchers for Game 2 were Rich Hill for the Dodgers and Justin Verlander for the Astros.

25|$|Redpath {{retired from}} Test cricket {{in order to}} devote himself {{full-time}} to proprietorship of an antique business in Geelong. He had already declined the 1975 Ashes tour to tend to this neglected enterprise. However his absence from top cricket was brief. After a season out of the game, he signed for World Series Cricket, lured by a personal visit to Geelong by Kerry Packer’s lieutenant Austin Robertson, and despite Packer’s initial reluctance to contract the Victorian. As with many of his colleagues, the personal costs of supporting the rebel entrepreneur were significant; {{after two decades of}} service to the South Melbourne Cricket Club, Redpath was made persona non grata. In an early world series match at VFL Park Waverley in 1977–78, Redpath <b>snapped</b> <b>his</b> Achilles tendon, an injury that ruled him out for the season. Packer declared that Redpath would be paid for the duration. The Victorian repaid the loyalty by returning again for 1978–79, playing mainly in World Series country cup games. He was recalled for international duties once more, playing two supertests at the age of 37. At Sydney, against the by then fearsome West Indies XI attack, he took blow after blow on the body, holding out for 143 minutes to make 9, and adding 71 critical runs with David Hookes which contributed to an improbable 10 wicket victory for the Australian XI.|$|E

This was only Jansen's second blown save all season and <b>snapped</b> <b>his</b> streak of converting his first 12 post-season save opportunities, a major league record. The game went into extra innings. José Altuve and Correa hit home runs off Josh Fields in the 10th inning to put the Astros in the lead.

In the bottom of the 11th inning, Charlie Culberson hit a home run off of Chris Devenski, but Devenski struck out Puig to end the game. The teams set a new record for combined home runs in a single World Series game with eight.

25|$|While {{searching for}} {{the energy of the}} Black Lantern- {{simultaneously}} sending various Doomsday 'clones' created from the original after {{the other members of the}} Superman family to distract them, and advised by a robotic duplicate of Lois Lane- Luthor encountered Brainiac in space while attempting to alter the last of the Black Lantern energy, acting upon an unspoken theory of his. Brainiac revealed that Loisbot was an unwilling pawn in his bid to hijack Luthor's quest. Luthor then replied that he had anticipated this for some time, and he then attacked Brainiac and <b>snapped</b> <b>his</b> neck, temporarily incapacitating him. Loisbot pleaded for Lex's forgiveness, and he accepted her apology. However, after he altered the four remaining black spheres, he opened a Phantom Zone portal which unleashed an extremely powerful, monstrously large being which prepared to kill all life in the universe, because the negative emotions of sentient creatures hurt it. Luthor promptly impaled Loisbot's head, allowing himself to be infected with Krypontian technology which he used to engage the monster on a mental plane of existence. Grappling with the creature, Luthor's body and mental essence suddenly fused with it, learning that it evolved in the Phantom Zone and now seeks to escape from the grief and anger of the Zone prisoners. Using his new power, Luthor draws Superman to him, attempting to drive Superman mad by forcing him to experience the human emotions that he believes the alien merely fakes to blend in. However, Luthor is outraged when he learns that not only is Superman's mission genuine, but his defining moment of tragedy is the loss of his father. Luthor is unable to cope with the fact that not only was his greatest enemy raised by humans, but he also had a father he would actually mourn, compared to the anguish Luthor endured in his own relationship with his father. As Luthor becomes one with the creature, Superman and Mr. Mind who has been aiding Luthor's search realise that the creature allows Luthor to create a feeling of peace and bliss throughout the entire universe, at the cost of never allowing him to cause any harm to another being at the same time. Superman attempts to appeal to Luthor about the potential of doing something even he never accomplished, but Luthor is unable to let go of his hate for Superman, costing him control of the entity as well as his memory of everything he learned or did while he was merged with it and it departs for another part of the universe. Luthor is ultimately defeated when he falls into one of the Phantom Zone holes created by the creature for the remainder of the timeline.|$|E
500|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Craig Steadman 10–3 in {{the first}} round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a surprise 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in his socks, before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. In his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost <b>snapped</b> <b>his</b> cue in half by hitting it against the table. In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee should have called a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. [...] "Personally I think it is a sign he has got other things on his mind," [...] said Hendry. [...] "He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship." ...|$|E

500|$|With Rivera's {{contract}} set {{to expire}} after 2001, the Yankees signed {{him to a}} four-year, $39.99million deal prior to the season, marking the first long-term contract of his career. In 2001, he was selected for the All-Star team for a third consecutive year. His final numbers included a 2.34ERA, a closer career-high innings pitched, and an MLB-leading 50saves in 57opportunities—his second time leading the league. His saves total that year surpassed Dave Righetti's 46 saves in 1986 for the most by a Yankee pitcher in a single season, and made him just the sixth MLB pitcher to reach 50saves in a single season. Rivera's performance earned him his second AL Rolaids Relief Man Award. Despite having what sportswriters deemed an [...] "aura of invincibility" [...] in the postseason, Rivera failed to close out the decisive Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In {{one of his most}} infamous moments, he blew a save {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, in part due to his own throwing error, and he lost the Series later in the inning by allowing Luis Gonzalez's bloop single with the bases loaded to score the winning run.

500|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Haber was loaned {{out for a}} third time, joining Scottish Premier League side St Johnstone on a season-long loan. On signing Haber for the season, St Johnstone manager Derek McInnes stated — [...] "West Brom {{have high}} hopes for him but having stepped up a level into the Premiership {{they wanted him to}} go out on loan rather than be kicking his heels at The Hawthorns. He is young, hungry, has real pace and he's keen to learn". A day later, he played in Alan Main's {{testimonial}} match, against a Manchester United XI. Haber made his competitive debut for the club in a 1–1 draw against Hearts on August 14, 2010, playing the opening 72 minutes of the match. He scored his first goal for the club five weeks later, on September 21, as he ran onto Alan Maybury's pass to finish neatly as St Johnstone beat Queen of the South 3–0 in the Scottish League Cup. He quickly doubled his goal tally when he scored in the club's 2–0 home league victory over Hibernian on October 2, 2010, coming on as a late second-half substitute and doubling St Johnstone's advantage in injury-time. After making 14 appearances, and scoring twice, during {{the first three months of}} the season, Haber <b>snapped</b> <b>his</b> anterior cruciate ligament in a 3–0 home defeat to Kilmarnock on November 6, 2010, turning [...] "awkwardly on the slick McDiarmid Park surface" [...] in [...] "an innocuous incident".

He {{was seen as a}} caretaker captain, but made the job his own and kept it even after the old captain had recovered. He started well, with Snow taking 4/54 when the West Indies crashed to 147 all out at Old Trafford and lost by an innings. At Lord's the West Indies chose to bat and reached 324/5 before Snow took 5/114 to get them out for 380. Illingworth saved the English innings with a century to cement his place as captain and the Test ended in a thrilling draw with England needing 37 runs with 3 wickets in hand. It was here that Snow [...] "penned in verse my feelings and impressions about {{what it is like to}} play at the headquarters of world cricket" [...] in his poem Lord's Test. In the Third Test at Headingley there was a problem when Illingworth asked Snow to [...] "give me everything you've got" [...] when the West Indians were 240/7 needing 303 to win, but Snow found the pitch lifeless, changed to medium-paced seamers, failed to take a wicket and Illingworth was not best pleased. England still won the Test by 30 runs and the series 2–0 and Snow was the chief wicket-taker with 15 (27.06) It the last time England would beat the West Indies for 31 years.|$|E
