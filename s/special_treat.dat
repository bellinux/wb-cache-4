500|$|Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it was {{favorable}} of {{the early}} pairing of Tucker and Ashley, giving them an [...] "honorable mention" [...] {{on a list of}} [...] "curiously quirky couplings". Candace Young of the website She Knows Soaps wrote that, [...] "Ashley and Tucker have been interesting as a power couple, if you will, in business and the corporate world." [...] In January 2011, Garrett awarded Nichols a [...] "Leading Men Gold Standard" [...] and praised his portrayal that week, writing: [...] "Stephen Nichols as Tucker was all over the place this week. Initially Tucker decided to back the recording label of Devon Winters and Noah Newman. Nichols played a man who wanted to help two young men break into the music industry. However, the shocking news that Cane and Sofia have been lying to Tucker and allowing a conman to swindle Tucker’s company was destined to be revealed. Although the climax came {{at the end of the}} week, the intensity in which Stephen Nichols played the revelation was exciting to say the least. Fans know that next week Tucker McCall’s going to cause heads to roll." [...] Jae Jones of Yahoo! praised the storyline revealing Tucker as Devon's father as it gave the soap opera's matriarch, Katherine, a biracial grandson. She wrote: [...] "What seems to make the story line even more interesting is the fact that she has a biracial grandson. Who would have ever thought the show could catch up with the current times? There are not too many daytime soaps left for housewives and house husbands to enjoy, but those who watch this show are always in for a <b>special</b> <b>treat</b> each afternoon." [...] They later named the storyline the [...] "best reveal" [...] of 2011.|$|E

2500|$|George {{was named}} after his mother's elder brother, King George I of Greece. As an infant, he was {{stronger}} and healthier than his brother Nicholas. He {{could be described as}} a typical Romanov. George was tall, unlike his elder brother Nicholas, handsome and full of fun. He was always getting into mischief and, because his mother had a great weakness for him, getting away with it. Like his siblings, he was brought up in a spartan fashion in the English manner. They slept on camp beds, rose at six and took a cold bath, although occasionally they were allowed to take a warm bath in their mother's bathroom. Breakfast was usually porridge and black bread; mutton cutlets or roast beef with peas and baked potatoes were served for lunch; bread, butter and jam at tea-time. Cake was a <b>special</b> <b>treat.</b> Nicholas and George had a sitting-room, dining-room, play-room and bedroom, all simply furnished. The only trace of ostentation was an icon surrounded by pearls and precious stones. George's mother taught him that family life was important. Because of his parents' happy marriage, he was brought up in an atmosphere of love and security missing in many royal households. On 27 May 1883, George's parents were crowned in a magnificent ceremony in the Uspensky Cathedral in the Kremlin in Moscow. The Emperor and Empress received the homage of the Imperial Family, including their sons, Nicholas and George, both in uniform. It was a major occasion {{in the life of the}} young Grand Duke. The family lived mostly in the security of the palace at Gatchina.|$|E

6000|$|The girls {{kept their}} word. Thereafter, nearly every Saturday {{of the summer}} found them taking tea with Miss Sally at Golden Gate.

6000|$|The Professor {{was very}} old, {{but he was}} well preserved--always spoken of as [...] "hale and hearty." [...] He still held his {{position}} in his college, and still took a good part in teaching mathematics, but he had an assistant who did the heavy work. He had been principal of the school where the Mistress of the House received her education, and she was much attached to him, and he always spent some part of his summer vacation at her house. The Master of the House, of course, was not there every summer, and so this season the Old Professor had a <b>special</b> <b>treat,</b> for there were many things he liked to talk about in which he knew the two ladies could take no interest.|$|E
60|$|The heaviness--whether weariness or content, still continued. Alwyn {{seemed to}} find it too much trouble to talk, and only gave little smiles, more like his mother than himself. He clung quite desperately to his sister when Mark offered to lift him from the carriage, but nurse was close behind, and {{it was good to}} see the little arms {{stretched}} out, and the head laid on her shoulder, the hand put up to stroke her cheek, and the lips whispering 'Wyn's own nursie.' The jubilant greeting and triumphant procession with which he was borne upstairs seemed almost to oppress him. He appeared almost as if he was afraid of wakening from a happy dream, and his lively merriment seemed all gone; there were only beams of recognition and gladness at 'Wyn's own nursery, Wyn's own pretty cup,' touching it as if {{to make sure that it}} was real, and pleased to see the twisted crusts, his <b>special</b> <b>treat.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... '"All to the good, Robin," [...] Sir Huon said. [...] "He'll be {{the less}} anxious to leave us. Oh, we'll {{give him a}} splendid fortune, and we shall act and {{influence}} on folk in housen as we have always craved." [...] His Lady came up then, and drew him under to watch the babe's wonderful doings.' 'Who was his Lady?'said Dan. 'The Lady Esclairmonde. She had been a woman once, till she followed Sir Huon across the fern, as we say. Babies are no <b>special</b> <b>treat</b> to me--I've watched too many of them--so I stayed on the Hill. Presently I heard hammering down at the Forge there.'Puck pointed towards Hobden's cottage. 'It was too early for any workmen, but it passed through my mind that the breaking day was Thor's own day. A slow north-east wind blew up and set the oaks sawing and fretting in a way I remembered; so I slipped over to see what I could see.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} {{were to be}} driven, as a <b>special</b> <b>treat,</b> to the sands at Jagborough. Nicholas {{was not to be}} of the party; he was in disgrace. Only that morning he had refused to eat his wholesome bread-and-milk on the seemingly frivolous ground that there was a frog in it. Older and wiser and better people had told him that there could not possibly be a frog in his bread-and-milk and that he was not to talk nonsense; he continued, nevertheless, to talk what seemed the veriest nonsense, and described with much detail the colouration and markings of the alleged frog. The dramatic part of the incident was that there really was a frog in Nicholas’ basin of bread-and-milk; he had put it there himself, so he felt entitled to know something about it. The sin of taking a frog from the garden and putting it into a bowl of wholesome bread-and-milk was enlarged on at great length, but the fact that stood out clearest in the whole affair, as it presented itself to the mind of Nicholas, was that the older, wiser, and better people had been proved to be profoundly in error in matters about which they had expressed the utmost assurance.|$|E
60|$|With {{burdened}} {{heart and}} aching eyes I {{looked over the}} walls around me. There, in that corner, was the red cloth door {{which led to the}} library. As children, how often Ralph and I had peeped curiously through that very door, to see what my father was about in his study, to wonder why he had so many letters to write, and so many books to read. How frightened we both were, when he discovered us one day, and reproved us severely! How happy the moment afterwards, when we had begged him to pardon us, and were sent back to the library again with a great picture-book to look at, as a token that we were both forgiven! Then, again, there was the high, old-fashioned, mahogany press before the window, with the same large illustrated folio about Jewish antiquities lying on it, which, years and years ago, Clara and I were sometimes allowed to look at, as a <b>special</b> <b>treat,</b> on Sunday afternoons; and which we always examined and re-examined with never-ending delight--standing together on two chairs to reach up to the thick, yellow-looking leaves, and turn them over with our own hands. And there, in the recess between two bookcases, still stood the ancient desk-table, with its rows of little inlaid drawers; and on the bracket above it the old French clock, which had once belonged to my mother, and which always chimed the hours so sweetly and merrily. It was at that table that Ralph and I always bade my father farewell, when we were going back to school after the holidays, and were receiving our allowance of pocket-money, given to us {{out of one of the}} tiny inlaid drawers, just before we started. Near that spot, too, Clara--then a little rosy child--used to wait gravely and anxiously, with her doll in her arms, to say good-bye for the last time, and to bid us come back soon, and then never go away again. I turned, and looked abruptly towards the window; for such memories as the room suggested were more than I could bear.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{people like}} to feed horses <b>special</b> <b>treats</b> such as carrots, sugar cubes, {{peppermint}} candies, or specially manufactured horse [...] "cookies." [...] Horses do not need treats, and due {{to the risk of}} colic or choke, many horse owners do not allow their horses to be given treats. There are also behavioral issues that some horses may develop if given too many treats, particularly a tendency to bite if hand-fed, and for this reason many horse trainers and riding instructors discourage the practice.|$|R
