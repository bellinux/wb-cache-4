500|$|Mercator never {{committed}} any of {{his prison}} experiences to paper; all he would <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he had suffered an [...] "unjust persecution". For {{the rest of his}} time in Leuven his religious thoughts were kept to himself and he turned back to his work. His brush with the Inquisition did not affect his relationship with the court and Nicholas Perrenot recommended him to the emperor as a maker of superb instruments. The outcome was an Imperial order for globes, compasses, astrolabe and astronomical rings. They were ready in 1545 and the Emperor granted the royal seal of approval to his workshop. Sadly they were soon destroyed {{in the course of the}} Emperor's military ventures and Mercator had to construct a second set, now lost. He also returned to his work on a large up-to-date and highly detailed wall map of Europe which was, he had already claimed on his 1538 world map, very well advanced. It proved to be a vast task and he, perfectionist that he was, seemed unable to cut short his ever-expanding researches and publish: as a result it was to be another ten years before the map appeared.|$|E
2500|$|... "What I did <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> such {{a thought}} of {{improving}} the situation of Israel in Eretz Israel would be worthwhile if we would rise to the occasion. It would require return to G-d by observing and honoring the Torah, and a consensus that the foundation of all must be the power of Torah. Repenting of baseless hatred, and wholehearted peace-seeking as obligated [...] would result in success {{because it would be}} close to G-d’s will. We must make amends toward the future that the power of the sanctity of Torah {{be at the top of}} our list of priorities, that 'the son of Yishai be at the lead.' If the will to improve materially will rest on Torah – then the Lord will shine His face upon us and crown our every deed with success. At first, the salvation will be gradual, as our holy Rabbis remarked upon witnessing daybreak over the valley of Arbel, but after it will gain momentum, appearing as a great and wondrous light, as in the days of our exodus from Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|Feyerabend {{considered}} the possibility of incommensurability, but he was hesitant in his application of the concept. He wrote that [...] "it is hardly ever possible to give an explicit definition of [...] " [...] , because it involves covert classifications and major conceptual changes. He also was critical of attempts to capture incommensurability in a logical framework, since he thought of incommensurability as a phenomenon outside the domain of logic. In the second appendix of Against Method (p.114), Feyerabend states, [...] "I never said... that any two rival theories are incommensurable... What I did <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> certain rival theories, so-called 'universal' theories, or 'non-instantial' theories, if interpreted in a certain way, could not be compared easily." [...] Incommensurability did not concern Feyerabend greatly, because he believed that even when theories are commensurable (i.e. can be compared), {{the outcome of the}} comparison should not necessarily rule out either theory. To rephrase: when theories are incommensurable, they cannot rule each other out, and when theories are commensurable, they cannot rule each other out. Assessments of (in)commensurability, therefore, don't have much effect in Feyerabend's system, and can be more or less passed over in silence.|$|E

2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> my grandma showed me my first strap. That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 15 December, Robert Barton was {{questioned}} by Kevin O'Higgins about his notes on Lloyd George's statement about signing the agreement or facing {{a renewal of}} war: [...] "Did Mr Lloyd George single Mr Barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say, 'The man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war?'" [...] Barton replied: [...] "What he did <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the signature and the recommendation of {{every member of the}} delegation was necessary, or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the Treaty". This was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the Irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute, and [...] "terrible and immediate war" [...] became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed. The next day, de Valera took up this point: [...] "... therefore what happened was that over there a threat of immediate force upon our people was made. I believe that that document was signed under duress and, though I have a moral feeling that any agreement entered into ought to be faithfully carried out, I have no hesitation in saying that I would not regard it as binding on the Irish nation." ...|$|E
