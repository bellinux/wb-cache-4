The response characteristics of the platform which uses only thrust vectoring and a second configuration which includes a single-gimbal CMG array are simulated and compared for hovering flight while subject to <b>severe</b> <b>air</b> <b>turbulence.</b> Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of a CMG array in its ability to significantly reduce the agility requirement on the thrust vectoring system. Albeit simplifying physical assumptions on a generic CMG configuration, the numerical results also suggest that reasonably sized CMGs will likely be sufficient for a small hovering vehicle...|$|E

Measurements of moderately <b>severe</b> clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> were obtained from a Canberra aircraft flying at altitudes of 26000 to 33000 ft {{in the vicinity of}} the sub-tropical jet stream. In some respects, particularly at long wavelengths, the spectra are dissimilar to those found for low level turbulence and there are indications that the turbulence is anisotropic.

40|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of {{a small patch of}} <b>severe</b> clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> recorded in a Canberra aircraft flying in the vicinity of storm tops, in Oklahoma, 1965, reveals the existence of a pattern in the variation of horizontal and vertical gust velocities. This pattern appears to arise from the presence of a complex system of equally-spaced vortex rolls, some with horizontal and some with tilted axes, embedded in turbulence of a more random nature. The largest gusts are found near the centres of the vortex rolls and are characterised by the sharpness of their gradients. The implications with respect to aircraft design loads of large gusts arising from such organised air motions is discussed with particular reference to the power spectral approach...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{methods were}} {{developed}} to determine time varying winds and turbulence from digital flight data recorders carried aboard modern airliners. Analysis of several cases involving <b>severe</b> clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> encounters at cruise altitudes {{has shown that the}} aircraft encountered vortex arrays generated by destabilized wind shear layers above mountains or thunderstorms. A model was developed to identify the strength, size, and spacing of vortex arrays. This model is used to study the effects of severe wind hazards on operational safety for different types of aircraft. It is demonstrated that small remotely piloted vehicles and executive aircraft exhibit more violent behavior than do large airliners during encounters with high-altitude vortices. Analysis of digital flight data from the accident at Dallas/Ft. Worth in 1985 indicates that the aircraft encountered a microburst with rapidly changing winds embedded in a strong outflow near the ground. A multiple-vortex-ring model was developed to represent the microburst wind pattern. This model can be used in flight simulators to better understand the control problems in severe microburst encounters...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{emphasis of}} this research was to develop a technique which would be a significant improvement over those currently used for flight planning to avoid clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> (CAT). The technique should, ideally, be both quantitative in determining potential intensity and specific in locating regions of relatively high risk. Furthermore, it should not rely on specialized data but be functional using the currently available rawinsonde observation (raob) system. Encouraging results documented in an earlier investigation were considered compelling enough to warrant a closer look into the possibilities of a Specific Clear <b>Air</b> <b>Turbulence</b> Risk (SCATR) index approach to the clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> problem. Unlike that research, which considered sustained periods of flight in light to moderate clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence,</b> this study focuses on several cases of documented severe CAT.

40|$|The "accepted " {{cause of}} clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> that plagues {{aircraft}} when flying at high altitudes is Kelvin-Helmholtz instability caused by wind shear. However, environmental Richardson numbers associated with air-craft turbulence reports {{are too high}} {{to assume that the}} turbulence is caused just by the environmental wind shear. Forecast techniques developed to date have assumed that there are layers of local Richardson number favorable for turbulence within the larger layer for which it was measured. The forecasts are probabilistic {{in the sense that the}} lower the environmental Richardson num-ber, the more likely somewhere in the layer there will be turbulence. Theory and observations demonstrate that gravity waves can locally modify the wind shear and sta-bility so as to produce turbulence. Analysis of model out-put associated with clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> events suggests that turbulence and indicators of large-scale atmospheric imbalance are related. Since highly unbalanced flow must undergo geostrophic adjustment which is a known cause of gravity waves, clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> may be caused by gravity waves. The conclusion, while preliminary, is that better clear <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> forecasts will likely come from an ingredients-based technique that includes both environmental wind shear and gravity wave forcing. 1...|$|R

40|$|Prediction of {{the effect}} of <b>air</b> <b>turbulence</b> on {{statistics}} relevant to a collision–coalescence process repre-sents a key challenge in the modeling of cloud microphysics. In this paper, collision-related statistics for gravity-driven motion of droplets are considered and various probability distributions associated with geometric configuration and relative motion of colliding droplets are theoretically derived. The theoretical results agree well with numerical results obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNSs). In the absence of <b>air</b> <b>turbulence,</b> the probability distributions, calculated {{at the beginning of the}} time steps used for collision detection, nontrivially depend on the time step size.
