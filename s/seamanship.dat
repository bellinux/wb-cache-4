5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was of a lack of <b>seamanship</b> by the captain and watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the death of the only crewman whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned blame on the captain and PWO.|$|E
5|$|Born in Windlesham, Surrey in 1976, {{where he}} lived and moved to Sherborne. He first learned to sail aged four or five, while visiting his {{grandparents}} at Christchurch, Dorset, and later sailed in a Seafly dinghy with his father, Keith. His talent {{brought him to the}} notice of Jim Saltonstall, who coached him in the Royal Yachting Association youth squad. Simpson attended Pangbourne College, a mixed boarding school in Berkshire, which originated as a nautical college, coaching students in sailing, <b>seamanship</b> and navigation. He studied at University College London, gaining a degree in economics. In addition to sailing, he was a keen footballer.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss {{finished}} his final {{year at the}} Naval Academy ranking 25th out of 61 graduates. The course requirements changed that year; Cabaniss received poor marks in <b>seamanship,</b> tactics, naval tactics, astronomy, and French language, but very high marks in mathematics, electricity, and English composition courses. He maintained his good conduct, earning the second-fewest demerits of any cadet. This earned him an appointment as a Cadet Ensign, a temporary position as an academy officer.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kane {{then took}} his ship to Sydney, where they {{received}} a hero's welcome. The narrowness of Calliopes escape; the excellence of the engines and {{the dedication of the}} crew, who kept the power plant in operation for many hours during the ordeal; the <b>seamanship</b> of Captain Kane and officers; their bravery in letting go of their anchor and facing the storm, trusting only in their ship and themselves; and the respect and encouragement given to them by the crew of Trenton; made Calliope famous.|$|E
5|$|China's power {{began to}} decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the {{subsequent}} Ming Dynastyneglected the importance of China's trade from sea power. The Ming rulers let China's naval dominance and its grip on the Spice trade slacken, and the European powers stepped in. Portugal, with its technological advances in naval architecture, weaponry, <b>seamanship</b> and navigation, took over the Spice Trade and subdued China's navy. With this, European Imperialism {{and the age of}} European Hegemony was beginning, although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade.|$|E
5|$|Having assumed this {{formation}} {{upon the}} giving of a prearranged signal, the Allied ships moved suddenly outwards from this position {{at a second}} signal, rowing into the Persian ships and catching them off guard. Their superior <b>seamanship</b> negated, the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk. During the battle a Greek ship, captained by Antidorus of Lemnos, defected to the Allies. Nightfall then ended the battle, with the Allies having fared better than they possibly expected to.|$|E
5|$|Sailing to {{intercept}} the Haitian ship, Yeo discovered {{her in the}} Gulf of Léogane and ordered Gaspard to surrender. The Haitian refused, and the frigates exchanged shots at 06:30. The superior <b>seamanship</b> and discipline on Southampton prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his greater numbers and within half an hour Heureuse Réunion was dismasted and battered. At 07:45 the Haitian ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing Heureuse Réunion to Port Royal, Jamaica. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and Heureuse Réunion, renamed Améthyste, was returned to Henri Christophe.|$|E
5|$|After {{being trapped}} in the harbour {{for more than a}} year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the first set of lock gates, she jammed on her passage through the second, which led to the River Avon. Only the <b>seamanship</b> of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E
5|$|Levant {{returned}} to Portsmouth in early 1775, but put to sea again on 22 June amid {{the early stages}} of the American Revolutionary War. Captain Murray's orders were to join a Mediterranean squadron under the overall command of Captain Robert Mann, which was tasked with intercepting merchant vessels suspected of supplying American rebels. While at sea Murray also took the opportunity to train his crew in <b>seamanship</b> and battle techniques, in preparation for future enemy engagement. In March 1776 she anchored in the Bay of Algiers where the Dey, or local ruler, received her warmly and provided the crew with supplies of bread, vegetables, and three live sheep.|$|E
5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In <b>seamanship,</b> the candidate {{was expected to be}} able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected {{to be able to keep}} a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{returned}} to Britain in May 1869. In June he joined HMS Royal Alfred, the flagship of the North America and West Indies Station, becoming a midshipman in October. From June to September 1870 he took leave in Germany, {{coinciding with the}} Franco-Prussian war, but {{he spent the next}} three-and-a-half years in the Americas (Bermuda and Halifax, Nova Scotia), where his tour of duty served {{to make up for the}} training he had missed while posted with the Prince of Wales on the Ariadne. Returning to Europe in early 1874, he was posted to the shore establishment HMS Excellent, and passed the sub-lieutenant's examinations—gaining the best marks ever recorded at <b>seamanship</b> and joint best-ever at gunnery.|$|E
5|$|Midshipmen were {{expected}} {{to work on the}} ship, but were also expected to learn navigation and <b>seamanship.</b> They {{were expected}} to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising gun batteries, commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain. Midshipmen {{were expected to}} keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, the Persian fleet {{should have}} held the {{advantage}} at sea, since the Athenian {{part of the}} Greek fleet was, despite their efforts at Artemisium and Salamis, still raw in <b>seamanship.</b> However, whether because of their low morale, or {{because they were in}} fact outnumbered, the Persians sought instead the tactical advantage of joining up with the army under Tigranes, and fortifying a position. However, when the Greeks chose to fight on land, the Persians then threw away the advantage of their fortifications by emerging to fight the Greeks in the open field. Furthermore, as Marathon and Thermopylae had shown, large numbers conferred little advantage against the more heavily armoured hoplites; thus, as the battle began, it was the Greeks who had the tactical upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Whitby is a seaside town, {{port and}} civil parish in the Borough of Scarborough and English county of North Yorkshire. It is {{located within the}} {{historic}} boundaries of the North Riding of Yorkshire. Situated {{on the east coast}} of Yorkshire {{at the mouth of the}} River Esk, Whitby has an established maritime, mineral and tourist heritage. Its East Cliff is home to the ruins of Whitby Abbey, where Cædmon, the earliest recognised English poet, lived. The fishing port developed during the Middle Ages, supporting important herring and whaling fleets, and was (along with the nearby fishing village of Staithes) where Captain Cook learned <b>seamanship.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{taking on}} {{supplies}} at Las Palmas, Lucas sailed to Praia on Cape Verde, before continuing south on 29 May {{in the direction}} of the Brazilian coast, hoping to profit from favourable winds and currents. In fact, due to persistent calms, a position off the Brazilian shore was only reached on 27 June. Because of the delay, Lucas decided not to supply himself but to sail directly to the Cape. Because Lucas made no stops on his journey between Cape Verde and the Cape, the fact that his voyage took far longer than a journey of this distance should have taken has surprised several authors. Historian C. Northcote Parkinson ascribed the delay, at least partially, to the poor quality of <b>seamanship</b> among Lucas's crews. The Batavian expeditionary force did not speak to another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding British dispositions when it eventually reached the Cape on 26 July. They first reconnoitred Saldanha Bay, then Table Bay to the south, and eventually on 6 August they anchored in Saldanha Bay.|$|E
5|$|Arnold, whose {{business}} activities {{before the war}} had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site {{where he wanted to}} meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior <b>seamanship</b> of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where {{they might be able to}} retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E
5|$|At 00:25, Kondo {{ordered all}} of his ships that were able to {{converge}} and destroy any remaining U.S.ships. However, the Japanese ships still {{did not know where}} Washington was located, and the other surviving U.S.ships had already departed the battle area. Washington steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged South Dakota. The Imperial ships finally sighted Washington and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled <b>seamanship</b> of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, the National Convention that governed the French Republic {{expanded}} the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars by declaring war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. The light vessels of the British Royal Navy had {{been preparing for}} the conflict for several months, having concentrated in June 1792 at Spithead {{in anticipation of the}} outbreak of war. These ships were stationed in large numbers in the North Sea and the English Channel to defend British maritime trade against the threat of French commerce raiders operating from the French Channel ports. The French Navy by contrast was riven with the same social divisions that had divided France {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution four years earlier. This had led to the collapse of the professional officer corps and the elimination of the rank of trained seamen-gunners on the grounds of elitism, resulting in a dearth of experience both in <b>seamanship</b> and naval combat.|$|E
5|$|In November 1940, {{while the}} United States was still neutral, the , a {{successor}} to the , granted Lykes Brothers permission to sell West Ekonk and five other cargo ships to the British Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). After West Ekonk took on a load of steel and scrap, the ship sailed to Halifax, where she joined convoy HX 99 in sailing for Liverpool on 26 December 1940. On 30 December, the ship's compass went out but West Ekonk was able to remain in her station in the convoy, and safely arrived at Liverpool on 11 January 1941, despite sailing through a gale with sleet storms on 4 January. In his notes for the convoy, P. E. Parker, the convoy's commodore, singled out H. MacKinnon, master of West Ekonk, for praise of his <b>seamanship</b> in keeping West Ekonk in the convoy without a working compass.|$|E
5|$|The Persians {{preferred}} a {{battle in the}} open sea, where they could better utilize their superior <b>seamanship</b> and numbers. For the Greeks, the only realistic hope of a decisive victory was to draw the Persians into a constricted area, where their numbers would count for little. The battle at Artemisium had seen attempts to negate the Persian advantage in numbers, but ultimately the Allies may have realised that they needed an even more constricted channel in order to defeat the Persians. Therefore, by rowing into the Straits of Salamis to attack the Greeks, the Persians were playing into the Allies' hands. It seems probable that the Persians would not have attempted this unless the Persians were confident {{of the collapse of}} the Allied navy, and thus Themistocles's subterfuge appears to have {{played a key role in}} tipping the balance in the favor of the Greeks. Salamis was, for the Persians, an unnecessary battle and a strategic mistake.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} James Cook's {{historic}} voyages, 1772–1775, {{was primarily a}} search for the elusive Terra Australis Incognita that was still believed to lie somewhere in the unexplored latitudes below 40°S. Cook left England in September 1772 with two ships, HMS Resolution and HMS Adventure. After pausing at Cape Town, on 22 November the two ships sailed due south, but were driven to the east by heavy gales. They managed to edge further south, encountering their first pack ice on 10 December. This soon became a solid barrier, which tested Cook's <b>seamanship</b> as he manoeuvered for a passage through. Eventually, he found open water, and was able to continue south; on 17 January 1773, the expedition reached the Antarctic Circle at 66°20'S, the first ships to do so. Further progress was barred by ice, and the ships turned north-eastwards and headed for New Zealand, which they reached on 26 March.|$|E
5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled <b>seamanship,</b> they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E
5|$|Sir Nathaniel Dance (20 June 1748 – 25 March 1827) was {{an officer}} of the Honourable East India Company who had a long and varied career on {{merchant}} vessels, making numerous voyages to India and back with the fleets of East Indiamen. He was already aware of the risks of the valuable ships he sailed on being preyed on by foreign navies, having been captured by a Franco-Spanish fleet in 1780 during the East Indies campaign of the American War of Independence. His greatest achievement came during the Napoleonic Wars, when having been appointed commodore of one of the company's fleets, he came across a French squadron under Rear-Admiral Comte de Linois, which was raiding British shipping in the area. Through skilful <b>seamanship</b> and aggressive tactics he fooled the French commander into thinking that the British convoy was escorted by powerful naval forces, and the French decided not to risk attacking the convoy. Dance compounded the deception by taking his lightly armed merchants and chasing the French away, despite the considerable disparity of force. Having saved the convoy from almost certain destruction, Dance was hailed as a hero, lavishly rewarded with money and a knighthood, and spent the last years of his life in comfortable retirement.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{most likely}} {{realised}} that this situation presented {{them with an}} opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian <b>seamanship</b> and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; {{they did not want to}} suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment. These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.|$|E
