5|$|The high European {{demand for}} the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his {{autonomous}} <b>sheikhdom.</b> This control of the cotton market also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself. With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of Tyre and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order {{to benefit from the}} customs fees he could exact. The city of Acre underwent an economic boom {{as a result of its}} position in the cotton trade with France, and became the fortified headquarters of Zahir's <b>sheikhdom.</b>|$|E
5|$|All the maqamat of Bani Zeid were {{designed}} differently, with some being rustic tombstones and others built more elaborately. The latter types {{consisted of a}} domed mausoleum known as a qubba, a shelter known as a makan nawm, a garden, a well and either a distinguishable olive or oak tree. Most of the upkeep of the buildings was provided by awqaf ("religious endowments"). One of the shrines was considered by the local peasantry {{to be a place}} to safeguard firewood and outside the reach of potential thieves. The maqamat were also divided by status, with some bearing significance only to an individual village or clan and some collectively revered by the residents of the <b>sheikhdom.</b> Of all the sites in the Bani Zeid <b>sheikhdom,</b> the most venerated shrine was that of Nabi Salih, dedicated to the prophet (nabi) Salih, which held special significance beyond Bani Zeid.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical to the defense of Zahir's <b>sheikhdom</b> against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E
50|$|The United Arab Emirates is a {{federation}} of seven emirates, each ruled by an emir. Until 1971 the <b>sheikhdoms</b> had been protectorates of the United Kingdom, {{known as the}} Trucial States. On December 1, 1971 The U.K. ended {{its relationship with the}} Trucial States and the <b>sheikhdoms</b> became independent. On December 2 the <b>sheikhdoms</b> united to form the United Arab Emirates.|$|R
50|$|The Yafai tribe was {{traditionally}} {{divided into}} 10 branches or <b>sheikhdoms</b> of which 5 are in Lower Yafa {{and the other}} 5 are in Upper Yafa. These <b>sheikhdoms</b> are broken down to many smaller branches and extended families.|$|R
5000|$|The Trucial Coast ( [...] الساحل المتهادن، أو المتصالح {{also known}} as Trucial States, Trucial Oman, Trucial States of the Coast of Oman, and Trucial <b>Sheikhdoms)</b> were a group of tribal confederations in the {{south-eastern}} Persian Gulf, previously known to the British as the 'Pirate Coast', which were signatories to treaties (hence 'trucial') with the British government. These treaties established an informal protectorate by Great Britain, and the <b>sheikhdoms,</b> or emirates, were a British protectorate from 1820 until 2 December 1971, when the seven principal trucial <b>sheikhdoms</b> became independent. Six (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Al Quwain and Fujairah) were to form the United Arab Emirates on that day; the seventh [...] - [...] Ras Al Khaimah [...] - [...] joined the Federation on 10 February 1972.|$|R
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was a petty <b>sheikhdom,</b> and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During {{the first half of}} the first century AD, Palmyra incorporated some of the institutions of a Greek city (polis); the concept of citizenship (demos) appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, describing the Palmyrenes as a community. In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's boule (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during the first century, four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power rested in the hands of the council.|$|E
5|$|In 64BC the Roman Republic {{conquered the}} Seleucid kingdom, and the Roman general Pompey {{established}} {{the province of}} Syria. Palmyra was left independent, trading with Rome and Parthia but belonging to neither. The earliest known Palmyrene inscription is dated to around 44BC; Palmyra was still a minor <b>sheikhdom,</b> offering water to caravans which occasionally took the desert route on which it was located. However, according to Appian Palmyra was wealthy enough for Mark Antony to send a force to conquer it in 41 BC. The Palmyrenes evacuated to Parthian lands beyond the eastern bank of the Euphrates, which they prepared to defend.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{encouraged}} local Christian {{settlement in}} Acre, {{in order to}} contribute to the city's commercial dynamism in trade and manufacturing. Christians grew to become the largest religious group in the city by the late 18th century. Zahir's territory became a haven for Melkite and Greek Orthodox Christians from other parts of Ottoman Syria who migrated there for better trade and employment opportunities. In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively. The Melkite patriarch lived in Acre between 1765 and 1768. Along with the Jews, the Christians contributed to the economy of Zahir's <b>sheikhdom</b> in a number of ways, including the relative ease with which they were able to deal with European merchants, the networks of support many of them maintained in Damascus or Istanbul, and their role in service industries.|$|E
25|$|By 1966, the British {{government}} {{had come to}} the conclusion that it could no longer afford to govern what is now the United Arab Emirates. Much deliberation took place in the British parliament, with a number of MPs arguing that the Royal Navy would not be able to defend the Trucial <b>Sheikhdoms.</b> Denis Healey, who, at the time, was the UK Secretary of State for Defence, reported that the British Armed Forces were severely overextended, and in some respects, dangerously under-equipped to defend the <b>Sheikhdoms.</b> On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the decision to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial <b>Sheikhdoms</b> which had been, together with Bahrain and Qatar, under British protection. The British decision to withdraw was reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath.|$|R
50|$|Eastern also {{expanded}} to other British possessions East of Suez, namely Colombo, Ceylon (1920), Madras (1922), Karachi (1923), and Singapore (1928). British banks also expanded {{into the small}} <b>sheikhdoms</b> in the Persian Gulf, British protectorates which were short of modern financial institutions. Eastern opened a branch in Bahrain in 1920 to leverage the close trading links between the island and Bombay, a key stronghold of Eastern bank. Until 1944, Eastern remained the island's only bank. By the late 1930s, profits rose because of the booming oil industry in the Arab <b>sheikhdoms.</b> However, Eastern couldn't expand further {{in the region as}} the Imperial Bank of Persia (later the British Bank of the Middle East) held near monopoly agreements during the 1940s with the rulers of several important <b>sheikhdoms,</b> especially Kuwait.|$|R

5|$|Zahir {{successfully}} withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman {{governors of}} the Sidon and Damascus provinces, {{who attempted to}} limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. In 1771, in alliance with Ali Bey al-Kabir of Egypt Eyalet and with backing from the Russian Empire, Zahir captured Sidon, while Ali Bey's forces conquered Damascus, both acts in open defiance of the Ottoman sultan. At {{the peak of his}} power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous <b>sheikhdom</b> extended from Beirut to Gaza and included the Jabal Amil and Jabal Ajlun regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the Sublime Porte felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The Ottoman Navy attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sheikhdom</b> of Kuwait {{became a}} British {{protectorate}} in 1899 (until 1961) after the Anglo-Kuwaiti agreement of 1899 was signed between Sheikh Mubarak Al Sabah and the British government in India due to severe threats to Kuwait's {{independence from the}} Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|In January 1929, an Ikhwan {{raid on the}} <b>Sheikhdom</b> of Kuwait {{resulted}} {{in the killing of}} an American missionary, Dr. Bilkert, who was traveling by car with another American, the philanthropist Charles Crane. With no signs of Ibn Saud mobilizing his forces to rein in the Ikhwan and stop the raids, RAF resources were extended to Kuwait.|$|E

25|$|By 1966, it {{had become}} clear the British {{government}} {{could no longer afford}} to administer and protect what is now the United Arab Emirates. British MPs debated the preparedness of the Royal Navy to defend the <b>sheikhdoms.</b> Secretary of State for Defence Denis Healey reported that the British Armed Forces were seriously overstretched and in some respects dangerously under-equipped to defend the <b>sheikhdoms.</b> On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the government's decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial <b>Sheikhdoms,</b> that had been, together with Bahrain and Qatar, under British protection. Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the British Armed Forces in the Emirates. The British Labour government rejected the offer. After Labour MP Goronwy Roberts informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf <b>sheikhdoms</b> attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.|$|R
25|$|When the British-Trucial <b>Sheikhdoms</b> treaty expired on December 1, 1971, the Trucial States became fully {{independent}} <b>sheikhdoms.</b> Four {{more of the}} Trucial states (Ajman, Sharjah, Umm Al Quwain and Fujairah), had decided to join Abu Dhabi and Dubai in signing the UAE's founding treaty, with a draft constitution in place drafted in record time to meet the December 2, 1971 deadline. On that date, at the Dubai Guesthouse (now known as Union House), the emirates agreed {{to enter into a}} union to be called the United Arab Emirates. Ras al-Khaimah joined later, following Iran's swift annexation of the Tunbs islands, in early 1972.|$|R
25|$|In 1869, the Qubaisat tribe {{settled at}} Khawr al Udayd {{and tried to}} enlist {{the support of the}} Ottomans, whose flag was {{occasionally}} seen flying there. Khawr al Udayd was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, Percy Cox, confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan ('Zayed the Great') that Khawr al Udayd belonged to his <b>sheikhdom.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the ruler of the Zaab (Jazirat Al Hamra) was among the only 4 {{independent}} rulers who signed the first treaty with the British in 1820, while Ras al-Khaimah town was burned by the British and the capital was at Khatt. Also, the current state of Ras Al Khaimah was only recognised in 1921. A British general travelling in 1925 also speaks about the Zaab (Jazirat Al Hamra) as a state independent of any other <b>sheikhdom.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1755, the {{guarantor}} of Assaad Hamadeh at the Court of Tripoli was the Sheikh Elias Abou Youssef son of Bahri or Al Bahri. In {{spite of the}} name Al Bahri added to {{the name of this}} last sheikh, this sheikh is Abou Youssef Elias, married to a daughter of Al Bahri family. It seems that, between 1748 and 1755, Abou Youssef Elias became powerful enough to claim the <b>sheikhdom</b> of Kfarsghab and take it from his relatives by his wife, the Abou Mansour Al Bahri.|$|E
50|$|Mawsata was {{the most}} {{populated}} of the five <b>sheikhdoms</b> of Upper Yafa. The last ruler was deposed in 1967 upon {{the founding of the}} People's Republic of South Yemen and the area is now part of the Republic of Yemen.|$|R
2500|$|In 1820, {{a number}} of <b>Sheikhdoms</b> on the {{southern}} Persian Gulf coast and the British government signed a maritime peace treaty. The treaty only granted protection to British vessels and did not prevent coastal wars between tribes. As a result, piratical raids continued intermittently until 1835, when the sheikhs agreed {{not to engage in}} hostilities at sea for a period of one year. The truce was renewed every year until 1853, when a treaty was signed with the United Kingdom under which the sheikhs (the Trucial <b>Sheikhdoms)</b> agreed to a [...] "perpetual maritime truce". It was enforced by the United Kingdom, and disputes among sheikhs were referred to the British for settlement. Bahrain subscribed to the treaty in 1861.|$|R
5000|$|Al-Dhubi {{was one of}} {{the five}} <b>sheikhdoms</b> of Upper Yafa.It was part {{nominally}} of the Western Aden Protectorate, although the date of the treaty is unknown. Al-Dhubi never joined the Federation of South Arabia, but became part of the Protectorate of South Arabia between 1963 and 1967.|$|R
25|$|Stability {{returned}} with the rule of Zahir al-Umar, a powerful Arab sheikh who ruled the Galilee, and later much of the Levantine coast and Palestine. He transformed Nazareth from a minor village into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. Nazareth played a strategic role in Zahir's <b>sheikhdom</b> because it allowed him to wield control over the agricultural areas of central Galilee. He made sure to ensure Nazareth's security for other reasons as well, among them strengthening ties with France by protecting the Christian community and to protect one of his wives who resided in Nazareth.|$|E
25|$|During Ottoman rule, Acre {{continued}} {{to play an important}} role in the region via smaller autonomous sheikhdoms. Towards the end of the 18th century Acre revived under the rule of Zahir al-Umar, the Arab ruler of the Galilee, who made the city capital of his autonomous <b>sheikhdom.</b> Zahir rebuilt Acre's fortifications, using materials from the city's medieval ruins. He died outside its walls during an offensive against him by the Ottoman state in 1775. His successor, Jazzar Pasha, further fortified its walls when he virtually moved the capital of the Saida Eyelet ("Province of Sidon") to Acre where he resided. Jazzar's improvements were accomplished through heavy imposts secured for himself all the benefits derived from his improvements. About 1780, Jazzar peremptorily banished the French trading colony, in spite of protests from the French government, and refused to receive a consul. Both Zahir and Jazzar undertook ambitious architectural projects in the city, building several caravanserais, mosques, public baths and other structures. Some of the notable works included the Al-Jazzar Mosque, which was built out of stones from the ancient ruins of Caesarea and Atlit and the Khan al-Umdan, both built on Jazzar's orders.|$|E
25|$|The Bahraini protests were {{a series}} of anti-government protests from 2011 until 2013. The protests were {{inspired}} by the unrest of the 2011 Arab Spring and 2011–12 Iranian protests and escalated to daily clashes after the King Hamad government violently repressed a revolt {{with the help of}} foreign mercenary forces (mostly Pakistanis) and a coalition of neighbouring <b>Sheikhdom</b> armies under the name of Peninsula Shield Force, however Oman and Kuwait refrained from sending troops or supporting Saudi Arabia and UAE armies in Bahrain. Iran is alleged by United States and others to have a hand in the arming of Bahraini militants. The Bahraini protests were {{a series of}} demonstrations, amounting to a sustained campaign of civil and violent resistance in the Persian Gulf country of Bahrain. As part of the revolutionary wave of protests in the Middle East and North Africa following the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, the Bahraini protests were initially aimed at achieving greater political freedom and equality for the majority Shia population, and expanded to a call to end the monarchy of Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa following a deadly night raid on 17 February 2011 against protesters at the Pearl Roundabout in Manama, known locally as Bloody Thursday.|$|E
5000|$|The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman (سلطنة مسقط وعمان [...] ) was a thalassocratic {{nation that}} {{encompassed}} {{the present day}} Sultanate of Oman and parts of present-day United Arab Emirates and Gwadar, Pakistan.

50|$|Lower Yafa {{included}} some fertile areas of Abyan {{belonging to the}} <b>sheikhdoms</b> of Al Saadi, Yaher, Kalad, Thi Nakheb, and Yazidi.

50|$|Until 1971, Bahrain {{had been}} part of a British {{protectorate}} along with the other <b>sheikhdoms</b> in the Persian Gulf. In 1971 the protectorate ended and seven of the other <b>sheikhdoms</b> joined in a federation to become the United Arab Emirates. Bahrain, however, did not join the federation, but declared its independence on August 15, 1971. The United States recognized the State of Bahrain on the same day and moved to establish diplomatic relations. The U.S. Embassy in Manama was opened on September 21, 1971, with John N. Gatch, Jr. as Chargé d'Affaires ad interim. Ambassador William A. Stoltzfus, Jr. presented his credentials to the government of Bahrain on February 17, 1972. Stoltzfus was concurrently the ambassador to Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, while resident in Kuwait. The first ambassador commissioned solely to Bahrain was Joseph W. Twinam in 1974.|$|R
500|$|The late 19th-century {{chief of}} the Bani Zeid <b>sheikhdom,</b> Sheikh Salih al-Barghouti, resided in a large palace-like manor in Deir Ghassaneh. The first floor and {{portions}} of the second floor were originally built in 1602. In 1862-63 Sheikh Salih renovated the manor which became known locally as [...] "Saraya al-Sheikh Salih al-Barghouti" [...] and built {{the remainder of the}} second floor. The building was divided into three main components, namely the salamlek, the khazeen and the haramlek. The salamlek included a reception area, dining halls and a guesthouse while the khazeen consisted of workshops, food depots and horse stables. The haramlek, on the second floor, served as the living quarters for women and servants. Above the living quarters hung the sheikh's retreat and leisure area from which he could view his estates.|$|E
500|$|The wealth Zahir {{accumulated}} through monopolizing Palestine's {{cotton and}} olive oil trade to Europe financed his <b>sheikhdom.</b> For much of his rule, he oversaw a relatively efficient administration and maintained domestic security, although he faced and suppressed several rebellions by his sons. The aforementioned factors, along with Zahir's flexible taxation policies and his battlefield reputation made him popular among the local peasantry. Zahir's tolerance of religious minorities encouraged Christian and Jewish immigration to his domain. The influx of immigrants {{from other parts of}} the empire stimulated the local economy and led to the significant growth of the Christian communities in Acre and Nazareth and the Jewish community in Tiberias. He and his family, the Zaydani clan, also patronized the [...] construction of commercial buildings, houses of worship and fortifications throughout Galilee. Zahir's founding of a virtually autonomous state in Palestine has made him a national hero among Palestinians today.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Pococke, {{who visited}} in 1727, writes {{that it is}} [...] "famous for some {{pleasant}} gardens of lemon and orange trees; and here the Turks have a mosque, to which they pay great veneration, having, as they say, a great sheik buried there, whom they call Sede Ishab, who, according to tradition (as a very learned Jew assured me) is Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses." [...] Around this time and until the late 18th century, Hittin was a small village in the autonomous <b>sheikhdom</b> of Zahir al-Umar. In 1767, Zahir's son Sa'id sought to control Hittin and nearby Tur'an, but was defeated by his father. Nonetheless, Zahir granted Sa'id both villages when he pardoned him. A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin [...] showed the place, named as Hattin.|$|E
50|$|After {{conflicts}} and raids receded during the 20th century, the Berta people {{moved to the}} valleys, where their villages are located today. During the 19th century, the area of Benishangul was divided in several <b>sheikhdoms</b> (Fadasi, Komosha, Gizen, Asosa), {{the most powerful of}} which was ruled by Sheikh Khoyele {{at the end of the}} 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The Yafa'i tribe has {{traditionally}} inhabited the mountainous hinterland of the Aden area. In the 19th century it {{was formed by}} two sultanates, Lower and Upper Yafa.
