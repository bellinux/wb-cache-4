30|$|Before {{administering}} {{stem cells}} for regeneration, {{they need to}} be cultured to achieve the required quantity, especially when considering human derived stem cell due to their limited numbers (Asatrian et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2012; Dissanayaka et al. 2014). Traditionally, cell culturing is undertaken with fetal bovine serum, which increases the risk of transinfection and immunologic responses (Chen et al. 2012). Researchers have used human platelet lysate for cell culturing during pulp tissue regeneration, implying that the use of autologous medium is a possibility (Chen et al. 2012). Besides increasing the quantity of the stem cells, culturing stem cells with different vehicles can induce them to differentiate into specific target tissues. For instance, dexamethasone and ascorbic acid in culture media lead to greater osteogenic differentiation (Wang et al. 2013). Tooth germ cell-condition medium (TGC-CM) has been introduced for its inductive properties in odontoblastic differentiation (Huo et al. 2010), which can be prepared from three sources: human, rat and porcine. Wang et al. (2011 b) reported that culturing DPSCs using porcine-derived TGC-CM resulted in greater regular odontoblast-like cell layer formation compared with human-derived TGC-CM. Huo et al. (2010) prepared TGC-CM from rats in two stages, embryonic and neonatal, and cultured dermal multipotent stem cells in these two media. They observed that embryonic TGC-CM was more bone inductive rather than odontoblastic (Huo et al. 2010). In mineralization-inductive <b>media,</b> <b>supplementary</b> amounts of KH 2 PO 4 can make the stem cells more potent for odontoblast or osteoblast differentiation (Wang et al. 2011 a, 2013).

40|$|The limited specificity, {{sensitivity}} and multiplex capacity of detection techniques currently available for important seed-borne pathogens of tomato {{is a significant}} risk for the global tomato trade and production industry. These pathogens {{can be associated with}} seed at low concentrations but, due to their highly virulent nature, these low levels can be sufficient to infect germinating seedlings and spread to neighbouring plants and fields, potentially causing epidemics and economic losses. In this study, detection techniques currently available for phytodiagnostics were evaluated for the capacity to accurately detect and identify five agronomically important seed-borne pathogens of tomato: Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm), Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. A prototype diagnostic microarray was also designed in an attempt to develop a tool that could simultaneously detect these five seed-borne pathogens from a single sample. Viral detection based on serological techniques was rapid, accurate and reliable but only detected a single pathogen per assay and required supplementary bioassays to indicate the viability of detected viral pathogens. Selective media plating for bacterial detection demonstrated unreliable recovery of targeted bacteria from infected seed and leaf samples and required supplementary tests to validate the identity of presumptive positives. Assays were lengthy, laborious and sometimes too ambiguous for accurate diagnosis of bacterial pathogens. Nucleic acid-based technologies demonstrated improved {{sensitivity and}} specificity for detection of targets from pure culture, leaf and seed extracts, compared to conventional and serological methods, yet also required <b>supplementary</b> bioassays or <b>media</b> assays to validate the viability of detected pathogens. Amplification efficiency however, was affected by the presence of PCR inhibitors and despite positive detection, variable banding intensity in electrophoretic analysis of amplified products necessitated the use of reference cultures to validate diagnosis. The developed microarray incorporated 152 pathogen-specific and control probes to facilitate diagnosis and taxonomic classification of detected pathogens. The array was challenged with pure culture extracts of the five target pathogens, selected related and non-target, unrelated pathogens of tomato. Positive detection of each of the pathogens was demonstrated but the production of hybridisation signals was highly variable and extremely sensitive to minor technical differences. Each of the five pathogens were successfully detected in combination proving that different classes of seed-borne pathogens could be detected from a single sample using the developed microarray. This prototype microarray has good potential for phytodiagnostic screening of the five targeted pathogens, and further validation, optimisation and extension for testing tomato seed samples may facilitate incorporation of this array into standard diagnostic protocols...|$|R

This study {{examined}} the broader use of a print-media intervention, which was previously shown to be effective at promoting physical activity to participants recruited from a regional Australian community, as a strategy suitable for a more diverse statewide Population sample. Methods. Participants were randomly selected adults who responded to a telephone interview conducted by the New South Wales Health Department and consented to Participate in a randomized controlled trial. Consenters were allocated to either intervention (n = 361) or control (n = 358) conditions. The intervention, a personalized letter plus stage-targeted booklets, was sent 1 week postbaseline. Data were collected via telephone inter view at baseline and 2 and 8 months and were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi(2) statistics. Results. The groups were similar at baseline (mean age 43 +/- 3 years; 64 % women). Process evaluation showed high intervention recall (76 % at 2 months) and high follow-up response rules (> 85 % at 8 months) were achieved. Nonsignificant increases in physical activity were observed (F- 1,F- 719 = 2. 18, p =. 14). Discussion.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a method has been {{proposed}} to visualize curves, surfaces and hypersurfaces in four-dimensional space. Objects in 4 -space are first projected into the 3 D image space and further projected into the 2 D image space. Four topics have been investigated: (1) Fundamental Concepts. (2) Visual Phenomena and Their Meaning. (3) System Architecture. (4) Applications. ^ The orientation of the 3 D and 2 D image spaces can be specified {{by a set of}} six Euler angles or a pair of quaternions. Since the quaternion pairs representing 4 D rotations are not unique, three useful forms have been discussed. Each form is suitable for rotation combination, for conversion between quaternions and Euler angles, or for user interface. The silhouette point of an m-surface with respect to a projection from n-space to l-space (m ≤ l 3 ̆c n) has been defined. The close relationship between silhouette and envelope turned out to be useful in explaining some phenomena with a surface defined by the envelope theorem and in understanding the image of a hypersurface. ^ Several geometric properties and phenomena in 4 -space have been demonstrated by computer generated pictures and animations. They include the ambiguity caused by projection, the degeneracy of the silhouette surface of a hypersurface, and the principal curvatures of a hypersurface. ^ The architecture of an interactive 4 D visualization system has been presented. The system was built on z-buffer based graphics workstations. Algorithms and data structures of polygonalization, point refinement, merging polygons, and visibility determination in 4 -space are discussed. ^ Finally several examples have been presented to illustrate the application of the visualization system: tool path generation for NC machines, collision detection and analysis for robot motion planning, and visualization of electron density data of a virus for molecular biology. ^ <b>Supplementary</b> <b>media</b> for this thesis, a video tape and a set of color slides, is available in the Film Library of Purdue University. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{themes of}} this thesis are {{videogames}} and learning. More specifically, what educators {{ought to know}} about videogames and their utility in carrying out educational initiatives. Videogames are a defining medium of the 21 st century. However in comparison to books, film, and print media, videogames are often overlooked as viable platform for educational initiatives. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that since the emergence of videogames in modern mainstream media, the platform has mainly been used for entertainment purposes. The thesis mainly explores mainstream videogames beyond entertainment media and examines how the platform can foster learning for various educational initiatives applicable to 21 st century learning. The initiative this thesis focuses on in particular is cross-cultural learning because in an increasingly globalized society, increasing intercultural competencies and cultural awareness is an imperative initiative of 21 st century education. Therefore this thesis starts by generally exploring videogames as learning platforms and then the research portion of the thesis how a particular mainstream videogame can foster cultural learning. The first question addressed in this thesis addresses is what educators ought to know about mainstream videogames. A chapter titled “Videogames and Learning” is dedicated to exploring this question. The conclusions of this chapter suggest two things. First that videogames as they currently exist are built on solid learning principles that allow the player to independently learn the internal design grammar of the videogame they’re playing. Knowing these principles and seeing how they operate/ function in videogames is useful to educators because it reveals inherent truths about how human beings learn. Implementing these learning principles in classroom curricula or even lesson plans can increase good learning potential. The second conclusion of this chapter expresses that videogames can serve as a platform that fills the gaps of modern education. Videogames and their vast capabilities can perform as semiotic domains which link information to its corresponding practice. For instance, students can learn about information of space travel and apply that information in a videogame that allows the player to manipulate the variables of space travel, thus allowing for better learning. Using this conclusion, the author then performed a case study which addressed the question of how videogames can serve as a platform for enhanced cross cultural learning in the 21 st century. To explore this question, the author conducted a self-case study by assessing her learning experience playing the videogame, Never Alone, a mainstream game that aims to shed light on a marginalized culture in Alaska through a cultural narrative. The author had never previously encountered this culture and had no specific knowledge of this culture prior to playing the game. The goal of the case study is to determine what this case can demonstrate about videogames as platforms for cultural learning. In assessing her experience, the author uses David Kolb’s (1984) four-part learning theory which claims that learning takes places when 4 actions have been carried out: experience, observation/reflection of that experience, conceptualization, and application. The conclusions of the case study suggest that videogames can be a viable platform for cross cultural learning granted that each part of Kolb’s model is carried out. In other words, the simple act of playing the game is not enough. One must carry out all steps of Kolb’s model to construct a cultural learning experience. It also suggests that any educator attempting to use a mainstream, narrative-based videogame as <b>supplementary</b> <b>media</b> to a lesson must implement reflection, conceptualization, and application practices in order to construct a learning experience out of a videogame. However, the reliability of this case-study can be questioned {{due to the fact that}} the researcher performed the case-study seeking a learning experience, the researcher herself is highly interculturally competent, and the accuracy of the cultural conclusions the researcher made about the videogame is not confirmed...|$|E
