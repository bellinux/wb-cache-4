5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were deposited in water, probably in a caldera lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
5|$|By extrapolating the now-eroded {{and tilted}} beds upward, geologists have {{determined}} that these mountains were several kilometers high.

5|$|On April 24, the {{astronomer}} David Charbonneau, {{who led the}} team that made the Hubble observations, cautioned that the telescope itself may have introduced variations that caused the theoretical model to <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> presence of water.

5|$|The {{number of}} layers {{deposited}} varies with {{location in the}} Lake Lewis basin.

5|$|There {{are also}} devices that combine the {{features}} of interstitial and intracavitary breast brachytherapy (e.g. SAVI).

5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (and hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
