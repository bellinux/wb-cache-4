5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, leading English batsman Len Hutton had been dropped. The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the {{previous}} Test, during which he scored 20 and 13. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the sidewhich was not in good batting formas it was a poor example from a key player. According to journalist and retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, Hutton's second innings at Lord's had been the worst of his career and gave the impression he had been <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian pace attack. The omission generated considerable controversy, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was England's best batsman, and thought he had been treated poorly by the selectors. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, and 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. O'Reilly regarded Hutton's omission as punitive and vindictive. He said if Hutton needed to be shielded from the new ball attack, then England should have reshuffled their batting order to place their beleaguered opener down the order. O'Reilly said that as Hutton had a large range of attacking strokes, he was not a stereotypical, defensive opener who was mainly used to wear down the opening bowlers, and could be used in the middle order as an aggressor.|$|E
25|$|Some 133 Ju 88s were {{pressed into}} the Blitzkrieg, but very high combat losses and {{accidents}} forced a quick withdrawal from action to re-train crews to fly this very high-performance aircraft. Some crews were reported to be more <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ju 88 than the enemy, and requested a transfer to an He 111 unit. By this time, major performance deficiencies in the A-1 led to an all-out effort in a major design rework. The outcome was a longer, 20.08m (65ft in) wingspan, from extended rounded wing tips {{that had already been}} standardised on the A-4 version, that was deemed needed for all A-1s; thus the A-5 was born. Surviving A-1s were modified as quickly as possible, with new wings to A-5 specifications.|$|E
25|$|In February, General Yudenich {{was praised}} for the victory and {{promoted}} to commander-in-chief of all Russian {{troops in the}} Caucasus. The Allies (British and France) asked Russia to relieve {{the pressure on the}} Western front. In return, Russia asked the Allies to relieve pressure in the Caucasus by a naval attack. The resulting operations in the Black Sea gave the Russians some respite to replenish their forces. Additionally, actions at the Battle of Gallipoli which aimed at capturing the Ottoman capital helped the Russian forces on this front. On February 12, the commander of the 3rd Army Hafiz Hakki Pasha died of typhus and was replaced by Brigadier General Mahmut Kamil Pasha. Kamil faced the daunting task of putting the Ottoman army back in order. The military planners back in Istanbul were <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russians advancing deeper into the mainland.|$|E

500|$|Interpretation of Henry's {{personality}} {{by historians}} has altered over time. Earlier historians such as Austin Poole and Richard Southern considered Henry as a cruel, draconian ruler. More recent historians, such as Hollister and Green, view his implementation of justice much more sympathetically, particularly when {{set against the}} standards of the day, but even Green has noted that Henry was [...] "in many respects highly unpleasant", and Alan Cooper has observed that many contemporary chroniclers were probably too <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King to voice much criticism. Historians have also debated the extent to which Henry's administrative reforms genuinely constituted an introduction of what Hollister and John Baldwin have termed systematic, [...] "administrative kingship", or whether his outlook remained fundamentally traditional.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Steven Moffat {{announced in}} 2011 {{that he intended}} to give a [...] "rest" [...] to the Daleks. The reason for the rest was that Moffat felt their frequent appearances made them the [...] "most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe". Moffat recalled that the Daleks were remembered for being scary, but due to their legacy as British icons they had become [...] "cuddly" [...] over the years and their true menace forgotten; with [...] "Asylum" [...] he intended to make them scary again, reminding the audience of their intentions. He thought {{the best way to do}} this would be to show Daleks that were considered even madder than usual. Gillan admitted that she had not been <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Daleks before working on the episode. It is also the first Dalek story Moffat has written for the show; he stated that he [...] "couldn't resist" [...] the opportunity.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the media}} frenzy about details of Hageman's offence, two contestants {{that had not}} yet {{appeared}} on the show were removed by ITV. It was revealed that one had failed to disclose that he had a criminal record during the application process, while information on the second contestant was withheld. A third contestant was subsequently removed by ITV. Each contestant was from a different night, with the first removed on the programme aired 7 September; however footage pre–filmed revealed his identity. One of the three contestants removed, Ryan Keating, was later interviewed by The People, which revealed that he received a 12–month community order and £50 fine in 2008 after he got into a drunken altercation with his wife. He argued that he should not have been removed from the show, saying that he [...] "was honest with them from the outset. I've been totally on the level. They've stitched me up because they were <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headlines– but it's total double standards." ...|$|E

500|$|During these times, the Moros had no {{allegiance}} {{with the}} Filipinos and the Americans, {{and they were}} largely unwelcoming of their assistance. In many cases, they would even indiscriminately attack them as well. The Moros also performed various cruelties during the war, such as thoughtlessly assaulting Japanese immigrants already living in Mindanao before the war. The vicious warlord Datu Busran Kalaw, was known for boasting that he [...] "fought both the Americans, Filipinos and the Japanese", which took the lives of both American and Filipino agents and the Japanese occupiers. Nonetheless, the Americans respected {{the success of the}} Moros during the war. An American POW Herbert Zincke recalled in his secret diary that the Japanese guarding him and other prisoners were <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moro warriors and tried to keep as far away from them as possible to avoid getting attacked. The American Captain Edward Kraus recommended Moro fighters for a suggested plan to capture an airbase in Lake Lanao before eventually driving the Japanese occupiers out of the Philippines. The Moro Datu Pino sliced the ears off Japanese and cashed them in with the American guerrilla leader Colonel Fertig at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and 20 centavos.|$|E
500|$|His {{next film}} roles, in 1998, were Kissing a Fool, Six Days, Seven Nights, and Apt Pupil. In Kissing a Fool, a romantic comedy, Schwimmer played Max, a dapper, smart-mouthed ladies' man. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Fans of the sitcom Friends may be {{surprised}} by David Schwimmer in Kissing a Fool. [...] Take it from someone who has never seen Friends and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does just fine. As a TV sports reporter in Kissing a Fool, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man". The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. In Six Days, Seven Nights, he played the boyfriend of Anne Heche's character. In Apt Pupil, adapted from a novella {{of the same name}} by Stephen King, he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor. [...] "I was <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> part", Schwimmer said, [...] "but I {{wanted to be part of}} the movie". At the time, he noted it was a [...] "little frustrating" [...] that people would typecast him due to his role on Friends.
