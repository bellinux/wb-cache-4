5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in {{the cracks in the}} ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs.

5|$|Dung beetles (Scarabidae) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies, such as Musca vetustissima and Haematobia exigua which are serious pests of cattle in Australia. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the <b>soil,</b> <b>with</b> the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of Musca vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{fires were}} viewed {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest fires were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the <b>soil</b> <b>with</b> nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum ferrugineum {{is found}} mainly in {{coniferous}} woodland, often near pines, but occasionally with spruce.

5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay <b>soil</b> <b>with</b> sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E

In temperate zones, millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests, and may reach densities of over 1,000 individuals per square metre. Other habitats include coniferous forests, deserts, caves, and alpine ecosystems. Some species can survive freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of soil water retention vs. soil water matric potential {{is applied to}} study irrigation and drainage scheduling, soil water storage capacity (plant available water), solute movement, plant growth and water stress. To measure field capacity and wilting point is expensive, laborious and is time consuming, so, frequently, matemathic models, called pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) are utilized to estimate field capacity and wilting point through physical-chemical soil characteristics. Six PTFs have been evaluated (Gupta and Larson, 1979; Rawls et al., 1982; De Jong et al., 1983; Rawls and Brakensiek, 1985; Saxton et al., 1986; Vereecken et al., 1989) by comparing measured <b>soil</b> moisture values <b>with</b> estimated ones at soil water matric potential of - 33 and - 1500 kPa. Soil samples were collected (361) from 185 pedons of Apulian Region (Southern Italy). Accuracy of the soil moisture predictions is quantified with Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between estimated and measured water retention values. In Apulia Region the tested PTFs give different results on soils grouped {{on the basis of}} textural composition and organic matter (O. M.) content both at the Field Capacity (FC) and Wilting Point (WP). At the FC, Gupta and Larson model has given the best performance in Clayey (C), Sandy clay loam (SaCL), Sandy loam (SaL) and Silty (Si) soil, in loamy and tendency silty <b>soils</b> <b>with</b> O. M. content less than 1. 9 % and in tendency sandy <b>soils</b> <b>with</b> O. M. content less than 1. 5 % and greater than 2 %; the Rawls model in Silty clay (SiC) and Silty loam (SiL) soils, in tendency clayey <b>soils</b> <b>with</b> O. M. less than 2. 3 % and in loamy and tendency silty <b>soils</b> <b>with</b> O. M. greater than 1. 9 %; the Rawls and Brakensiek model in tendency sandy <b>soils</b> <b>with</b> O.

5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English <b>soil</b> <b>with</b> a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only {{four hours and}} made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult {{for the first few}} weeks as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease. He rectified this, and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test. Five more centuries {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the easier}} Western species to grow, Banksia lemanniana has some horticultural {{potential}} in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes {{five to six}} years to flower from seed. It prefers a more alkaline rocky or sandy <b>soil,</b> <b>with</b> a nominal pH range from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, and has been successfully cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic <b>soil,</b> <b>with</b> added peat being helpful. They may {{be grown}} in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it can be readily grown as a pot plant.

5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained <b>soil</b> <b>with</b> a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind.

This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are principally seed eaters. Other {{food items}} eaten include green shoots and leaves, bulbs and berries. Insect food such as ants and {{termites}} may be eaten {{especially during the}} breeding season. The diet of many sandgrouse is highly specialised, with the seeds of {{a small number of}} plant species being dominant. This may depend on local availability but in other cases it reflects actual selection of favoured seeds over others by the sandgrouse. Seeds of leguminous plants are usually {{an important part of the}} diet. In agricultural areas oats and other grain are readily taken. Seeds are either collected from the ground or directly from the plants. Foraging techniques vary between species that coexist which reduces competition; in Namibia, double-banded sandgrouse feed slowly and methodically whilst Namaqua sandgrouse feed rapidly, exploring loose <b>soil</b> <b>with</b> their beaks and flicking it away sideways. Grit is also swallowed to help grind up food in the gizzard.|$|E
5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. <b>Soil</b> <b>with</b> the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil.|$|E

50|$|Finely ground {{agricultural}} lime is often applied to acid soils to increase soil pH (liming).
