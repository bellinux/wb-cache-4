60|$|From {{the foot}} of the tree the crevice in which it grew led upwards to the right, then doubled back to the ledge above the nest, upon which Cheplahgan was {{standing}} when I discovered him. The lip of this crevice made a dizzy path that one might follow by moving crabwise, his face to the cliff, with only its roughnesses to cling to with his fingers. I tried it at last, crept up and out twenty feet, and back ten, and dropped with a great breath of relief to a broad ledge covered with bones and fish scales, the relics of many a savage feast. Below me, almost within reach, was the nest, with two dark, scraggly young birds resting on twigs and grass, with fish, flesh and fowl in a gory, skinny, <b>scaly</b> <b>ring</b> about them--the most savage-looking household into which I ever looked unbidden.|$|E
5000|$|Campbell: [...] "Atonement {{consists}} in {{no more than}} the abandonment of that self-generated double monster—the dragon thought to be God (superego) and the dragon thought to be Sin (repressed id). But this requires an abandonment of the attachment to ego itself, and that is what is difficult. One must have a faith that the father is merciful, and then a reliance on that mercy. Therewith, the center of belief is transferred outside of the bedeviling god's tight <b>scaly</b> <b>ring,</b> and the dreadful ogres dissolve. It is in this ordeal that the hero may derive hope and assurance from the helpful female figure, by whose magic (pollen charms or power of intercession) he is protected through all the frightening experiences of the father's ego-shattering initiation. For if it is impossible to trust the terrifying father-face, then one's faith must be centered elsewhere (Spider Woman, Blessed Mother); and with that reliance for support, one endures the crisis—only to find, in the end, that the father and mother reflect each other, and are in essence the same. The problem of the hero going to meet the father is to open his soul beyond terror {{to such a degree that}} he will be ripe to understand how the sickening and insane tragedies of this vast and ruthless cosmos are completely validated in the majesty of Being. The hero transcends life with its peculiar blind spot and for a moment rises to a glimpse of the source. He beholds the face of the father, understands—and the two are atoned." ...|$|E

40|$|The Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans) {{is smaller}} than either the Norway rat (R. norvegicus) or the roof rat (R. rattus). Polynesian rats have slender bodies, pointed snouts, large ears, and {{relatively}} small, delicate feet. A ruddy brown back contrasts with a whitish belly. Mature individuals are 4. 5 to 6 inches long (11. 5 to 15. 0 cm) {{from the tip of}} the nose {{to the base of the}} tail and weigh 1. 5 to 3 ounces (40 to 80 g). The tail has prominent fine <b>scaly</b> <b>rings</b> and is about the same length as the head and body. Female Polynesian rats have 8 nipples, compared to 10 and 12 nipples normally found on roof rats and Norway rats, respectively. Polynesian rats are native to Southeast Asia but have dispersed with humans across the central and western Pacific. Today, these rodents inhabit almost every Pacific island within 30 o of the equator. They occur from the Asiatic mainland south to New Guinea and New Zealand, and east to the Hawaiian Islands and Easter Island. Polynesian rats accompanied early Polynesian immigrants to Hawaii and today occur on every major island of the archipelago. The Polynesian rat is not present in the mainland United States. Exclusion: Not practical for Hawaiian sugarcane fields. Cultural Methods: Synchronize planting and harvesting of large blocks of fields. Eliminate or modify noncrop vegetation adjacent to sugarcane fields. Develop potential resistant sugarcane varieties. Repellents: None are registered. Toxicants: Zinc phosphide. Fumigants: Not practical in and around sugarcane fields. Trapping: Not practical in and around sugarcane fields. Shooting: Not practical. Biological Control: Not effective...|$|R
40|$|Tinea imbricata, {{also known}} as ‘Tokelau’, is an {{uncommon}} superficial mycosis caused by the anthropophilic dermatophyte Trichophyton concentricum. Cutaneous lesions appear characteristically as <b>scaly</b> and concentric <b>rings</b> that may cover {{all parts of the}} body. Often acquired in childhood, tinea imbricata is a chronic disease and lichenification is extremely common due to pruritus. The dermatophytosis mainly occurs in the South Pacific, but also in some regions of Southeast Asia and Central or South America. Tinea imbricata usually affects people living in primitive and isolated conditions. Mycological analysis is required for the diagnosis. The epidemiological and mycological study reported here took place in the Solomon Islands from June–September 2006. Skin scrapings were collected from 29 Melanesian patients (aged 8 months to 58 years) with chronic cutaneous lesions and were analysed mycologically in the Laboratory of Parasitology and Mycology of Angers University Hospital (France). Ten patients showed very evocative lesions with a positive direct examination, but T. concentricum was only isolated from three patients. Identification of the strains was confirmed by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. With the increase in international travel, one cannot disregard that this very rare species may be isolated by mycologists in temperate areas from patients coming from endemic foci...|$|R

Spores are elliptic (or narrowly so), and measure 8-12 by 4.8-6.2 µm. There are clamp connections present in the hyphae. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 23-30 by 8-10 µm. The hymenium lacks cystidia. The cap flesh comprises homogenous, interwoven hyphae that are 3-5 µm in diameter, while the cap cuticle is a 200-300-micrometer thick layer of interwoven, gelatinous hyphae up to 4 µm in diameter.|$|R
