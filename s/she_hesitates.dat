As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E

500|$|One {{player at}} a time is the storyteller. [...] (The 2nd edition rules suggest the {{starting}} storyteller could be the [...] "player with the longest beard", or any other method upon which the players agree.) Whenever a story ingredient is mentioned, if any player has a Storytelling card for that ingredient, {{he or she can}} play it and become (or continue being) the storyteller. [...] A player may be required to draw extra Storytelling cards (for example, when they are the storyteller and are interrupted by another player who becomes the new storyteller, or if he or <b>she</b> <b>hesitates</b> for too long while telling the story). [...] If the storyteller ends the story with the ending on their Happy Ever After card, and is out of cards, he or she wins. [...] Players are expected to cooperate (to some extent) in order to avoid contradictions in the story as it develops, for the story to make sense, and (according to the rulebook) that any ending to the story is [...] "satisfying".|$|E

Liz sees the film in private, and her reaction is very negative, but <b>she</b> <b>hesitates</b> to tell Jenna the truth. When Jenna finds out that Liz hated the film, the two start fighting and accusing each other of not being truthful. Meanwhile, ignoring Liz's warnings, Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) manages to break into Liz's office to steal the film, which he watches {{with the rest of the}} TGS with Tracy Jordan writing staff. Much to Liz's shock, the staff say they liked the film. As the argument between Liz and Jenna escalates, Jack intervenes and persuades them to work things out. Liz admits that she was jealous of Jenna's success and Jenna remembers that the diet pills she was taking would lead to mood swings, and they forgive one another.|$|E

500|$|During the TGS after party, Danny's body paint—after {{performing}} as a robot—had not washed off {{and could be}} seen under the black lights at the party.

500|$|Lisa, {{despite being}} a child prodigy, often sees {{herself as a}} misfit within the Simpson family and other {{children}} due to her extremely high level of intelligence. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways, and is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield, with her rebellion against social norms being depicted as constructive and heroic, yet she can be self-righteous at times. In [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father's roast-pig barbecue, an act for which she later apologizes. Episodes often take shots at Lisa's idealism and virtue signalling. In [...] "Bart Star", (season nine, 1997) Lisa, departs from her typically more genuine nature and apparently {{looking for a new}} cause to crusade over, defiantly declares that she, a girl, would like to join the football team. In the 1990s, it was considered odd to allow a girl to play football. However, when coach Ned Flanders reveals that several girls already play for the team, <b>she</b> <b>hesitates</b> and claims football is [...] "not really [...] thing". She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig's skin, but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to Amnesty International. Upset by being unable to gain moral superiority, Lisa runs off.|$|E
2500|$|Norma {{looks at}} both of her sons, who are asleep. She {{considers}} killing them.

[...] But she cannot bring herself to do it: (Aria: Teneri, teneri figli, Essi, pur dianzi delizia mia / [...] "My dear, dear sons; a moment ago they were my delight, in their smiles, I thought I saw the forgiveness of heaven.") [...] The children wake up and she calls for Clotilde, demanding that Adalgisa be brought to her.|$|E

2500|$|Cecil {{enters with}} the death warrant and {{attempts}} to persuade her to sign it. While <b>she</b> <b>hesitates,</b> Elizabeth contemplates the situation (Aria: Quella vita a me funesta / [...] "That life, so threatening to me"). [...] Cecil urges her to sign it [...] "so that every ruler will know how to pardon you for it" [...] and, as {{she is about to}} do so, Leicester arrives. [...] Seeing him, Elizabeth exclaims [...] "you are hastening the execution" [...] and signs the death warrant. Leicester pleads for mercy, Elizabeth rejects the plea, and Cecil urges her to remain firm (Trio Deh! per pietà sospendi l'estremo colpo almeno / [...] "Alas! For pity's sake spare the final blow at least"). The confrontation ends with Elizabeth holding firm despite Leicester's accusations of cruelty; she orders him to witness Mary's execution.|$|E

[...] "Andover was the best time of my life," [...] she recalled. She played the lead role of Nellie Forbush in the school's spring musical production of South Pacific opposite Peter Kapetan as Emile. She commented: [...] "It was just a little awkward to be Nellie at first because <b>she</b> <b>hesitates</b> to marry Emile since he had once lived with a Polynesian woman – I don't agree with her reasoning so that made things a bit hard at the beginning." [...] She appeared in a student video directed by classmate Jonathan Meath in a film class taught by Steve Marx. She graduated in 1974 with the academic honor of [...] "cum laude" [...] which was awarded to 80 out of 378 graduating seniors. She majored in theater at Wesleyan University, worked in summer stock productions during vacations, and graduated in 1978. Later, in an interview, she reported that she sometimes had eating disorders during this time of her life. She said: [...] "I binged... I starved ... I was one step from anorexia [...] a piece of toast and an apple would be all I would eat in a day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hazel Grace Lancaster—a 16-year-old {{with cancer}} that {{has spread to}} her lungs—attends a cancer patient support group at her mother's behest. At first <b>she</b> <b>hesitates</b> because she feels like it has done her nothing. She thinks {{attending}} the support group could be {{the worst part of}} her life, until a particular support meeting, Hazel meets a 17-year-old boy named Augustus Waters, whose osteosarcoma caused him to lose his right leg, which was replaced with a prosthetic. On catching Augustus stare at her, Hazel feels weird. They meet after the Support Group and converse on {{the fact that they were}} not [...] "literally" [...] in the heart of Jesus, but in a basement. When everything seems to go well, Augustus pulls out a cigarette and puts it between his lips. Hazel is disgusted by this and yells at him saying that he's already got cancer and he wants to pay money for more cancer, [...] "Not being able to breathe sucks," [...] she yells. Augustus calmly explains the metaphor, which is, [...] "You put the thing that kills you right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to kill you." [...] Hazel, impressed by this, goes to his place to watch a movie. Augustus is at the meeting to support his friend, Isaac, whose only remaining eye is soon to be removed due to cancer. Hazel and Augustus strike a bond immediately and agree to read each other's favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel written by Peter Van Houten, who lives in Amsterdam, about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience. After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion. Hazel explains the novel's author had retreated following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E
