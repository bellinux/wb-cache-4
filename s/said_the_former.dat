5|$|The San Diego {{chapter of}} JC's Girls {{is based at}} the Rock Church, a 10,000-member church with a {{majority}} of members {{under the age of}} 30. In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways. Scher <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> strippers were the most effective JC's Girls volunteers because they understand from personal experience the situations of the women they are trying to help. By 2011, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls were visiting strip clubs twice each month. They pray before, during, and after each visit and a team of other members pray for them from another location.|$|E
500|$|After {{nearly six}} months of investigations, the Judicial Commission {{reported}} its findings on June 12, 2012. It found that the memorandum was authentic and that Haqqani was its [...] "originator and architect". The report <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> ambassador [...] "orchestrated {{the possibility of an}} imminent coup to both persuade Mr. Ijaz to convey the message and also to give it (Memorandum) traction and credibility". [...] The justices found further that one of Haqqani's purposes was to head a new national security team in Pakistan. In an unexpected turn of the investigation, a secret fund was discovered in Pakistan's Washington embassy that Haqqani allegedly had access to and had allegedly utilized, in [...] "apparent violation of Article 84 of the Constitution of Pakistan". The Commission's report exonerated President Zardari from any prior knowledge of the memorandum, although it noted that in the [...] "considered view" [...] of the justices, Haqqani had led Ijaz to believe the memorandum had the Pakistani president's approval. Following testimony by Ijaz, the Commission deemed him a reliable witness whose credibility Haqqani had unsuccessfully sought to undermine.|$|E
500|$|The club began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month – with a win. Judge and Fallon scored again to secure a 2–1 home victory against Doncaster Rovers, and pull Argyle clear of the relegation zone. They looked like earning a valuable point when they travelled to play Leicester City but were denied by a 94th-minute goal from midfielder Andy King. Another home defeat, this time to Sheffield United followed, which left Sturrock desperate to improve morale among his squad, but a third consecutive 1–0 defeat at Swansea City, during which Lowry was sent off, signalled the end of Paul Sturrock's second spell as manager. Paul Mariner was placed in charge until further notice. [...] "It's a sad day, but obviously a happy day for me because I'm getting my chance to be a manager in the league," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> striker. [...] "He's a great friend of mine. The bond that we have together is quite remarkable and we have a mutual respect for each other." [...] His first match was a 2–0 defeat at Preston North End, but he took positives from the performance.|$|E

500|$|The {{nature of}} the contest {{fractured}} {{in the next few}} days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates, and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson, were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign. Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans. She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary, setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> President [...] "needs to stop". The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Hillary Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.|$|E
500|$|The Commodore 64 and Atari ST {{versions}} of Wonder Boy in Monster Land also received similar praise from gaming magazines. The Games Machine praised the AtariST version but criticized the Commodore64 version. The reviewers <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> [...] "is not only playable, but the graphics are the nearest to the arcade machine you're going to get"; however, {{they said the}} graphics in the latter, while colorful, were too block-like and ruined its overall presentation. Reviewers from Zzap!64 criticized the Commodore64 version, saying that this version is only slightly better and more playable than the Amiga version. Moreover, they said this version also suffered from repetitive gameplay and [...] "inefficient multi-load", though an improvement from the Amiga version. Zero gave a fair assessment of the AtariST version, appreciating the [...] "cutesy" [...] and cartoon-like graphics and addicting gameplay, which the reviewer said is [...] "very easy to get into and very hard to put down"; they criticized the game's lack of any save features, saying {{that some of the}} gameplay gets repetitive after a while. Swedish magazine [...] acclaimed the Commodore64 version in most aspects. They lauded its graphics for being simplistic but clean, but they noted that they were not sensational. They criticized the game for its music, which they said can become annoying after a while, and for its lack of save points. Overall, they gave a positive review, saying that it [...] "is a perfect example of how to make a game that is fairly simple to play but still is fairly advanced".|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, he lent {{support to}} an {{unsuccessful}} effort {{by a group}} attempting to convince President George W. Bush to release Edwin Edwards from prison. [...] "He has been ruined. There is no purpose to be served by his sitting in prison for 10 years," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> Louisiana Speaker. Edwards was convicted in May 2000 on conspiracy, racketeering, and money-laundering charges following a four-month trial.|$|E

2500|$|However, a local {{delegate}} to the National People's Congress, joined the fray on 4 November by {{saying that it was}} within the powers of the Central government to decide on a timetable for universal suffrage in the chief executive and the Legislative Council elections. [...] "If Hong Kong people want universal suffrage earlier, they should show more respect for the powers of the central government" [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> lawmaker Maria Tam Wai-chu.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, the Israeli {{government}} shelved {{the plan}} to forcibly relocate about 40,000 Bedouin Arabs from their ancestral lands to government designated towns. One of the plan's architects stated that the Bedouin had neither been consulted nor agreed to the move. [...] "I didn't tell anyone that the Bedouin agreed to my plan. I couldn't say that because I didn't present {{the plan to}} them," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> minister Benny Begin.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011, Ahern said he {{believed}} {{that he would have}} [...] "done all right" [...] in the presidential election but for the decline in the popularity of Fianna Fáil. Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election. [...] "I still would have done all right. I mean they have done some figures and I would probably sit in around 30 per cent, which you haven’t a hope with as the party is on 20 per cent." [...] He added that [...] "the party popularity is the thing that snookers it, because if your party isn’t winnable..." [...] Mr Ahern said: [...] "If there was no downturn and if it wasn’t all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, then you could have had a good run at it." [...] He predicted that [...] "nobody is going to win it outright – like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: [...] "Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that’s 14 years, so that ends any chance that I’ll have." [...] He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. [...] "The only thing that is important to me is the central allegations. And what the tribunal says about the other trash is irrelevant." [...] Michael Martin <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> taoiseach was [...] "out of touch with reality" [...] if {{he believed}} he could have won the presidency for Fianna Fáil. Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that.|$|E
