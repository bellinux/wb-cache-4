Officials confirmed that the expansion would be set predominantly in the adjacent Universal Studios Florida theme park, and would feature attractions themed after Diagon Alley and London. The rumored Hogwarts Express connection between the two parks was also confirmed. Officials stated the expansion <b>should</b> <b>open</b> in 2014.|$|E

She delivered her speech as planned, though rewritten from her original draft, in a move that was widely supported across the political spectrum and enhanced her popularity with the public.|$|E

25|$|The 29th had dawned calm, {{but while}} we were still trying to persuade {{ourselves}} that the tragedy was over and the volcano had exhausted its bowels, at about 8 o'clock, we heard a crash and then I noticed that smoke was rising {{from the point of}} the island that looks towards east. The smoke spread very gradually as far as the crater of the volcano, while there were many whiffs issuing from points in the direction of another headland. I realized that the island had opened in these places and fearing that, if a crater <b>should</b> <b>open</b> below the water, an explosion might follow, much more formidable than the preceding ones, I mounted a horse and retired permanently to the Sanctuary of Caysasay.|$|E
25|$|There is one {{airport in}} Leh, from {{which there are}} daily flights to Delhi and weekly flights to Srinagar and Jammu. There are two airstrips at Daulat Beg Oldie and Fukche for {{military}} transport. While an airport meant for civilian purpose at Kargil {{is used by the}} Indian Army. The airport is a political issue for the locals who argue that the airport should serve its original purpose, i.e., <b>should</b> <b>open</b> up for civilian flights. Since past few years the Indian Air Force has been operating AN-32 air courier service to transport the locals during the winter seasons to Jammu, Srinagar and Chandigarh. A private airplane company Air Mantra landed a 17-seater aircraft at the airport, in presence of dignitaries like the Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, marking the first ever landing by a civilian airline company at Kargil.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2013, a {{poll was}} opened {{allowing}} players {{to decide whether}} Jagex <b>should</b> <b>open</b> a separate incarnation of RuneScape from August 2007. Old School RuneScape was opened to paying subscribers on 22 February 2013 after the poll received 50,000 votes, and a free-to-play version was later released on 19 February 2015. It was originally created as an exact copy of RuneScape from August 2007 and receives regular content additions. Old School RuneScape is entirely community based; for any proposed update or idea to pass into the game, it needs at least 75% {{of the community to}} vote Yes for it, and if it does not pass it will either be dropped or reconstructed and re-polled so that the players may find the update more acceptable. On 17 July 2017, Jagex announced the development of a mobile version of Old School Runescape.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{uncertainty}} {{about what happened}} during the remaining hours of 23 December; for example, whether the house arrest for the People's Deputies was cancelled. Between 5 and 7 pm there was a cabinet meeting in which Ebert failed to inform the USPD members of the approaching army units. The three USPD members of the Council then left the Chancellery. At some point, the Volksmarinedivision found out about the advancing troops for they also marched towards the Chancellery and got there first. Dorrenbach met Ebert and asked him to remove the army troops. At the same time, the officers of these units arrived in Ebert's office and asked him for his orders and whether they <b>should</b> <b>open</b> fire. Nothing is known about the ensuing conversation, except that Ebert promised to resolve the situation on the next day by a Kabinettsbeschluss (cabinet decision). The result was that both sides pulled back. The Volksmarinedivision returned to the Marstall, the army to the Tiergarten. However, at 2 am Ebert did order the troops to attack the Marstall in the morning.|$|E
25|$|In April 1976, Spurrier {{was sent}} to the {{expansion}} Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two players and a second round draft pick as part of the new franchise's first trade. The Buccaneers' new acquisition generated local excitement, as Spurrier had been a college star at the nearby University of Florida. He won the job as team's first starting quarterback, a position that he later regretted as the undermanned Bucs went on to suffer the first winless season (0-14) in modern NFL history. Though he had looked forward to playing professional football in Florida, Spurrier was frustrated by losing, the constant hits playing behind a porous offensive line, and his philosophical differences with Bucs coach John McKay. McKay insisted on employing a run-heavy attack similar to the offense he had used to win championships at The University of Southern California, while Spurrier felt that the team did not have the right personnel to run the ball effectively and <b>should</b> <b>open</b> up the offense. Another point of contention was Coach McKay's insistence that his son, John McKay, Jr., be the Buc's primary wide receiver while Spurrier and other observers felt {{that he did not have}} the talent to fill that role.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 360, Shapur II staged a {{campaign}} to capture the city of Singara (probably modern Shingar or Sinjar northwest of Mosul). The town fell {{after a few days}} of siege. From Singara, Shapur directed his march almost due northwards, and leaving Nisibis unassailed upon his left, proceeded to attack the strong fort known indifferently as Pinaca (Phaenicha) or Bezabde. This was a position on the east bank of the Tigris, near the point where that river quits the mountains and debouches upon the plain; though not on the site, it may be considered the representative of the modern Jezireh (Cizre in southeastern Turkey), which commands the passes from the low country into the Kurdish mountains. It was much valued by Rome, was fortified in places with a double wall, and was guarded by three legions and a large body of Kurdish archers. Shapur sent a flag of truce to demand a surrender, joining with the messengers some prisoners of high rank taken at Singara, lest the enemy <b>should</b> <b>open</b> fire upon his envoys. The device was successful; but the garrison proved staunch, and determined on resisting to the last. After a long siege, the wall was at last breached, the city taken, and its defenders indiscriminately massacred.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the rocky}} terrain in the Faroe Islands, its road {{transport}} system was not as extensive as in other places of the world. This situation has now changed, and the infrastructure has been developed extensively. Some 80 {{percent of the population}} of the islands is connected by tunnels through the mountains and between the islands, bridges and causeways that link the three largest islands and three other larger and smaller islands to the northeast together. While the other two large islands to the south of the main area, Sandoy and Suðuroy, are connected to the main area with ferries, the small islands Koltur and Stóra Dímun have no ferry connection, only helicopter service. Other small islands—Mykines in the west, Kalsoy, Svínoy and Fugloy in the north, Hestur west of Streymoy, and Nólsoy east of Tórshavn—have smaller ferries and some of these islands even have helicopter service. In February 2014 all the political parties of the Løgting agreed on making two subsea tunnels, one between Streymoy and Eysturoy (the Eysturoyartunnilin) and one between Streymoy and Sandoy (Sandoyartunnilin). The plan is that both tunnels <b>should</b> <b>open</b> in 2021 and they will not be private. The work to dig the Eysturoy-tunnel started on 1 March 2016 above the village of Hvítanes near Tórshavn.|$|E

500|$|Before use {{the user}} should verify the {{contents}} of the cylinder and check the function of the cylinder valve. This is usually done with a regulator connected to control the flow. Pressure and gas mixture are critical information for the diver, and the valve <b>should</b> <b>open</b> freely without sticking or leaking from the spindle seals. Failure to recognize that the cylinder valve was not opened or that a cylinder was empty has been observed in divers conducting a pre-dive check. Breathing gas bled from a cylinder may be checked for smell. If the gas does not smell right it should not be used. Breathing gas should be almost free of smell, though a very slight aroma of the compressor lubricant is fairly common. No smell of combustion products or volatile hydrocarbons should be discernible.|$|E
500|$|There was {{considerable}} debate {{as to whether}} Galvis <b>should</b> <b>open</b> the 2013 season working on his hitting in AAA, or on the bench of the major league Phillies. Manager Charlie Manuel preferred the latter, commenting that even in 300 major league at bats splitting time between second base, shortstop, and third base, Galvis could make a greater contribution than in a season in the minor leagues. Ultimately, he did make the opening day roster, but struggled through the first third of the season, and was optioned to AAA on June 27. Correspondingly, the Phillies acquired veteran infielder John McDonald. He performed better in AAA, including a 40-game streak during {{which he did not}} commit any errors, and a leadoff home run on the Fourth of July. He returned to the major league Phillies as a September callup, and on September 7, 2013, he compiled four hits including a game-winning home run against the Atlanta Braves. Overall, 19 at second base, 14 at third base, 10 in left field, and six at shortstop comprised his 49 total major league starts. At the major league level, he hit [...]234 with six home runs and 19 RBIs, and in AAA, he hit [...]245 with three home runs and 25 RBIs.|$|E
