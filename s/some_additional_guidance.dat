40|$|Business {{combinations}} under {{common control}} in International Financial Reporting Standards – is authoritative accounting guidance needed? The {{purpose of the}} article is {{to answer the question}} if a separate standard (IFRS) is needed for business combinations under common control (BCUCC), which are not governed by any IFRS as the moment. In such cases, the approach resulting from IAS 8 should apply to them, which allows the use of national regulations to account for BCUCC. The authoress shortly described the theoretical issues related to the subject and presented the results of empirical research that verified the practical aspects of the problem. The research methodology involves a literature and legal act analysis, content analysis of financial statements, as well as deductive and inductive reasoning. On the basis of the gathered data the authoress concluded that even the existence of necessary regulations in national GAAPs does not guarantee that all the requirements related to the qualitative characteristics of the reported information are met and, as such, the main objectives for which IFRS were developed may not be met. As such, the authoritative guidance proves necessary. Very little research on the subject was published, thus, this paper may provide <b>some</b> <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> as to what issues related to BCUCC should receive particular attention...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} impact of <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> {{provided}} on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (in addition to what is contained in the relevant IFRS) as a decision aid on the accuracy of judgments and the confidence the accountants have on their judgments. Originality: Prior studies in auditing and psychology have considered the effect of decision aids on the accuracy of judgments. However, prior studies in accounting have not investigated {{the impact of}} <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> provided on IFRS on the accuracy of judgments and the confidence the accountants have on their judgments. Design/methodology/approach: An experiment, using the accountants as the subjects, was undertaken in a CPA meeting held in Malaysia in November 2010. Findings: Those accountants provided with decision aids in the form of <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> on IFRS make more accurate judgments than those accountants who are not provided with any <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> on IFRS. Furthermore, the <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> in the accounting standards increase the confidence the accountants have on their judgments.

Practical and Social implications: The results provide evidence {{of the importance of the}} <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> on the principles-based IFRS, hence, indicating that accounting regulators, such as the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), should seriously consider including more guidance on IFRS. 2 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Extract] This 'self-assessment' {{checklist}} {{was developed}} {{in response to the}} global review of University HIV/AIDS strategies undertaken by UNESCO in 2005. It was first {{presented at the annual meeting}} of the Association of Caribbean Universities and Research Institutes (UNICA) in November 2005. It was apparent that (with some notable exceptions) many universities have not shown leadership in HIV/AIDS that would have been shown by universities on other important social issues. There are a variety of reasons why this is so, but it is likely that the foremost reason is because of the stigma and taboo associated with HIV/AlDS, which has lead to a qualitatively different response from many key institutions, not just universities. It is clear that universities would benefit from <b>some</b> <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> and models concerning how they should respond to HIV/AIDS. The self-assessment checklist offers an implicit model for responding; a simple mechanism whereby universities can use to check their track record; and a basis for audit by umbrella bodies and quality assurance agencies if desired The checklist is divided along the usual lines of responsibility accepted by universities: teaching, research and service: Section 1 : HIV and the education and training role ofthe University Section 2 : HIV and the research and inquiry role of the University Section 3 : HIV and service to the university and to society role...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The Cancer Plan Self-Assessment Tool {{is easy to}} {{complete}} and allows users to evaluate the comprehensiveness of their plan. The components and indicators identified in this tool are not an exhaustive list of items that {{should be included in}} a cancer plan, but they are critical to CDC. Users may need to include additional components and/or indicators {{to meet the needs of}} their stakeholders. Use of this tool is not mandatory. However, if you do apply it to your plan, please share your results with your program consultant as s/he may provide <b>some</b> <b>additional</b> <b>guidance.</b> Intended Users: This tool was created by CDC/Comprehensive Cancer Control Branch staff for Comprehensive Cancer Control program directors and cancer coalition members to assist them with revising or assessing the State/Territory/Tribe/Pacific Island Jurisdiction cancer plan (referred to as 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 jurisdiction 22 ̆ 0 ac? throughout this document). IntroductionBackground: The cancer plan self-assessment tool was adapted from CDC 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Cancer Plan Index. * The Cancer Plan Index is a tool developed to review CCC plans and assess their level of comprehensiveness on the basis of selected topic areas, including goals, objectives, and strategies. The CDC Cancer Plan Index Study was completed in collaboration with Research Triangle Institute, Inc. in 2008. 1 Since the Cancer Plan Index was developed, NCCCP has implemented new priority areas (see Appendix A) and modified performance measures for CCC grantees. This self-assessment tool incorporates the CDC/NCCCP priorities and updated measures. To read more about the Cancer Plan Index see Appendix B. Description: The self-assessment tool has eight core components (description of the process used to develop the plan, goals, objectives, strategies, stakeholder involvement, presentation of data on disease burden, reduction of cancer disparities, evaluation, and additional descriptive items). Seven of the components were identified in the CPI as key elements of cancer control planning. Grouped within each component are corresponding indicators that reflect plan attributes and planning processes.

40|$|International audienceThis report {{focuses on}} new {{advances}} regarding tropical cyclone (TC) intensity change induced by external influences. It briefly recalls the framework and main areas of progress identified {{during the last}} IWTC. It then highlights the major operational improvements in TC intensity forecasting since then and describes the research studies conducted to augment {{our understanding of the}} processes governing TC intensity changes under external forcing. Important shortcomings that remain are pointed out and suggestions are given to initiate discussion at the workshop on how to further progress on these matters. 2. 5. 0 Introduction The refinement of our knowledge regarding environmental control on TC intensity was highlighted during the IWTC-VII. Several advances were reported on the four dominant synoptic-scale factors influencing TC intensity: (i) vertical wind shear (VWS), (ii) relative humidity (RH), (iii) sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean heat content (OHC), as well as (iv) outflow-layer interactions with the environment. A spectrum of shear values and TC intensities that permit continued intensification was identified from observational and modeling studies. Tang and Emanuel (2010) underlined two mechanisms for inner-core ventilation, defined as the entrainment of low-entropy air from the environment (Simpson and Riehl 1958) under vertical shear: inward eddy fluxes (e. g., through vortex Rossby waves) and downward fluxes through convective downdrafts. Riemer et al. (2010) demonstrated how asymmetries resulting from the relative shear flow help import low entropy environmental air towards the TC core at mid levels where it excites downdrafts (by ice melting and evaporative cooling) that flush the inflow layer with low-entropy air, which is then taken into downstream updrafts; these processes reduce the eyewall buoyancy and convection and thus the storm intensity (Figure 1). There was disagreement {{on the role of the}} Saharan Air Layer in the Atlantic basin on TC intensity change. A composite study indicated that the rate of TC intensification was only weakly dependent on environmental conditions, suggesting that rapid intensification (RI; maximum wind speed increasing by at least 30 kt in 24 h) would be more influenced by internal dynamical processes, provided that a preexisting favorable environment exists (Hendricks et al. 2010). Despite <b>some</b> <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> and considering that intensity change forecasts were still challenging, IWTC-VII encouraged continued research towards improving the understanding of the impact of various environmental parameters on TC structure and intensity. These encompassed (i) -to-(iv), as well as water vapor advection, dust, topography, and boundary-layer fluxes. IWTC-VII also recommended research into predictability limits for intensity forecasting...|$|E
