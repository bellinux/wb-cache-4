The inquiry would re-examine Wagga and Riverina FM Stereo Broadcasters application which Riverina Broadcasters had contested. The inquiry would also look at the application for a supplementary FM commercial licence from Riverina Broadcasters, and at the viability of Riverina Broadcasters if an FM commercial licence was granted to a <b>second</b> independent <b>licensee</b> in the city.|$|R
40|$|Using a new dataset with {{detailed}} geographic information about licensing {{activities of the}} Max Planck Society, Germany's largest non-university public research organization, we analyze how the probability and magnitude of commercial success are affected by geographic distance between licensors and licensees. Our evidence suggests that proximity is not generally associated with superior commercialization outcomes. A negative association between distance and commercialization success is identified only for the specific cases of, first, spin-off licensees located outside Germany and, <b>second,</b> foreign <b>licensees</b> within the subsample of inventions with multiple licensees. academic inventions, licensing, spin-off entrepreneurship, geographic distance...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the effect of {{spillover}} on extent of licensing when cost reducing innovation is introduced and licensed to a number of oligopolistic firms. We characterize the equilibrium number of licenses that are sold through an auction. An increase in the number of licenses has two effects. First, it increases the competi-tion between the <b>licensees.</b> <b>Second,</b> due to spillover, the non-licensees become more efficient contributing to even more competition. We find that despite these effects, a patentee of a significant innovation will sel-l more licenses when there is spillover than without spillover thereby inducing even more competition. In this case, consumer surplus will be greater with spillover. However, if the innovation is less significant, then the patentee will sell less licenses with spillover thereby restric-t competition. In this case the market price will be higher and the consumer surplus will be smaller...|$|R
40|$|Casual {{empiricism}} {{suggests that}} the interna-tional licensing of the production and marketing of branded food and related products may become an increasing y {{important aspect of the}} globalization of the food industry, particularly in sectors such as soft drinks, brewing and confectionery prod-ucts. For example, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola both license the canning and distribution of their final products in overseas markets, Anheuser [...] Buschand Miller license production of various of their beer brands whilst Nestl&chocolate products are manufactured under license in the United States by Hershey. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold; first, in Section 1 empirical evidence on the extent of international licensing is presented and evaluated. In particular, due to recent developments, the specific focus of the analysis is on the case of brewing where the licensing of branded beers appears to be a fairly widespread international phenomenon and is often two-way in nature, i. e. U. S. brewers act as both licenser and <b>licensees.</b> <b>Second,</b> because much of the recent theoretical literature on licensing has dealt only with the licensing of process technologies rather than branded products, Section 2 considers the possible motives for such licensing using a simple game-theoretic structure. The results suggest that im-perfect competition in overseas markets and im-perfect information may be important determinants of international licensing. Finally, the research and strategic implications of international licensing are considered...|$|R
40|$|In United States tort law, {{there are}} two general {{approaches}} to determining when a property owner is to {{be held liable for}} damages to entrants on his land. Twenty-four states follow common law tradition, which distinguishes between trespassers, invitees (business visitors), and licensees (social guests) (Cupp Jr. 2010, fn. 2). A “reasonable duty of care, ” often including a duty to warn of danger as well as a duty to inspect and make safe, is taken to obtain {{in the case of the}} latter two, but not always in the case of trespassers. 1 Call this the traditional approach. In 1968, the landmark California Supreme Court case Rowland v. Christian (1968) introduced a second approach. At issue in Rowland was a social guest who injured himself on a faucet. Miss Christian, the defendant, was aware of the dangerous condition of the faucet and failed to warn James Rowland, the plaintiff, of the danger. In finding for the plaintiff, the court established a precedent that regarded the three-fold distinction between trespasser, invitee, and licensee as non-dispositive, and suggested a singular approach that imposes a duty of reasonable care on land 1 There is a good deal of variation here. First, on some versions, a higher duty applies to invitees than to <b>licensees.</b> <b>Second,</b> different jurisdictions treat the legal duty itself differently. The Arizona Supreme Court, in Siddons v. Business Properties Development Co. (1998) cited the Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 360, concluding that...|$|R
40|$|For several years, {{the demand}} for data has increased. Furthermore, this is a growing trend. There are three ways to meet this demand. One option {{is to make the}} network denser; this implies large investments. We can work on {{improving}} the bandwidth efficiency; unfortunately, the channel limit is about to be reached[1]. Finally, the bandwidth allocated to telecommunication can be enlarged. Indeed, there are large spaces on spectrum which have been underused by the army or by the TV broadcasters. These players employ only a part of their allocated frequencies or use them only in a restricted area or time. Thus, regulatory frameworks are under construction to allow second users to exploit the locally unused frequencies without harming the incumbent. The two most advanced projects in this area are Licensed Share Access (LSA) and TV White Spaces (TVWS). Under LSA, an agreement is settled between an incumbent who underuses its spectrum (e. g: the Army) and one to several <b>second</b> users (share <b>licensees).</b> The agreement states, among other things, the area where the share licensees can deploy their networks and the conditions leading to its termination. In the case of TVWS, which takes advantage of the locally unused TV frequencies, the number of second users is unlimited and there is no direct contract with the incumbents (TV broadcasters and PMSE 1). Instead, second users have to obtain the regulator authorization. Concretely, second users inform a database of their localization and the characteristics of their devices and will get in return available channels and power limitations. Even if there is a common understanding of these regulatory frameworks, regulators[2][3] are still working on the definition. This paper aims at presenting in several countries the trends in the regulation of TVWS and LSA. Aspects such as normalization, authorized uses, and allocated bandwidths will be highlighted. From this overall regulatory picture, this research will provide insight on the business development around TVWS and LSA. QC 20150205 METI...|$|R
