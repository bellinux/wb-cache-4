It is not clear whether the Soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted. At least one Soviet penetration agent, British Secret Intelligence <b>Service</b> <b>representative</b> to the U.S. Kim Philby, was told about the project in 1949, as part of his job as liaison between British and U.S. intelligence. Since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time, the Soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of Venona. However, this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption.|$|E

In Three Generations, directed by Gaby Dellal, she appeared with Susan Sarandon and Elle Fanning as the mother of a young transgender man (Fanning).

ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on {{the likelihood of a}} caller cancelling their service or buying a new product. It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net. CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other. CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages. In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas. The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015.

500|$|At the time, {{this season}} marked {{the final year}} that some cast members‚Äînotably Helms, Fischer, Novak, and Krasinski‚Äîwere signed on for the show, as their {{contracts}} expired {{at the end of}} the season; this caused speculation that several members of the main cast would leave the series following this season.

On February 28, 2012, it was announced that Spader would not return for a ninth season of the show. There was initial speculation that following the eighth season, Daniels was considering rebooting the series due to the possible departures of main cast members. However, a new deal was negotiated with NBC, and all the main cast members, sans Spader, Novak, and Kaling, would return for the ninth season, although several new characters would be brought on board for a [...] "mini reboot".

According to BJ Novak, the episode was originally going to be called [...] "My Grilled Foot", but writer Mindy Kaling thought it was [...] "too weird for people to tune in and watch that".
