Physiologist Von Mohl explored <b>solute</b> transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, {{dopamine}} {{functions as}} a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled {{by a set of}} mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a <b>solute</b> carrier—a vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, {{but it can also be}} caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|Treatment of uremia by {{hemodialysis}} has becomewidespread {{over the}} last 40 years and has improved substantially over that time. However, people treated with this modality continue to suffer frommultiple disabilities. Retention of organic <b>solutes,</b> especially those poorly removed by hemodialysis, likely contributes to these disabilities. Certain classes of <b>solutes</b> are removed less well than urea by hemodialysis and by the normal kidney. These include protein-bound <b>solutes,</b> relatively large <b>solutes,</b> sequestered compounds, and substances removed at rates higher than urea by the normal kidney.

40|$|An updated {{review of}} the {{existing}} knowledge regarding uremic toxins facilitates the design of experimental studies. We performed a literature search and found 621 articles about uremic toxicity published after a 2003 review of this topic. Eighty-seven records provided serum or blood measurements {{of one or more}} <b>solutes</b> in patients with CKD. These records described 32 previously known uremic toxins and 56 newly reported <b>solutes.</b> The articles most frequently reported concentrations of beta 2 -microglobulin, indoxyl sulfate, homocysteine, uric acid, and parathyroid hormone. We found most <b>solutes</b> (59 %) in only one report. Compared with previous results, more recent articles reported higher uremic concentrations of many <b>solutes,</b> including carboxymethyllysine, cystatin C, and parathyroid hormone. However, five <b>solutes</b> had uremic concentrations less than 10 % of the originally reported values. Furthermore, the uremic concentrations of four <b>solutes</b> did not exceed their respective normal concentrations, although they had been previously described as uremic retention <b>solutes.</b> In summary, this review extends the classification of uremic retention <b>solutes</b> and their normal and uremic concentrations, and it should aid the design of experiments to study the biologic effects of these <b>solutes</b> in CKD...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} remove or recover the {{extracted}} <b>solute,</b> SIR particles can be regenerated using low pressure steam stripping, which is particularly effective for {{the recovery of}} volatile hydrocarbons. However, if the vapor pressure of the extracted <b>solute</b> is too low, or if the complexation between <b>solute</b> and extractant is too strong, other techniques need to be applied, e.g. pH swing.|$|E
25|$|In ion-exchange {{chromatography}} (IC), retention {{is based on}} the attraction between <b>solute</b> ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. <b>Solute</b> ions of the same charge as the charged sites on the column are excluded from binding, while <b>solute</b> ions of the opposite charge of the charged sites of the column are retained on the column. <b>Solute</b> ions that are retained on the column can be eluted from the column by changing the solvent conditions (e.g. increasing the ion effect of the solvent system by increasing the salt concentration of the solution, increasing the column temperature, changing the pH of the solvent, etc...).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to mixing, the substances {{in a solution}} {{interact with each other}} at the molecular level. When something is dissolved, molecules of the solvent arrange around molecules of the <b>solute.</b> Heat transfer is involved and entropy is increased making the solution more thermodynamically stable than the <b>solute</b> and solvent separately. This arrangement is mediated by the respective chemical properties of the solvent and <b>solute,</b> such as hydrogen bonding, dipole moment and polarizability. Solvation does not cause a chemical reaction or chemical configuration changes in the <b>solute.</b> However, solvation resembles a coordination complex formation reaction, often with considerable energetics (heat of solvation and entropy of solvation) and is thus far from a neutral process.|$|E
40|$|The grain {{refining}} effect of four peritectic-forming <b>solutes</b> (Ti, V, Zr and Nb) {{as well as}} three eutectic-forming <b>solutes</b> (Cu, Mg and Si) on pure Al was investigated. Significant grain refinement is observed {{by the addition of}} peritectic-forming <b>solutes,</b> whereas the addition of eutectic-forming <b>solutes</b> only slightly decreases the grain size. The mechanisms underlying the grain refinement of these alloys were then studied by a new analytical methodology for assessing grain refinement that incorporates the effects of both alloy chemistry and nucleant potency. It is found that the low degree of grain refinement by the addition of eutectic-forming <b>solutes</b> is mainly attributed to the segregating power of <b>solutes,</b> i. e. the constitutional undercooling contribution. However, peritectic-forming <b>solutes</b> do not only cause grain refinement by their segregation power but, more importantly, they introduce copious potent nuclei into the melt and promote significant grain refinement via heterogeneous nucleation...|$|R

40|$|Living cells {{accumulate}} compensatory <b>solutes</b> {{for protection}} against {{the harmful effects of}} extreme environmental conditions such as high salinity, temperature and desiccation. Even at high concentrations these <b>solutes</b> do not disrupt the normal cellular functions and at times counteract by stabilizing the cellular components. These properties of compensatory <b>solutes</b> have been exploited for stabilizing proteins and cells in vitro. Betaines are widespread natural compensatory <b>solutes</b> that have also been used in other applications such as therapeutic agents and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enhancers. Some biomedical applications of novel synthetic analogues of natural betaines were investigated. Natural compensatory <b>solutes</b> are either dipolar zwitterionic compounds or polyhydroxyl compounds, and the physical basis of compensation may differ between these, so one focus was on synthetic betaines with hydroxyl substituents. The majority of the synthetic <b>solutes</b> stabilized different model proteins against stress factors such as high and low temperatures. The presence of hydroxyl groups improved protection against desiccation. The observed stabilization effect is not just on the catalytic activity of the enzyme, but also on its structural conformation. Synthetic compensatory <b>solutes</b> have a potential application as protein stabilizers. Dimethylthetin was evaluated as a therapeutic agent and found to be harmful in a sheep model. However, from the study we were able to generate a large-animal continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) model and showed that glycine betaine could be added to the dialysis fluid in chronic renal failure. Some synthetic compensatory <b>solutes</b> reduce the melting temperatures of DNA better than most natural <b>solutes.</b> Synthetic <b>solutes</b> were identified that have potential to enhance PCR and could replace some reagents marketed by commercial suppliers. Density, viscosity and molecular model data on the <b>solutes</b> showed correlations with the biochemical effects of the <b>solutes,</b> but no physical measurements were found that reliably predicted their potential for biotechnological applications...|$|R

40|$|It is {{now well}} known that small <b>solutes</b> such as sugars can reduce {{membrane}} damage during freezing and dehydration. One of the mechanisms for this protection is that small <b>solutes</b> can hinder deleterious phase transitions, thus preserving membrane integrity. The mechanisms for this can {{be understood in terms}} of the hydration forces explanation (HFE) [G. Bryant, K. L. Koster, J. Wolfe, Seed Sci. Res. 11 (2001) 17 – 25]. At low to intermediate hydrations, the presence of small <b>solutes</b> reduces membrane transition temperatures through their (non-specific) volumetric and osmotic properties. If concentrations are sufficiently high that vitrification occurs, then the transition temperatures are depressed even further. In the fully dehydrated state, direct hydrogen bonding between <b>solutes</b> and membranes may become important. Recently [K. Koster, G. Bryant, Eur. Biophys. J. 32 (2003) 96 – 105], we showed how <b>solutes</b> can be excluded from inter-membrane regions during dehydration if the <b>solutes</b> are too large, explaining why large <b>solutes</b> (eg polymers) cannot inhibit membrane phase transition. This raises two questions: (1) is there partial exclusion of small and intermediate sized <b>solutes?</b> (2) if so, how does this alter the effects of the <b>solutes?</b> and (3) is there a maximum useful concentration of small <b>solutes?</b> Question (3) is answered in an accompanying paper (see Lenné et al., this volume). In this paper we will present the results of Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments designed to answer the first two questions, and discuss the implications for our understanding of the effects of <b>solutes</b> on membranes during dehydration.

25|$|In many {{simulations}} of a solute-solvent system {{the main focus}} is on the behavior of the <b>solute</b> with little interest of the solvent behavior particularly in those solvent molecules residing in regions far from the <b>solute</b> molecule. Solvents may influence the dynamic behavior of solutes via random collisions and by imposing a frictional drag on the motion of the <b>solute</b> through the solvent. The use of non-rectangular periodic boundary conditions, stochastic boundaries and solvent shells can all help reduce the number of solvent molecules required and enable a larger proportion of the computing time to be spent instead on simulating the <b>solute.</b> It is also possible to incorporate the effects of a solvent without needing any explicit solvent molecules present. One example of this approach is to use a potential mean force (PMF) which describes how the free energy changes as a particular coordinate is varied. The free energy change described by PMF contains the averaged effects of the solvent.|$|E
