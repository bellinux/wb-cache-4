5|$|Healthcare in Tripura {{features}} a {{universal health care}} system run by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of Tripura. The health care infrastructure {{is divided into three}} tiers– the primary health care network, a <b>secondary</b> <b>care</b> system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey– 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long waiting time, and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate is better than the national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of Malaria, Diarrhea, Japanese Encephalitis and Meningitis. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major Malaria outbreak.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Secondary</b> health <b>care</b> {{refers to}} a higher level of health care system, in which {{patients}} from primary health care are referred for more specialized treatments. <b>Secondary</b> health <b>care</b> level includes medical services provided by a specialist or more advanced facilities, upon referral from a primary care physician that requires more specialized knowledge, skill or equipment than the primary care physician.Secondary prevention programs identify and treat [...] asymptomatic people, who have already been exposed to different risk factors or have any pre-clinical diseases, without any clinical symptom. These activities are focused on early screening of asymptomatic patients, that are prone to develop the disease without any possible prevention or treatment. Screening tests are an example of secondary prevention activities, since they are performed even on patients who did not manifest any clinical symptoms of diseases, such as: hyperlipidemia, hypertension, breast, prostate cancer and many others. <b>Secondary</b> health <b>care</b> is offered by regional hospitals in municipalities such as Mitrovica, Peje, Gjakove, Prizren and Gjilan.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: There is a {{high level}} of over-referral from primary eye care leading to {{significant}} numbers of people without ocular pathology (false positives) being referred to <b>secondary</b> eye <b>care.</b> The present study used a psychometric instrument to determine whether there is a psychological burden on patients due to referral to <b>secondary</b> eye <b>care,</b> and used Rasch analysis to convert the data from an ordinal to an interval scale. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: 322 participants and 80 control participants. METHODS: State (i. e. current) and trait (i. e. propensity to) anxiety were measured in a group of patients referred to a hospital eye department in the UK and in a control group who have had a sight test but were not referred. Response category analysis plus infit and outfit Rasch statistics and person separation indices were used to determine the usefulness of individual items and the response categories. Principal components analysis was used to determine dimensionality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Levels of state and trait anxiety measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. RESULTS: State anxiety scores were significantly higher in the patients referred to <b>secondary</b> eye <b>care</b> than the controls (p 0. 1). Rasch analysis highlighted that the questionnaire results needed to be split into "anxiety-absent" and "anxiety-present" items for both state and trait anxiety, but both subscales showed the same profile of results between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: State anxiety was shown to be higher in patients referred to <b>secondary</b> eye <b>care</b> than the controls, and at similar levels to people with moderate to high perceived susceptibility to breast cancer. This suggests that referral from primary to <b>secondary</b> eye <b>care</b> can result in a significant psychological burden on some patients...|$|R

2500|$|The {{healthcare}} system receives funding from two sources. Municipal financing {{is based on}} taxes and is used to provide primary healthcare services. [...] They also {{have a right to}} collect user fees, and receive state subsidies if their tax levy is not adequate for providing the public services required, based on the demographic factors on their area. Municipalities fund the health centers on the primary care level and regional hospitals on <b>secondary</b> <b>care</b> level. As municipalities are both the providers and purchasers of the health services it does not encourage for cost-efficiency. National Health Insurance (NHI) is based on compulsory fees and it is used to fund private healthcare, occupational healthcare, outpatient drugs and sickness allowance. Regional and university hospitals are financed by federations of participating municipalities, often using the diagnosis-related group system.|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{research}} was conducted to investigate the utilization of visual inspection with acetic-acid (VIA) in cervical cancer screening among health workers in <b>secondary</b> health <b>care</b> institutions of Kaduna-state. Settings and Design: An Ex-post facto design {{was used for the}} study. The study population comprises all nurses, midwives, and nurse-midwives working in all the secondary healthcare institutions of Kaduna-state. The sample size used for the study was 300 using the Yamane, (1967) sample size selection formula. Subjects and Methods: The technique involved were stratified sampling method whereby the three existing senatorial zones served as strata. Each of the stratums was clustered according to the existing local government areas. A purposive sampling was further used to select nine local governments, three from each senatorial zone that have <b>secondary</b> health <b>care</b> institutions. A proportionate sampling was used at the various selected <b>secondary</b> health <b>care</b> institutions to distribute the questionnaire to the health workers based on their total number. The instruments used for data collection were the four-point level likert scale questionnaire, which was structured. 300 questionnaire copies were administered out of which (297) were retrieved. Statistical Analysis Used: The data collected were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and two sample t-test at 0. 05 level of confidence to answer the hypothesis. Significant difference exist in the demographic variables of age-group, sex, professional category, years of working experience and <b>secondary</b> health <b>care</b> institutions) in the utilization of VIA among health workers in <b>secondary</b> health <b>care</b> institutions of Kaduna-state (P < 0. 05). A post-hoc Scheffe test was further used to determine where the differences were. Results: However, the overall results reveals that health workers in secondary healthcare institutions of Kaduna-state are not utilizing VIA in cervical cancer screening with an aggregate mean score of (2. 1625) and (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: It was concluded that health workers in <b>secondary</b> health <b>care</b> institutions of Kaduna-state are not utilizing VIA to screen for cervical cancer. It is therefore recommended that specialist VIA units should be created in the hospitals specifically for VIA screening services; this {{will go a long way}} in utilizing VIA to screen for cervical cancer by the health workers thereby reducing the high incidence of the disease...|$|R

Instead of the non-directive symptomatic medical treatment that currently exists, clear guidelines and criteria need to be formulated for specific medical conditions such as damage to bronchial tubes, sleep apnea, neuron destruction, etc. Such an effort could be implemented through India's existing health care pyramid.

60|$|A {{familiar}} incident may elucidate this {{contrast in}} {{the operations of}} nature, may render plain {{the manner in which}} a process of intellectual improvements, the reverse of that which nature pursues, is by reason introduced. There never perhaps existed a school-boy, who, having, when he retired to rest, carelessly blown out his candle, and having chanced to notice, as he lay upon his bed in the ensuing darkness, the sullen light which had survived the extinguished flame, did not, at some time or other, watch that light as if his mind were bound to it by a spell. It fades and revives, gathers to a point, seems as if it would go out in a moment, again recovers its strength, nay becomes brighter than before: it continues to shine with an endurance, which in its apparent weakness is a mystery; it protracts its existence so long, clinging to the power which supports it, that the observer, who had lain down in his bed so easy-minded, becomes sad and melancholy; his sympathies are touched; it is to him an intimation and an image of departing human life; the thought comes nearer to him; it is the life of a venerated parent, of a beloved brother or sister, or of an aged domestic, who are gone to the grave, or whose destiny it soon may be thus to linger, thus to hang upon the last point of mortal existence, thus finally to depart and be seen no more. This is nature teaching seriously and sweetly through the affections, melting the heart, and, through that instinct of tenderness, developing the understanding. In this instance the object of solicitude is the bodily life of another. Let us accompany this same boy to that period between youth and manhood, when a solicitude may be awakened for the moral life of himself. Are there any powers by which, beginning with a sense of inward decay that affects not however the natural life, he could call to mind the same image and hang over it with an equal interest as a visible type of his own perishing spirit? Oh! surely, if the being of the individual be under his own care, if it be his first care, if duty begin from the point of accountableness to our conscience and, through that, to God and human nature; if without such primary sense of duty, all <b>secondary</b> <b>care</b> of teacher, of friend, or parent, must be baseless and fruitless; if, lastly, the motions of the soul transcend in worth those of the animal functions, nay, give to them their sole value; then truly are there such powers; and the image of the dying taper may be recalled and contemplated, though with no sadness in the nerves, no disposition to tears, no unconquerable sighs, yet with a melancholy in the soul, a sinking inward into ourselves from thought to thought, a steady remonstrance, and a high resolve. Let then the youth go back, as occasion will permit, to nature and to solitude, thus admonished by reason, and relying upon this newly acquired support. A world of fresh sensations will gradually open upon him as his mind puts off its infirmities, and as instead of being propelled restlessly towards others in admiration, or too hasty love, he makes it his prime business to understand himself. New sensations, I affirm, will be opened out, pure, and sanctioned by that reason which is their original author; and precious feelings of disinterested, that is self-disregarding, joy and love may be regenerated and restored; and, in this sense, he may be said to measure back the track of life he has trodden.|$|E
