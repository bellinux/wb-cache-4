5000|$|Jojoba oil [...] is {{the liquid}} {{produced}} in the seed of the <b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis</b> (Jojoba) plant, a shrub, which is native to southern Arizona, southern California, and northwestern Mexico. The oil makes up approximately 50% of the jojoba seed by weight. The terms [...] "jojoba oil" [...] and [...] "jojoba wax" [...] are often used interchangeably because the wax visually {{appears to be a}} mobile oil, but as a wax it is composed almost entirely (~97%) of mono-esters of long-chain fatty acids and alcohols, accompanied by {{only a tiny fraction of}} triglyceride esters. This composition accounts for its extreme shelf-life stability and extraordinary resistance to high temperatures, compared with true vegetable oils.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the effect of 70 % ethanol extract of <b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis</b> seeds on lipid profile in rabbits. Material and methods: The plant extract was orally administered to the atherogenic rabbits (atherogenic diet + cholesterol powder supplement at 400 mg/kg/body weight / day dissolved in 5 mL coconut oil) at dose of 500 mg/kg body weight/day. During the hall period of the experiment blood samples were collected and serum was analyzed for lipid profile. At the end of the experiment the animals were sacrificed; the heart and the liver were collected and stored at- 20 °C until assayed. Biochemical analysis of blood serum and tissue (liver and heart muscle) were performed for cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides. In addition blood serum was analyzed further for HDLcholesterol. Results: All the results were by administration of <b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis</b> seeds. Serum cholesterol levels dropped from 957. 57 to 223. 3 and further to 143. 4 {{by the end of the}} experiment. Similarly, phospholipids statistically analyzed using student’s t-test. Hypolipidaemic nature of <b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis</b> extract was studied in hyperlipidaemic rabbits. The increased cholesterol levels were brought to normal and triglycerides levels were reduced. The tissues lipids profiles of liver and heart muscle showed similar changes in those noticed in serum lipids. Conclusion: We can conclude from these results that a <b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis</b> seed possesses active hypolipidaemic constituents. The results suggest the validity of <b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis</b> seeds clinical use in hypolipidaemic control, after their toxicological investigation.

40|$|Very long chain primary {{alcohols}} {{are significant}} components in cuticle waxes of plants. Fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FARs) catalyze {{the formation of}} a fatty alcohol from an acyl-CoA. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome contains eight genes homologous to FAR genes from jojoba (<b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis),</b> silk moth, wheat and mouse. Expression of six Arabidopsis FAR homologs in Escherichia coli resulted in production of alcohols from endogenous E. coli fatty acids by five of these genes, confirming that they encode for FAR enzymes. Only a truncated splicing version of the sixth gene was found, and this gene yielded a protein with no FAR activity. The five functional FAR enzymes yielded distinctly different compositions of fatty alcohols when expressed in E. coli, indicating that the different enzymes may be involved in the production of different types of alcohols in plant cells.

40|$|Simmondsin, a {{glycoside}} {{extracted from}} jojoba meal (<b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis),</b> causes {{a reduction in}} food intake after oral administration. To investigate the mechanism by which simmondsin reduces food intake, fasted and free-feeding rats were given simmondsin-supplemented food and simultaneously injected with devazepide, a specific antagonist of peripheral-type cholecystokinin receptors (CCKA receptors). In free-feeding rats, supplementation of food with 0. 5 % simmondsin caused a reduction in food intake of +/- 40 % {{in the period of}} 4 h following food presentation. Intraperitoneal injection of 100 micrograms devazepide/kg body weight prevented this effect. In rats fasted for 20 h, the food intake in the 30 min after presentation of food supplemented with 0. 15 % or 0. 50 % simmondsin was reduced in a dose-related manner; this was also inhibited by simultaneous application of devazepide. It is suggested that peripheral CCKA receptors are involved in the effect of simmondsin on food intake.

40|$|Simmondsin, a {{glycoside}} {{extracted from}} jojoba meal (<b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis),</b> causes {{a reduction in}} food intake after oral administration. To investigate whether a moderate dose of simmondsin, inducing a food intake reduction of about 25 %, has transient or permanent detrimental effects on hematological and pathological parameters in rats, the following study was conducted. Rats treated with simmondsin (0. 25 % mixed in the food) were compared to the appropriate control- and pair-fed rats. After 10 weeks, 50 % of the rats receiving simmondsin or pair-Fed to simmondsin treated rats were changed to a control diet ad libitum, the other 50 % remained on the simmondsin or pair-fed treatment until week 20. Growth, food intake, hematological and some pathological parameters were determined. From this study it could be concluded that simmondsin treatment induced a transient increase in organ weights compared to pair-fed rats, and a slight macrocytic, normochromic anemia, that also recovered completely after withdrawal of simmondsin. However, the conducted study did not reveal any microscopic or biochemical sign of toxicity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Jojoba (<b>Simmondsia</b> <b>chinensis,</b> Link) is {{the only}} plant known that synthesizes liquid wax. The final step in liquid wax {{biosynthesis}} is catalyzed by an integral membrane enzyme, fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) :fatty alcohol acyltransferase, which transfers an acyl chain from acyl-CoA to a fatty alcohol to form the wax ester. To purify the acyltransferase, we have labeled the enzyme with a radioiodinated, photoreactive analog of acyl-CoA, 12 -[N-(4 -azidosalicyl) amino] dodecanoyl-CoA (ASD-CoA). This molecule acts as an inhibitor of acyltransferase activity {{in the dark and}} as an irreversible inhibitor upon exposure to ultraviolet light. Oleoyl-CoA protects enzymatic activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Photolysis of microsomal membranes with labeled ASD-CoA resulted in strong labeling of two polypeptides of 57 and 52 kD. Increasing concentrations of oleoyl-CoA reduced the labeling of the 57 -kD polypeptide dramatically, whereas the labeling of the 52 -kD polypeptide was much less responsive to oleoyl-CoA. Also, unlike the other polypeptide, the labeling of the 57 -kD polypeptide was enhanced considerably when photolyzed in the presence of dodecanol. These results suggest that a 57 -kD polypeptide from jojoba microsomes may be the acyl-CoA:fatty alcohol acyltransferase...|$|E
