5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made {{with peanut butter}} and marshmallow fluff usually served on white bread.

5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's <b>salty</b> ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12. The high pH is interpreted to be {{a consequence of}} serpentinization of chondritic rock {{that leads to the}} generation of H2, a geochemical source of energy that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected in Enceladus's plumes.|$|E

5|$|Jibneh Arabieh or jibneh baida is a {{white table}} cheese served {{with any of the}} above dishes. Ackawi cheese is a common {{variation}} of jibneh baida. Ackawi cheese has a smoother texture and a mild <b>salty</b> taste. Labaneh is a pasty yogurt-like cream cheese either served on a plate with olive oil and za'atar—which is generally called labaneh wa za'atar—or in a khubz sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Mono Lake {{itself has}} {{its own set of}} activities, {{including}} walking tours among towers of tufa, boat tours of the lake, and birdwatching opportunities. The lake is too <b>salty</b> to support any fish, but fishing is possible in streams that feed Mono Lake. Additional activities include hiking around and on the craters and domes, and mountain biking outside of the Scenic Area boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Potassium can be {{detected}} by taste because it triggers {{three of the five}} types of taste sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also <b>salty</b> to the taste. The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.|$|E

5|$|Angels {{on horseback}} {{can be served}} a hors d'œuvre, as a canapé, or as a savoury. Angels on horseback are canapés when served with breads. In England, they are {{traditionally}} served as savouries; <b>salty</b> or savoury items served after the dessert meant to cleanse the palate before the serving of digestifs. One cookbook including angels on horseback as a savoury is the 1905 Savouries Simplified, by Constance Peel.|$|E
5|$|Bacon: A Love Story, A <b>Salty</b> Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat is a 2009 non-fiction {{book about}} bacon, written by American writer Heather Lauer. Lauer started the blog Bacon Unwrapped {{and a social}} {{networking}} site about bacon in 2005, after the idea came to her while she was out drinking with her two brothers; her online success inspired her to write the book, which describes curing and cooking bacon, gives over 20 bacon recipes, and analyzes the impact of bacon on popular culture. The text is interspersed with facts about bacon and bacon-related quips from comedian Jim Gaffigan.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the Aswan High Dam {{across the}} Nile River in the 1960s {{has reduced the}} flow of {{freshwater}} and silt into the Levantine Sea. This made the sea relatively <b>saltier</b> and nutrient-poor than previously, {{which led to the}} collapse of historically important sardine fisheries, and has given an additional advantage to Red Sea species, who are adapted to the <b>saltier</b> and nutrient-poor Red Sea.|$|R
50|$|The two parent water parcels {{may have}} the same density, but they have {{different}} properties; for instance, different salinities and temperatures. Seawater almost always gets more dense if it gets either slightly colder or slightly <b>saltier.</b> But medium-warm, medium-salty water can be denser than both fresher, colder water and <b>saltier,</b> warmer water; in other words, the equation of state for seawater is monotonic, but non-linear. See diagram.|$|R

(Cardona was not involved in the show's production; however, he was credited as creator of the model footage.) ...|$|R
5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect <b>salty,</b> sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but {{this has not been}} well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E
5|$|Erythranthe species tend to {{concentrate}} sodium chloride and other salts absorbed from the soils {{in which they}} grow in their leaves and stem tissues. Native Americans and early travelers in the American West used this plant as a salt substitute to season wild game. The entire plant is edible, but reported to be very <b>salty</b> and bitter unless well cooked. The juice from the leaves {{was used as a}} poultice for mild skin irritations and burns. Leaves can be used in salads and soups; flowers taste best before blooming. E. lutea has been used for cooking in Peru.|$|E
5|$|In Judaism, it is {{recommended}} to have either a <b>salty</b> bread or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat. It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to dip the bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the Kiddush. To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt.|$|E
5000|$|In the Ayeyarwady and Tanintharyi divisions, the {{majority}} of ngapi is produced from freshwater fish. Ngapi usually contain a lot of added salt. This form of ngapi is more widely available in Myanmar and the Burmese population is more accustomed to the <b>saltier</b> ngapi than the Rakhine version. The ngapi from Myeik is very well known and is <b>saltier</b> than those from the region.|$|R

50|$|Oceanographically, the Laguna Madre is {{considered}} a hypersaline lagoon; this indicates that it is usually much <b>saltier</b> than the ocean, due to being nearly landlocked in a semiarid environment This is because its salinity can vary wildly depending on rainfall and freshwater inflow, from as high as 120 ppt (12%) - over three times <b>saltier</b> than the ocean - to as low as 2 ppt (0.2%) after a heavy rain.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} {{communities were}} unable to access produce {{that the majority of}} Britain would such as peppers or aubergines. Artisan Welsh produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and Welsh wine was of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical Welsh foods were going through a revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, Welsh organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear in supermarkets. Other modern Welsh characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering <b>salty</b> butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a {{small lake}} that {{was observed in}} Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely <b>salty,</b> and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.|$|E
5|$|The icy Galilean moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, all {{generate}} induced magnetic {{moments in}} response to changes in Jupiter's magnetic field. These varying magnetic moments create dipole magnetic fields around them, which act to compensate {{for changes in the}} ambient field. The induction is thought to take place in subsurface layers of <b>salty</b> water, which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter's large icy moons. These underground oceans can potentially harbor life, and evidence for their presence {{was one of the most}} important discoveries made in the 1990s by spacecraft.|$|E
