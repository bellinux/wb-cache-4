40|$|A static {{field study}} was conducted, both {{during the day}} and at night, to examine the effect that color {{contrast}} within a <b>safety</b> <b>vest</b> has on noticeability. Fluorescent orange and yellow fabrics were matched with orange, yellow, silver, or white retroreflective trim to appear similar to a <b>safety</b> <b>vest.</b> The method of paired comparisons was used to develop a linear scale of how noticeable the various color combinations appeared under cluttered and uncluttered viewing conditions. The results indicate that color contrast within the <b>safety</b> <b>vest,</b> as well as relative to the environmental surround, affects judgments of noticeability. However, in the nighttime condition color contrast was not an identifiable attribute, as all the retroreflective materials used appeared white when illuminated. In the nighttime condition, the luminance of the retroreflective trim accounted for almost all {{of the variance in the}} noticeability judgments. The results of this study suggest that a design for safety apparel that includes a combination of fluorescent yellow and fluorescent orange fabrics (providing color contrast for the daytime) with silver/white micro-prismatic retroreflective trim (proving high luminance for nighttime) is likely to be the most noticeable combination in both daytime and nighttime conditions...|$|R

40|$|Heat related {{illness is}} a serious health concern for {{construction}} workers in tropical climates or those working under hot and humid environmental conditions. It can cause damage to body organs and the nervous system resulting in permanent disability or even death. Development of systems for construction workers to detect and alert temperature-warning signs early is a timely and strategic need.

A test pedestrian wearing different configurations of retroreflective markings was positioned on the left shoulder of an unilluminated two-lane roadway.

50|$|As well as {{the obvious}} danger of heat, firefighters are exposed to toxic fumes, sharp objects, uneven ground, {{slippery}} surfaces, biological fluids, spilt chemicals and electricity.

40|$|A virtual {{human body}} model (HBM), {{developed}} for vehicle crash simulations, {{was used to}} conduct a pilot study of dangerous accidents that occur in equestrian sports. It was performed to illustrate the potential that the explicit finite element (FE) HBMs have to improve rider safety and to assess the protective capacity of the <b>safety</b> <b>vest.</b> Four different questions were addressed: 1. When a rider is trampled by a horse, how does the risk of injury vary with chest impact location? 2. Does a safety-vest provide protection if the rider is kicked by a horse and does the protection vary with {{the violence of the}} hoof impact? 3. Can a safety-vest provide any benefit when the rider is hit by the horse after a rotational fall? 4. How does the risk for thoracic injuries vary when the rider falls off the back of a horse at different angles? The HBM was the Total Human Model for Safety AM 50 version 3. 0 (Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan), improved for thorax injury predictability in a previous automotive project. The FE code was LS-DYNA (Livermore Software Technology Corporation, USA). Models of a generic <b>safety</b> <b>vest,</b> a horse impactor and a hoof were developed as part of this project. The risk of thorax injury was evaluated with stresses and strains measured for each rib, and the chest deformation criteria Dmax and DcTHOR. 1. The risk of injury was higher for hoof impacts close to the sternum compared to more lateral locations that had up to 25 % less risk. Hence, this knowledge could be used to optimize novel safety-vest designs with HBM simulations. 2. Yes, the safety-vest provided protection against horse kicks, and it varied with the violence of the kick. Therefore, if the range of impact energy that occurs in real-world accidents is known, HBM simulations can be used to optimize the vest material properties. 3. No, the safety-vest did not provide any benefit when the horse lands on top of the rider. This conclusion suggests that safety measures should focus on preventing this type of accident, rather than designing personal protection for the rider. 4. When the rider falls with the head first, the number of predicted rib fractures increases compared to flat falls. However, the model predicts rib fractures for all of the falls simulated from a height of 1. 5 meters for a rider without a <b>safety</b> <b>vest.</b> To conclude, FE HBMs have the potential to improve equestrian safety and further studies on equestrian safety-vests designs are warranted.
