60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quickly; then shrugged her {{shoulders}} again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> a second, then laughed, {{a thought}} unpleasantly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> doubting her senses, her pupils {{wide with}} terror.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> blankly <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> without replying, {{and they}} silently {{made their way}} to Mr. Gerald's carriage.|$|R
6000|$|... "His future father-in-law?" [...] said <b>she,</b> and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> round-eyed, with parted lips. Then added: [...] "M. d'Ogeron? The Governor of Tortuga?" ...|$|R
50|$|Rain {{takes place}} in a town loosely {{inspired}} by mid-twentieth century Paris, and follows a young boy. In the opening of the game, he is stuck in bed at home with a fever. During the day he stares out of his window and sees an invisible girl in the rain who is given form by the rain casting a silhouette around her. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for a brief second before being chased away by something huge and menacing that is also invisible unless the rain gives it a form.|$|R
60|$|A moment <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> bewildered. He {{was very}} disconcerting. Then she recovered.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with an ashen {{face and}} gulped twice {{before she could}} speak.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> hopelessly, {{and then she}} {{buried her face in}} her hands.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> {{stopped and}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with hands clenched, her eyes haggard with despair.|$|R
60|$|She {{caught the}} irony now more plainly in his voice. <b>She</b> {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> still <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for a moment, {{and then}} with a queer gesture turned round with her back to him, {{shutting}} the gate as she did so, and seemed to be looking down the valley towards the church tower.|$|R
60|$|She started, <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{distended}} eyes, and {{her small}} mouth was {{open like a}} ring.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> blankly, {{and with}} that vague {{expression}} of puzzlement which irritated whilst it half-frightened him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in silence. The two white-lit faces {{examined}} each other. Both she and Benham were trembling.|$|E
60|$|But the jest evoked no {{response}} from her. <b>She</b> continued to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with those eager yet timid eyes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the next}} scene, Su-ho and his classmates are {{singing in a}} music class, when he notices his classmate Su-eun staring <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> His friend says <b>she</b> always <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in class, and Su-ho starts to think she might be {{interested}} in him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mouse dear!" [...] Istra plumped {{down on a}} trunk in the {{confused}} billows of incoming baggage, customs officials, and indignant passengers that surged about them on the rough floor of the vast dock-house. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with real sorrow in her fine eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{cried out}} at that, and {{clutched}} her breast whose calm was suddenly disturbed. Her eyes dilated as <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{a moment}} with the perplexity she had shown at times on the night he visited her, and went out...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{for a few}} minutes, {{as though}} seeking to read some deeper meaning into his words. Then she turned {{abruptly}} away.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} that--that owoble suit is o'dina'y clothes!" [...] <b>she</b> said, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and {{gave way to}} tears of real tenderness.|$|R
60|$|The {{smile with}} which she had been {{greeting}} him withered on her lips. <b>She</b> frowned and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> a moment, with increasing haughtiness.|$|R
50|$|At {{the police}} station, Sgt. Rubin uncovers a file on Victoria's past and determines {{she has been}} living in the Engels home after being taken out of the {{psychiatrist}} hospital; he and Lt. McGiver promptly leave to go to the boarding house. Meanwhile, with Scotty bound and gagged in a closet, Mrs. Engels attempts to console the childlike Victoria. Mason obtains a gun from his bedroom and returns to the attic, attempting to kill Victoria. In a struggle, he inadvertently shoots Mrs. Engels through the chest, killing her. With his back turned, Victoria approaches Mason. He turns around, and <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> blankly, moving closer with a knife. Cornered against a window, he shoots her, and then shoots himself in the head.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{breathing}} heavily, {{then looked}} {{out of the window}} again. At last she turned to him. She seemed to refer to his invitation.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice, for {{of course}} it was <b>she,</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in amazement. So this was the mysterious sailor about whom there had been so much talk in Bryngelly.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{the joy of}} festival {{drained from}} her face. [...] "Do I bother you when we go on vacations? Don't I add {{anything}} to your fun?" ...|$|E
60|$|She did not understand, and so <b>she</b> {{could only}} <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with those round, brown eyes of hers dilating, her lovely cheeks {{blanching}} with horrid fear.|$|R
6000|$|Josie sat down, {{her heart}} {{bounding}} with joy. If he mistook {{her for a}} thief all was not lost {{and she would not}} have to write [...] "finis" [...] as yet to this important case. But she made no answer to his remark; <b>she</b> merely <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in a dull, emotionless way that was cleverly assumed.|$|R
60|$|Derek {{had come}} closer; {{he put his}} hand down and gripped her arm. Her eloquence dried up before the intentness of his face, and <b>she</b> just <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Now that he {{had made}} the {{suggestion}} he was sick with anguish, and yet the torture of it gave him a strange, subtle sensation. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with open eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{but when}} {{he gave her a}} shove she {{realized}} what he was saying, and made such a spurt as had never before been seen in that dooryard.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's-stealing-ain't it?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{bewildered by}} his {{reckless}} lightness of mood.- [...] "It is now, because I've lost. If I'd'a won it, it 'ud 'a' been financial shrewdness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Laurie bent, {{and whispered}} three words in Jo's ear, which {{produced}} a comical change. <b>She</b> stood and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for a minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, [...] "How do you know?" ...|$|R
60|$|But here {{occurred}} {{what he had}} dreaded {{most and}} probably thought he had escaped. <b>She</b> had <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>at</b> the stewardess, at the walls, with abstracted, vacant, and bewildered, but always undimmed and unmoistened eyes. A sudden convulsion shook her whole frame, her blank expression broke like a shattered mirror, she threw {{her hands over her}} eyes and fell forward with her face {{to the back of her}} chair in an outburst of tears.|$|R
50|$|As {{it begins}} to rain, Mayumi {{looks up at the}} sky. A young boy looks at her in horror. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for a moment before going after him with an {{abnormally}} crazed face. The left side of her face slit {{all the way up to}} her ear. After the movie's ending, it is revealed that Mayumi has killed 13 people and injured 53, and has disappeared.|$|R
