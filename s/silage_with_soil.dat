It encourages the researchers to evaluate the condition of ensilage process of Pennisetum purpureum by studying atmosphere modification in the silo and the effect of the usage of various additives in the process of silage production. Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), molasses, L. acidophillus were used. The study was conducted with a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) 3 x 2 factorial pattern. Atmosphere modification as the first factor consist of: (A 0 : <b>silage</b> <b>with</b> compaction (conventional) A 1 : <b>silage</b> <b>with</b> vacuum method, A 2 : <b>silage</b> <b>with</b> modified C 02) and two kinds of silage additives as the second factor (B 1 : indirect additive (molasses); B 2 : direct additive (Lactic Acid Bacteria).

Foram utilizados 12 borregos Santa Inês (49 ± 3 kg) distribuídos em um delineamento {{experimental}} de blocos completos casualizados. As rações foram compostas por 50 % de volumoso e 50 % de concentrado na MS, sendo os quatro tratamentos experimentais: a) cana-de-açúcar in natura (CC), b) silagem de cana-de-açúcar tratada com L. buchneri (SAD), c) silagem de cana-de-açúcar tratada com 1, 0 % de uréia (U 1, 0) e d) silagem de cana-de-açúcar tratada com 1, 5 % de uréia (U 1, 5). O coeficiente de digestibilidade da FDN foi menor (p 0, 05) para as variáveis avaliadas. A ensilagem da cana-de-açúcar melhora a digestibilidade da FDN. Ensiling {{of sugar}} cane {{may contribute to}} improve operational efficiency at farm level.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of feeding Atriplex halimus (AH) <b>silage</b> treated <b>with</b> two {{developed}} enzyme cocktails to sheep on feed intake, nutrient digestibility and ruminal fermentation. The AH silage was treated without or with 2 L of ZAD 1 ® or ZAD 2 ®/ 1000 kg with 5 % molasses and ensiled for 30 days. Barley grain (300 g/head/day) was fed as an energy supplement once daily at 10. 00 hours and AH <b>silage</b> <b>with</b> or without enzyme treatment was offered ad libitum to animals twice daily at 09. 00 and 16. 00 hours. Sheep were fed on four experimental forage diets comprised of AH silage and barley (D 1), AH <b>silage</b> treated <b>with</b> ZAD 1 ® and barley (D 2), AH <b>silage</b> treated <b>with</b> ZAD 2 ® and barley (D 3) and AH <b>silage</b> treated <b>with</b> a combination of ZAD 1 ® and ZAD 2 ® (1 : 1) and barley (D 4). Ensiling AH with enzymes reduced its contents of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber. The dry matter intake of AH of D 2, D 3 and D 4 decreased (P < 0. 001) as compared to D 1. However, enzyme-treated diets had greater total digestible nutrients intake (P < 0. 001) as compared to D 1. The nutrients digestibility for D 2, D 3 and D 4 were higher than those for D 1 (P < 0. 001), and were higher for D 3 as compared to both D 2 and D 4. Sheep fed on D 3 had highest (P < 0. 001) ruminal total volatile fatty acids concentration, ammonia nitrogen concentration and microbial protein yield.

40|$|There {{are large}} {{variations}} in α-tocopherol (vitamin E) and β-carotene (pro-vitamin A) concentrations in forages. α-Tocopherol and β-carotene are antioxidants and {{important for the}} health and fertility of cows. This thesis investigated the effects of site, year, forage species, cutting date, wilting and ensiling technique on α-tocopherol and β-carotene concentrations in forage. Utilisation of vitamins E and A in dairy cows was also studied. Different grass-legume mixtures of the forage species birdsfoot trefoil, red clover, timothy and meadow fescue were sown at two sites in Sweden; Skara {{in the south and}} Umeå in the north. The mixtures were harvested at three occasions in the spring growth. At an additional site in Denmark, perennial ryegrass was used instead of meadow fescue. White clover was also included in Denmark and forages were harvested in a four-cut system. Vitamin analysis was performed on forage species from all mixtures and cutting dates. <b>Silages</b> treated <b>with</b> acid or bacterial inoculant were compared to untreated silages from a regrowth of forage mixtures in Skara. Dairy cows were offered a high daily dose of esterified natural vitamin E during the transition period (E) and were compared to cows without supplementation (C). Concentrations of α-tocopherol, β-carotene and retinol were measured in the blood and milk during lactation. Forages grown at Skara generally had higher vitamin concentrations than forages grown at Umeå. Differences between years were smaller. Birdsfoot trefoil generally had higher vitamin concentrations than red clover, whereas differences between grasses were more inconsistent. Cutting date had less effect at Umeå than Skara, irrespective of leaf blade proportion and developmental stage. In Denmark, numerical differences indicate that vitamin concentrations were higher in the fourth harvest than in earlier harvests, which was possibly a seasonal effect. The α-tocopherol concentration in the mixture with birdsfoot trefoil increased during ensiling and was higher in <b>silages</b> <b>with</b> birdsfoot trefoil than in <b>silages</b> <b>with</b> red clover. Inoculant-treated <b>silage</b> <b>with</b> red clover had higher α-tocopherol content than untreated <b>silage</b> <b>with</b> red clover. The E cows had higher concentrations of α-tocopherol in the blood than the C cows, when the supplement was offered. No effects of treatment on vitamin concentrations in blood were found later in the lactation. Treatment effects on vitamin concentrations in milk were affected by the vitamin concentration of the forage...|$|R

The ensiling characteristics were determined by ensiling Napier grass silages in airtight plastic pouches for 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 45 d. The effect of Napier grass <b>silages</b> treated <b>with</b> these additives on voluntary feed intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation and microbial rumen fermentation was determined in 4 fistulated cows using 4 × 4 Latin square design. The pH value of the treated silages rapidly decreased, and reached to the lowest value within 7 d of the start of fermentation, {{as compared to the}} control. Lactic acid content of <b>silages</b> treated <b>with</b> FJLB was stable at 14 d of fermentation and constant until 45 d of ensiling. At 45 d of ensiling, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of <b>silage</b> treated <b>with</b> cassava meal were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than the others.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the supply of wet brewers grain <b>silage</b> <b>with</b> and without nutrient additives in ensiling (wheat bran, soybeans hulls and ground corn), and the effect of additives on the intake and digestibility of dry matter and nutrients as well as the efficiency, production and milk composition of Holstein cows. Four multiparous Holstein cows were used, with an average milk production of 25 liters per day. The cows were randomly assigned, via the Latin Square design (4 x 4), to one of four experimental diets. The experimental period was 21 days. The results obtained in the experiment were evaluated by analysis of variance, Fisher’s F test and Tukey’s test at 5 % probability. The experimental diets consisted of wet brewers grain silage alone, and this <b>silage</b> <b>with</b> the addition of wheat bran, soybean hulls or ground corn. The diets did not affect the initial body weight of the animals. Diets containing wheat bran and ground corn provided a higher intake of dry matter (21. 78 and 21. 50 kg day- 1) and organic matter (20. 42 and 20. 22 kg day- 1) compared to the wet brewers grain silage alone and the diet containing soybean hulls. The results observed for dry matter (636. 96 and 632. 96 g kg- 1), organic matter (659. 16 and 654. 35 g kg- 1 DM), crude protein (712. 84 and 717. 79 g kg- 1 DM) and neutral detergent fiber (598. 99 and 538. 90 g kg- 1 DM) when cows were fed diets containing soybean hulls and ground corn, respectively, were higher than other diets. The different diets did not change daily milk production, milk production corrected for 3. 5 % fat or milk composition. The milk urea nitrogen from cows fed ground corn diets was a lower concentration (17. 67 mg dL- 1), however, it was still above the suitable range (10 to 14 mg dL- 1). Providing wet brewers grain <b>silage</b> <b>with</b> soybeans hulls or ground corn to Holstein cows increased the digestibility of dry matter and nutrients.
