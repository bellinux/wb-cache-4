500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{introduced}} the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which {{continued to be}} a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season.

During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, [...] "I think it's really funny how little game (Leslie) has with guys.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Office fansite [...] "OfficeTally", Celotta <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Lieberstein had only about one weekend to finish the script and distribute it to the actors, so there was little discussion about their individual volleyball abilities. Once the scripts were circulated, the writers learned that Jenna Fischer was {{not very good at}} volleyball and had trouble making certain motions with her arm over her head due to a previous injury. As a result, director Ken Kwapis arranged for stunt doubles to perform some of the volleyball moves; a handful of scenes were also shot with Pam doing an overhead motion with the ball being added later using computer-generated imagery. The opening credits were trimmed down to ten seconds and no post-credits scene was used {{in order to keep the}} episode within the network-mandated 21 minutes and 35 seconds. The producers considered making the episode an hour long like other season finales from past seasons, like [...] "The Job" [...] and [...] "Goodbye, Toby", but they found they did not have enough plot points to conclude in [...] "Company Picnic" [...] and would have had trouble filling a full hour.|$|E

According to Renfro, she and another American went to a drug house where Holloway supposedly was, bringing money, but found that Jug Twitty had already been to the area, spreading [...] "a lot of uproar and panic in the direct vicinity," [...] and nothing could be accomplished.

The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus.
