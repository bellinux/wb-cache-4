25|$|The Second Demographic Transition (SDT) is a {{conceptual}} framework first formulated in 1986 by Ron Lesthaeghe and Dirk van de Kaa in a <b>short</b> <b>article</b> that {{was published in the}} Dutch sociology journal Mens en Maatschappij. SDT addressed the changes in the patterns of sexual and reproductive behavior which occurred in North America and Western Europe in the period from about 1963, when the birth control pill and other cheap effective contraceptive methods such as the IUD were adopted by the general population, to the present. Combined with the sexual revolution and the increased role of women in society and the workforce the resulting changes have profoundly affected the demographics of industrialized countries resulting in a sub-replacement fertility level.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to this card, and with Douglas's avid support, but {{against the advice of}} friends such as Robbie Ross, Frank Harris, and George Bernard Shaw, Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal libel in a private prosecution; as sodomy was then a criminal offence. According to libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction only by demonstrating in court that the charge he had made was not only factually true, but that there was also some public interest in having made the charge publicly. Edward Carson, Queensberry's lawyer, therefore portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who habitually preyed upon naive young boys and seduced them into a life of homosexuality with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced into evidence; he claimed that they were works of art. Wilde was closely questioned about the homoerotic themes in The Picture of Dorian Gray and in The Chameleon, a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which he had contributed a <b>short</b> <b>article.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{existence}} of Chestnuts Long Barrow {{has been known}} since the 18th century. The earliest possible reference to the monuments {{was provided by the}} antiquarian John Harris in an ambiguous comment included in his History of Kent in Five Parts, published in 1719. In 1773, the site was described in print by the antiquarian Josiah Colebrooke in a <b>short</b> <b>article</b> that he wrote for Archaeologia, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London, in 1773. He described it as one of the [...] "temples of the antient [...] Britons". Colebrook's analysis was echoed in the 18th-century writings of Edward Hasted, W. H. Ireland, and John Thorpe.|$|E
500|$|In September of {{that same}} year, Holmes read a <b>short</b> <b>article</b> in the Boston Daily Advertiser about the renowned 18th century frigate USS Constitution, {{which was to be}} {{dismantled}} by the Navy. Holmes was moved to write [...] "Old Ironsides" [...] in opposition of the ship's scrapping. The patriotic poem was published in the Advertiser the very next day and was soon printed by papers in New York, Philadelphia and Washington. It not only brought the author immediate national attention, but the three-stanza poem also generated so much public sentiment that the historic ship was preserved, though plans to do so may have already been in motion.|$|E
500|$|Johan Ludvig Heiberg, a {{prominent}} Hegelian, at first criticized the aesthetic section, Either (Part I), {{then he had}} much better {{things to say about}} Or, Part II. Julie Watkin said [...] "Kierkegaard replied to Heiberg in The Fatherland as Victor Eremita, blaming Heiberg for not reading the preface to Either/Or which would have given him the key to the work." [...] Kierkegaard later used his book Prefaces to publicly respond to Heiberg and Hegelianism. Kierkegaard and William Godwin were very similar in their criticism of critics. He also published a <b>short</b> <b>article,</b> Who is the Author of Either/Or?, a week after the publication of Either/Or itself.|$|E

500|$|It {{was next}} {{recorded}} by the antiquarian Josiah Colebrooke in a <b>short</b> <b>article</b> that he wrote for Archaeologia, {{the journal of the}} Society of Antiquaries of London, in 1773. Aided by the minister of the parish, the Reverend Buttonshaw, Colebooke enquired among elderly locals as to whether they had heard of the oak tree mentioned by Harris, but none had. Colebrooke asserted that it was to the Addington area that the Britons retreated after their defeat at the Battle of Aylesford, and that it was here that they buried their military leader, Categern. However, the later archaeologist John H. Evans has claimed that Colebrooke's descriptions and drawings are [...] "almost completely worthless" [...] because the antiquarian incorrectly thought the monument to be a stone circle rather than a rectangular chambered tomb. Colebrook's analysis was echoed in the 18th-century writings of Samuel Pegge, Edward Hasted, and John Thorpe.|$|E
500|$|Little {{more was}} done {{until the late}} 20th century. In 1986 Federico Krutwig {{published}} a <b>short</b> <b>article</b> in the Revista Internacional de Estudios Vascos entitled [...] "Los gitanos vascos", with a short word list and a brief analysis of the language's morphology. However, the most detailed research to date {{was carried out by}} Basque philologist Josune Muñoz and historian Elias Lopez de Mungia, who began their work in the Southern Basque Country in 1996 {{at the behest of the}} Romani organisation Kalé Dor Kayiko, with support from the Euskaltzaindia and the University of the Basque Country. Kalé Dor Kayiko, who had been working to promote the Romani language, was alerted to the existence of Erromintxela in the 1990s through an article by the historian Alizia Stürtze, Agotak, juduak eta ijitoak Euskal Herrian [...] "Agotes, Jews, and Gypsies in the Basque Country". Kalé Dor Kayiko intends to continue research into the language, attitudes, identity, and history of the Erromintxela people in the less well researched provinces of Navarre and the Northern Basque Country.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Dickinson's {{behavior}} {{began to}} change. She {{did not leave}} the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors {{from the other side}} of a door rather than speaking to them face to face. She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878–1882. Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person. Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders. Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers. Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that [...] "Aunt Emily stood for indulgence." [...] MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a <b>short</b> <b>article</b> in 1891 called [...] "A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson", thought of her as always offering support to the neighborhood children.|$|E

500|$|Murray cod were {{originally}} {{the most common}} large native fish in the Murray-Darling basin. Contrary to some fishery department literature, the first serious declines in Murray cod were caused by extremely severe overfishing. In {{the latter half of}} the 1800s and the early 1900s, Murray cod — very large, very long-lived fish — were caught in unimaginable numbers by both commercial and recreational fishermen. For example, one commercial fishing operation commenced on the Murray River near Echuca in 1855, targeting Murray cod over hundreds of kilometres of river, and yet within eight years, grave concerns over the sustainability of this operation, and complaints about the near-absence of Murray cod in their heavily fished grounds, were being raised in the main state newspaper, The Argus. Yet, fishing effort continued to increase in the region, so in the late 1880s and early 1890s, between 40,000 and 150,000kg of mostly Murray cod (between 7,500 and 27,000 fish, at an average weight of 5.5kg) were caught near Echuca. Similarly, in 1883, more than 147,000kg of Murray cod were sent to Melbourne from just one river town (Moama). By the 1920s Murray cod had been overfished to the point where large-scale commercial fishing operations were no longer feasible. Recreational fishermen took similarly excessive hauls during this era, using rods and reels, handlines, setlines, drum nets, gill nets, and even explosives, with hauls often either wasted or illegally sold. Perhaps this extreme overfishing and its impacts of wild Murray cod stocks is best summarised by a <b>short</b> <b>article</b> in the Register News (a South Australian newspaper) in 1929: ...|$|E
