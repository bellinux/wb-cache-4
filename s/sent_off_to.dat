5|$|On 19 September, Confiance {{captured}} the Prize, from Calcutta, which had stored eight of her ten guns in her hold to improve her stability. Prize was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Mauritius {{on the next}} day with an 85-man prize crew. Surcouf then steered for Ganjam, where he captured three smaller ships.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{had three}} more {{children}} with Olivia. As money was now tight, Olivia insisted that her stepchildren {{put to work}} rather than receive schooling. The Colt brothers became attached to their one surviving sister, Sarah Ann, who acted as a surrogate mother of sorts, until she was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a relative's house {{to work as a}} menial. John was known to keep locks of hair belonging to her and Margaret all through his life.|$|E

5|$|When the {{battered}} fleet returned to Venice, {{news of the}} defeat spread throughout the city to mixed reactions. Though some were willing to forgive the defeat considering the circumstances, many others needed someone {{to blame for the}} loss that was considerable not only in human and material terms, but also symbolically. The people of Venice had been humiliated by an upstart nation with practically no naval experience. Though Guiscard would die the next year and the Norman threat would quickly disappear, a scapegoat was needed at that moment. A faction of influential Venetians, possibly led by Vitale Faliero based on later writings, led a popular revolt to depose Selvo, and in December 1084 they succeeded. Selvo apparently did not make a great effort to defend himself and was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a monastery. He died three years later in 1087, and was buried in the loggiato of St. Mark's Basilica.|$|E
5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> take Revenge as a prize.|$|E
5|$|The regime did {{not limit}} {{itself to a}} purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled {{prominent}} Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on Göring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary Herbert von Bose without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate Edgar Jung, the author of Papen's Marburg speech; they disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch. The Gestapo also murdered Erich Klausener, the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate. Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests {{that he could not}} be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticise the regime and was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Vienna as German ambassador.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{a poetic}} persona is often {{encountered}} in Classical Chinese poetry, in which the author writes a poem {{from the viewpoint of}} some other person (or type of person).

25|$|In 2008, Koch put {{the team}} up for sale, with an asking price of $10 million. No investors stepped up. The WNBA took over {{management}} of the Comets and disbanded the team in December 2008.

Comets players were <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> other teams in a dispersal draft.|$|E
25|$|Before being <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> road camps, {{sugar beet}} farms or prisoner-of-war camps, many Japanese-Canadian men and {{families}} were processed through Hastings Park in Vancouver, BC.

25|$|During World War I, {{with many}} players <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{war and the}} {{possibility}} of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organisation was run by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their membership.|$|E

25|$|Thus, in June 1826, Wilhelm's father felt {{forced to}} demand the {{renunciation}} of a potential marriage to Elisa. Wilhelm spent {{the next few months}} looking for a more suitable bride, but did not relinquish his emotional ties to Elisa. He was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the Weimar court to look for a suitable wife, where he wed Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, fourteen years his junior on 11 June 1829. This marriage would prove to be unhappy. Wilhelm saw his cousin, Elisabeth, for the last time in 1829. She died of tuberculosis five years later, unmarried.|$|E
