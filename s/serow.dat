5|$|Literacy on Nauru is 96percent. Education is {{compulsory}} {{for children}} {{from six to}} sixteen years old, and two more non-compulsory years are offered (years 11 and 12). There is a campus of the University of the South Pacific on Nauru. Before this campus was built in 1987, students would study either by distance or abroad. Since 2011, the University of New England, Australia has established a presence on the island with around 30 Nauruan teachers studying for an associate degree in education. These students will continue onto the degree to complete their studies. This project is led by Associate Professor Pep <b>Serow</b> and funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.|$|E

25|$|Tigers are carnivores. They prefer hunting large {{ungulates}} such as chital, sambar, gaur, and to {{a lesser}} extent also barasingha, water buffalo, nilgai, <b>serow</b> and takin. Among the medium-sized prey species they frequently kill wild boar, and occasionally hog deer, muntjac and grey langur. Small prey species such as porcupines, hares and peafowl form a very small part in their diet. Because of the encroachment of humans into their habitat, they also prey on domestic livestock.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife include Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephant, deer, bison, leopard, gaur, tiger, and crocodiles, {{as well as}} many bird species. Migratory birds come to {{the state}} during the winter. The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer, red panda, chinkara, takin, <b>serow,</b> pangolin, minivet and Kalij pheasants. The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project conserving the {{endangered}} Bengal tiger, although the forest hosts many other endangered species, such as the Gangetic dolphin, river terrapin and estuarine crocodile. The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal. Recognizing its special conservation value, Sundarban area has been declared as a Biosphere Reserve.|$|E

40|$|International audienceContagious {{dermatitis}} {{in domestic}} and wild ruminants caused by parapoxvirus (PPV) occurs worldwide. Although PPV infections appear in cattle, sheep and goats, the papular, nodular, pustular and ulcerated skin lesions of wild Japanese <b>serows</b> () are significantly {{more severe than}} those of other animals. To determine the factors involved in the severity of these skin lesions, we compared the molecular characteristics of 4 PPV isolates from Japanese <b>serows</b> and 2 isolates from sheep in Japan, and also investigated the biological properties of primary endothelial cells from different host species. All of the 6 Japanese isolates harbored a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene, which is {{known as one of}} the virulence factors of PPVs. Three different amino acid sequences of viral VEGF were identified and the sequence was identical among the 4 isolates from the Japanese <b>serows.</b> The temporal expression pattern of viral VEGF mRNA was almost the same among 3 isolates encoding the 3 different VEGFs in infected cells from different host species. Recombinant forms of the 3 different VEGFs showed the ability to induce vascular permeability and endothelial cell-proliferation. Primary endothelial cells from Japanese <b>serows</b> were most responsive to recombinant viral VEGF compared to cells from cattle, sheep, and goats. These results suggest that not only the biological activity of viral VEGF but also the high responsiveness to viral VEGF of endothelial cells might be involved in the severe proliferative skin lesions induced by PPV infection in Japanese <b>serows...</b>|$|R
25|$|Asian {{black bears}} are omnivorous, and will feed on insects, beetle larvae, invertebrates, termites, grubs, carrion, bees, eggs, garbage, mushrooms, grasses, fruits, nuts, seeds, honey, herbs, acorns, cherries, dogwood, and grain. Though herbivorous {{to a greater}} degree than brown bears, and more {{carnivorous}} than American black bears, Asian black bears are not as specialised in their diet as pandas are: while pandas depend on a constant supply of low calorie, yet abundant foodstuffs, black bears are more opportunistic and have opted for a nutritional boom-or-bust economy. They thus gorge themselves on a variety of seasonal high calorie foods, storing the excess calories as fat, and then hibernate during times of scarcity. Black bears will eat pine nuts and acorns of the previous year in the April–May period. In times of scarcity, they enter river valleys to gain access to hazelnuts and insect larvae in rotting logs. From mid-May through late June, they will supplement their diet with green vegetation and fruit. Through July to September, they will climb trees to eat bird cherries, pine cones, vines and grapes. On rare occasions they will eat dead fish during the spawning season, though this constitutes a much lesser portion of their diet than in brown bears. In the 1970s, black bears were reported to kill and eat Hanuman langurs in Nepal. They appear to be more carnivorous than most other bears, including American black bears, and will kill ungulates with some regularity, including domestic livestock. Wild ungulate prey can include muntjacs, <b>serow,</b> takin, wild boar and adult water buffaloes, which they kill by breaking their necks.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran <b>serow</b> in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E

The closest relative to the Japanese <b>Serow</b> is the Taiwan <b>serow</b> (Capricornis swinhoei).

(Filarioidea: Nematoda), {{found in}} {{subcutaneous}} tissues of 37 (33 %) of 112 <b>serows</b> (Naemorhedus crispus) examined in Japan, is described. The female worm had {{the characteristics of}} Loxodontofilaria, e. g., the large body size, well-developed esophagus with a shallow buccal cavity, and the long tail with three caudal lappets. The male worm of the new species, which was first described in the genus, had unequal length of spicules, 10 pairs of pre- and post-caudal papillae, and three terminal caudal lappets. Deirids were present in both sexes. Among four species of the genus Loxodontofilaria: one from the hippopotamus and three from the Elepantidae, L. caprini n. sp. appears close to L. asiatica Bain, Baker & Chabaud, 1982, a subcutaneous parasite of Elephas indicus in Myanmar (Burma). However, L. caprini n. sp. is distinct from L. asiatica in that the Japanese female worm has an esophagus half as long and the microfilariae also half as long with a coiled posterior. The microfilariae {{were found in the}} skin of <b>serows.</b> The new parasite appears to clearly illustrate a major event in the evolution of onchocercids: the host-switching.
