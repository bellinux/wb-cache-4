40|$|ABSTRACT – NHS ePortfolio is {{currently}} the standard assess-ment method used for most UK training programmes, from the Foundation Programme to core and specialty training years. This article discusses the terminology used in online assessments and gives a hands-on guide for trainees in how to successfully use ePortfolio. KEY WORDS: Foundation Programme, ePortfolio, trainees If you {{have been involved in}} any UK-based postgraduate medical training (as either a supervisor, an assessor or a trainee) over the past few years, you are likely to have had some experience with the NHS ePortfolio system. What began with a pilot programme in 2004 – 05 escalated to use by the vast majority of foundation trainees in 2007. 1 Its use is now standard throughout not only the foundation training programme in the UK but also the specialty training pro-grammes, including medical specialty training, general practitioner training and anaesthetic training. 2, 3 Despite ePortfolio’s widespread use, recent survey data from the Northern Deanery showed that a mere 25 % of foundation trainees thought that it was ‘a good idea’, while 81. 7 % of them felt it involved ‘excessive bureaucracy’. 4 Meanwhile, a cross-sectional survey of core medical trainees found that most (84 %) agreed that ongoing progress records of some sort was necessary but few (5 %) felt confident about ePortfolio’s value for money. 5 Whether or not you like online portfolio systems, ePortfolio <b>seems</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> as a tool for assessment and advancement. Most ePortfolios change on an annual to semi-annual basis to reflect both changes in the intended curriculum and attempts to improve ease of use. As such, I will mainly address the broad concepts and give some advice on how to survive your experience with the ePortfolio. Tip: Always check details with your own curriculum and ePortfolio. The ePortfolio has a number of different parts that vary between training schemes (especially outside of foundation and core training). However, the general elements within most ePortfolios are similar, so I shall examine them in turn. Tip: As soon as you get your username details, try to log in to the web-site. If you wait until you need to use it to check your details and then have problems, you will only waste your time...|$|E

40|$|Although a latecomer, {{economically}} important Asia {{has emerged}} {{at the forefront}} of global free trade agreement (FTA) activity. This has sparked concerns about the negative effects of Asian FTAs, including the "noodle bowl" problem. Amid slow progress in the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha negotiations and the global financial crisis, however, Asian regionalism <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> The focus for policymakers should then be how best to minimize the costs of FTAs while maximizing their benefits. Adopting a pragmatic perspective, this paper examines key trends and challenges in Asian FTAs. It provides new evidence from firm surveys, analysis of specific agreements, and computable general equilibrium estimates. It provides the following set of recommendations: strengthen the support system for using FTAs; rationalize rules of origin and upgrade their administration; ensure better coverage of agricultural trade; forge comprehensive "WTO-plus" agreements; and encourage a region-wide FTA. Political economy considerations suggest that a likely scenario is for FTA consolidation in Asia [...] by creating a People's Republic of China-Japan-Korea FTA, combining it with ASEANÂ +Â  1 FTAs, and then involving Australia, India, and New Zealand [...] to be followed by connections with North America and Europe. In conclusion, the analysis suggests a bottom-up approach to a Doha Round Agreement should be adopted. Asian free trade agreements (FTAs) Noodle bowl WTO-plus provisions East Asia-wide FTA...|$|R

[...] Jameson appeared in a number of Corwin's productions, as actor and narrator, including The Plot to Overthrow Christmas (as Santa Claus), They Fly Through the Air, <b>Seems</b> Radio Is <b>Here</b> <b>To</b> <b>Stay,</b> There Will Be Time Later, Log of the R-77, A Soliloquy to Balance the Budget, Descent of the Gods (as Apollo), Fragments From a Lost Cause, America at War, and A Program to Be Opened in a Hundred Years. In They Fly and Soliloquy, Jameson was the sole performer. [...] Corwin wrote several scripts with Jameson in mind. Jameson's voice was described as [...] "a magnificently mellow instrument," [...] and Jameson was said to be [...] "a master of language cadences" [...] and to have [...] "a fine gift for irony." [...] The roles Corwin wrote for Jameson [...] "tended toward an elaborate style, with an Olympian quality about them." [...] In a January 27, 1969, letter to Jameson, Corwin stated [...] "if I was the father of those breakthrough plays, you were the godfather. There might have been others who could have played Santa in The Plot as well as you, though {{for the life of me}} I cannot think who; but nobody - nobody- could have have carried They Fly as you did." [...] Corwin said They Fly was the play that made the biggest difference in his life, and told Jameson [...] "for that service alone, I would be eternally grateful to you. But it was, happily, not alone." [...] Corwin told Jameson that he was a [...] "rock." [...] Corwin stated that [...] "knowing your rich mind and the grace and power of your art, I was emboldened to write for you as a composer writes for an instrumentalist whose range and qualities broaden his own by giving him the confidence to reach high." ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFrance has {{recently}} undergone a teacher training reform (2010 - 2011), {{in the context}} of the Bologna Process, which started in 2002. We are still in the early stages of this reform today. It was carried out in an extremely tense context with universities and politicians being very critical of the IUFM (Instituts de Formation des Maîtres, which were the only structure in charge of teacher training), and even the former French president himself publicly asserting they had disappeared. At the same time, the drastic reduction in the number of teachers in primary and secondary schools (because of the government’s policy of the reducing the number of State-employed) gave this reform a financial dimension and therefore strengthened opposition to it. And indeed, this reform has brought very strong, although sometimes contradictory, opposition from different actors. On the one hand, the faculties (UFR) *, and above all history faculties, which had previously been in charge of initial training in the different disciplines, were afraid for the future of their research masters (which would be in competition with the vocational masters); and on the other hand, the IUFM which were in danger of disappearing and who argued in favour of vocational masters. The reform in teacher training profoundly affected the universities, where didactics was traditionally poorly considered (and this was particularly true in faculties for humanities and social sciences). Very few departments (such as the Centre de Formation et d’Études sur l’Enseignement des Disciplines, CFEED) de Paris 7 -Denis Diderot) provided training and research in didactics and, after the Ph D, the specialists of history didactics could only find positions in the IUFM (at the time these institutions were independent schools, outside the universities). To add to these difficulties, the reform of teacher training {{in the context of}} the Bologna Process was at odds with the traditional mode of teacher recruitment. In France, teachers are State-employed and have to pass a very competitive exam, the CAPES*, considered as an important element of Republican democracy. The future of this exam was questioned in the reform. Moreover, at the same time the government announced a very important reduction in the time devoted to training newly qualified teachers (stagiaires), and this caused further outcry (for example from the trade unions). For all these reasons, the introduction of masters in teacher training courses was a very controversial process, and recent studies, commissioned by the very government who conducted this reform seem to confirm some of the criticisms. To understand the reform and the problems it has created, we have first to consider the academic context in which it took place, together with the place of this discipline, which is traditionally considered to be important for the education of citizens. Secondly, we are going to see the consequences and the problems created by this reform in teacher training, the basis of which (the masters) <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> Indeed, if the new government set up after the presidential election in May 2012 seems to intend to make some changes (particularly for the training of stagiaires), it is very unlikely that the BA/MA reform of teacher training will be abandoned...|$|R
