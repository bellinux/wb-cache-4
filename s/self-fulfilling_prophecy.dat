25|$|Intended to paralyse black {{opposition}} and prevent political violence, {{the state of}} emergency proved a <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy.</b> State repression deepened black alienation from the regime and suggested to some that peaceful political organising was a dead end.

25|$|An unusual kind {{of social}} {{influence}} is the <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy.</b> This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true.

Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by their own behavior.|$|E

500|$|As {{lawyer for}} the UGG, Brownlee began to sympathize with the {{prevailing}} farmers' view that the eastern Canadian business establishment was hostile to their interests (for example, when the UGG wanted to sell twine, no manufacturer would supply it). [...] He recommended that the UGG reduce farmers' reliance on the eastern establishment by expanding its operations into insurance, investment, and real estate. [...] The result was the United Grain Growers Securities Ltd. [...] He also helped the UGG quietly sell the stock it held in the Home Bank of Canada when UGG directors began to doubt the bank's soundness; this subtlety was considered essential, as the directors were concerned that airing their doubts publicly would make the bank's failure a <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy.</b> [...] When UGG Assistant General Manager J. R. Murray found an interested buyer, Brownlee advised Murray against insisting on an intricate written sales contract for fear that the buyer would sense the directors' concerns. [...] His advice was heeded, and the sale was concluded December 29, 1919. [...] The bank failed less than four years later.|$|E

[...] She discusses the potential positive and negative psychological effects that can occur subsequent to taking the est training. [...] She analyzes the rules of the training, and the behavioral tools used by the trainers, and points out that the est personnel are not qualified to assess psychopathology.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} how indeterminacy in a one-sector model may arise due to externalities in the disutility of labor supply, which is termed as demand-side indeterminacy. This contrasts supply-side indeterminacy that {{is driven by}} externalities in the production function as exemplified by Benhabib and Farmer (Journal of Economic Theory, 1994). For the one-sector models considered, I find that indeterminacy arises more easily from the demand than from the supply side. In addition, demand and supply-side indeterminacy generate different cyclical patterns of wages, a feature that is useful for identifying episodes of <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecies</b> within {{the two types of}} indeterminacy.

500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the biggest one of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] a <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy.</b> You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{educational}} research on children’s academic performance, few topics have received {{more attention than}} the consequences of school segregation {{and the impact of}} <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecies.</b> However, virtually no research has investigated whether <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecies</b> account for the impact of school composition on academic achievement. Purpose & Research Objectives: This study aims to integrate research on the effects of school segregation with that on <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecies</b> by examining the mediating role of teacher expectancies regarding the impact of school composition on pupils’ math achievement. First, we investigate whether teachers’ teachability expectations are related to the socioeconomic and ethnic composition of the school. Second, we investigate whether and how the effects of school composition can be explained by <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecies.</b> Because it is theorized that teacher expectancies might have an impact on pupils’ academic achievement through pupils’ perceptions of control over their achievement, we investigate the role of pupils’ sense of academic futility. Sample & Research Design: Quantitative data from a survey of 2, 845 pupils and 706 teachers in 68 Flemish (Belgian) primary schools and qualitative data obtained through in-depth interviews with 26 teachers in five schools are analyzed. A complementary mixed-method design is used: Findings from the quantitative data are strengthened and illustrated with qualitative data. Results: The multilevel analysis shows that teachers’ teachability expectations are lower in schools with a high share of nonnative and working-class pupils and that these teachability expectations have an indirect impact on pupils’ achievement through pupils’ feelings of academic futility. The qualitative analysis reveals that the low teacher expectations in these schools are largely triggered by alleged linguistic deficiencies and problematic language use of the pupils and that school staff persistently communicate their preference for Dutch monolingualism to pupils. Recommendations: The results {{of this study indicate that}} socioeconomic desegregation may not be needed if it is possible to reform schools with a larger share of working-class pupils. Schools that produce more favorable teachability expectations are recommended. In particular, teachers’ attitudes and beliefs regarding pupils’ linguistic backgrounds might be the focus of educational reforms...|$|R

2500|$|Mares are {{considered}} easier to handle than stallions.

However, there is considerable evidence that much [...] "marish" [...] behavior is mostly the result of humans expecting or allowing the mare to misbehave. Because horses in general are very attuned to the emotional state of their riders, expectation by a rider of difficult manners during estrus can create a <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>prophecy</b> and a cranky mare.|$|E
