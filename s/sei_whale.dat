In a 2012 review of cetacean taxonomy, Alexandre Hassanin (of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle) and colleagues suggested that, based on phylogenic criteria, {{there are four}} extant genera of rorquals.

5|$|The {{blue whale}} is usually {{classified}} {{as one of}} eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, Sibbaldus, {{but this is not}} accepted elsewhere. DNA sequencing analysis indicates that the blue whale is phylogenetically closer to the <b>sei</b> <b>whale</b> (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to the humpback whale (Megaptera) and the gray whale (Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis).

5|$|The {{introduction}} of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925 substantially {{increased the number}} of whales taken per year. In 1937–38 alone, over 29,000 fin whales were taken. From 1953–54 to 1961–62, the catch averaged over 30,000 per year. By 1962–63, <b>sei</b> <b>whale</b> catches began to increase as fin whales became scarce. By 1975–76, fewer than 1,000 fin whales were being caught each year. In the North Pacific, over 74,000 fin whales were caught between 1910 and 1975. Between 1910 and 1989, over 55,000 were caught in the North Atlantic. Coastal groups in northeast Asian waters, along with many other baleen species, were likely driven into serious perils or functional extinctions by industrial catches by Japan covering wide ranges of China and Korean EEZ within very short period in 20th century. Migrations of the species into Japanese EEZ and in East China Sea were likely to be exterminated relatively earlier, as the last catch records on Amami Oshima was between the 1910s and 1930s. After the cease of exploiting Asian stocks, Japan kept mass commercial and illegal hunts until 1975. Several thousand individuals were hunted from various stations mainly along coasts of Hokkaido, Sanriku, and the Gotō Islands.|$|E

500|$|Rorquals are {{the largest}} group of baleen whales, with 9 species in two genera. They include the largest animal that has ever lived, the blue whale, which can reach 190 tonnes, the fin whale can easily reach 50 tonnes, and even the {{smallest}} of the group, the northern minke whale, reaches 9 tonnes. They take their name from a Norwegian word meaning [...] "furrow whale": all members of the family have a series of longitudinal folds of skin running from below the mouth back to the navel (except the <b>sei</b> <b>whale,</b> which has shorter grooves). These are understood to allow the mouth to expand immensely when feeding. All rorquals have ventral grooves, and are the only cetaceans to have them.

500|$|The baleen of baleen {{whales are}} keratinous plates. They {{are made of}} a calcified hard α-keratin material, a fiber-reinforced {{structure}} made of intermediate filaments (proteins).
