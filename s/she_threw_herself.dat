500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{live for}} the first time the 2011 Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011. During the performance she danced with her male backup dancers and the official video of the song was played on a screen behind them. Later, in May 2012, Beyoncé performed a funky version of the song as a part of her revue show [...] in Atlantic City, New Jersey at Revel. While reviewing the show, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Then she makes some of the most thorough and gold-plated declarations of self-worth ever rendered in pop. 'There’s nothing not to love about me,' she sang... without needing to make a joke out of it." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice was also positive about the performance of the song, saying, [...] "Live, <b>she</b> <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> into the track, from tsk-tsk-tsk opening to impassioned ending; after that, the song's frenetic beat got transformed into an extended outro that showcased her band's prowess in such a convincing way, she took off her shoes to dance along with it." [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was included in the set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013-2014).|$|E
500|$|Napoleon demanded, from {{a highly}} {{superior}} position, peace terms {{in what was}} to be called the Peace of Tilsit (1807). In the midst of these negotiations, the emperor agreed to keep half of Prussia intact. The men were joined by Queen Louise; Frederick William had sent for his wife, then pregnant with her daughter Princess Louise, to beg for a better settlement for Prussia, with Louise advising her husband, [...] "For God's sake no shameful peace... should at least not go down without honor." [...] As the king felt that her presence might put Napoleon in a [...] "more relaxed mood"; Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit, but only to save [...] "her Prussia". Napoleon had previously attempted to destroy her reputation by questioning Louise's marital fidelity, but the queen met him anyway, attempting to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms. Formerly Louise had regularly referred to him as [...] "the Monster", but nevertheless made a request for a private interview with the emperor, whereon <b>she</b> <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> at his feet; though he was impressed by her grace and determination, Napoleon refused to make any concessions, writing back to his wife Empress Joséphine that Louise [...] "is really charming and full of coquettishness toward me. But don't be jealous...it would cost me too dearly to play the gallant." [...] Napoleon's attempts to destroy Louise's reputation failed however, and they only made her more beloved in Prussia. Queen Louise's efforts to protect her adopted country from French aggression secured for her the admiration of future generations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{etymology}} of Erode {{is attributed}} to multiple theories. It might have its origin in the Tamil phrase Eru Odai meaning two streams based {{on the presence of}} two water courses, Perumpallam and Kalingarayan Canal. The name might have also been derived from Tamil phrase [...] "Eera Odu" [...] meaning wet skull. Dakshaprajapathi, who married his daughter to Hindu god Shiva, conducted a yajna for which Shiva was not invited. Shiva's wife Dakshyayini attended the ritual against the wish of her husband and she was not welcomed by her parents without her husband. Enraged at this, <b>she</b> <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> in fire pot and burned to ashes. Shiva became agitated and threw everyone present at the ritual including Brahma, the Hindu god of creation into the sacrificial pot.
