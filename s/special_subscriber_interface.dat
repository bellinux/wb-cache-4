50|$|The firm's first product, {{introduced}} in 2007, is a USB device that has both the software necessary to place Internet-based telephone calls via a customer-supplied high-speed Internet connection and the electronics (technically {{known as a}} SLIC, or <b>Subscriber</b> Line <b>Interface</b> Circuit) which allow conventional landline telephones to be plugged directly into the device.|$|R
50|$|Ringers were {{commonly}} {{placed in}} the same housing as the subscriber set, which consisted of other electrical components, such as induction coils, capacitors, and, if required, a magneto generator. The <b>subscriber</b> set <b>interfaced</b> a telephone set to the telephone network, while magneto generators were used in a manual exchange to generate a remote ring signal.|$|R
50|$|In {{telephone}} switches, time-slot interchange switches usually {{form the}} outer {{layer of the}} switching fabric at a central office's switch. They take data from time-multiplexed T-1 or E-1 lines that serve neighborhoods. The T-1 or E-1 lines serve the <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> cards (SLICs) in local neighborhoods. The SLICs serve as the outer space-division switches of a modern wired telephone system.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as pulse dialing (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the local loop between the telephone exchange and the calling party's telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the rotary dial as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of <b>special</b> <b>subscriber</b> trunk dialing equipment. Operators used an earlier type of multi-frequency signaling.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> circuit (SLIC) {{provides}} DC power, ringing {{and supervision}} functions for the "plain old telephone service " (POTS) where alerting a telephone {{is a prerequisite}} but a central ringer is generally not available. SLICs have also been used in Terminal Adapters (TA), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Network Termination (NT) applications. This application note provides a detailed design procedure for the flyback transformer {{that can be used}} with MAX 1856 in SLIC power supplies. The MAX 1856 offers a low cost solution for generating <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> circuits (SLIC) power supplies. The SLIC provides DC power, ringing and supervision functions for the "plain old telephone service " (POTS) where alerting a telephone is a prerequisite but a central ringer is generally not available. SLICs which incorporate the ringer function, have been used in Terminal Adapters (TA), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Network Termination (NT) applications. This document presents a sampling of power supply reference designs for use with typical SLICs in two- channel and four-channel POTS loops. Each application has specialized requirements depending on the number of channels serviced and loop length. The requirements for three typical applications are presented in Table 1...|$|R

50|$|A {{line card}} {{typically}} interfaces the twisted pair cable of a {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) local loop {{to the public}} switched telephone network (PSTN). Telephone line cards perform multiple tasks, such as analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion of voice, off-hook detection, ring supervision, line integrity tests, and other BORSCHT functions. In some telephone exchange designs, the line cards generate ringing current and decode DTMF signals. The line card in a subscriber loop carrier is called a <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> card (SLIC).|$|R

50|$|The {{telephone}} company maintains large battery systems that supply DC line voltage {{for the operation}} of analog telephone service at customer locations. The voltage supplied is a compromise between operational needs for reliable service and safety precautions for customers and service personnel. The length of the line to a customer telephone interface presents a resistance across which the central office voltage experiences a drop and therefore the voltage at the customer site may vary. The nominal battery (system) voltage is 52.1 V, based on a 24-cell lead-acid battery. The voltage at a <b>subscriber's</b> network <b>interface</b> is typically 48 V between the ring and tip wires.|$|R
50|$|Congestion {{is defined}} as the {{situation}} when exchanges or circuit groups are inundated with calls and are unable to serve all the <b>subscribers.</b> <b>Special</b> attention must be given to ensure that such high loss situations do not arise.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} Volterra {{approach}} and assuming fading memory, a very efficient method to identify weakly non-linear systems is presented. Making special assumptions on the Volterra kernels, one {{ends up in}} the Hammerstein model, which has less complexity than the Volterra model, thus reducing the numerical effort. Using FIR filters to realize the Hammerstein model, no starting values are necessary to solve the linear optimization problem. To deal with the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, special regularization techniques have been used. Applying these methods to a large scale analog integrated circuitry, namely a broadband SLIC (<b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> circuitry) for a splitter-less ADSL-Lite central office application, results are given for the buffer, consisting of a few hundred components in BiCMOS technology...|$|R

During steady state operation, the drive current for the subscriber loop allows the loop to respond to changes in loop conditions according to a steady state time constant of the loop filter. Upon detection of a line voltage transient which exceeds a predetermined threshold in either a positive or negative direction, the filter time constant is significantly reduced (e. g., 100 : 1) and held at such reduced value following the initial transient and for a predetermined time period after the line voltage has fallen back below such predetermined threshold. This allows the transient conditions to be fully compensated prior to resetting the filter time constant back from the lower transient value to the higher steady state value...|$|R

40|$|A {{signal line}} driving circuit with power control for {{selectively}} reducing internal power dissipation when driving an external load. While driving the external load with a constant current the output voltage generated across such load is monitored. If the load impedance decreases sufficiently {{to cause the}} output voltage to fall below a predetermined threshold value and, therefore, cause the voltage across the signal line driving circuit to increase, {{the magnitude of the}} power supply voltage is automatically reduced, thereby reducing the voltage across the signal line driving circuit. Such a signal line driving circuit is particularly advantageous as a <b>subscriber</b> line <b>interface</b> circuit (SLIC). As the subscriber goes from an on-hook condition to an off-hook condition and if the subscriber loop is sufficiently short (or low in impedance), a lower power supply voltage is used to minimize the power dissipation of the SLIC while still maintaining the required subscriber loop current...|$|R
