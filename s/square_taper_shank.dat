50|$|Threaded {{fasteners}} {{either have}} a <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> or a non-tapered <b>shank.</b> Fasteners with <b>tapered</b> <b>shanks</b> {{are designed to}} either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.|$|R

50|$|Most {{drill bits}} for {{consumer}} use have straight shanks. For heavy duty drilling in industry, bits with <b>tapered</b> <b>shanks</b> are sometimes used. Other types shanks used include hex-shaped, and various proprietary quick release systems.|$|R
5000|$|End-milling cutters with a Morse <b>taper</b> <b>shank</b> with a tang are {{occasionally}} seen: {{for security}} these {{must be used}} with a C-collar or similar, fitting into the neck between cutter and shank, and pulling back against the large end of the taper ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>shanks</b> [...] "stick" [...] in {{a socket}} best when both the shank and the socket are clean. Shanks can be wiped clean, but sockets, being deep and inaccessible, are best cleaned with a {{specialized}} taper cleaning tool which is inserted, twisted, and removed.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>square</b> <b>tapered</b> {{bottom bracket}} axles are {{threaded}} {{at the ends}} and use nuts. Other <b>square</b> <b>tapered</b> bottom brackets are hollow or not and crank bolts thread into the ends.|$|R
50|$|This shank {{was common}} before 1850, {{and is still}} in production. At first, the <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> was just rammed into a square hole {{in the end of}} the drill. Over time, various chuck designs have been invented, and modern chucks can grasp and drive this shank effectively.|$|R
50|$|Often {{referred}} to as 'cotterless', since this was the design that was introduced after cottered spindles, <b>square</b> <b>taper</b> was once the most popular (and only) style 'cotterless' crank. This interface consists of a spindle with <b>square</b> <b>tapered</b> ends that fit into <b>square</b> <b>tapered</b> holes in each crank. It is still manufactured in great numbers for bicycles and maintains popularity for such applications as bicycles.|$|R

50|$|Tools with a <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> are {{inserted}} into a matching tapered socket and pushed or twisted into place. They are then retained by friction. In some cases, the friction fit {{needs to be}} made stronger, as {{with the use of a}} drawbar, essentially a long bolt that holds the tool into the socket with more force than is possible by other means.|$|R

50|$|In {{recent years}} Shimano has {{migrated}} {{much of their}} product line away from <b>square</b> <b>taper</b> to a spline attachment called Octalink and to external bearing types. In late 2006, Campagnolo {{announced that it was}} abandoning the <b>square</b> <b>taper</b> interface for double chainsets in favor of an outboard bearing design called Ultra-Torque, which uses a splined interface between spindle halves.|$|R
50|$|For light loads (such as {{encountered}} by a lathe tailstock or a drill press), tools with self-holding tapers are simply slipped onto {{or into the}} spindle; {{the pressure of the}} spindle against the workpiece drives the <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> tightly into the tapered hole. The friction across the entire surface area of the interface provides a large amount of torque transmission, so that splines or keys are not required.|$|R

5000|$|The Morse taper {{allows the}} bit to be mounted {{directly}} into the spindle of a drill, lathe tailstock, or (with the use of adapters) into the spindle of milling machines. It is a self-locking (or self holding) taper of approximately 5/8" [...] per foot that allows the torque {{to be transferred to}} the drill bit by the friction between the <b>taper</b> <b>shank</b> and the socket. The tang {{at the end of the}} taper is only for ejecting the drill bit from the spindle, with the aid of a drift.|$|R

2500|$|... a <b>square</b> <b>tapered</b> spindle. The taper is 2 degrees {{with respect}} to the centerline. There are at least two non-interchangeable {{dimensions}} (e.g. Shimano and Campagnolo use competing standards in <b>square</b> <b>taper,</b> viz. JIS and ISO respectively, where the ISO spindle is longer and its taper end is slightly smaller. [...] Most parts made by European manufacturers are to the ISO standard, and most Asian manufacturers use the JIS (Shimano) standard), and two orientations: diamond and square. The hole in the crank in which one screws a crank puller almost always has a diameter of 22 mm, though some old French cranks (Stonglight and T.A.) require a different puller.|$|R
50|$|In typical modern bikes, {{the bottom}} bracket spindle is {{separate}} from the cranks. This {{is known as a}} three-piece crankset. The cranks attach to the spindle via a common <b>square</b> <b>taper,</b> a cotter or via a variety of splined interfaces.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} an open framed, <b>square,</b> <b>tapered</b> steel {{structure}} with lantern and gallery, {{the highest in the}} Island, at a height of 145 ft (129 iron steps). It has a white revolving light, giving two flashes in quick succession every 15 seconds.|$|R
40|$|A {{drill bit}} loader is {{described}} for loading a <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> of a drill bit into a similarly tapered recess {{in the end}} of a drill spindle. The spindle has a transverse slot at the inner end of the recess. The end of the <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> of the drill bit has a transverse tang adapted to engage in the slot so that the drill bit will be rotated by the spindle. The loader {{is in the form of}} a cylinder adapted to receive the drill bit with the shank projecting out of the outer end of the cylinder. Retainer pins prevent rotation of the drill bit in the cylinder. The spindle is lowered to extend the shank of the drill bit into the recess in the spindle and the spindle is rotated to align the slot in the spindle with the tang on the shank. A spring unit in the cylinder is compressed by the drill bit during its entry into the recess of the spindle and resiliently drives the tang into the slot in the spindle when the tang and slot are aligned. In typical remote drilling operations, whether in hot cells or water pits, drill bits have been held using a collet or end mill type holder with set screws. In either case, to load or change a drill bit required the use master-slave manipulators to position the bits and tighten the collet or set screws. This requirement eliminated many otherwise useful work areas because they were not equipped with slaves, particularly in water pits...|$|R
50|$|<b>Square</b> <b>taper</b> drills {{were also}} used for large ratchet drills, for {{drilling}} large holes, or in thick plate. These bits would fit straight into a ratchet drill, and the ratchet drill would be used against a strong arm, for pressure to push the drill into the work piece.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Various design charts of ample {{validity}} and prompt access are presented, which per-mit the contact stresses within the lug of a pinned connection to be forecast {{in the presence}} of an initial clearance between the pin periphery and the lug bore. To cover the range of the practically encountered geometries and loadings, round-ended lugs of various widths and with a variously <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> are considered, and several inclinations of the applied load are addressed. The charts are compiled with the aid of finite elements. The employment of the recently proposed load factor F allows the combined effects on the peak contact stresses of the load intensity and of the initial clearance to be predicted...|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} designs in use that have {{varying degrees of}} popularity. One is Truvativ's Power Spline interface. It is a 12 spline spindle {{proprietary}} to Truvativ offered as a lower cost alternative to other spline designs. It is essentially a beefed up <b>square</b> <b>taper</b> spindle with splines instead of tapers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{flexibility}} {{is also used}} to provide accurate axial location. An HSK toolholder has both a <b>tapered</b> <b>shank,</b> and a flange with a mating surface. The shank is short (about half as long as other machine tapers), with a shallow taper (a ratio of 1:10), and slightly too large to allow the flange to seat fully in the socket. The thin walls, short <b>shank</b> and shallow <b>taper</b> provide a large opening {{in the back of the}} tool. An expanding collet fits in there, and mates with 30° chamfer inside the shank. As the drawbar retracts, it expands the collet and pulls the shank back into the socket, compressing the shank until the flange seats against the front of the socket. This provides a stiff, repeatable connection ...|$|R
50|$|Formerly, it {{was common}} to mount bicycle cranks using a cotter, though now usually a more easily {{maintained}} arrangement is used such as a <b>square</b> <b>tapered</b> or splined interface. These cotters have a short threaded section at the narrower end of the taper, {{which is used to}} hold the cotter in place with a washer and nut.|$|R

The model {{consists of three}} passive elements only {{and can be used}} for modelling nonuniform distributed RC structures involving exponential, hyperbolic sine squared, hyperbolic cosine <b>squared</b> and <b>square</b> <b>taper</b> geometries. The model can be easily implemented for computer-aided analysis and design of circuits and systems comprising nonuniform distributed RC structures...|$|R
5000|$|West Point Lighthouse, a <b>square</b> <b>tapered</b> tower, {{was built}} in 1875 by the federal Department of Marine. The West Point Lighthouse Inn, Museum and Restaurant was {{established}} in 1984. The West Point Development Corporation, a non-profit organization, maintains the lighthouse as a navigational aid beacon, although the living quarters of the lighthouse are now used as a unique country inn and museum.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Friction Stir Welding has provided an alternative improved way of producing aluminium joints, in a faster and reliable manner. In this study the effect of tool pin profile on the mechanical and metallurgical properties of dissimilar AA 6351 - AA 5083 H 111 joints produced by FSW is analyzed. Five different tool pin profiles are developed such as straight cylindrical, threaded cylindrical, <b>square,</b> <b>tapered</b> <b>square,</b> and <b>tapered</b> octagon to weld the joints. All the welds are produced perpendicularly to the rolling direction for both alloys. Tensile tests {{are performed to evaluate}} the mechanical properties by using computerized universal testing machine. Color metallographic is carried out along various zones of the friction stir welded. Among the five tools square pin profile give better tensile strength and the stirred zone of the welded area has finer grains compared to other weld zones...|$|R
50|$|Tools with an R8 taper are {{inserted}} {{directly into}} the machine's spindle. R8 collets are typically used to hold tooling with round shanks, although any shape can be held if the collet has the correct corresponding shape cut in it. The collets have a precision bore with axial compression slots for holding cutting tools and are threaded for the drawbar. The R8 system is commonly used with collets {{ranging in size from}} ″ to ″ in diameter or tool holders with the same or slightly larger diameters. The collets or tool holders are placed {{directly into the}} spindle and the drawbar is tightened into the top of the collet or tool holder from above the spindle. Other tools such as drill chucks, fly cutters, indexable insert cutters, etc. may have an R-8 <b>taper</b> <b>shank</b> built into or added to the tool.|$|R
