5|$|Overheating {{caused by}} the lack of space between the video cards forces {{researchers}} using the FASTRA II to keep the <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> door open, so that the video cards can get regular air, decreasing the overall temperature inside the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{case could}} be opened by {{operating}} a single lever on the back, which unlocked {{one of the two}} sides of the machine, as well as the drive bays. All of the expansion slots for memory, PCIe cards and drives could be accessed with the <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> removed and no tools were required for installation.|$|E
5|$|Coming into series six as reigning champion, Razer {{started its}} title defence by {{qualifying}} from a four-way melee. It then defeated the pyramid-shaped robot Cyrax on a judges' decision {{to set up}} a heat final against Raging Reality. It pushed its opponent towards Matildas flywheel, which ripped off an entire <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> and caused Raging Reality to break down. This saw Razer reach the semi-finals for a second consecutive series. Against Wild Thing, Razer damaged one of its opponent's exposed drive wheels, hampering its movement. Subsequently, Razer grasped it with the arm and dropped Wild Thing into the pit. Razer next fought Dantomkia, which was armed with a pneumatic flipping arm. Although Razer was the early aggressor, Dantomkia retaliated by pushing Razer into the arena wall. The rest of the battle was similarly even, with Razer's more potent attacks being matched by Dantomkia's pushing power. The judges decided that Razer should move on to a second series final.|$|E
50|$|The body <b>side</b> <b>panels</b> are 3 mm thick, and {{are carried}} by {{columnar}} sections, in between which {{parts of the}} cabling channels are laid. The <b>side</b> <b>panels</b> encompass the area from {{the back end of}} the driver's cabs up {{to the beginning of the}} sloped roof section, which is part of the removable roof sections. They end toward the top in a hollow section, which then takes on the roof sections. The <b>side</b> <b>panels</b> are connected together by two welded wicket/belt made up of steel plate.|$|R
50|$|The Main Altar of the Kastulus Minster is the {{principal}} masterpiece of the wood sculptor Hans Leinberger of Landshut.

5|$|A replica set of Hitler's Eastern Front Headquarters Wolf's Lair was {{constructed}} 60 kilometers south of Berlin, though the headquarters' actual location was in modern-day Poland. It took twelve weeks to build. Filming also {{took place in}} some of the houses that were used to hide the bombs in 1944. The interior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was also replicated using film shot by Hitler's consort Eva Braun and designing models of furniture possessed by secretive collectors. The production also made use of surviving Nazi relics, including furniture used by the Reich Ministry and objects that once adorned Hitler's desk. Nazi symbols, the display of which is heavily restricted in Germany, were also used at several locations, and while the filmmakers gave forewarnings to local residents, a passerby witnessing the use of swastikas during filming in Berlin filed an official complaint with the city. Similar charges have also been filed against the owners of sites set up to show Nazi displays for the film's production. Filming also took place at Babelsberg Studios. During filming on August 19, 2007, eleven people were hurt when the <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> of a truck they were riding broke, with one person requiring hospitalization. They demanded $11 million in compensation, rejecting a settlement offered by the studio.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Nike commemorated {{the club}} with two {{exclusive}} Dunk shoes, both released in limited quantities. The High Dunk (featuring a black , and {{the skull and}} crossbones symbol) was released to all countries throughout Europe, with only 500 pairs produced. The Low Dunk (featuring a smooth white colorway, and holding the team's logo impregnated in the <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> leather) was released only to shops in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, with only 150 pairs produced.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of the low}} {{sales of}} the Classic Brougham hardtop, the Classic DPL four-door sedan became the only Matador version {{produced}} by VAM for 1973, with Javelin being the largest two-door model offered by the company. The 1973 Classic DPLs were virtually the same to their previous year's counterparts with differences only in seat and <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> designs {{as well as the}} grille design and a new engine head with larger valves and independent rockers.|$|E

25|$|The toy of Red Alert {{was sold}} by itself, {{as well as}} {{packaged}} with the Mini-Con Dirtboss and a Tiny-Tin as a promotion at Walmart stores. Oddly, though the Walmart promotional Red Alert was identical to the regular deluxe sized one with an Earth Cyber Key included, the box stated Red Alert came with a Speed Planet Cyber Key and had information about the Speed Planet on the <b>side</b> <b>panel.</b> The reason he has a multi-medical tool instead of a left hand is because it was sliced off in the conflict before Armada by Starscream.|$|E
25|$|The 1976 {{models were}} {{almost the same}} as their {{immediate}} predecessors; their differences were limited to a compression ratio increase for the 258 six from 7.6:1 to 8.0:1. New gauges appeared {{in the form of a}} 160km/h speedometer and revised warning lights, sunvisors were redesigned to larger more rectangular units with side bending portions, a new more-ornate dome light lens, new seat and <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> designs, while a rear defroster was added to the options. The separate seatbelts warning buzzer between the wipers and lights knobs was discontinued. New full-rubber bumper guards became available alongside the already existing metal ones with rubber strips.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the few}} {{remaining}} complaints with the Merlin-powered aircraft was a poor rearward view. The canopy structure, which was the same as the Allison-engined Mustangs, was made up of flat, framed panels; the pilot gained access, or exited the cockpit by lowering the port <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> and raising the top panel to the right. The canopy could not be opened in flight and tall pilots especially, were hampered by limited headroom. In order to at least partially improve the view from the Mustang, the British had field-modified some Mustangs with clear, sliding canopies called Malcolm hoods (designed by Robert Malcolm), and whose design had also been adopted by the U.S. Navy's own F4U-1D version of the Corsair in April 1944.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} Google web applications, Google Maps uses JavaScript extensively. As the user drags the map, the grid squares are {{downloaded}} from the server and {{inserted into the}} page. When a user searches for a business, the results are downloaded in the background for insertion into the <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> and map; the page is not reloaded. Locations are drawn dynamically by positioning a red pin (composed of several partially transparent PNGs) {{on top of the}} map images. A hidden IFrame with form submission is used because it preserves browser history. The site also uses JSON for data transfer rather than XML, for performance reasons. These techniques both fall under the broad Ajax umbrella. The result is termed a slippy map and is implemented elsewhere in projects such as OpenLayers.|$|E

500|$|In {{the right}} panel, Dyer is shown {{with his eyes}} shut, {{vomiting}} into a hand basin. In the two outer frames his figure is shadowed by arrows, pictorial devices that Bacon often used to place a sense of energy into his paintings. In this work, the arrows point to a man about to die, and according to Tóibín they scream [...] "Here!", [...] "Him!". The arrow of the right panel, according to Tóibín, points to a [...] "dead figure on the lavatory bowl, as though telling the Furies where to find him". The triptych is centralised by the lightbulb, and {{by the fact that}} Dyer faces inwards in the two outer canvasses. The triptych's composition and setting are poised to suggest instability, and the doors in each <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> are splayed outwards as if to look into the darkness of the foreground.|$|E

500|$|The name Razer Naga is {{believed}} to be based on both the Sanskrit word for [...] "snake" [...] and possibly Naga, a World of Warcraft race. The first Razer Naga was announced at Gamescom 2009 and released in August 2009. The first version of the Naga had a total of seventeen buttons, with twelve being {{on the left side of}} the mouse, and a switch on the underside of the mouse that maps them to the keyboard's top number buttons or its numeric keypad. The original Naga had a maximum sensitivity of 5,600 DPI. DPI stands for [...] "dots per inch", and is a unit for measuring the sensitivity of a mouse, with a higher DPI equaling a higher sensitivity. Downloadable software by Razer called AddOns allowed the user to map what each key did. The Naga Epic, which was released in November 2010, was the first installment in the Naga series to have wireless functionality. It was also released with an interchangeable <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> and the ability to change the color of the lights from a pool of sixteen million colors. A redesigned version of the original Naga, called the Naga Molten, was released in early 2011.|$|E
500|$|On April 17–18, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols {{removed the}} bomb {{supplies}} from their storage unit in Herington, Kansas, where Nichols lived, and loaded {{them into a}} Ryder rental truck. They then drove to Geary Lake State Park, where they nailed boards onto {{the floor of the}} truck to hold the 13barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale. Each filled barrel weighed nearly [...] McVeigh added more explosives to the driver's side of the cargo bay, which he could ignite (killing himself in the process) at close range with his Glock 21 pistol in case the primary fuses failed. During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier (the wife of Michael Fortier) stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a shaped charge. This was achieved by [...] the aluminum <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building. Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels {{in the shape of a}} backwards J; he later said that for pure destructive power, he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building; however, such an unevenly distributed [...] load might have broken an axle, flipped the truck over, or at least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention. All or most of the barrels of ANNM contained metal cylinders of acetylene intended to increase the fireball and the brisance of the explosion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{criticism}} {{also was}} due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still {{more expensive than the}} cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced.
