As all the band members got into side projects afterwards, work on Lightning Bolt only resumed in March 2013. The music for Lightning Bolt has a harder rock <b>sound</b> <b>with</b> longer songs to contrast predecessor Backspacer (2009), and the lyrics convey singer Eddie Vedder's feelings on aging and mortality.|$|E

Lyrically incorporating a range of political, social, philosophical and cultural references that have defied existing pop music conventions, Arulpragasam {{was one of the}} first acts to come to public attention through the internet.

It was {{released}} on November 2, 1973 by Columbia Records. The album was made available following a 1973 live television special promoted to improve Streisand's image and <b>sound.</b> <b>With</b> world music as the primary genre, the album's instrumentation varies greatly; even items such as kitchen utensils were used to create melodies and beats. With {{a majority of the}} songs on the album being cover songs, Streisand also re-recorded various tracks that originated earlier in her career. Her manager, Martin Erlichman, was credited as the album's sole and executive producer.|$|E

The U.S. force steamed in a single column in Ironbottom <b>Sound,</b> <b>with</b> destroyers in the lead and rear of the column, and the cruisers in the center. Five ships had the new, far-superior SG radar, but Callaghan's deployment put none {{of them in the}} forward part of the column, nor did he choose one for his flagship.

5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a melon and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate <b>sound</b> <b>with</b> support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E

Built mainly of sandstone in 1616, {{it also has}} a half-timbered section. The style is reminiscent of similar buildings in the north of Germany and in the Netherlands. Olufsen, Jens Bang's half brother, was not only a successful merchant but also mayor of Aalborg.

Unto the Locust features heavier, faster and more complex riffs by both Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel, influenced by classical music, and supported by fast and complex drum patterns by Dave McClain.

The record's music features a mellow, groove-based <b>sound</b> <b>with</b> elements of funk, jazz, smooth soul, and quiet storm. A concept album, Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite was composed as a song cycle that focuses on an adult romance, {{based in part on}} Maxwell's personal experiences.|$|E

5|$|Musically, glam metal {{combines}} a traditional heavy metal <b>sound</b> <b>with</b> elements of hard rock and punk rock, adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs. Like other heavy metal {{songs of the}} 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos. They also include extensive use of harmonies, particularly in the characteristic power balladsslow, emotional songs that gradually build to a strong finale. These {{were among the most}} commercially successful singles in the genre and opened it up to a wider audience {{that would not have been}} attracted to traditional heavy metal. Lyrical themes often deal with love and lust, with songs often directed at a particular woman.|$|E
5|$|Risk is {{the eighth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on August 31, 1999 by Capitol Records, the band's last album {{to be released}} by the label. The first Megadeth album since 1990 to feature a lineup change, Risk marks the studio debut of drummer Jimmy DeGrasso with the band, {{as well as the}} final appearance of longtime guitarist Marty Friedman, who announced his departure a year later. Meant to be a breakthrough on alternative rock radio, Risk received a mixed response because of the great deviation from the band's traditional sound. The backlash ultimately resulted with the band returning towards a heavier <b>sound</b> <b>with</b> its next album.|$|E
5|$|Since their inception, U2 have {{developed}} and maintained a distinctly recognisable <b>sound,</b> <b>with</b> emphasis on melodic instrumentals and expressive, larger-than-life vocals. This approach is rooted partly {{in the early}} influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite {{at a time when}} the band was not known for musical proficiency. The Edge has consistently used a rhythmic echo and a signature delay to craft his distinctive guitar work, coupled with an Irish-influenced drone played against his syncopated melodies that ultimately yields a well-defined ambient, chiming sound. Bono has nurtured his falsetto operatic voice and has exhibited a notable lyrical bent towards social, political, and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiose scale in his songwriting. In addition, the Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band.|$|E
