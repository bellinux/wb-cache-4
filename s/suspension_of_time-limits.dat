The physiological relevance for the selective regulation of cellular processes is demonstrated for the case <b>of</b> regulation by <b>time-limited</b> calcium oscillations...|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} time-limited welfare {{beginning at}} the broadest level, tracing the rapid emergence <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> welfare as a policy approach in part I. Chapter 1 examines the history <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> welfare and the key challenges posed by this policy. Part II begins {{to focus on the}} three participating states [...] Florida, Vermont, and Wisconsin [...] describing the goals, evolution, and planning of the policies. Chapter 2 examines the roots of the three programs, characteristics of locations where the programs are operating, and attitudes and characteristics of welfare recipi(nts subject to the programs. These contextual factors have helped to shape the policies that are discussed in chapter 3 and implementation experiences that are examined in part III. Part III moves from the state level to the local level, where the challenges <b>of</b> operating <b>time-limited</b> welfare programs are being faced. Chapter 4 examines the planning and start-up <b>of</b> the three <b>time-limit</b> programs, focusing special attentioa on computerized management information systems, which played a key role. Chapter 5 focuses on communication of the new message of welfare to recipients and discusses how to explain the new policies and their implications for recipients and to change the day-to-day operation of the welfare system. Chapter 6 describes the central role of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skill...|$|R

40|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> psychosocial {{interventions}} targeting social skills, internalizing {{and externalizing}} difficulties {{have been developed for}} children and young people with ASD. Increasingly more evidence is emerging that such interventions are effective in reducing difficulties and improving skills. However, large variability between studies and large individual heterogeneity in outcomes have been reported. Furthermore, there are concerns about the limited generalization of learnt skills. For example, what might be learnt in a training program in a clinical setting may not generalize to the school or home setting or even from one person to the next. In addition, experiences and difficulties in childhood are likely to be different from those in adolescence or adulthood and learnt skills to cope with such difficulties may not be transferable across different developmental periods. Furthermore, very little is known about potential mechanisms of change following these interventions. One possible effective "ingredient" to improve outcomes might be the active role and involvement of caregivers. In this update review paper, we summarize the current empirical evidence for the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> psychosocial interventions for children and young people with ASD, examine how parents are involved in these interventions and the scientific evidence for the inclusion of caregivers in these interventions.

40|$|Arguably, {{eliminating}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments [...] {{periods when}} banks jointly refuse to convert their liabilities into outside money or other assets [...] {{was an important}} impetus for creating the Federal Reserve. Friedman and Schwartz suggest that a suspension in 1930 would have decreased {{the severity of the}} Great Depression. More recently, an emerging literature suggests that <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments may well be optimal in some states of the world. We present evidence about <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments from an episode that is close to a controlled experiment for examining their effects. In 1861, about 44 percent of the banks in Wisconsin closed, 81 percent of the banks in Illinois closed, and noteholders suffered substantial losses. The historical record suggests a possible explanation: an effective <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments in Wisconsin but not Illinois. Historical and statistical evidence indicate that the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreased the number of banks that closed as well as noteholders' losses. Our statistical evidence indicates a 25 percent increase in the probability that an average bank in the two states remains open with the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments. The <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreases noteholders' losses by about 20 cents per dollar of notes. Bank failures; Banks and banking - History; Banks and banking, Central...|$|R

40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{execution of the}} sentence' should be judged in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2. Through this process, I argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be determined with sufficient consideration of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing reoffending...|$|R
