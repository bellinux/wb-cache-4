25|$|Since its inception, NETS has {{delivered}} its signature road <b>safety</b> <b>campaign,</b> Drive Safely Work Week (DSWW), through member companies and state partners. DSWW typically has an overarching theme, with specific topics or learning points delivered each {{day during the}} course of a week in October. As technology has evolved, the mode of delivery for DSWW materials has shifted from printed materials to electronic materials that may be downloaded from the Internet. Over the years, prevention of distracted driving has been a common theme for DSWW. In 2010 and 2011, NETS worked in partnership with the U.S. DOT to offer DSWW campaign materials on distracted driving free of charge, an arrangement that resulted in over 6,000 organizations downloading materials during 2010. One of NETS’s member services is the “Safety in Numbers” fleet safety benchmarking program, which provides international benchmarking services, with both qualitative and quantitative data from large companies representing various industry sectors. As a group, NETS member companies participating in the benchmarking program operate nearly half a million vehicles worldwide, with more than nine billion miles driven annually (Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, unpublished data).|$|E

After Rindt's death, his wife Nina stayed close with the Stewarts and can be seen visiting them at the 1971 Monaco Grand Prix in the Roman Polanski-produced film Weekend of a Champion.|$|E

A case scenario was developed by reviewing current literature on adolescent health behaviour, risk awareness, road safety and marketing communication.
