25|$|How mantle {{convection}} {{directly and}} indirectly relates to plate motion {{is a matter of}} ongoing study and discussion in geodynamics. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>this</b> energy must be transferred to the lithosphere for tectonic plates to move. There are essentially two main types of forces that are thought to influence plate motion: friction and gravity.|$|E
25|$|The 1940s {{brought forward}} a new {{generation}} of musicians—Aníbal Troilo, Osvaldo Pugliese, Miguel Caló, Alfredo de Ángelis, Ricardo Tanturi, Ángel D'Agostino, etc.—and a new characteristic style. Fresedo sought to adapt to these new times, but <b>somehow,</b> <b>this</b> attempt merely detracted from the strength of the fresediano style that had so successfully combined so as successful rhythm and elegance. From this time forward, his orchestrations become slower and he chooses mellifluous singers who even, in some cases, give a certain boleristic air to their versions of his tangos.|$|E
25|$|Meena Kumari was {{a patient}} of chronic {{insomnia}} {{and was on}} sleeping pills {{for a long time}} {{since the days of the}} telephoning conversations with Kamal Amrohi. During 1963, Dr. Saeed Timurza, her physician, then prescribed a small peg of brandy as a sleeping pill alternative and this was officially how she came into contact with the habit that was to kill her. <b>Somehow</b> <b>this</b> prescribed peg of brandy turned into heavy drinking after her separation from her husband. Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi never formally divorced, but separated in 1964. During those years of separation from her husband, Kumari's name was associated with Rahul, Gulzar, Dharmendra and Sawan Kumar Tak.|$|E

25|$|They {{were also}} {{critical}} of the races on water weather forecasting, which during the three days of storm, did not alter its forecast for a following SE wind change, which never eventuated. But probably lured yachts further south and away from Tasmania than necessary before tacking due west to close the coast. Sea-U-Later along with other yachts tracked down the 151-degree east longitude, becoming becalmed for 20 hours around 42 degrees south, in {{the centre of the}} weakened low, that all weather reports had said had moved well into the Tasman Sea. Whilst a respite the delay cost them dearly, Sea-U-Later was 37th to complete the race. The official explanation of the meteorology during the period was in the same edition, but <b>somehow</b> <b>this</b> was not communicated to yachts at sea at the time.|$|E
500|$|Prior to Dwarf Fortress, Tarn Adams {{was working}} on a project called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood which was a {{role-playing}} game. By 2004, Adams decided to shift from the original Armok to Dwarf Fortress after the former became difficult to maintain. Adams calls it his life's work and said in 2011, that version 1.0 will not be ready for at least another 20 years, and even after that he would continue to work on it. The game has a cult following and an active online community. As {{there is no way to}} win, every fortress, no matter how successful, is usually destroyed <b>somehow.</b> <b>This</b> prompts the unofficial community motto: [...] "Losing is Fun!" ...|$|E
500|$|On March 24, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Bosh's former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home. Three days later, it {{was reported}} that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid. Mathis' lawyer also told the press, [...] "My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that <b>somehow</b> <b>this</b> thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult." ...|$|E

50|$|The Fury is {{reactivated}} by Jaspers {{and kills}} both Captain Britain and Jackdaw. Captain Britain is then removed from Earth-238 by Merlyn and revived on Earth-616. The Fury, <b>somehow</b> detecting <b>this,</b> adapts itself to travel between realities.|$|R

500|$|Farrell next {{appeared}} in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, which premiered in 2007 and was {{distributed in the}} US in early 2008. Reviews were mixed, with Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide writing that Allen's work was [...] "shallow and unconvincing from beginning to end" [...] and Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle saying that although [...] "it's {{not as good as}} Match Point or Crimes and Misdemeanors...taken on its own, it's a fairly impressive piece, a directorially vigorous, well-acted, tightly constructed movie". LaSalle praised Farrell: [...] "Allen is notorious for not giving his actors explicit instructions, and yet <b>somehow</b> <b>this</b> worked wonders for Farrell, who has never seemed so naked, so clear and so unencumbered as he does here." [...] Manohla Dargis concurred in the New York Times, adding that she thought Farrell was well-matched with co-star Ewan McGregor.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News, who did {{not like}} [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", felt [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] proved the series could be funny. He {{specifically}} complimented the episode's commentary on American consumerism. Simon wrote, [...] "It's all very bitter social satire, and if it weren't on Comedy Central, believe me, no one in networkland would think it ready for prime time. And you know what else? It's funny." [...] Likewise, The Washington Post critic Tom Shales strongly criticized [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", but said the second episode was funny and included [...] "cleverly intertwined" [...] plot-lines. Shales said, [...] " [...] suggests the show may be an attempt at satire and not just poopy humor ... Yes, it's still sick and still twisted, but <b>somehow</b> <b>this</b> episode at least appears to have some comic ingenuity behind it, whereas the first was just a smutfest." [...] In 2006, [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was identified by Winnipeg Free Press {{as one of the}} ten most memorable South Park episodes, and ranked twelfth in a list of the top 25 greatest Cartman moments, as determined by voters on the Comedy Central website. The Daily Record in Scotland listed the episode's ending, and the [...] "Beefcake!" [...] line, as one of the six most memorable moments in the series.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Deming {{authored}} a guest {{column in}} the Oklahoma Daily where he argued {{that there may be}} [...] "biological differences between the sexes that may contribute to men's tendency to favor engineering [...] [...] [...] [...] On average, females have better verbal abilities than males. Males, however, tend to be superior in visual-spatial skills and mathematics, both of which may be important in engineering." [...] Deming wrote: There is significant scientific evidence that sex-based differences in spatial and mathematical abilities may be biological in origin. For example, male rats do better in mazes than females. I concede it is possible that those female rats performed poorly because they were distressed by the lack of proper role models, but <b>somehow</b> <b>this</b> seems implausible.|$|E

2500|$|Rocker Partners, renamed Copper River Management, filed a {{counterclaim}} against Overstock in November 2007, alleging overstatement of profits, false projections, and misrepresentations about the company's ventures. Copper River also alleges that Byrne tried to silence critics by suing them. A {{portion of this}} suit was {{settled out of court}} on October 13, 2008, when Overstock.com and Gradient dropped the claims against each other after Gradient retracted allegations that Overstock's reporting methods did not comply with rules established by the FASB, stated they believed Overstock.com complied with GAAP standards, and that three directors were independent according to NASD standards, and apologized. Byrne has said the apology and settlement [...] "represents a great step forward in our case", while Copper River's attorney stated that [...] "If <b>somehow</b> <b>this</b> improved Overstock's case, then Gradient would admit to doing something wrong and they haven’t.", and that he expected the settlement to help Copper River's case.|$|E
