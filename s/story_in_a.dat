5|$|Drum is Zola Maseko's {{first feature}} film. He {{originally}} {{wanted to tell}} Sophiatown's <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> six-part television series called Sophiatown Short Stories. Unsuccessful in convincing the South African Television Company to pursue such a series, he decided to change the medium to that of film. He secured {{a large amount of}} his funding by convincing Taye Diggs to fill the lead role.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} Scandal, Kurosawa {{was approached}} by Daiei studios, which asked the director to make another film for them. Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter, Shinobu Hashimoto, with whom he would eventually work on nine of his films. Their first joint effort was based on Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's experimental short <b>story</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> Grove, which recounts {{the murder of a}} samurai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points-of-view. Kurosawa saw potential in the script, and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.|$|E
5|$|By 1916 Frederick Warne & Co had {{discontinued}} Miss Moppet in its panorama format, and republished the <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> book {{format that}} year. Potter illustrated a frontispiece of the kitten and mouse seated in profile, and a title page vignette {{of a mouse}} on all fours facing the reader for the book format. At , the book's dimensions were smaller than other Peter Rabbit books. In 1917, she suggested to her publisher that Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes {{be published in the}} smaller Miss Moppet format.|$|E

5|$|In 1997 {{the myth}} of Myrrha and Cinyras was one of 24 tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses that were retold by English poet Ted Hughes in his poetical work Tales from Ovid. The work was praised for not {{directly}} translating, but instead retelling the <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> language which was as fresh and new for the audience today as Ovid's texts were to his contemporary audience. Hughes was also complimented on his achievements in using humour or horror when describing Myrrha or a flood, respectively. The work received critical acclaim winning the Whitbread Book Of The Year Award 1997 and being adapted to the stage in 1999, starring Sirine Saba as Myrrha.|$|E
5|$|In Hans Christian Andersen's {{version of}} the story, a bluebird had been viewing Thumbelina's story since the {{beginning}} and had {{been in love with}} her since. In the end, the bird is heartbroken once Thumbelina marries the flower-fairy prince, and flies off eventually arriving at a small house. There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself and chronicles the <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> book.|$|E
5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as time goes on.

Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to tell a <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E

5|$|Nemec's {{character}} replaced Daniel Jackson (portrayed by Michael Shanks) during season6 after Shanks {{had left}} the show amid controversy after season5. The producers based Jonas's motivation to join Stargate Command on his momentary reluctance to actively prevent Daniel's death, and his feelings of responsibility afterwards. Jonas was slowly integrated into the <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prolonged transition stage over {{the first half of}} season6. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season6, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season7. The role of Jonas was reduced to recurring status in season7.|$|E
5|$|Nilo Rodis, who {{had worked}} on two {{previous}} Star Trek features, was appointed the role of art director, and worked with Shatner to establish the film's visual design. Shatner sought a grittier and more realistic feel to the Star Trek universe, and so the two worked together to visualize the film from start to finish. After Shatner explained the entire <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> day-long session, Rodis went home and sketched out each scene from the script. Shatner {{was pleased with the}} results, especially with Rodis' designs for Shatner's most expansive or dramatic shots.|$|E

60|$|My theory {{does not}} wholly {{account for the}} fact (no theory wholly {{accounts}} for any fact), and I own that the same objections would lie from the reader against a number of short <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> magazine. But {{it may be that}} the effect is not the same in the magazine because of the variety in the authorship, and because it would be impossibly jolting to read all the short <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> magazine 'seriatim'. On the other hand, the identity of authorship gives a continuity of attraction to the short <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> book which forms that exhausting strain upon the imagination of the involuntary co-partner.|$|R

5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Gangstas in Space was released. In three missions, players {{continue}} the Saints Row: The Third <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new arc about the Gangstas in Space film referenced {{in the main}} story. In the game, the film about the Saints is being directed by the self-interested Hollywood director Andy Zhen and the player is acting the final scenes of the film alongside a female co-star making her debut. In the first level, the player fights the military to save a female alien and controls the turret on the getaway vehicle. In the second, the player is in a shootout in a linear map. The last mission has the player in an aircraft fighting other aircraft while the co-star uploads viruses to transmitters. At the time of review, the player could not revisit the old missions to earn missed achievements, but was later patched. Costumes and vehicles are unlocked upon completing the pack. The pack was released in North America on February 21, 2012, and in Europe the next day.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{increased}} running time, budget and facilities, the team {{were able to}} include more cels in animations, as well as longer and more intricate action sequences. The film included difficult sequences that Watanabe could not do {{along with the rest}} of the film, so two guest directors were brought in for them: Hiroyuki Okiura, who handled the opening sequence, and Tensai Okamura, who created a cinematic Western shown at a drive-in theater during the film. Watanabe wanted to give the film an Arabic feel, in contrast to the series which often used New York and Hong Kong for inspiration. To this end, Watanabe went on a research trip to Morocco. The character Rashid was based on the guide who had shown the research team round the city. Working on the film was different for Watanabe when compared to the series in a positive way: while he had to put the entire <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> twenty-minute episode for the series, the team were able to create a longer, more detailed narrative.|$|E

5|$|In {{an early}} draft {{of what would}} later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but {{the appearance of a}}n older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; {{this was the first time}} Ito drew illustrations for a book.|$|E
5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on in the moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a large piece of the <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> short amount of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E
5|$|Undead Nightmare is a {{modified}} {{expansion of the}} 2010 video game Red Dead Redemption, an open world Western action-adventure in which the former outlaw John Marston is coerced {{by the federal government}} to capture former members of his gang in exchange for his family's freedom. Undead Nightmare is an alternate timeline expansion that adds a new full-length <b>story</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> zombie horror theme and reworks the base game's environment to appear dark and spooky. As corpses begin to rise from the dead to become flesh-eating zombies, some of the living go into hiding and others become hostile. Marston seeks to find the plague's cause and its cure for his wife and son. The game's story lasts about six hours and includes new cutscenes, voice acting, and music. It is accessed separately from the main game menu with its own save files. It does not share play progress and items from the main game, nor does it require the base game in any form.|$|E
