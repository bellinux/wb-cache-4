50|$|The Plateau <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> (Cnemidophorus septemvittatus) is {{a species}} of lizard found in the {{southern}} United States in Texas, and in northern Mexico in Chihuahua and Coahuila. It is known to hybridize with the Eastern <b>Spotted</b> <b>Whiptail,</b> Cnemidophorus gularis, but {{is considered to be}} a distinct species due to phenotypic characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Like most whiptailed lizards, the Chihuahua <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> is diurnal and insectivorous.|$|E
50|$|The Chihuahuan <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> (Cnemidophorus exsanguis, syn. Aspidoscelis exsanguis) is {{a species}} of lizard native to the United States in {{southern}} Arizona, southern New Mexico and southwestern Texas, and northern Mexico in northern Chihuahua and northern Sonora.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most species}} of <b>whiptail</b> lizard, Trans-Pecos <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptails</b> are diurnal and insectivorous.|$|R
50|$|Texas <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptails</b> grow 6.5 to 11 in {{in total}} length (including tail). They are {{typically}} a tan brown or green-brown in color, with {{a pattern of}} seven distinct grey or white stripes that run {{the length of the}} body, and stop at the tail, with light colored spots along the sides. The underside is uniformly white in color. Males often have a red-colored throat, blue belly, and black or blue patches on the chest, while females have only a pink-colored throat. The tail is long compared to the body, usually close to three times the body length. The tail is usually a uniform peach or tan color.|$|R
50|$|The Texas <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> (Cnemidophorus gularis or Aspidocelis gularis) is {{a species}} of long-tailed lizard native to the {{southern}} United States, in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, and northern Mexico in Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro, and Veracruz.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} {{believed}} to be the result of extensive hybridization between the little striped whiptail, Cnemidophorus inornatus, the plateau <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail,</b> Cnemidophorus septemvittatus, and the western Mexico whiptail, Cnemidophorus costatus. It is one of many lizard species known to be parthenogenetic.|$|E
50|$|The Chihuahuan <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> grows from 9.5 to {{12 inches}} in length. It is {{typically}} a reddish-brown in color, with six lighter colored stripes that run {{the length of}} the body, with spotting between the stripes. The underside is white or sometimes pale blue. It is slender-bodied with a tail nearly three times its body length.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other species}} of whiptail lizard, the Plateau <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> is diurnal and insectivorous. They are wary, energetic, and fast moving, darting for cover if approached. It is found {{primarily}} in semi-arid canyonlands and rocky desert foothills. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring, with females laying eggs in the mid summer, which hatch six to eight weeks later.|$|E
50|$|The Laredo Striped Whiptail (Cnemidophorus laredoensis) is {{a species}} of lizard found in the {{southern}} United States, in Texas, and northern Mexico in Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Some sources {{believe it to be}} the result of extensive hybridization between the Texas <b>Spotted</b> <b>Whiptail,</b> Cnemidophorus gularis, and the Six-lined Racerunner, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus. It is one of many lizard species known to be parthenogenic.|$|E
50|$|Important lowland {{populations of}} {{riparian}} and xeroriparian {{amphibians and reptiles}} are also known to live along the creek. Included in this group are several toads, the checkered garter snake, the Madrean alligator lizard, and the giant <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> lizard. The Mexican garter snake, which has declined throughout its range in the United States, retains a strong population in Ciénega Creek.|$|E
50|$|The Plateau <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> grows from 8 to 12.5 inches. It has {{an overall}} dark green, dark brown or black {{coloration}} with 6-7 cream colored stripes that {{run down the}} body from head to tail, sometimes with white spotting between stripes. Their underside is typically white or pale blue, and females often have an orange throat. They have a slender body, with a tail that is nearly three times their body length.|$|E
50|$|The Trans-Pecos <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> is gray {{or black}} in color, with {{six to eight}} yellow or white stripes which run along the body from head to tail. Unlike other species of whiptail lizards, they have no {{spotting}} between their stripes. Their undersides are white or pale blue in color, and often they have light blue {{on the sides of}} their heads and tails. They are thin-bodied, and have a tail that is typically almost three times the length of their bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{checkered}} whiptail (Cnemidophorus tesselatus) is {{a species}} of lizard found in the southwestern United States in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico, and in northern Mexico in Chihuahua and Coahuila. Many sources believe that the species originated from the hybridization of the marbled whiptail, Cnemidophorus marmoratus, the plateau <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail,</b> Cnemidophorus septemvittatus, and possibly the six-lined racerunner, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus. It {{is one of many}} lizard species known to be parthenogenic. It is sometimes referred to as the common checkered whiptail to differentiate it from several other species known as checkered whiptails.|$|E
40|$|DNA barcoding {{potentially}} offers {{scientists who}} are not expert taxonomists a powerful tool to support the accuracy of field studies involving taxa that are diverse and difficult to identify. The taxonomy of rays has received reasonable attention in Australia, although the fauna in remote locations such as Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia is poorly studied and the identification of some species {{in the field is}} problematic. Here, we report an application of DNA-barcoding to the identification of 16 species (from 10 genera) of tropical rays as part of an ecological study. Analysis of the dataset combined across all samples grouped sequences into clearly defined operational taxonomic units, with two conspicuous exceptions: the Neotrygon kuhlii species complex and the Aetobatus species complex. In the field, the group that presented the most difficulties for identification was the <b>spotted</b> <b>whiptail</b> rays, referred to as the ‘uarnak’ complex. Two sets of problems limited the successful application of DNA barcoding: (1) the presence of cryptic species, species complexes with unresolved taxonomic status and intra-specific geographical variation, and (2) insufficient numbers of entries in online databases that have been verified taxonomically, and the presence of lodged sequences in databases with inconsistent names. Nevertheless, we demonstrate the potential of the DNA barcoding approach to confirm field identifications and to highlight species complexes where taxonomic uncertainty might confound ecological data...|$|E
