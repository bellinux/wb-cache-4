40|$|A reductive {{perturbation}} {{scheme is}} used to derive a generalized non-linear Burgers' equation, which includes the effects of dispersion, in the long wavelength regime for the two-fluid hydrodynamical model used to describe cosmic ray acceleration by the first-order Fermi process in astrophysical <b>shocks.</b> <b>The</b> generalized Burger's equation is derived for both relativistic and non-relativistic cosmic ray <b>shocks,</b> and describes <b>the</b> time evolution of weak <b>shocks</b> in <b>the</b> theory of diffusive <b>shock</b> acceleration. <b>The</b> inclusion of dispersive effects modifies the phase velocity of <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> obtained from <b>the</b> lower order non-linear Burger's equation through the introduction of higher order terms from the long wavelength dispersion equation. The travelling wave solution of the generalized Burgers' equation for a single shock shows that larger cosmic ray pressures result in broader <b>shock</b> transitions. <b>The</b> results for relativistic shocks show a steepening of <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> as <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> speed approaches <b>the</b> relativistic cosmic ray sound speed.

5|$|After a brief {{postponement}} {{because of}} the death of her maternal uncle, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, Victoria married Prince Louis on 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt. Her father did not approve of the match; in his view Prince Louis had little money and would deprive him of his daughter's company, as the couple would naturally live abroad in Britain. However, Victoria was of an independent mind and took little notice of her father's displeasure. Remarkably, that same evening, Victoria's father secretly married his mistress, Countess Alexandrine Hutten-Czapska, the former wife of Alexander von Kolemine, the Russian chargé d'affaires in Darmstadt. His marriage to a divorcee who was not of equal rank <b>shocked</b> <b>the</b> assembled royalty of Europe and through diplomatic and family pressure Victoria's father was forced to seek an annulment of his own marriage.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft <b>shocked</b> <b>the</b> entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E

40|$|Configurations of corotating <b>shocks</b> in <b>the</b> outer {{heliosphere}} are computed on {{the assumption}} that <b>the</b> <b>shocks</b> move at constant speeds between collisions. The basic physical process is the interaction of a forward shock with a reverse <b>shock.</b> <b>The</b> points at which this interaction takes place are determined algebraically in terms of <b>the</b> initial <b>shock</b> positions and speeds. Between the points at which <b>the</b> <b>shocks</b> interact, <b>the</b> <b>shocks</b> have <b>the</b> form of Archimedian spirals. Shock configurations are determined for the case of two corotating shock pairs originating at 2. 5 AU and for a single shock pair at 2. 5 AU. In both cases the heliosphere is divided into several distinct regions distinguished by the number of times the particles have passed through a <b>shock.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> strengths decrease when a forward shock interacts with a reverse shock, corotating shocks are expected to be weaker at larger distances from the sun...|$|R
5|$|Immediately after Wimbledon, Robson {{entered the}} XXV Italiacom Open in Palermo where she reached her first ever WTA semifinal.

She continued her good form in the quarter final, where she emerged victorious against the world No. 41 and No. 5 seed Carla Suárez Navarro in three sets. However, her run came to an end when she lost in the semifinals to Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová in three sets. Robson then received a wild card to enter the main draw of the Swedish Open but lost her first match against Anabel Medina Garrigues.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century {{movement}} {{in the tradition of}} European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, <b>shocked</b> <b>the</b> public and transformed the U.S. art scene. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.|$|E
5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she <b>shocked</b> <b>the</b> court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{vigorous}} political {{debate in the}} 1790s was sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France in November 1790. Most commentators in Britain expected Burke to support the French revolutionaries, because he had previously {{been part of the}} liberal Whig party, a critic of monarchical power, a supporter of the American revolutionaries, and a prosecutor of government malfeasance in India. When he failed to do so, it <b>shocked</b> <b>the</b> populace and angered his friends and supporters. Burke's book, despite being priced at an expensive three shillings, sold an astonishing 30,000 copies in two years. Thomas Paine's famous response, The Rights of Man (1792), which became the rallying cry for thousands, however, greatly surpassed it, selling upwards of 200,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|The Sack of Damietta was a {{successful}} raid on {{the port city of}} Damietta on the Nile Delta by the Byzantine navy on 22–24 May 853. The city, whose garrison was absent at the time, was sacked and plundered, yielding not only many captives but also large quantities of weapons and supplies intended for the Emirate of Crete. The Byzantine attack, which was repeated in the subsequent years, <b>shocked</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid authorities, and urgent measures were taken to refortify the coasts and strengthen the local fleet, beginning a revival of the Egyptian navy that culminated in the Tulunid and Fatimid periods.|$|E
5|$|The finals system {{meant that}} they would have to play their finals match in England against English Super League club Wigan. The Mariners <b>shocked</b> <b>the</b> club and the league by winning 22–18. That score line would again be {{repeated}} in the grand final qualifier against Australian club Cronulla, another match the Mariners were expected to lose. But the Mariners were able to defeat the Australian Super League runners-up to take themselves to the grand final of the competition. Against the winners of the Super League grand final, Brisbane, the Mariners were blown away by the competition favourites. In what would be their final rugby league match as a club, the Mariners were down at half-time 26–4 and the final scoreline of 36–12 prevented the Mariners taking out a A$1 million prize.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the propagation}} of converging cylindrical shock waves in a nonideal gas, {{in the presence of}} an axial magnetic field. Chester-Chisnell-Whitham’s method has been employed to determine <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> velocity and <b>the</b> other flow-variables just behind <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> in <b>the</b> cases, when (i) the gas is weakly ionised before and behind <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> front, (ii) <b>the</b> gas is strongly ionised before and behind <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> front, and (iii) nonionised gas undergoes intense ionisation {{as a result of the}} passage of <b>the</b> <b>shock.</b> <b>The</b> effects of the nonidealness of the gas, the conductivity of the gas, and the axial magnetic field have been investigated. It is found that in the case (i), an increase in the value of parameter () characterising the nonidealness of the gas accelerates the convergence of <b>the</b> <b>shock.</b> In <b>the</b> case (ii), <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> speed and pressure behind <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> increase very fast as the axis is approached; and this increase occurs earlier if the strength of the initial magnetic field is increased. In the case (iii), for smaller values of the initial magnetic field, <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> speed, and pressure behind <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> decrease very fast after attaining a maximum; and for higher values of the initial magnetic field, the tendency of decrease appears from the beginning. This shows that the magnetic field has damping effect on <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> propagation. In <b>the</b> case (iii), it was also found that the growth of <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> in <b>the</b> initial phase and decay in the last phase were faster when it was converging in a nonideal gas in comparison with that in a perfect gas. Further, it has been shown that the gas-ionising nature of <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> has damping effect on its convergence...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulation {{with the}} realistic ion-to-electron mass ratio of 1836 {{is carried out}} to investigate <b>the</b> electrostatic collisionless <b>shocks</b> in relatively high-speed (~ 3000 km s^- 1) plasma flows and also the influence of both electrostatic and electromagnetic instabilities, which can develop around <b>the</b> <b>shocks,</b> on <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> dynamics.
