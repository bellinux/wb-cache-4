2500|$|The {{restoration}} of Middleton Place began in 1916 when Middleton descendant John Julius Pringle Smith (18871969) {{and his wife}} Heningham began several decades of meticulously rebuilding the plantation's gardens. They had New York architect Bancel LaFarge design a stableyard complex of barn, <b>stable,</b> <b>work</b> buildings, and cottages; the buildings were constructed of brick salvaged from the ruined main house. In the early 1970s, approximately [...] of the [...] plantation including the south flanker, the gardens, and several outbuildings {{were placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places. During the same period the Middleton descendants transferred ownership of the historic district to the non-profit Middleton Place Foundation, which presently maintains the site.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1933, Cleveland {{high school}} student Jerry Siegel wrote a short story, {{illustrated}} by his friend and classmate Joe Shuster, titled [...] "The Reign of the Superman", which Siegel self-published in his fanzine, Science Fiction. The titular character is a vagrant who gains vast psychic powers from an experimental drug and uses them maliciously for profit and amusement, only to lose them and become a vagrant again, ashamed {{that he will be}} remembered only as a villain. Siegel's fanzine did not sell well. Siegel and Shuster shifted to making comic strips, which they self-published in a book they called Popular Comics. The pair dreamed of becoming professional authors and believed that syndicated newspaper strips offered more lucrative and <b>stable</b> <b>work</b> than pulp magazines. The art quality standards were also lower, making them more accessible to the inexperienced Shuster.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} secure employment, either in one's current job or {{in a job}} that utilises a person's skills in the most {{socially}} productive way, is usually seen as crucial {{for the success of}} the economy and human development. The aim is to counterbalance the destructive effect on productivity and social costs that come from abuse of managerial power. Consistent with minimal international standards, employees in the United Kingdom have three principal job security rights, introduced originally by the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 and the Industrial Relations Act 1971. First, after one month's work an employee must have at least one week's notice before any dismissal, unless there has been gross misconduct. This minimum rises to two weeks after two years, three weeks after three years, and so on, up to twelve weeks after twelve years. Second, after two years' work, the dismissal must be fair. This means the employer must have a justification based on an employee's capability, conduct, redundancy or another good reason, or the employee can claim damages or the job back from an Employment Tribunal. Third, also after two years' work and if dismissed because the enterprise no longer needs someone doing the employee's job, there is a right to a redundancy payment. Like the notice period, redundancy pay increases according to the number of years worked. Contracts should usually go beyond this bare minimum, but cannot go below. Compared to its European and Commonwealth counterparts, jobs in the UK are relatively insecure. Workers have few ways, except pressure through collective bargaining, to challenge a management's decision about dismissals before they take place. When collective redundancies are proposed, however, EU law has introduced a requirement that employers consult on changes. EU law also introduced a rule that if a business is transferred, for instance, during a merger or acquisition, employees may not have their terms worsened or lose their jobs without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. If employees do lose their work, they may fall back on a minimal system of state insurance, funded primarily through income tax or National Insurance, to collect a [...] "jobseekers allowance", and may make use of public employment agencies to find employment again. The UK government has in the past aimed to create [...] "full employment" [...] however this goal has not necessarily translated into secure and <b>stable</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} employment patterns on weight gain and weight loss in young adult women. Methods Study sample is 5164 participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health who completed surveys in 2003 and 2006. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of weight change. Results The adjusted odds of gaining weight, compared with women in <b>stable</b> full-time <b>work</b> (49. 7 %), were lower for women in <b>stable</b> part-time <b>work</b> (47. 3 %, OR = 0. 74, CI: 0. 58 – 0. 94), or who transitioned from not in the labour force (NILF) to part-time (42. 8 %, OR = 0. 68, CI: 0. 47 – 0. 99) or full-time (37. 5 %, OR = 0. 54, CI: 0. 34 – 0. 85) work. Heavy weight gain (> 10 kg) was less likely among women in <b>stable</b> part-time <b>work</b> (6. 4 %, OR = 0. 59, CI: 0. 37 – 0. 93) compared with those in <b>stable</b> full-time <b>work</b> (8. 1 %). The likelihood of weight loss compared with women in stable full-time employment (22. 4 %) was higher among stable part-time workers (28. 4 % OR = 1. 34, CI: 1. 02 – 1. 75) and those who transitioned from full-time to part-time work (24. 8 %, OR = 1. 30, CI: 1. 01 – 1. 67). Discussion The lower likelihood of heavy weight gain associated with fewer work hours suggests more time spent at work may contribute to weight gain. Young women in full-time employment may benefit from workplace interventions supporting healthier lifestyles...|$|R
