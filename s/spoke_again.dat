5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} in Jalisco, Mexico. His father, Antonio del Valle, was {{a soldier in the}} Spanish army who came to California in 1819 and was mayordomo (administrator and/or foreman) of Mission San Fernando Rey de España. Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at the Presidio of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was {{promoted}} to second lieutenant and transferred to the Presidio of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved in a power struggle with the commandant of the Presidio of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing a rift between father and son, and they never <b>spoke</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two never <b>spoke</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since 1789, {{the press}} had been speculating that Garrow, a Whig, would enter Parliament; however {{he was first}} elected in 1805 for Gatton. This was a rotten borough, with Garrow {{appointed}} to {{serve the interests of}} his patron. After his entry into politics Garrow at first paid little attention, not making his maiden speech until 22 April 1806, when he opposed a charge for the impeachment of Marquess Wellesley. He <b>spoke</b> <b>again</b> on 18 June 1806 on a legal technicality, and after that did not intervene for another six years. Braby and other sources indicate that he did not enjoy his time in Parliament, and was rarely there unless required to conduct some business.|$|E
6000|$|The Malay {{revolved}} the <b>spokes</b> <b>again</b> with disdainful obedience, and the red-faced man {{was moving}} forward grunting to himself, when {{through the open}} skylight the hail [...] "On deck there!" [...] arrested him short, attentive, and with a sudden change to amiability in the expression of his face.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the captain}} <b>spoke</b> up <b>again,</b> and I thought {{his voice was}} a little changed.|$|R
60|$|As she <b>spoke</b> {{darkness}} <b>again</b> obscured everything, {{and they}} could do naught but listen to the terrible sounds--and pray.|$|R
5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then <b>spoke</b> <b>again,</b> rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, after a {{brief period}} as an actor, Anderson began another world tour. In 1862, {{at the age of}} eighteen, John Henry Jr. left his father's troupe and began his own {{independent}} career as a conjuror. This started a bitter feud between father and son and the two never <b>spoke</b> <b>again.</b> Greatly in debt, Anderson returned to England in 1864. He would tour once more in 1866.|$|E
25|$|Macleod {{returned}} to Scotland in 1928 to become Regius Professor of Physiology (in succession {{to his former}} teacher, Prof. John Alexander MacWilliam who retired in 1927) and later Dean of the University of Aberdeen Medical Faculty. Between 1929 and 1933 {{he was also a}} member of the Medical Research Council. He wrote a report on the discovery in 1922 to explain his side of the story, but otherwise refrained from active involvement in controversy about credit. Banting hated him passionately, and the two never <b>spoke</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Three men ran aft to the wheel, but {{the deadly}} rifles <b>spoke</b> out <b>again.</b> Two of them fell. The third dived under the bulwark, for shelter.|$|R
50|$|Muthee {{returned}} to the Wasilla church as a guest speaker for the weekend of September 20-22, 2008. He <b>spoke</b> there <b>again</b> in October 2010, with video footage available on the church's website.|$|R
60|$|He {{was looking}} at her with mild fixedness while he <b>spoke,</b> and <b>again</b> she felt that subtle mysterious {{influence}} of a personality by which it has been given to some rare men to move their fellows.|$|R
25|$|Sheringham's {{first season}} at Old Trafford was {{difficult}} - although he scored 14 goals in all competitions {{he failed to}} meet expectations as the 1997–98 season ended without the league title. Towards {{the end of the}} season, during a game at Bolton Wanderers, an incident occurred that furthered the animosity with fellow striker Andy Cole. When Bolton scored, Sheringham blamed Cole, his strike partner and Cole then refused to talk to him. The breakdown in their relationship was never resolved, and reputedly they never <b>spoke</b> <b>again.</b> This had started three years previously in 1995 when Sheringham had snubbed Cole as the latter came on to make his international debut.|$|E
25|$|During {{the voyage}} home in March 1925, news {{came to the}} ship that Friedrich Ebert had died – {{and for the first}} time Adolf Hitler <b>spoke</b> <b>again</b> openly in Munich. His April engagements complete, and with Maria back, Erb {{returned}} to Munich ready to resume his work. But Bruno Walter had left Munich for the Berlin-Charlottenburg Städtische Oper in 1922: his successor Hans Knappertsbusch had little time for the Swabian tenor, whose contract expired in summer 1925. It was not renewed. After 12 years at Munich he was permitted a farewell (15 June) in Das Nachtlager in Granada (hardly a showcase) and Erb, who loved Munich, left in bitterness. A year later his baritone colleague Brodersen died, and was replaced by Heinrich Rehkemper: the bass , at Munich since 1903, remained.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} began with RYM I and II meeting in an {{opposite}} wing than PL, on different {{sides of the}} Coliseum. As discussion eventually resumed between the two groups, “it {{became clear that the}} expulsion of PL was inevitable”. Dohrn <b>spoke</b> <b>again</b> about Third World Struggles and anti-imperialism, things of which PL had no concern. She ended her speech with the proclamation that SDS “was becoming a revolutionary movement; and as such, it could not allow a group such as PL in its ranks”. Chanting began again, with PL fighting for their beliefs; however, it was basically over. “Although they controlled a third of the delegates at the final SDS convention,” the reality was that PL “had a presence in only a handful of the locations where SDS was active, and everyone knew it. It was over.”.|$|E
60|$|Spike started, and {{he mused}} in silence some little time, ere he <b>again</b> <b>spoke.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Seneca <b>again</b> <b>spoke,</b> {{and after}} a {{consultation}} with Peter laid in his paddle.|$|R
60|$|But {{his friends}} did not understand, {{and soon they}} <b>spoke</b> to him <b>again</b> about it.|$|R
25|$|A {{little more}} than a year before his death, Minkowski {{introduced}} his geometric interpretation of spacetime to the public on November 5, 1907 in a lecture to the Göttingen Mathematical society with the title, The Relativity Principle (Das Relativitätsprinzip). In the original version of this lecture, Minkowski continued to use such obsolescent terms as the ether, but the posthumous publication in 1915 of this lecture in the Annals of Physics (Annalen der Physik) was edited by Sommerfeld to remove this term. Sommerfeld also edited the published form of this lecture to revise Minkowski's judgement of Einstein from being a mere clarifier of the principle of relativity, to being its chief expositor. On December 21, 1907, Minkowski <b>spoke</b> <b>again</b> to the Göttingen scientific society, and on September 21, 1908, Minkowski presented his famous talk, Space and Time (Raum und Zeit), to the German Society of Scientists and Physicians.|$|E
25|$|By {{shuffling}} his cabinet, Jackson {{hoped to}} keep the talented McLane in his service by removing from him the obligation to implement his planned permanent destruction of the Second Bank of the United States. Appointed U.S. Secretary of State in a recess appointment, McLane served from May 29, 1833 until June 30, 1834. He quickly managed the first major reorganization of the department, by establishing seven new bureaus. He also managed a dispute with France, over what were known as the “Spoliation Claims”. In 1832 France had agreed to reimburse the United States for certain shipping losses incurred during the Napoleonic Wars. However, successive French governments had failed to appropriate the funds required, all the while maintaining their desire to do so. Jackson was impatient {{to resolve the issue}} and worked with McLane to develop a hard line policy, confronting the French. Martin Van Buren was now Vice President and felt otherwise. Without consulting McLane, he intervened directly and convinced Jackson to give the French more time. McLane was furious with his old mentor for this intervention, and resigned his position, recognizing his apparent lack of authority in a direct area of responsibility. The incident also ended his friendship with Van Buren, and they never <b>spoke</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
500|$|Alone {{aboard the}} Plancus, Amir made the three-day boat trip to Java. Upon {{arriving}} at Batavia, he enrolled at a Christian MULO there, where he completed {{his last year}} of junior high school. Anthony H. Johns of Australian National University writes that he learned some Christian concepts and values. Also in Batavia, Amir became involved with the social organisation Jong Sumatera. During this period, the young man wrote his first poems. Husny credits several to his heartbreak after he found that Aja Bun had been married to another man without Amir's knowing (the two never <b>spoke</b> <b>again),</b> while Dini suggests that the poem [...] "Tinggallah" [...] was written not long after he boarded the Plancus, while he was longing after his parents.|$|E
60|$|But she had {{disappeared}} through a side door, {{and he never}} <b>spoke</b> to her <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} for a moment. Sir Lucius would not disturb it, and Mrs. Dallington <b>again</b> <b>spoke.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He stopped short. [...] "He {{will never}} believe the story," [...] he thought. [...] "He will only think I am taking {{him for a}} fool and get offended." [...] General D'Hubert <b>spoke</b> up <b>again.</b> [...] "Yes, {{originating}} in youthful folly it has become..." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I {{was rather}} taken aback {{when the doctor}} entered the Anfield boot room", Wark said. [...] "He was small in stature and I {{could not help but}} detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as he {{introduced}} himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. [...] "He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. [...] "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he <b>spoke</b> <b>again,</b> this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical." ...|$|E
500|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4, Ray Davies said {{of a possible}} reunion, [...] "There is a desire to do it", but that he wouldn't participate {{if it were a}} nostalgia act: [...] "The thing that would make me decide 'yes' or 'no' would be whether or not we could do new songs". He added that the main barrier to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke. Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved. In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion. That same month, Ray Davies <b>spoke</b> <b>again</b> about the possibility of performing with his brother: [...] "I suggested he do some low-key shows to see how well he can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with a big-time announcement.... But, if Dave feels good about it and there's good new material that we can write, it'll happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Her church trial {{took place}} at the Boston meeting house on two {{consecutive}} Thursdays in March 1638. [...] Hutchinson was accused of numerous theological errors of which only four were covered during the first day, so the trial was scheduled to continue the following week, when Wilson took an active part in the proceedings. [...] During this second day of interrogation a week later, Hutchinson read a carefully written recantation of her theological errors. [...] Had the trial ended there, she would have likely remained in communion with the church, with the possibility of even returning there some day. [...] Wilson, however, did not accept this recantation, and he re-opened a line of questioning from the previous week. [...] With this, a new onslaught began, and when later given the opportunity, Wilson said, [...] "... your errors...is the slightinge of Gods faythfull Ministers and contenminge and cryinge down them as Nobodies." [...] Hugh Peter chimed in, followed by Thomas Shepard, and then Wilson <b>spoke</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "I cannot but reverence and adore the wise hand of God...in leavinge our sister to pride and Lyinge." [...] Then John Eliot made his statement, and Wilson resumed, [...] "Consider how we cane...longer suffer her to goe on still in seducinge to seduce, and in deacevinge to deaceve, and in lyinge to lye!" ...|$|E
5000|$|And a voice <b>spoke</b> to him <b>again</b> {{the second}} time, “What God has {{cleansed}} {{you must not}} call common.” ...|$|R

60|$|Rose looked up, and {{she looked}} pleased. Then she mused in silence, for some time, when she <b>again</b> <b>spoke.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{revolution}} could [...] divide families. The {{most dramatic}} example was when William Franklin, son of Benjamin Franklin and royal {{governor of the}} Province of New Jersey, remained loyal to the Crown throughout the war; they never <b>spoke</b> <b>again.</b> Recent immigrants {{who had not been}} fully Americanized were also inclined to support the King, such as recent Scottish settlers in the back country; among the more striking examples of this, see Flora MacDonald.|$|E
2500|$|Ferrara warned Donati {{that he was}} {{in deeper}} than he thought, and {{strongly}} suggested he get out of Boston for his own good. Donati reassured him that he could hold on. [...] "Don't worry," [...] his associate attempted to reassure him. [...] "I've buried the stuff. Once this blows over, I'll find the right person to negotiate with." [...] It is unknown if Donati ever made such overtures to anyone; he and Ferrara never <b>spoke</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Canada, Mulroney demanded Bouchard clarify the remark or resign, and Bouchard {{supplied}} a lengthy letter of resignation on May 22, 1990. The two men, who had been close friends since attending Laval University together, never <b>spoke</b> <b>again.</b> Bouchard sat as an independent. [...] He made a speech in defence of the original Meech accord and stated that without it, sovereignty was the only option. Bourassa announced his support of Bouchard's action from the National Assembly, and said it provided a clear warning to English Canada of what would occur if Meech failed.|$|E

6000|$|Dr. May <b>spoke</b> once <b>again.</b> [...] "Don't let any {{one long}} for {{external}} trial. The offering {{of a free}} heart is the thing. To offer praise is the great object of all creatures in heaven and earth. If the happier we are, the more we praise, then all is well." ...|$|R
