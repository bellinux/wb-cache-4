40|$|A new {{single step}} direct-write {{photomask}} {{process has been}} proposed by using Bi/In bimetallic thermal resist which turns almost transparent with high energy laser exposure. The Bi over In metallic films, each layer ~ 40 nm thick, were DCsputtered onto quartz mask plate substrates in a single pump-down chamber. Before laser exposure the Bi/In had 2. 91 Optical Density. Bi/In is a bimetallic thermal resist and hence shows near wavelength invariance exposure sensitivity from Near IR to UV light. For Bi/In exposure, up to 0. 9 W Argon laser (514 nm) beam was focused by an f= 50 mm lens to a 10 micron spot. When writing a mask the Bi/In coated sample was placed on a computer-controlled high accuracy X-Y table and the pattern was raster-scanned by the laser at 10 mm/sec. After exposure the Bi/In film became nearly transparent (0. 26 OD) at I-line (365 nm) wavelength, and remained conductive. Bi/In photomasks have been used together with a <b>standard</b> <b>mask</b> aligner to pattern the oxide and Al layer during the manufacturing of test solar cell devices in the lab.

40|$|By {{applying}} special {{thick film}} photolithography {{it is possible}} to realize a highly automative ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) packaging at the wafer level. In this paper two approaches based on photolithographic processing of encapsulating layers are presented. A lift-off method of commercial thermocurable encapsulants has been investigated, as well as direct photopolymerization of ultraviolet-curable encapsulant compositions, containing either epoxy acrylate or polyurethane acrylate oligomers together with monomers and photoinitiators. Lift-off has been developed using either thin or thick photoresist sacrificial layers. The best compatibility implies thick photosensitive polyimide layers as a sac-rificial photoresist together with the encapsulant material based on alumina-filled epoxy. However, better results are obtained by using photopatternable encapsulant polymers that permit application of thin or thick polymer layers on a wafer substrate containing ISFET chips.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} patterning fine line interconnections over non-planar surfaces and introduces {{the idea of using}} holographic masks for more challenging geometries. Design/methodology/approach – A photolithographic method for achieving grossly non-planar interconnects is described. The patterning of electrical interconnections onto the piezo-electric actuators of an ink-jet print head is used as an example. Uniform coverage of the substrate is achieved using an electro-depositable photoresist. The required pattern is transferred via a custom-designed chrome-on-glass mask using a <b>standard</b> <b>mask</b> aligner. Findings – Large arrays of 100 ?µm-pitch electrical interconnections were successfully deposited onto 500 ?µm-high high piezo-electric actuators. It was necessary to modify the shapes of the line segments on the mask in order to compensate for diffractive line broadening. For more extreme 3 D geometries it becomes necessary to consider the use of holographic masks. Originality/value – Printed circuit boards and semiconductor wafers are nominally flat and traditional lithographic processes have been developed accordingly. However, future microelectronic packaging schemes and microsystems may require patterning to be achieved on grossly non-planar surfaces. We have demonstrated that this can be achieved on ink-jet print heads using photolithography and point to the research necessary to enable it to be realised on more extreme non-planar substrates...|$|E

40|$|One and two {{dimensional}} grating structures with submicron period {{have a huge}} number of applications in optics and photonics. Such structures are conventionally fabricated using interference or e-beam lithography. However, both technologies have significant drawbacks. Interference lithography is limited to rather simple geometries and the sequential writing scheme of e-beam lithography leads to time consuming exposures for each grating. We present a novel fabrication technique for this class of microstructures which is based on proximity lithography in a mask aligner. The technology is capable to pattern a complete wafer within less than one minute of exposure time and offers thereby high lateral resolution and a reliable process. Our advancements compared to <b>standard</b> <b>mask</b> aligner lithography are twofold: First of all, we are using periodic binary phase masks instead of chromium masks to generate an aerial image of high resolution and exceptional light efficiency at cert ain distances behind the mask. Second, a special mask aligner illumination set-up is employed which allows to precisely control the incidence angles of the exposure light. This degree of freedom allows both, to shape the aerial image (e. g. transformation of a periodic spot pattern into a chessboard pattern) and to increase its depth of focus considerably. That way, our technology enables the fabrication of high quality gratings with arbitrary geometry in a fast and stable wafer scale process...|$|E
40|$|During the {{development}} of process generations with critical dimensions (CDs) around or even far below the wavelength used for printing, the wafer exposure step has {{become more and more}} complicated due to the non-linearities that occur within this sub-wavelength regime. These non-linearities give rise to a variety of optical-proximity effects (OPE) that must then be corrected for (optical-proximity correction, OPC). At the same time, the reticle errors are consuming a larger part of the total error budget on the wafer than {{we have seen in the}} past. As a consequence, detailed assessments of the reticle quality are gaining more importance and the average number of measurements for qualification of a high-end reticle is rapidly increasing. Within-die CD measurements are becoming common practice for such reticles. Quite often these measurement points are selected randomly. However, regions within the design with relatively low aerial-image contrast during imaging will be subject to the largest amplification of the mask-errors (highest Mask-Error-Enhancement Factor, MEEF). In this work a solution is presented in which measurement points with high MEEF-values can be selected from any given layout data. The method is embedded into the <b>standard</b> <b>mask</b> data preparation flow using CATS TM.

40|$|Background and Aims: Face mask {{ventilation}} of the edentulous {{patient is}} often difficult as ineffective seating of the <b>standard</b> <b>mask</b> to the face prevents attainment of an adequate air seal. The efficacy of nasal ventilation in edentulous patients has been cited in case reports but has never been investigated. Material and Methods: Consecutive edentulous adult patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, during a 17 -month period, were prospectively evaluated. After induction of anesthesia and administration of neuromuscular blocker, lungs were ventilated with a standard anatomical face mask of appropriate size, using a volume controlled anesthesia ventilator with tidal volume set at 10 ml/kg. In case of inadequate ventilation, the mask position was adjusted to achieve best-fit. Inspired and expired tidal volumes were measured. Thereafter, the face mask {{was replaced by a}} nasal mask and after achieving best-fit, the inspired and expired tidal volumes were recorded. The difference in expired tidal volumes and airway pressures at best-fit {{with the use of the}} two masks and number of patients with inadequate ventilation with use of the masks were statistically analyzed. Results: A total of 79 edentulous patients were recruited for the study. The difference in expiratory tidal volumes with the use of the two masks at best-fit was statistically significant (P = 0. 0017). Despite the best-fit mask placement, adequacy of ventilation could not be achieved in 24. 1 % patients during face mask ventilation, and 12. 7 % patients during nasal mask ventilation and the difference was statistically significant.

Design – Prospective, randomized clinical study. Setting – University teaching hospital. Animals – Sixteen client-owned dogs without evidence of cardiopulmonary disease were studied. Interventions – Eight animals {{were randomly assigned to}} each of 2 treatment groups: group A received 2. 5 cmH 2 O CPAP and group B received 5 cmH 2 O CPAP after first receiving oxygen (5 L/min) by a regular face mask.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} investigation into the electrical properties of two types of G 4 -DNA and several DNA-based molecules, targeting them as candidates for molecular wires and devices. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) comparison of co-deposited tetra- and intra-molecular G 4 -DNA reveals variations in morphology and different sensitivity to the applied electric field, suggesting that the folding orientation of the strands affects the molecular structure, i. e. either the tetrad unit or the tetrad-tetrad stacking or both, and therefore the charge mobility. Tetra-molecular G 4 -DNA is found to be twice as polarizable as intra-molecular G 4 -DNA, suggesting it has greater charge mobility. These promising results motivated direct electrical transport measurements on tetra-molecular G 4 -DNA using a special conductive AFM setup, profiling the conductance along the molecule. Reproducible currents of tens to over 100 pA were measured in many tetra-molecular G 4 -DNA molecules over distances ranging from tens to over 100 nm. The measured charge transport is compatible with long-range thermally activated hopping between multi-tetrad segments. To form the stationary electrical contact, a new variant of stencil lithography was developed, based on reversible electrostatic clamping, overcoming indeterminate blurring effects associated with the problem of metal penetration in <b>standard</b> <b>mask</b> patterning techniques. This method enabled to demonstrate full mask compliance in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM measurements. The pull-in instability was demonstrated inside an SEM chamber and was confirmed by a non-linear transient response computation. New mechanisms were proposed for the replica formation and the blurring effect based on cluster evaporation and mobile source decay, explaining the ultimate resolution of the masking technique and its limitations.

40|$|Quantum {{parasitic}} {{effects and}} miniaturization of Single Photon Avalanche Diodes in deep-submicron technologies {{have been studied}} in this thesis in detail. Tunneling noise and Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) noise have been the main two parasitic effects addressed comprehensively. While the fundamental equations for tunneling count rate in SPADs have been presented, the tunneling study has been performed by comparing two different topologies of SPADs on the same technology. The tunneling evaluation has been performed by implementing a new n-tub guard ring SPAD in 0. 35 ?m standard CMOS technology. The NTGR SPAD has been characterized theoretically by simulations, and experiments. The tunneling noise effects have been verified in the I-V characteristics and Dark Count Rate responses of the new NTGR SPAD. While the NTGR SPAD has shown 3 % improvement in the maximum Photon Detection Probability (PDP), the timing jitter Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) has been increased from 80 ps in p-tub guard ring SPAD to 152 ps in the NTGR SPAD. The breakdown voltage has been decreased 4. 1 V due to using different doping profiles for NTGR SPAD implementation. Avalanche photoemission of the active area of NTGR SPAD demonstrated the ability for single photon detection {{in comparison with the}} other diodes, which show photoemssion in guard rings as a sign of Premature Edge Breakdown (PEB). The second parasitic effect which has been studied in this thesis was the RTS behavior of dark count rate (DCR); this is characterized as a bistability and multistability of DCR. RTS behavior of DCR has been observed in a SPAD fabricated in 0. 8 ?m CMOS technology and in four proton-irradiated SPADs designed and fabricated in 0. 35 ?m CMOS technology. To the best of our knowledge, {{this was the first time}} RTS behavior of DCR has been reported in SPADs in any CMOS technology. RTS characteristics have been evaluated experimentally and verified theoretically with respect to the bias and temperature. The RTS hypothesis of the fluctuations has been verified by measurements that have been in excellent agreement with the theory. The RTS behavior is expected to affect large array of SPAD detectors being used for 3 D imaging applications. Demonstrating the functionality of SPADs in deep-submicron technologies has been the second main challenge of this thesis. We have demonstrated that singlephoton detectors can be fabricated in commercial deep-submicron CMOS processes. Miniaturization has been explored with the first SPAD designed and successfully tested in technologies smaller than 130 nm. The proposed structures, implemented in 90 nm standard CMOS technology, emerged from a systematic study aimed at miniaturization, while optimizing overall performance. The guard ring design has been the result of an extensive modeling effort aimed at constraining the multiplication region within a well-defined area where the electric field exceeds the critical value for impact ionization. By implementing different SPAD structures, we have studied the geometric trade-offs involved in the design of deep-submicron SPADs. Numerous SPADs with different arrangements of doping layers and different guard ring sizes have been implemented. Among them, as many as 45 structures were functional with a range of well-defined, reproducible breakdown voltages. The implemented structures have also been simulated and characterized. The detectors feature an octagonal multiplication region and a guard ring to prevent PEB using a <b>standard</b> <b>mask</b> set, exclusively. The proposed structure emerged from a systematic study aimed at miniaturization, while optimizing the overall performance. The devices exhibit a DCR of 8. 1 kHz, a maximum PDP of 14 % at maximum excess bias. At 0. 13 V of excess bias, a PDP of 9 % and a jitter of 398 ps at a wavelength of 637 nm, were measured at room temperature. An afterpulsing probability of 32 % was measured at the nominal dead time. The main weak point of SPADs which have been demonstrated in this thesis in 90 nm technology was the lack of isolation with the substrate, while different solutions have been proposed confining the NTGR SPAD, not to communicate with the substrate. Simulation based analysis of SPADs designed in 65 nm CMOS technology has been described in the last section. The design of SPADs in 65 nm technology was based on the characterization results of functional SPADs in 90 nm technology. While implementation of SPADs in imaging CMOS technologies can lead to better performance due to the special layers, one of the main achievements of this thesis has been the demonstration of SPAD in a standard CMOS technology without employment of imaging doping layers. Because of the isolation issues described above, novel circuits have been implemented for the SPAD quenching and pulse detection.

Results showed no masked priming facilitation for opaque forms {{in the presence of a}} semantic prime, indicating that context can influence early morphological analysis. Priming was found for both semantically transparent and opaque forms (farmer-farm, witness-wit) when there was no semantically-related context, consistent with the literature and an account positing early blind segmentation. These findings provide an important update to the long-standing debate on early morphological processing in written word recognition...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} an image region to hide or mask a given target signal {{continues}} to {{play a key role}} in the design of numerous image processing and vision systems. However, current state-of-the-art models of visual masking have been optimized for artificial targets placed upon unnatural backgrounds. In this paper, we (1) measure the ability of natural-image patches in masking distortion; (2) analyze the performance of a widely accepted <b>standard</b> <b>masking</b> model in predicting these data; and (3) report optimal model parameters for different patch types (textures, structures, and edges). Our results reveal that the <b>standard</b> model of <b>masking</b> does not generalize across image type; rather, a proper model should be coupled with a classification scheme which can adapt the model parameters based on the type of content contained in local image patches. The utility of this adaptive approach is demonstrated via a spatially adaptive compression algorithm which employs patch-based classification. Despite the addition of extra side information and the high degree of spatial adaptivity, this approach yields an efficient wavelet compression strategy that can be combined with very accurate rate-control procedures.

40|$|To date it {{is unclear}} whether (1) awareness-independent non-evaluative {{semantic}} processes influence affective semantics and whether (2) awareness-independent affective semantics influence non-evaluative semantic processing. In the current study, we investigated these questions with the help of subliminal (masked) primes and visible targets in a space-valence across-category congruence effect. In line with (1), we found that subliminal space prime words influenced valence classification of supraliminal target words (Experiment 1) : Classifications were faster with a congruent prime (e. g., the prime ‘up’ before the target ‘happy’) than with an incongruent prime (e. g., the prime ‘up’ before the target ‘sad’). In contrast to (2), no influence of subliminal valence primes on the classification of supraliminal space targets into up- and down-words was found (Experiment 2). Control conditions showed that <b>standard</b> <b>masked</b> response-priming effects were found with both subliminal prime types, and that an across-category congruence effect was also found with supraliminal valence primes and spatial target words. The final Experiment 3 confirmed that the across-category congruence effect indeed reflected priming of target categorization of a relevant meaning category. Together, the data jointly confirmed prediction (1) that awareness-independent non-evaluative semantic priming influences valence judgments...|$|R
