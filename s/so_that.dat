5|$|However as {{the army}} took shape, French {{officers}} were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust. Crucially, {{some of these}} officers had little experience in working together as a unified force, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> support for other units was often not given.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides <b>so</b> <b>that</b> by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
5|$|The stages were {{shortened}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> no night riding occurred.|$|E

5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters could indicate their choice and the rules on allowable markings were relaxed, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> Deputy Returning Officers would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots.

5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they would be harder to attack and <b>so</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be more}} difficult to take UN personnel hostage.
