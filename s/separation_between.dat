5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> the de-oxygenated {{bloodstream}} destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a <b>separation</b> <b>between</b> the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E

These separations are obtained in appropriately high complexity classes where these questions do not have contradictory relativizations. Our results show that the notion of completeness under random reductions is sensitive tovery smallchanges in success probability, since we can separate completeness under reductions with very small differ- ences in success probability.

In [4], we proposed a polynomial-time approximate algorithm for computing bounds on the <b>separations</b> <b>between</b> all pairs of events in acyclic timing constraint graphs. This paper describes applications of our algorithm to two interesting problems: (i) a buffered producer-consumer system, and (ii) a multiprocessor system operating under different scheduling and buffering schemes. We describe how the temporal behavior of each system is modeled using min and max constraints in a timing constraint graph. The resulting graph is analyzed using the algorithm of [4] to answer several important questions about the system...|$|R
