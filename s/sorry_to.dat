However, Dot discovers that Nick is only there for her money. She refuses to pay him, so he tells her if she does not, she cannot see Dotty. Dot gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty. It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill Dot for her life insurance. They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia, but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot. In a rage, Nick holds various members of the community hostage, resulting in an explosion in Kathy's café. Nick survives and after being disowned again by Dot, he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing. Dotty is retrieved by her mother, Sandy (Caroline Pegg), following various devious deeds, such as accusing Dot of beating her, which leads to Dot being questioned by the police for child abuse.

25|$|The {{neatness}} of his attire {{was almost}} incredible; I believe {{a speck of}} dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound.

25|$|His {{leadership}} of the group had been strong and colorful. He had been rough on {{those who did not}} produce but fine to those who had.

25|$|You {{always told}} us to remain here {{and take care of}} our lands. It made our hearts glad to hear that was your wish... but now, father, we see you drawing back, and we are <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> see our father doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E
25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects.

We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions with respect to the quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E
25|$|We {{may have}} to ASSASSINATE {{some of the people}} you elect on Nov. 7!

If you are too stupid to turn things around with your vote, there are people out here like me who are willing to turn things around with guns, force and violence. We hope our method does not become necessary.|$|E

25|$|The {{fighting}} led to {{the evacuation}} of the Jewish villages of Atarot (17 May) and Neve Yaakov (18 May) near Jerusalem, and Kalya and Beit HaArava near the Dead Sea (both on 20 May), {{as well as the}} expulsion of the Jewish inhabitants of the Old City of Jerusalem. The defenders of the Jewish Quarter surrendered to the Arab Legion on 28 May 1948, this leading to the forced evacuation of all Jewish inhabitants. Before the war, the Jews of the Old City had friendly relations with their Arab neighbors and were <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> have to leave.|$|E
25|$|The 2002–03 and 03-04 seasons yielded no medals for Jokerit. In {{the spring}} of 2003, Jokerit {{acquired}} forward Glen Metropolit from the Washington Capitals organization; despite his unimpressive NHL record, Metropolit became scoring leader of Jokerit in both the 2003–04 regular season and playoffs, {{as well as the}} 2004–05 regular season. Metropolit became a firm fan favorite, and many were <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> see him leave the Finnish league after the 2004–05 season. Another important Jokerit acquisition was goalie Tim Thomas from the Boston Bruins organization. Thomas played in every game of the season bar two with a save percentage of 94.59% and a record-breaking 15 shutouts, for which he won the Kultainen kypärä award.|$|E
25|$|I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> {{transmit}} to Your Lordship the disagreeable {{account of a}} disagreeable Business, {{some time in the}} Beginning of this Month, upon news of the Rebel Army approaching, General Carleton set out for Montreal in great Haste; the 7th instant the Rebels landed in the Woods near St. John's, and beat back to their Boats by a Party of Savages incamped at that Place; in this Action the Savages behaved with great Spirit and Resolution, and had they remained firm to our Interests, probably the Province would have been safe for this Year, but finding the Canadians in General averse to the taking up Arms for the Defence of their Country, they withdrew, and made their Peace.|$|E

She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E
25|$|Although {{reaction}} to the game's announcement satisfied the studio, they realized that its fast pace would make extensive use of the GamePad while muting the TV display's utility; players must focus on one screen while ignoring the other. The tiny monsters were problematic, since shooting them was unsatisfying. The issues were singled out by Ubisoft management at a Ubisoft Paris meeting, and the team decided to slow the game's pace. The enemies were changed from small monsters to zombies, since their movement is slower and they are easily identified as monsters. According to Jean-Karl Tupin-Bron, the team was <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> realize that Killer Freaks would not work but delighted {{by the results of}} the transition. By September 2011, most of the Killer Freaks team had joined the zombie-game team. During the transition, the game's tone became more serious. The team tried to distinguish itself from other zombie games in the video-game market, making the GamePad its central feature. They were inspired by the 2007 film, I Am Legend, in which the protagonist is the only survivor left in a city and must be constantly on guard against zombies. ZombiU, the game's working title, became its official name since it was a zombie game for Wii U.|$|E
