50|$|In hydrology, <b>stemflow</b> is {{the flow}} of intercepted water down the trunk or stem of a plant. <b>Stemflow,</b> along with throughfall, is {{responsible}} for the transferral of precipitation and nutrients from the canopy to the soil. In tropical rainforests, where this kind of flow can be substantial, erosion gullies can form {{at the base of the}} trunk. However, in more temperate climates <b>stemflow</b> levels are low and have little erosional power.|$|E
50|$|Precipitation and {{morphological}} {{factors that}} influence <b>stemflow</b> timing and volume also affect the chemical composition; in general, <b>stemflow</b> water becomes more dilute {{during the course of}} a storm event, and rough-barked species contain more nutrients than smooth-barked species.|$|E

50|$|The junipers that {{establish}} in overgrazed {{lands are}} young and vigorous, dense and multi-trunked, and shallow rooted. This {{makes it difficult for}} remaining grasses to compete for water, especially if they are still being grazed and the soils are impoverished. The presence of these dense, shallow-rooted shrubs also means less water reaches the soil, subsurface flows and deep drainage. However, their dense canopies and thick litter do reduce overland flows compared to grazed grasses. Old-growth Ashe junipers are different in that they have true trunks, use less water, are slow growing, less foliated and have very deep roots. Wilcox (Texas A&M University) and Keith Owens (Texas Ag. Ext. researcher at Uvalde) are currently studying how these deeper roots may facilitate the deep drainage of water down trunk <b>stemflows.</b> Dr. Owens reports that for every one inch of rain, about 6 gallons of previously undocumented water is funneled down the trunks.|$|R
40|$|The {{biogeochemical}} cycle of copper and cadmium {{has been studied}} in two forested ecosystems for two years. These two sites are: a) a Norway spruce forest (Picea abies) on an acid brown soil (FAQ: Dystric cambisol) and b) a mixed coniferous forest (Picea abies, Pinus cembra, Larix decidua and Abies alba) on a podzol. Both of them are located on low heavy metal polluted sites: the Swiss Plateau (850 m a. s. l.) for the first one and the oriental edge of the Mont-Blanc Massif (1650 m a. s. l.) for the second one. The Cu and Cd stocks in the vegetation and in the soil are evaluated. Heavy metal fluxes through the ecosystems are determined by analysis of concentrations and quantities of rain, throughfalls, <b>stemflows,</b> lysimetric soil solution and litterfall. In addition, the forms of Cu and Cd immobilization in soils are studied by means of sequential extraction, whereas immobilization forms in solution are studied by means of ion exchange chromatography and selective electrode. The results obtained allowed us to draw conclusions concerning the general pollution level in the experimental sites and the annual and/or detailed behaviour of Cu and Cd in the ecosystems. The conclusions are the following: As expected, the sites are not polluted since concentrations and fluxes are low. The chemical composition of solutions is modified during transition through the ecosystem, especially the copper concentrations. The acid brown soil humic layer is more efficient than the podzol humic layer in modifying this composition. There is no significant seasonal variation of concentrations and fluxes. However, the metal diffusion through the ecosystem is almost immediate. The soil plays {{an essential role in}} the immobilization of the heavy metals. The organic and organo-mineral layers are particularly active in this process. Exportations out of the ecosystems are limited. They are relatively more important for the podzol than for the acid brown soil and higher for Cd than for Cu. Transfer and stocking forms, and the ways of input to the soil depend on the metal considered: Copper input to the soil is mainly due to litterfall. In the soil, the metal has a preference to be associated with organic matter. In solution, it forms complexes with dissolved organic matter (mainly fulvic acid of MW < 1000  dalton). So, it is strongly retained within the soil and it cannot be easily drained out of the soil profile. At the opposite, cadmium is mostly transported by liquid means (throughfalls). In solution, it is present as free cadmium ions. In the soil, it is less strongly fixed than Cu since Cd is mostly associated with Fe and Mn oxides. For both of the metals, the free ion concentration in solution depends on pH and the saturation rate of organic matter. The latter has a heterogenous and polyfunctional character which explains a similar complexing capacity for all the samples studied. The differences observed in copper and cadmium behaviour can explain the variable diffusion of a polluting Cu and Cd flux through a given ecosystem and to the aquifer. The soil intervenes as a discriminating factor when the two experimental sites are compared...|$|R

40|$|<b>Stemflow</b> is an {{important}} mechanism to replenish soil water for xerophytic shrubs in water-stressed ecosystems, whereas the biotic influences of leaf and branch on shrub <b>stemflow</b> were not completely investigated. In this study, the <b>stemflow</b> of 98 branches with various basal diameter under 42 rainfall events was measured for Salix psammophila in northern China during the rainy seasons of 2014 and 2015. The effects of rainfall characteristics, and plant traits of leaf and branch on <b>stemflow</b> were detected. <b>Stemflow</b> productivity (branch <b>stemflow</b> production of unit biomass) was proposed to determine the beneficial branch architecture for efficient <b>stemflow</b> production. The developed allometric equations by expressing the plant traits as a power function of branch basal diameter could satisfactorily estimate the leaf traits and biomass. There were significant differences of branch <b>stemflow</b> between different basal diameter and precipitation classes. The average shrub <b>stemflow</b> depth and percentage was 0. 77 mm (0. 004 - 3. 32 mm) and 5. 54 % (0. 70 - 7. 92 %), respectively. The precipitation amount and leaf fresh biomass were identified as the most influential rainfall characteristic and plant trait of <b>stemflow,</b> respectively. The <b>stemflow</b> production increased linearly with precipitation amount, and <b>stemflow</b> percentage increased with precipitation amount to approach the asymptotic value of 7. 61 %.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} focused on the amount of <b>stemflow</b> in {{different}} forests and for different rainfall events, but few {{studies have focused}} on how <b>stemflow</b> intensity varies during events or the infiltration of <b>stemflow</b> into the soil. <b>Stemflow</b> may lead to higher water delivery rates {{at the base of the}} tree compared with throughfall over the same area and fast and deeper infiltration of this water along roots and other preferential flow pathways. In this study, <b>stemflow</b> amounts and intensities were measured and blue dye experiments were conducted in a mature coniferous forest in coastal British Columbia to examine double funneling of <b>stemflow.</b> <b>Stemflow</b> accounted for only 1 % of precipitation and increased linearly with event total precipitation.

40|$|As {{rainfall}} {{passes through}} canopies water is redistributed spatially and reaches the soil as throughfall and <b>stemflow.</b> <b>Stemflow</b> {{can account for}} more than 10 % of incident rainfall for different vegetation types in tropical, temperate, semi-arid and arid regions even though their trees basal area occupies a comparatively small fraction of total forest area. But, <b>stemflow</b> percentage of incident rainfall varies widely for different forests of the same tree species. <b>Stemflow</b> studies from European beech forests report <b>stemflow</b> percentages in a range from 3 % up to 25 %. The few studies including more than one year of <b>stemflow</b> records also mentioned high inter-annual variability of <b>stemflow</b> per forest stand. This study aims at assessing the drivers of <b>stemflow</b> percentage variability between different forest sites of the same species and the temporal variability of single forests and individual trees. For this we are compiling data of beech <b>stemflow</b> from several European countries together with the respective rainfall data and forest parameters. The compilation will include studies with a high quantity of sampled individuals (up to 20 trees) as well as studies with single individuals but long-term data collection (> 10 years).

On an annual basis, the funneling ratio (<b>stemflow</b> divided by the product of rainfall and trunk basal area) seems to be a good parameter for <b>stemflow</b> estimation. We found, however, an increased variability of the funneling ratio for seasonal data (leaved and leafless periods).

We calculated rainfall, throughfall and <b>stemflow</b> concentrations and fluxes of Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +,, Cl-, SO 42 -, NO 3 - and H+ and <b>stemflow</b> volume-weighted mean concentrations and fluxes for three size classes of broadleaf trees and three size classes of palms. The concentrations of most solutes were higher in <b>stemflow</b> than in rainfall and increased with increasing tree and palm size. Concentration enrichments from rainfall to <b>stemflow</b> and throughfall were particularly high (81 -fold) for NO 3 -. <b>Stemflow</b> fluxes of NO 3 - and H+ exceeded throughfall fluxes but <b>stemflow</b> fluxes of other solutes were less than throughfall fluxes. <b>Stemflow</b> solute fluxes to the forest soil were dominated by fluxes on babassu palms, which represented only 4 % of total stem number and 10 % of total basal area. For NO 3 -, <b>stemflow</b> contributed 51 % of the total mass of nitrogen delivered to the forest floor (<b>stemflow</b> + throughfall) and represented more than a 2000 -fold increase in NO 3 - flux compared what would have been delivered by rainfall alone on the equivalent area. Because these highly localized fluxes of both water and NO 3 - persist in time and space, they have the potential to affect patterns of soil moisture, microbial populations and other features of soil biogeochemistry conducive to the creation of hotspots for nitrogen leaching and denitrification, which could amount to an important fraction of total ecosystem fluxes.
