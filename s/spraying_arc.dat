5000|$|Cold Spray (CS) (formerly gas dynamic cold spray) is a coating {{deposition}} method. Solid powders (1 to 50 micrometers in diameter) are accelerated in a supersonic gas jet to velocities up to 500-1000 m/s. During {{impact with}} the substrate, particles undergo plastic deformation and {{adhere to the}} surface. To achieve a uniform thickness the spraying nozzle is scanned along the substrate. Metals, polymers, ceramics, composite materials and nanocrystalline powders can be deposited using cold spraying. [...] The kinetic energy of the particles, supplied by {{the expansion of the}} gas, is converted to plastic deformation energy during bonding. Unlike thermal spraying techniques, e.g., plasma <b>spraying,</b> <b>arc</b> spraying, flame spraying, or high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF), the powders are not melted during the spraying process.|$|E

30|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>arc</b> is {{required}} for thicker section than short arc. It is very suitable when a high deposition rate is needed and when deep penetration {{is required}} for welding of massive base materials that can tolerate high heat input. The large weld pool makes vertical or overhead position welding difficult, {{especially in the case}} of plain carbon steel and stainless steels. For joining steels, the transition current can be varied more than when welding aluminium alloys. A <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> can be used with almost all common alloys containing aluminium and also nickel alloys, copper alloys, stainless steels, magnesium, and carbon steels (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Althouse et al. 2004; Robert and Messler 2004; Goecke 2005 a, b; Jeffus and Bower 2010). Despite the advantages of conventional <b>spray</b> <b>arc,</b> odd arc instabilities and disordered metal transfer have restricted its adoption. In <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> mode, the current and voltage are almost steady, which leads to random droplet size and frequency (Hutt and Lucas 1982). Therefore, high fume, spatter, and heat input are generated. As a result of insufficient control, the weld quality can be adversely affected. It should also be noted that the argon-based shielding gas used to achieve <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> is more expensive than CO 2. In view of these drawbacks, <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> is unsuitable for aluminium, structural steel, coated steel, and high-strength steels.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{development}} of high-performance-modified <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> processes in {{gas metal arc}} welding due to modern digital control technology and inverter power sources enables a focused <b>spray</b> <b>arc,</b> which results in higher penetration depths and welding speed. However, microcracks occurred in the weld metal while approaching the process limits of the modified <b>spray</b> <b>arc,</b> represented by a 20 -mm double layer DV-groove butt-weld. These cracks were detected in structural steel exhibiting a yield strength level of up to 960 MPa and are neither dependent on the used weld power source nor a consequence of the modified <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> process itself. The metallographic and fractographic investigations of the rather exceptional fracture surface lead to the classification of the microcracks as hot cracks. The effects of certain welding parameters on the crack probability are clarified using a statistical design of experiment. However, these microcracks do not impact the design specification for toughness in the Charpy V-notch test (absorbed energy at - 40 °C for the present material is 30 J) ...|$|R
30|$|In {{bridging}} transfer, {{the molten}} metal grows until it touches the weld pool. A short circuit occurs and current rises; thus, the constriction and the breaking detach the droplet. In flight transfer, no contact {{exists between the}} electrode wire and the weld pool (Li and Zhang 2007). If the size of drops detached from the electrode to the molten weld pool is smaller than {{the diameter of the}} electrode wire, the arc mode is projected spray. If the molten metal from the electrode rotates, it is called rotating <b>spray</b> <b>arc.</b> Projected <b>spray</b> is mostly called <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> to simplify the terminology (Robert and Messler 2004). Characteristics that are generally typical of a projected <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> are steady detachment, low spatter, constant size of the droplet, and direct droplet transfer. Therefore, this mode of arc is preferred in conventional GMAW (Li and Zhang 2007).|$|R

The results showed that the arc current increases along with arc voltage increase. The lower the spraying voltage is, the smaller the molten grain size becomes. However, if the arc voltage is lower than the minimum critical arc voltage of the material, the arc could not keep smooth burning. The spraying current has correspondence relationship with wire feed speed. The spraying current could be adjusted through wire feed speed adjustment...|$|E

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of the vertical volumetric distribution of an axial fan sprayer on the Brevipalpus phoenicis control efficiency. First, an assay was performed to evaluate the vertical volume distribution uniformity of the sprayer, assessing different spray nozzles configurations on the spray arcs, sides of the sprayer and spray heights. Afterwards, another experiment was carried out to analyze the relationship between the distribution of the Fenpyroximate acaricide on Coffea arabica L. and the B. phoenicis control efficiency. The treatments were arranged in a 4 x 2 factorial + 1 additional control, consisting of four spray volumes (200 L ha- 1, 400 L ha- 1, 600 L ha- 1 and 800 L ha- 1) and two spray nozzles configurations (1 : 100 % of MAG 1. 5 nozzles; 2 : upper extension with 5 MAG 3. 0 nozzles, middle extension with 9 MAG 1. 5 nozzles and lower extension with 4 MAG 3. 0 nozzles). Configuration 2 provided the smallest coefficient of variation (28 %). Nozzle configurations had no effect on the incidence of B. phoenicis. The use of nozzles with different flow rates on the <b>spraying</b> <b>arc</b> improves the vertical volumetric distribution uniformity of axial fan sprayers, but does not affect the B. phoenicis control efficiency...|$|E

30|$|AWS has {{classified}} welding arcs {{into three}} main categories: short, globular, and <b>spray</b> <b>arcs.</b> Other variations of arcs {{mentioned in this}} study are pulsed, cold, rotating, buried, and rapid arcs. A stable arc has three main features: a constant shape of droplets, constant length of arc, and low amount of spatter.|$|R
30|$|Following {{the first}} {{classification}} of arc types in 1976 (Lancaster 1984), several further classifications have been proposed. Short arc, globular <b>arc,</b> and <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> {{are the three}} major classifications of arc types by the American Welding Society (AWS) (Iordachescu and Quintino 2008). The International Institute of Welding (IIW), in 1984, divided <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> types into the three categories: (i) drop spray or projected spray, (ii) rotating spray, and (iii) streaming spray (Iordachescu and Quintino 2008; Lancaster 1986). Norrish (2003) and then Ponomarev et al. (2003) modified this categorization. Utilization of digital control of power sources has led to many improvements in arc control, especially in welding with short and pulsed arcs. Digital control increases the reaction speed of the power source inverter {{and the use of}} sophisticated software makes it possible to directly influence the arc (Weman 2003; Iordachescu and Quintino 2008).|$|R

40|$|High Velocity Air Fuel Electric <b>arc</b> <b>{{spraying}}</b> (HVAF <b>Arc)</b> is {{a thermal}} spraying {{technology that is}} quite similar to electric <b>arc</b> <b>spraying.</b> The {{difference between these two}} types of spraying equipment is that whereas the electric <b>arc</b> <b>spraying</b> technology uses compressed air as the atomizing gas, HVAF Arc uses the combustion products of propane and air. As HVAF Arc has not been widely researched, information about how the apparatus actually functions and what kind of effect changing its spraying parameters has, was desired. This thesis consists of theoretical and experimental parts. In the literature review, thermal spraying technologies and the microstructure of thermally sprayed coatings is discussed briefly.

In the experimental part, results from tests made to HVAF Arc specimens that have been strayed with different spraying parameters are presented. These tests include composition and thickness analyses, surface roughness tests, Vickers hardness tests, an erosion and a corrosion test. According to the results, HVAF Arc coatings have fine microstructure, with low porosity, but are quite heavily oxidized. They are typically more oxidized than coatings made without using propane as a process gas, though the HVAF Arc coatings have lower surface roughness, less pores and slightly higher hardness, due to the amount of oxides in the coating. Typically, by changing spraying parameters the coating qualities of HVAF Arc do not change much...|$|R

50|$|In gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (GTAW), inert gases {{are used to}} shield the tungsten from contamination. It also shields the fluid metal (created from the arc) from the reactive gases in air which can cause porosity in the solidified weld puddle. Inert gases are also used in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) for welding non-ferrous metals. Some gases which are not usually considered inert but which behave like inert gases in all the circumstances likely to be encountered in some use can often be used as a substitute for an inert gas. This is useful when an appropriate pseudo-inert gas can be found which is inexpensive and common. For example, carbon dioxide is sometimes used in gas mixtures for GMAW because it is not reactive to the weld pool created by arc welding. But it is reactive to the arc. The more carbon dioxide that is added to the inert gas, such as argon, will increase your penetration. The amount of carbon dioxide is often determined by what kind of transfer you will be using in GMAW. The most common is <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> transfer, and the most commonly used gas mixture for <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> transfer is 90% argon and 10% carbon dioxide.

30|$|Arc modes {{are related}} to arc voltage {{and the level of}} current. By {{changing}} these two parameters, the modes of the arc can be changed. With small current, the droplet does not form until it touches the weld pool; this mode of arc is a so-called short arc. The arc mode changes to a globular arc when the current is increased so that a small electromagnetic force is generated (Wang et al. 2004). In a globular arc, the diameter of the droplet is bigger than the electrode and the droplet is formed by the gravitational force. By further increasing the current, the type of arc changes to a projected <b>spray</b> <b>arc,</b> then a streaming arc, and finally a rotating arc (Li and Zhang 2007).

Organic coating could fail prematurely and result in corrosion progression from coating failure. This paper will discuss the overall framework of experiments to justify the performance of thermal <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> aluminium coating. In this research 99. 5 % aluminium was used as the coating material in wire form of 2. 3 mm diameter using wire <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> method. Six samples were prepared with different thickness of coating from 200 to 400 microns. Mechanical tests such as Pull-off Test and Bend Test were performed to evaluate the coating performance.

40|$|An ongoing {{continuous}} process of automatization {{of the production}} lines is used in industry to reduce production costs. Automatization of quality control {{should be seen as}} part of a cost reduction process, as well as of quality control of the welding. Mostly the time-consuming and expensive checking procedure of the weld joint is carried out off-line by an experienced welding operator. The need for automatic quality control is thus great in order to achieve higher cost efficiency. The present thesis focus on the weld quality of pulsed, short-circuiting and <b>spray</b> Gas Metal <b>Arc</b> welding. The purpose is to design algorithms to detect defects on-line and automatically during a robotic welding pass using the measured weld voltage and current. Experiments with different specimens are performed in order to cause defects in weld joints and introduce symptoms in the measured signals. The defects produced in the weld joint are found to be of two main kinds. In pulsed welding, burn-through occurs. In <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> and short-circuiting welding, the size of the weld was reduced. The two types of defects and their relation to the measured welding voltage and current are discussed. The environment around the measurements is highly disturbed by electrical noise. Several measurement techniques is used accordingly in order to prevent interference of the measurements. To obtain a reliable detection, features which are sensitive to changes in the weld process must be extracted from the measured signals. Features which are suggested in other works of this field, and features which are obtained through observation of the measured signals from the experiments of the present thesis are investigated. The investigation shows that the mean and variance of the weld voltage and current yield promising results when welding in short-circuiting and spray mode due to the robustness of the extracted features. When welding in pulsed mode, the prediction error from an autoregressive model with extra input is used as a feature. The extracted features are fed into a detection algorithm to further enhance the signal to noise ratio of the resulting test quantity. The filtering of the features is then compared to a threshold. Six statistical detection algorithms for weld quality have been designed and tested on measured data.
