25|$|When {{planning}} {{these new}} facilities, Metcalf {{was concerned about}} the security of the collection – damage to manuscripts and books from variations in heat and humidity, or worst of all, damage from a flood. In the case of Houghton, the building that was to house the rare collections at Harvard, many features were designed into the air conditioning and plumbing systems that were meant to mitigate the risk of damage. Catch basins were installed under any pipe running horizontally to catch and divert any water from leaks. The plumbing system itself was designed so that the location of leaks could be found quickly through a series of <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves,</b> and the walls were designed with easy access to plumbing. The display cases themselves were designed so that they were well ventilated. This allowed lighting to be installed in the cases (rather than outside) without impacting the temperature and humidity levels. It was features like these that helped keep the collections safe.|$|E

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of voice pipes {{is that they}} may breach the integrity of watertight spaces. This led {{to the introduction of}} <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> on both ends of voicepipes to prevent water from a flooded compartment from entering other compartments via its voicepipes.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of types of valve used in autogas systems. The most common ones are <b>shut-off</b> or filter-lock <b>valves,</b> which are used to stop flow in the service line. These may be {{operated}} by vacuum or electricity. On bi-fuel systems with a petrol carburettor, a similar <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> is usually fitted in the petrol line between the pump and carburettor.|$|R

50|$|Diaphragm valves can be manual or automated. Their {{application}} is generally as <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> in process systems within the industrial, food and beverage, pharmaceutical and biotech industries.

50|$|Since this is {{essentially}} a water pumping system, standing column well design requires critical considerations to obtain peak operating efficiency. Should a standing column well design be misapplied, leaving out critical <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> for example, {{the result could be}} an extreme loss in efficiency and thereby cause operational cost to be higher than anticipated.|$|E
50|$|Since the oubreak of {{the fire}} and its {{intensity}} was undoubtedly caused by escaping gas from the Pintsch lighting system, the report recommended measures such as automatic <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> and safer placement of cylinders.

50|$|During {{this period}} of some 25 years, {{starting}} with Convair, and General Dynamics Pazmany also worked at McDonnell Douglas for aerostructures and engines. Douglas was a specialist in fighter aircraft who merged with Boeing in 1967. At Rohr he produced related components, including engine nacelles, thrust reversers, and mounting pylons for both military and commercial aircraft. Pazmany’s engineering talents stretched from conventional prop-driven aircraft to jets, missiles, cruise missiles, and unmanned stealth craft, aero systems and parts. He earned seven patents for inventions for aircraft thrust reversers to emergency natural gas <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> that activate during earthquakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{operators}} {{working in}} the unit {{at the time of}} the incident were unable to reach manual <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> that would have isolated the damaged section from a fuel source. A remotely operated shut-off valve was located between the damaged section and the storage tanks but not between the damaged section and the distillation column. In addition, the pumps were controlled from a local control station that was also inaccessible. The pumps were eventually shut down from the central control building but there was not a remote shutdown control for the pumps in the central control room. Isolating the damaged section via a remotely operated valve upstream of the pumps could have ended the incident prior to ignition of the vapor cloud and would have definitely reduced the severity of the situation.|$|E
50|$|A {{curb box}} (also {{known as a}} valve box, buffalo box, or b-box) is a {{vertical}} cast iron sleeve, accessible from the public way, housing the <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> (curb cock or curb stop) for a property's water service line. It is typically located between a building and the district's water main lines and usually consists of a metal tube with a removable or sliding lid, allowing access to the turn-key within. It typically serves as the point denoting the separation of utility-maintained and privately-maintained water facilities.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of shape memory alloys operating in an overtemperature <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> at {{a temperature of}} 95 °C for up to 2000 hours are presented. Alloys of NiTi, Cu-Al-Ni and Cu-Zn-Al have been characterised under these ageing conditions. The effect of altering the processing parameters, viz solution treatment temperature, quenching technique and training procedure were examined. All alloys show degradation of the memory behaviour but results are presented which demonstrate that improvements in degradation can arise by altering the solution treatment temperature and training procedure...|$|R
50|$|Non-{{pressure}} refuel systems operate via {{a closed}} loop system where all pressure is contained interior to signal lines, level control, and a <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve.</b> When the fuel tank fill point is reached, a bleed line signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a diaphragm valve at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled. Non-pressurized refueling systems do not require tank pressurization for automatic nozzle shut-off, thus allowing their use on thin-walled metallic and composite material fuel tanks.|$|R
50|$|In April 2010, a Puget Sound Energy began a US$200 {{million project}} to {{rehabilitate}} and upgrade the power plant. The project included retrofitting {{the first four}} of the generators in Plant 1 and replacing the fifth. A turbine-generator would be replaced in Plant 2 as well. The weir was lowered to 16 ft in height, lengthened by 37 ft and the water-intake structure was replaced. Lowering the weir will help reduce flood waters upstream of the falls. The penstocks, which feed the power plants with water, were to be upgraded as well. Finally, automatic shut-off and bypass valves were installed for Plant 2. The <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> will better prepare the plant for emergencies and the bypass valves will allow water to flow downstream in the case that Plant 2 is offline. To promote tourism, recreation and culture, several upgrades to include new visitor centers, hiking trails, a boardwalk and improved landscaping were implemented. Renovations on Plant 2 were completed in April 2013. The new 6.5 MW Francis turbine generator in Plant 1 and the entire project was finished in mid-2014. The project raised the installed capacity of the power plant from 44.4 MW to 53.9 MW.|$|E
50|$|The {{firefighting}} {{water system}} at the HCC {{was part of the}} process water system. When the first explosion occurred, some fire hydrants were sheared off at ground level by the blast. The result was inadequate water pressure for firefighting. The <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> which could have been used to prevent the loss of water from ruptured lines in the plant were out of reach in the burning wreckage. No remotely operated fail-safe isolation valves existed in the combined plant/firefighting water system. In addition, the regular-service fire-water pumps were disabled by the fire which destroyed their electrical power cables. Of the three backup diesel-operated fire pumps, one had been taken out of service, and one ran out of fuel in about an hour. Firefighting water was brought in by hoses laid to remote sources: settling ponds, a cooling tower, a water main at a neighboring plant, and even the Houston Ship Channel. The fire was brought under control within about 10 hours {{as a result of the}} combined efforts of fire brigades from other nearby companies, local fire departments, and the Phillips 66 foam trucks and fire brigade.|$|E
50|$|Cone valves or {{ball valves}} are another alternative. These are {{commonly}} found as the service <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They {{can be identified}} by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed. Usually, when the handle {{is in line with}} the pipe the valve is open, and when the handle is across the pipe it is closed. A cone valve consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a taper-plug cock. A ball valve uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle rotates the passage away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot pass. Valves of this type using a cylinder rather than a cone are sometimes encountered, but using a cone allows a tight fit to be made even with moderate manufacturing tolerances. The ball in ball valves rotates within plastic seats.|$|E
50|$|The TR3 {{is a true}} roadster, {{designed}} for sunny weather but with removable rain protection. It has a convertible hood (US top) that snaps on and off and removable side curtains, allowing very low doors with padding for the driver's arm to rest on. There are holes in the floor, with rubber plugs, so that the originally supplied jack might be used from inside the car, as did the Jaguar XK120. The optional heater is poor and the <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> is under the bonnet (US hood). A third person can be carried behind the seats.|$|R
25|$|If a <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> is fitted {{between the}} first and second stages, as is found on scuba bailout systems used for {{commercial}} diving and in some technical diving configurations, the demand valve will normally be isolated and unable to function as a relief valve. In this case an overpressure valve must be fitted to the first stage if it does not already have one. As very few contemporary (2016) scuba regulator first stages are factory fitted with overpressure relief valves, they are available as aftermarket accessories which can be screwed into any low pressure port available on the first stage.|$|R
