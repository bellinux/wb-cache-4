5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E

25|$|In the Lois Duncan novel Locked in Time {{the main}} protagonist Nora finds it odd that her 13 year old stepsister Josie commented how <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> trampled to {{death at the}} Ringling Circus Fire, even though the event had {{occurred}} many years before Josie was born.|$|E
25|$|Brennan's {{work was}} fostered by William Maxwell, and she wrote under The New Yorker {{managing}} editors Harold Ross and William Shawn. Although she was widely {{read in the}} United States in the 1950s and 1960s, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> unknown in Ireland, even though Dublin was the setting of many of her short stories.|$|E

She tackled {{the role of}} her namesake, Joan of Arc, in a 1954 stage production of George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, but she left the play after a nervous breakdown and battles with director Harold Clurman.|$|E

Her mother married her second husband, Nicholas Avenel, {{sometime}} afterwards, but the exact date of this marriage is not known.

25|$|She {{began the}} decade with The Lemon Sisters, a poorly {{received}} comedy/drama that she starred in and produced, which was shelved {{for a year}} after its completion. In 1991, Keaton starred with Steve Martin in the family comedy Father of the Bride. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> not cast in the film, as the commercial failure of The Good Mother had strained her relationship with Walt Disney Pictures, the studio of both films. Father of the Bride was Keaton's first major hit {{after four years of}} commercial disappointments.|$|E
25|$|In 1834 Minna was {{appearing}} {{as part of}} Heinrich Eduard Bethmann's Magdeburg Theatre Company during a summer season at Bad Lauchstädt, a spa resort near Halle. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> 25.

The 21-year-old Wagner {{changed his mind and}} accepted the contract in order to pursue her, taking rooms directly beneath hers.|$|E
25|$|In the final, Campbell-Brown ran a {{personal}} best of 7.00seconds – the fastest winning time for 11 year – {{to upset the}} pre-race favourites. Finishing just after in 7.03seconds, Jones-Ferrette settled for silver – the first global athletics medal for the United States Virgin Islands. Jeter rounded out the top three with a run of 7.05seconds, continuing her bronze medal run from the World Championships in Athletics. Zang Milama and Brooks shared fourth place having made significant career progressions over the distance. Chandra Sturrup's sixth-place finish was notable in that, {{at the age of}} 38 years, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> a decade older than the next oldest athlete to reach the final (Jeter).|$|E
50|$|Emma Tatham (31 October 1829 - 4 September 1855) was a 19th-century English poet. Although <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> {{forgotten}} today, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> regarded in the Victorian era as a prodigy and {{a poetic}} genius.|$|R

25|$|The next {{international}} {{tournament for}} Scotland was the 2003 IWCC Trophy in the Netherlands, {{which served as}} a qualifier for the 2005 World Cup. MacLean played in only three of her team's five matches at the event, against Pakistan, the West Indies, and Japan. In her final match, against Japan, she made her highest ODI score, 23 runs from fifth in the batting order. In that match, which was her final international appearance, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> 40 years old – only Liz Smith has appeared in an ODI for Scotland at an older age. MacLean had balanced {{the final years of}} her playing career for Scotland with a position as marketing and communications manager for Cricket Scotland.|$|E
25|$|City of Peking {{usually made}} the voyage from Yokohama to San Francisco in about sixteen days, but on one {{occasion}} the vessel took almost twice as long. The ship left the Port of Yokohama on January 10, 1893. After <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> a week late in arriving, concern increased {{to the point that}} the steamship San Juan was dispatched to Honolulu with relief supplies, intending to trace the route of the missing vessel. However, City of Peking finally arrived unassisted, thirteen days late. It transpired that she had broken a propeller shaft and been forced to revert to her auxiliary sails, but since she had been carrying only enough sail for two of her four masts, progress had been unusually slow.|$|E
25|$|A {{prolific}} writer, Rebecca Harding Davis {{is credited}} with over 500 published works. Despite her outpouring of literary works, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> entirely forgotten {{by the time of}} her death in 1910. However, Davis was rediscovered in the very early 1970s by the feminist writer Tillie Olsen, who found a collection of Davis's works in a junk shop. Olsen quickly recognized the talent and significance of Davis's writings, and personally endeavored to reintroduce Davis's work. In 1972, The Feminist Press published Life in the Iron Mills with Olsen's own biographical interpretation of Davis's life in relation to a selection of her published works. Olsen's non-fiction volume, titled Silences, was an analysis of authors' silent periods in literature, including writer's blocks, unpublished work, and the problems that working-class writers, and women in particular, have in finding the time to concentrate on their art, and {{the second part of the}} book was a study of the work of Davis.|$|E

25|$|On May 16, 1562, Adham Khan, Akbar's {{general and}} foster brother, was defenestrated twice for murdering a rival general, Ataga Khan, {{who had been}} {{recently}} promoted by Akbar. Akbar was woken up in the tumult after the murder. He struck Adham Khan down personally with his fist and immediately ordered his defenestration by royal order. The first time, his legs were broken {{as a result of}} the 12 meter fall from the ramparts of Agra Fort but he remained alive. Akbar, in a rare act of cruelty probably exacerbated by his anger at the loss of his favorite general, ordered his defenestration a second time, killing him. Adham Khan had wrongly counted on the influence of his mother and Akbar's wet nurse, Maham Anga, to save him as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> an unofficial regent in the days of Akbar's youth. Akbar personally informed Maham Anga of her son's death, to which she famously commented, 'You have done well.' She died 40 days later of acute depression.|$|E
25|$|Between early 1978 and mid-1993 Genie {{moved through}} several more {{institutions}} and foster homes, {{some of which}} subjected her to severe levels of abuse and harassment. Shurley saw Genie at least twice during this time, at her 27th birthday party in 1984 and again two years later, and later recalled that during both visits <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> completely silent and made very little outward expression or eye contact. In 1992 Curtiss said that since 1978 she had only heard two updates on Genie's condition, both indicating she almost never spoke, and in a 1993 book on Genie author Russ Rymer wrote that as of 1992 she very rarely spoke. In a 1994 afterword to his book Rymer wrote that in early 1993 Genie's mother told him Genie was significantly more verbal, albeit hard to understand. The Riglers reestablished contact with Genie and her mother in mid-1993, and shortly afterwards David Rigler wrote that when he and Marilyn first visited Genie she immediately recognized and greeted both of them by name.|$|E
500|$|Re d'Italias captain, Emilio Faà di Bruno, {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the melee, but he could only steer his ship using her engines. Blocked by another Austrian ironclad, Faà di Bruno ordered his ship to reverse course. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> stopped when she was rammed by the Austrian flagship, [...] The Austrian ship's ram tore a gaping hole in Re d'Italias hull. She quickly rolled over to port and sank. Out of her crew, only 166 men were saved; the remaining 400 went down with the ship, including Faà di Bruno.|$|E
