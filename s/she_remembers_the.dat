5|$|The game {{begins as}} Nilin (Kezia Burrows), an Errorist imprisoned in the Bastille Fortress, is having almost all her memory wiped by Memorize. As she {{is taken to}} have {{the last of her}} {{memories}} wiped, a mysterious man called Edge, the leader of the Errorists and a man she only hears over her comm device, helps her escape. Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into the slums of Neo-Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a Memorize doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed Bad Request, is told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out the slums, Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases the memories of the inmates and partially regains some of her own. <b>She</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed the mind of a Memorize commander and made him believe he had killed his girlfriend. The altered memory pushed him to commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|According to the Halakha, {{a person}} may only recite the blessing while it is still night.

If one forgets to count a day altogether, {{he or she may}} {{continue}} to count succeeding days, but without a blessing.

25|$|At {{the age of}} 24, she {{returned}} to Brisbane and continued teaching aerobics, now to classes of hundreds of students. She also continued sewing activewear for herself and on request. Smith enjoyed producing activewear {{so much that she}} decided to give up instructing and make it her full-time occupation. In 1989, the owner of the gym at which she worked offered her space for a studio above the gym, and also casual work as a receptionist if she needed extra money. <b>She</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> space as squalid, full of cockroach droppings that would be dislodged by the vibrations of people jumping around in the building. Her mother lent her money to fund increasing production, and to help her with her rent and costs of living.|$|E

(The reader must assume that the village is in the Mühlviertel.) Hilde does not wish to go, yet {{does not want to be}} excluded. As they enter the village, Hilde recalls working hard in the fields to harvest the crop left behind by farmers to have enough food for their large family. <b>She</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> hunger pains and how her father could not find work. She remembers Fritzi, a member of her apartment-style household, bringing eggs and bacon on Sundays from the farmers and how she had felt proud carrying the basket into the kitchen. She had wanted her mother to be more proud of her than she was of her older and prettier sister, Monika.|$|E
500|$|In two stanzas of Völuspá, {{the war is}} recounted by a völva (who {{refers to}} herself here in the third person) while the god Óðinn {{questions}} her. In {{the first of the}} two stanzas, the völva says that <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> first war in the world, when Gullveig was stabbed with spears and then burnt three times in one of Óðinn's halls, yet that Gullveig was reborn three times. In the later stanza, the völva says that they called Gullveig Heiðr (meaning [...] "Bright One" [...] or potentially [...] "Gleaming" [...] or [...] "Honor") whenever she came to houses, that she was a wise völva, and that she cast spells. Heiðr performed seiðr where she could, did so in a trance, and was [...] "always the favorite of wicked women." ...|$|E

Sarah insists she must face Jareth alone and promises to call the others if needed. In a room modeled after an Escher staircase drawing, she confronts Jareth while trying to retrieve Toby. She recites the lines from her play that mirror her adventure to that point, but she still cannot remember the last line. As Jareth begs her to obey him, promising he will love her, <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> line, [...] "You have no power over me!" [...] Defeated at the last second, Jareth returns Sarah and Toby home safely and turns into a barn owl, flying away.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Illegal" [...] {{was shot in}} Mexico City on 17 October 2006, during a short break in the {{schedule}} of the Oral Fixation Tour, between concerts in Mexico and Guatemala. Jaume de Laiguana and Shakira were the co-directors of the video. The filming took a full day, and some American and Mexican fans were invited over as extras. It officially premiered on 16 November 2006 on MTV's Total Request Live (TRL). The video features Shakira as the girlfriend of a boxer. Throughout most of the video, she {{is shown in the}} empty boxing venue where her former boyfriend boxes. Through flashbacks, <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> good times in their relationship - including being alone in the ring, affectionately treating each other. At the end of the video, the reason behind their break-up is shown. Shakira comes to see her boyfriend boxing in the championship match where he wins, unaware that Shakira is there watching him. Another girl steps in the ring and kisses the boxer, revealing to Shakira he is cheating on her. Her boyfriend, to his shock, finally sees that Shakira is watching him kiss the other girl. The video ends with her looking back at him, clearly hurt, before turning away and leaving.|$|E
2500|$|This {{adds another}} mystery – who did kill Costello? Pippa is helped {{to lie on}} the sofa and Clarissa is {{suddenly}} struck by something Hugo said earlier when he stated that Sellon's antique shop was called [...] "Sellon and Brown". <b>She</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> phone call asking for Mrs. Brown and a comment made by Costello to Miss Peake before she showed him from the house to the effect that he came [...] "to see Mrs. Brown" [...] and she realises that Miss Peake is in fact Mrs. Brown, Sellon's former partner. Clarissa was given the rent of the house cheaply to install another Mrs Brown to lure other fortune hunters who are after Sellon's unknown amazing discovery. She laughs off the apparent danger she put Clarissa in stating that she kept a very close eye on things, such as her being on the scene when Costello was threatening her earlier in the evening.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, in {{conjunction}} with actor Dev Anand's death, Vyjayanthimala recollected her memories during the filming in Madras, where <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> actor calling her [...] "Papa", the Tamil termed that was used by her family and friends, and he would search for her throughout the sets while yelling [...] "where is Papa, where is my heroine". According to Subhash Chheda, when Amar Deep was released, the long-awaited airing of Vyjayanthimala and Dev Anand was compared to the Madhubala and Dev Anand pair, where the public gave the verdict that: [...] "If Madhubala brooks no equality, Vyjayanthimala admits no superiority". Unfortunately, the film failed to turn the Vyjayanthimala and Dev Anand team into a hit pair. The same year Vyjayanthimala was booked by M. G. Ramachandran for his second directorial venture Ponniyin Selvan. One of the first screen adaptations of Kalki Krishnamurthy's Ponniyin Selvan, the film had a huge ensemble cast consisting of Gemini Ganesan, Padmini, Savitri, Saroja Devi, M. N. Rajam and Nagesh along with Ramachandran and Vyjayanthimala. In the film, she was given the role of Kundavai, the elder sister of Raja Raja Chola I, played by Ganesan and the wife of Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan, played by Ramachandran. However, in mid-1958 the film was shelved for unknown reasons. The same year she did another Tamil film Gemini Pictures's Magnum opus Vanjikottai Valiban along with Gemini Ganesan and Padmini. Written by Gemini Story Department which was headed by Kothamangalam Subbu, the Black-and-white epic film was produced and directed by S. S. Vasan. She {{played the role of}} Princess Mandakini, the beautiful princess of Ratna Island Kingdom. As a stubborn princess, she always wanted to achieve her ambition in any deed which led to her ultimate death and formed the climax. The film had a great theatrical run where the film completed 100 days run at cinemas and was labelled as a blockbuster at the box office. The film is still remembered for the dance of Vyjayanthimala and Padmini in the [...] "Kannum Kannum Kalanthu" [...] song which was choreographed by Hiralal, and was well received by critics and audience alike, wherein the popularity of the song surpassed the popularity garnered by the film. The song is still {{regarded as one of the}} best dance sequences in Indian cinema. Vanjikottai Valiban was followed by its Hindi version titled Raj Tilak. Screenplay of the film was by Ramanand Sagar. The film was directed by S. S. Vasan with Ganesan, Vyjayanthimala and Padmini in the lead. Within a week, the film sank at the box office and was unable to achieve the same box office success made by the Tamil version. By the end of the year, The Indian Express named Vyjayanthimala as the most successful female star of 1958. Similarly, Boxofficeindia.com ranked Vyjayanthimala at the top spot in their list of [...] "Top Three Successful Box Office Actress of 1958".|$|E

6000|$|After the lapse of a {{few minutes}} the old {{housekeeper}} plods upstairs and delivers John's message. Anne, finding it altogether incomprehensible, subjects the poor dame to severe examination, but fails to elicit anything further. What is the meaning of it? What [...] "business" [...] can have compelled John, who for ten weeks has never let the word escape his lips, to leave her like this--without a word! without a kiss!

There must be some peacemakers left in the world, or {{everything}} will turn to blood and confusion; for even women grow dreadfully fierce in these times. My old grandmother laments her bedriddenness, because, she says, she cannot go to cheer on the people against the enemy. But <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> old times of the Indian wars, when the women were as much in danger of death as the men, and so were almost as fierce as they, and killed men sometimes with their own hands. But women, nowadays, ought to be gentler; let the men be fierce, if they must, except you, and such as you, Septimius." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have said}} {{that she does not}} resent her grief. No; the {{weakness}} of that word would make it a lie. To her, what hurts becomes immediately embodied: she looks on it as a thing that can be attacked, worried down, torn in shreds. Scarcely a substance herself, she grapples to conflict with abstractions. Before calamity she is a tigress; she rends her woes, shivers them in convulsed abhorrence. Pain, for her, has no result in good: tears water no harvest of wisdom: on sickness, on death itself, she looks with the eye of a rebel. Wicked, perhaps, she is, but also she is strong; and her strength has conquered Beauty, has overcome Grace, and bound both at her side, captives peerlessly fair, and docile as fair. Even in the uttermost frenzy of energy is each maenad movement royally, imperially, incedingly upborne. Her hair, flying loose in revel or war, is still an angel's hair, and glorious under a halo. Fallen, insurgent, banished, <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> heaven where she rebelled. Heaven's light, following her exile, pierces its confines, and discloses their forlorn remoteness.|$|E
6000|$|I PRESUME {{everybody}} has heard of me. My name is the Signora Psyche Zenobia. This I {{know to be}} a fact. Nobody but my enemies ever calls me Suky Snobbs. I have been assured that Suky is but a vulgar corruption of Psyche, which is good Greek, and means [...] "the soul" [...] (that's me, I'm all soul) and sometimes [...] "a butterfly," [...] which latter meaning undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my new crimson satin dress, with the sky-blue Arabian mantelet, and the trimmings of green agraffas, and the seven flounces of orange-colored auriculas. As for Snobbs--any person who should look at me would be instantly aware that my name wasn't Snobbs. Miss Tabitha Turnip propagated that report through sheer envy. Tabitha Turnip indeed! Oh the little wretch! But what can we expect from a turnip? Wonder if <b>she</b> <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> old adage about [...] "blood out of a turnip," [...] &c.? [Mem. put her in mind of it the first opportunity.] [Mem. again--pull her nose.] Where was I? Ah! I have been assured that Snobbs is a mere corruption of Zenobia, and that Zenobia was a queen--(So am I. Dr. Moneypenny always calls me the Queen of the Hearts)--and that Zenobia, as well as Psyche, is good Greek, and {{that my father was}} [...] "a Greek," [...] and that consequently I have a right to our patronymic, which is Zenobia and not by any means Snobbs. Nobody but Tabitha Turnip calls me Suky Snobbs. I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia.|$|E
