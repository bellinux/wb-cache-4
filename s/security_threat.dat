It was joined by McAfee and Symantec later that year. In May 2015, Fortinet {{acquired}} the Silicon Valley-based Wi-Fi hardware company, Meru Networks, for $44 million.

5|$|After the New Avengers {{are forced}} to allow Osborn to capture Luke Cage when he needs medical treatment, the team uses a {{tracking}} device Osborn had planted in Cage to trick him into blowing up his own house, after rescuing Cage from Osborn's custody. Osborn then creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming it poses a national <b>security</b> <b>threat.</b> During a pitched battle with several superheroes, Sentry causes Thor's world to fall to Earth. In the middle of Osborn's fight with Captain America, Stark removes Osborn's armor remotely, revealing Osborn used green facepaint to create a goblin-like look. Osborn screams {{that they do not}} know what they have done, only for Spider-Man to knock him down. He tells them they are all dead as the Void is released. Osborn knocks out Rogers and tries to escape, but is captured by Volstagg. Incarcerated in The Raft penitentiary, he blames his Green Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation exploit {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside his explanation of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a <b>security</b> <b>threat</b> because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: As {{the mobile}} Internet has become {{widespread}} in recent years, communication based on mobile networks is increasing. As a result, <b>security</b> <b>threats</b> have been posed {{with regard to}} the abnormal traffic of mobile networks, but mobile security has been handled with focus on threats posed by mobile malicious codes, and researches on <b>security</b> <b>threats</b> to the mobile network itself have not attracted much attention. In this paper, we analyzes <b>security</b> <b>threats</b> that occurred to mobile networks recently, and checks the <b>security</b> <b>threats</b> likely to occur in actual commercial service networks and their results. We propose a countermeasure that can respond to such <b>security</b> <b>threats,</b> present results that can be applied to actual commercial networks, and thus make it possible to proactively respond to <b>security</b> <b>threats</b> described in this paper...|$|R

5|$|The last {{decades of}} the 19th century saw concerted {{political}} campaigns for Irish home rule. Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852. Home rule {{was supported by the}} British Prime minister, William Gladstone, who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire, but his 1886 Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament. Although the bill, if passed, would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation, many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a <b>security</b> <b>threat</b> to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire. A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons. A third bill was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented because of the outbreak of the First World War leading to the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed {{to keep out of}} the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a <b>security</b> <b>threat</b> and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E
