5000|$|SH3D21 {{contains}} three SH3 domains. These domains {{are located}} near the N-terminus of the protein. In humans, these SH3 domains have a common amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Leu. This sequence motif is also conserved in other species. SH3D21 {{has been found to}} interact with Adenylate Kinase 2, Artemin, and Importin 13. The human protein has two isoforms and no paralogs. The second isoform is 645 amino acids long and is identical to the first isoform, except it is missing the first 111 amino acids. [...] Due to this, the second isoform is missing the first, and half of the second, N-terminal SH3 domain. Secondary structure analysis of SH3D21 indicates a long alpha helical structure near the C-terminus. [...] The purpose of this structure is unknown. SH3D21 is predicted to have many phosphorylation sites and multiple <b>sumolyation</b> sites throughout the entirety of the protein.|$|E
40|$|Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) catalyzes the {{polymerization}} of ADP-ribose {{units from}} NAD[sup] [/sup] modules on target proteins, {{resulting in the}} attachment of linear or branched polymers. PARP- 1 and its product poly(ADP-ribose) – PAR have recently received considerable attention because of their involvement {{in a wide range}} of cellular processes including chromatin modification, metabolism of nucleic acids, transcription regulation, and cell death. This review summarizes recent work on modular structure of six functional domains (A–F) of PARP- 1 molecule in the context of three classic domains, i. e., DNA binding (DBD), automodification (AD) and catalytic (CD) released by proteolytic enzymes. A special attention is paid to subcellular localization and molecular mechanisms of PARP- 1 posttranslational modifications, such as: poly(ADP-ribosylation), phosphorylation, acetylation and <b>sumolyation.</b> In addition, main functions of PARP- 1 are discussed, focusing on the activity of this enzyme in DNA damage detection and repair, genome stability, and cell death...|$|E
40|$|Ubiquitination, the {{covalent}} attachment of the polypeptide ubiquitin {{to target}} proteins, {{is a key}} posttranslational modification carried out {{by a set of}} three enzymes. They include ubiquitin-activating enzyme E 1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E 2, and ubiquitin ligase E 3. Unlike to E 1 and E 2, E 3 ubiquitin ligases display substrate specificity. On the other hand, numerous deubiquitylating enzymes have roles in processing polyubiquitinated proteins. Ubiquitination can result in change of protein stability, cellular localization, and biological activity. Mutations of genes involved in the ubiquitination/deubiquitination pathway or altered ubiquitin system function are associated with many different human diseases such as various types of cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders. The detection of altered or normal ubiquitination of target proteins may provide a better understanding on the pathogenesis of these diseases.  Here, we describe protocols to detect protein ubiquitination in cultured cells in vivo and test tubes in vitro. These protocols are also useful to detect other ubiquitin-like small molecule modification such as <b>sumolyation</b> and neddylation...|$|E
40|$|Ribosomal {{proteins}} (RPs) are constituents ofribosome {{important for}} protein biosynthesis but likely to haveextraribosomal functions. Many RPs {{are associated with}} variousdiseases and cancers. A previous study reported RPL 27,RPL 37 a and RPL 41 gene to be downregulated innasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) derived cell lines compared totheir normal counterpart. However, their actual physiologicalroles in organogenesis or tumorigenesis have not been properlydefined. In this paper, {{we report on the}} findings of structuralprediction of these three genes and infer their interactions withother proteins using structural neighbor prediction andmolecular docking strategies. Our results revealed that RPL 27 interact with SYNJ 2 and UBC 9. RPL 27 is predicted to mediateRNA binding protein and deregulate <b>sumolyation.</b> RPL 37 a issuggested to interact with CTNNB 1, SCMH 1 and ATBF 1. It ispredicted to deregulate Wnt degradation pathway, inhibitβ-catenin migration and regulate homeotic transcription.

40|$|Growth factor {{receptor}}-bound protein 14 (Grb 14) is an adapter protein {{implicated in}} {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} signaling. Grb 14 −/− studies highlight both {{the positive and negative}} roles of Grb 14 in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in a tissue-specific manner. In this study, we made a novel finding that Grb 14 inhibits the activity of PTP 1 B, the major negative regulator of insulin receptor (IR) signaling, in a phosphorylation-regulated manner. Phosphorylation of Tyr- 347 in the BPS domain of Grb 14 is critical for interaction with PTP 1 B, resulting in the competitive inhibition of PTP 1 B activity. We also found that rhodopsin-regulated Src kinase activation in retina leads to the phosphorylation of Grb 14. Further, ablation of Grb 14 resulted in significantly elevated retinal PTP 1 B activity in vivo. PTP 1 B is known to be regulated by oxidation, glutathionylation, phosphorylation, and <b>SUMOlyation,</b> and our study for the first time demonstrates the inhibition of PTP 1 B activity in vivo by protein molecule Grb 14 in a tissue-specific manner. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Using {{differential}} display of mRNA transcripts, we obtained nine partial cDNA clones that were up-regulated and down-regulated {{by exposure to}} drought. Two full length cDNAs of 825 bp and 700 bp, designated as Arachis hypogaea serine rich protein (AhSrp) and Arachis hypogaea leucine rich protein (AhLrp) were obtained using RLM-RACE. Based on the cDNA sequence, the transcriptional start site of AhSrp and AhLrp was assigned. AhSrp is predicted to code for a protein of 233 amino acids containing a signal peptide, three potential transmembrane domains and a <b>sumolyation</b> motif. AhLrp is predicted to code for a protein of 206 amino acids containing a signal peptide. The expression of partial cDNA and full-length cDNA were confirmed by RNA dot blot analysis. Expression of AhSrp was observed between 6 and 10 days of stress and prominent expression of AhLrp was visualized at 10 days of stress by semi quanititative PCR. Our studies {{have resulted in the}} identification of two new genes that {{may play a role in}} plant response to drought stress in peanut. Â© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B. V...|$|E
40|$|All {{organisms are}} {{composed}} of cells and the cell’s nucleus contains DNA. The induction of DNA damage {{is a threat to}} organisms. Signalling of DNA damage and subsequent repair is of substantial importance. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA can be induced by ionising radiation and DNA damaging agents but also arise as intermediates in several cellular processes (e. g. meiosis). DSBs are among the most genotoxic DNA lesions and their accurate repair is crucial. Genetic instability resulting from unrepaired DSBs can lead to cell death and, in a multicellular organism, to cancer. There are two major DSB repair pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous endjoining (NHEJ). By NHEJ, broken DNA is sealed together, irrespective of sequence homology, in a not necessarily error-free way. HR, in which a homologous DNA molecule is needed as a template, accurately repairs DSBs. In this thesis we mainly focus on recombinational repair proteins of the RAD 52 epistasis group and involved in HR. We analyse the biochemical properties of two Rad 52 homologs in S. pombe, Rad 22 A and Rad 22 B. We examine combined mutations in RAD 52 and RAD 54 homologs in S. pombe and mice. We investigate the importance of <b>sumolyation</b> of recombinational repair proteins. We also introduce mice deficient in Sycp 1, important for coordination during meiosis and the formation of crossover...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Magnaporthe oryzae, {{rice blast}} fungus, {{is the most}} devastating {{pathogen}} of rice. It {{has emerged as a}} model phytopathogen for the study of host-pathogen interactions. A large body of data has been generated on different aspects of biology of this fungus and on host-pathogen interactions. However, most of the data is scattered and is not available as a single resource for researchers in this field. Description Genomic Resources of Magnaporthe oyzae (GROMO), is a specialized, and comprehensive database for rice blast fungus, integrating information from several resources. GROMO contains information on genomic sequence, mutants available, gene expression, localization of proteins obtained from a variety of repositories, as primary data. In addition, prediction of domains, pathways, protein-protein interactions, <b>sumolyation</b> sites and biochemical properties that were obtained after computational analysis of protein sequences have also been included as derived data. This database has an intuitive user interface that shall prompt the user to explore various possible information resources available on a given gene or a protein, from a single source. Conclusion Currently, information on M. oryzae is available from different resources like BROAD MIT Magnaporthe database, Agrobacterium tumefaciens -mediated transformation (ATMT) M. oryzae database, Magnaporthe grisea – Oryza sativa (MGOS) and Massive Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) databases. In the GROMO project, an effort has been made to integrate information from all these databases, derive some new data based on the available information analyzed by relevant programs and make more insightful predictions to better understand the biology of M. oryzae. The database is currently available at: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|Laminopathies are a {{collection}} of over ten distinct and overlapping disease phenotypes resulting from over 340 known mutations in the LMNA gene. This gene encodes the alternatively spliced nuclear intermediate filament proteins, lamins A and C, that localize to the nuclear envelope and the nucleoplasm. These proteins {{are part of the}} nuclear lamina which is a complex meshwork of over 80 proteins underlying the inner nuclear membrane. Lamins have proposed roles in nuclear structural support and in multiple cell processes that include gene regulation, chromatin organization, and protein localization/scaffolding. Previous research has shown that in vitro expression of a laminopathic mutant lamin C resulted in nuclear aggregation of lamin C and subsequently sequestration of a co-expressed post-translational modification protein, sumo 1. Sumoylation is the attachment of the s&barbelow;mall u&barbelow;biquitin-like modifier 1 &barbelow; (sumo 1) to a target lysine(s) on substrate proteins which serves to regulate various protein characteristics such as transcriptional activity, localization, protein interaction, and stability. In this thesis, I investigated the <b>sumolyation</b> of lamin NC and the effect of laminopathic mutant lamin NC on sumoylation and sumo 1 localization. It was demonstrated that although not modified by sumo 1, mutant lamin NC elicits a mutation-dependent alteration of sumo 1 localization in vitro in cultured mouse myoblasts overexpressing lamin NC and primary mouse myoblasts expressing endogenous mutant lamins, as well as in vivo in affected muscle tissue from a laminopathy knock-in mouse model. Furthermore, in cultured myoblasts, this correlated with a mutation-dependent significant increase in the steady-state level of protein sumoylation by sumo 1. Taken together, these results suggest that the alteration of sumo 1 localization and sumoylation may be contributing factors in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of laminopathies...|$|E
