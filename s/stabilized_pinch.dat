50|$|Researchers in the UK {{planned a}} major {{assault on the}} <b>stabilized</b> <b>pinch</b> field, and started {{construction}} of ZETA in 1954. ZETA {{was by far the}} largest fusion device of its era, and equipped with all of the latest equipment. At the time, almost all fusion research was classified, so progress on ZETA was generally unknown outside the labs working on it. However, in 1956 the walls started to come down, and when they visited ZETA at Harwell, US researchers became aware that they were about to be trumped. A race broke out as teams {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic rushed to be the first to complete their <b>stabilized</b> <b>pinch</b> machines.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{remained}} relatively unknown for years, Soviet scientists used the pinch concept {{to develop the}} tokamak device. Unlike the <b>stabilized</b> <b>pinch</b> devices in the US and UK, the tokamak used considerably more energy in the stabilizing magnets, and much less in the plasma current. This reduced the instabilities due to the large currents in the plasma, and led to great improvements in stability. The results of their experiments were so good that other researchers were skeptical of {{them when they were}} first announced in full force in 1968. Members of the still-operational ZETA team were called in to verify the results. The tokamak has since gone on to become the most studied approach to controlled fusion.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{solutions}} were proposed, and by 1953 the [...] "stabilized pinch" [...] seemed {{to solve the}} problems encountered on earlier devices. <b>Stabilized</b> <b>pinch</b> machines added a set of external magnets that created a toroidal magnetic field inside the chamber. When the device was fired, this field added to the one created by the current in the plasma. The result was that the formerly straight magnetic field was twisted into a helix, which the particles followed as they travelled around the tube {{under the influence of the}} current. A particle near the outside of the tube that would want to kink outward would travel along these lines until it found itself on the inside of the tube, where its outward-directed motion would bring it back into the centre of the plasma.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for selecting 'most probable' MHD states compatible with certain global constraints (e. g., the energy, the toroidal magnetic flux, the total toroidal electric current, or the magnetic helicity). These states occur as the solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations which are far simpler {{than the original}} MHD equations. The <b>stabilized</b> Z <b>pinch</b> is discussed {{by way of illustration}} of the theory of probable states...|$|R
40|$|In {{the concept}} of the dynamic hohlraum an imploding z-pinch is {{optically}} thick to its own radiation. Radiation may be trapped inside the pinch to give a radiation temperature inside the pinch greater than that outside the pinch. The radiation is typically produced by colliding an outer Z-pinch liner onto an inner liner. The collision generates a strongly radiating shock, and the radiation is trapped by the outer liner. As the implosion continues after the collision the radiation temperature may continue to increase due to ongoing PdV (pressure times change in volume) work done by the implosion. In principal the radiation temperature may increase to {{the point at which the}} outer liner burns through, becomes optically thin, and no longer traps the radiation. One application of the dynamic hohlraum is to drive an ICF (inertial confinement fusion) pellet with the trapped radiation field. Members of the dynamic hohlraum team at Sandia National Labs have used the pulsed power driver Z (20 LMA, 100 ns) to create a dynamic hohlraum with temperature linearly ramping from 100 to 180 eV over 5 ns. On this shot zp 214 a nested tungsten wire array of 4 and 2 cm diameters with masses of 2 and 1 mg imploded onto a 2. 5 mg plastic annulus at 5 mm diameter. The current return can on this shot was slotted. It is likely the radiation temperature may be increased to over 200 CV by <b>stabilizing</b> the <b>pinch</b> with a solid current return can. A current return can with 9 slots imprints 9 filaments onto the imploding pinch. This degrades the optical trapping and the quality of the liner collision. A 1. 6 mm diameter capsule situated inside this dynamic hohlraum of zp 214 would see 15 kJ of radiation impinging on its surface before the pinch itself collapses to a 1. 6 mm diameter. Dynamic hohlraum shots including pellets are scheduled to take place on Z in September of 1998...|$|R
40|$|In a prior paper, we {{considered}} the linear stability of magnetized jets that carry no net electric current {{and do not}} have current sheets. In this paper, in addition to physically well-motivated magnetic field structures, we also include the effects of jet shear. The jets we study have finite thermal pressure in addition to having realistic magnetic field structures and velocity shear. We find that shear has a strongly stabilizing effect on various modes of jet instability. Increasing shear <b>stabilizes</b> the fundamental <b>pinch</b> modes at long wavelengths and short wavelengths. Increasing shear also stabilizes the first reflection pinch modes at short wavelengths. Increasing shear has only a very modest stabilizing effect on the fundamental kink modes at long wavelengths; however, increasing shear does have a strong stabilizing effect on the fundamental kink modes at short wavelengths. The first reflection kink modes are strongly stabilized by increasing shear at shorter wavelengths. Overall, we find that the combined effect of magnetic field and shear stabilizes jets more than shear alone. In addition to the results from a formal linear stability analysis, we present a novel way of visualizing and understanding jet stability.

The {open_quotes}helical-D{close_quotes} geometry produces a very large axial (toroidal) transform of magnetic line direction that reverses the pitch of the magnetic lines without the need of azimuthal (poloidal) plasma current. Thus, {{there is no need}} of a {open_quotes}dynamo{close_quotes} process and its associated fluctuations. The resulting configuration has the high magnetic shear and pitch reversal of the reversed field pinch (RFP). (Pitch = P = qR, where R = major radius).

40|$|The {{toroidal}} {{version of}} the hard-core pinch tube is created by levitating a ring conductor inside a toroidal shell. The magnitude of induced H/ sub theta / necessary for levi-tation is small in terms of field strengths normally desired for energetic pinches. In a 3 -in. glass-and-copper toroid of square cross section a 3 / 4 -in. hollow copper ring has been levitated with a 60 - cycle current of 3 kiloamperes. A 12 -in stainless steel tube of round cross section is being built. The stability of nearvacuum field hard-core configurations is best investigated in toroidal geometry. At high power levels and low plasma densities, the conventional toroidal stabilized pinch'' is subject to an anomalous plasma energy leakage to the wall, which cannot {{be explained by the}} observed ultraviolet radiation alone. A critical question is, therefore, whether the relative stability of some hard-core pinches, as reflected by the smoothness and reproducibility of magnetic probe traces, is reflected by an improved containment of the plasma en-ergy leading to high temperature. A toroidal hard-core tube is also useful in studying the nature of the nonhydromagnetic instabilities observed in the linear inverse <b>stabilized</b> <b>pinch.</b> '' The presence and condition of electrodes appear to have a substantial effect on the magnitude of these instabilities, as would be expected if they were, for instance, of electrostatic origin. In order to complement the plasma study of the hard-core pinch, we have developed an analogue method using sodium tubes to simulate the current-carrying layer. In this way the purely hydromagnetic aspect of the plasma behavior can be isolated. (auth...|$|E
40|$|An {{heuristic}} {{analysis of the}} pre-cusp phase of the present Tormac experiments has been carried out. The immediate goal has been to identify the requirements for producing a <b>stabilized</b> <b>pinch</b> in Tormac V qualitatively {{similar to that in}} Tormac IV. Concurrently, V has been modified to increase the pinch current and experimental investigation is underway. The experimental procedure is to introduce a toroidal magnetic field into the gas filled chamber. A toroidal electric field is then induced which ionizes the gas; the associated toroidal current simultaneously pinches the discharge. Uncertainty about the details of this process, in particular, about the amount of toroidal flux trapped within the pinch, has led to a one parameter theory. Speculation about the plasma heating mechanism and the subsequent interaction of pinch and cusp is left aside at this time. The chambers are basically rectangular in cross section; but, for simplicity, an equivalent radius is used. Although the experimental discharge probably evolves into a diffuse pinch, a cylindrical sheet pinch model is studied as a first step in understanding the qualitative features of the experiment. A simple Alfven scaling for instability time scales, appropriate for the previous weak pinch and considered {{in the design of the}} ringing frequency of the induction circuit is now supplemented by the sheet pinch model. If merited, a more quantitative numerical diffuse pinch model can be developed later. It should be pointed out that cusp confinement, the central problem of the Tormac program, is not addressed here. The goal is simply to identify the requirements for reproducing this particular phase of the Tormac IV experiment...|$|E

40|$|In certain plasma {{discharge}} experiments, {{it has been}} observed that under specific conditions a plasma glow discharge column tends to seek the central location of the discharge electrodes away from the electrode edges and chamber walls. Further, the column appears to have the properties of a <b>stabilized</b> equilibrium plasma <b>pinch</b> in a glow (non-arc-like) state. This is unusual since, normally field enhancements occur on edges resulting in arc-like discharge breakdown. Also, the column of plasma that protrudes from the anode emits highly intense, non-uniform light that is uncharacteristically bright for a glow discharge. The main purpose of this thesis is to explore the likely experimental cause and basic physics of this phenomenon. In particular, the glow discharge 2 ̆ 7 s secondary electron beam is explored and the consequences of this moderately energetic beam are examined. It appears that under certain conditions and assumptions, this secondary electron beam will initiate and sustain electron channeling and subsequent pinch forces due to charge repulsion, charge neutralization, and self-magnetic forces. This theory can be expanded beyond a glow discharge and be applied to any moderately energetic beam that passes through plasma, as long as the assumptions and conditions are not violated. An experimental apparatus was also constructed to investigate this phenomenon. It delivers controlled pulses that generate stable and repetitive pinched discharges. It allows the user to change the parameters and the conditions of the discharge and to study the conditions that bring about plasma constriction. Measurement tools were integrated into the system including current and voltage probes and image analysis tools. Finally, the conditions and assumptions built into the theory are revisited and compared to experiments and simulation, in order to discuss the applicability of the theory to a constricted glow discharge. Based on the models developed and on experimental implications, a parameter space based on the properties of the discharge has been identified that leads to the pinch of the discharge. Further, from transient discharge measurements, various properties of the pinch have been identified...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made these last decades in the development of hydrogeological numerical flow modelling for describing the hydrodynamic behaviour of landslides. However, these new sophisticated methods are still very seldom used in the problems of slope instability in particular because of the hydrogeological complexity which characterizes them; thin aquifers, discontinuous media, succession of saturated and unsaturated zones, low permeabilities, high hydraulic gradients, lithological heterogeneity, strong contrasts of permeabilities and heterogeneous infiltration. Predictive models of flow in the subsurface, which are often based on homogeneous porous media types of representation, are badly adapted to natural systems that are characterized by highly heterogeneous media such as landslides. These models are good and reliable on a landslide scale (regional scale), but their quality may be affected on a local scale by strong geological heterogeneities. Geological heterogeneities of the subsurface take part in determining the hydrodynamical and geomechanical behaviour of landslides. However, their spatial distribution is partially unknown. Thus, the principal objectives of this PhD thesis are: (i) To carry out an integrated multidisciplinary characterization study on the internal structure of landslides in flysch and Quaternary environments, in order to clarify the organisation of the geological heterogeneities and to identify the hydrodynamic implications. (ii) To propose a conceptual model representing the geological architecture and the hydrogeological functioning. (iii) To examine the effects of heterogeneity and anisotropy on flow systems. (iv) To better understand the influence of geological heterogeneities on the mechanical behaviour of large landslides by performing numerical sensitivity analyses, by means of different heterogeneity scenarios on the field parameters. (v) Finally, to test the incidences on slope stabilization techniques; evaluation of the efficiency of a drainage gallery work. The main test site of la Frasse landslide (VD, Switzerland) was chosen, and completed with additional landslide cases. The main results are the following: In most of the case studies, the landslide mass is composed of an old prehistoric <b>stabilized</b> mass, <b>pinched</b> between the active sliding mass and the bedrock, and playing an important hydrologic role. The stabilized mass and the bedrock form the substratum of the landslide. Landslides occurring in these types of media are defined by an organized heterogeneous environment with "fracture" flows and discontinuity porosity. The overall hydraulic conductivity is low, and locally high permeable zones exist. Regional groundwater circulations are limited and form local interconnected aquicludes organised in thin aquifers, and presenting saturated and unsaturated zones. The hydrogeological analyses showed that the system presents a bimodal permeability; (i) Low hydraulic conductivities characterizing the global matrix and defining the capacitive fraction, and (ii) high permeable features, with high hydraulic conductivities defining the conductive fraction, and favouring strong channelling effects. Besides, the observation shows that the aquifer system is generally very reactive with important magnitudes. Often, there is a straight correlation between water level variation and climatic conditions (rainy events). Landslides are characterized by two important inflows namely effective infiltration from the surface and lateral inflows from the neighbouring units. Water transfer between the stabilized mass and the active mass may be important and thus have to be considered. The existence of water transfer between the bedrock and the landslide mass (stabilized and active) is not well established. The bedrock and the landslide mass present a hydrological behavioural independence. Theoretical two- and three-dimensional flow models are used to investigate the effects of the spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity on the underground flows. The role of the connectivity in generating flow channelling is examined thanks to the observation of close relations between the permeability and the hydraulic pressures. The sensitivity analysis shows clearly that the relation between local permeability and hydraulic pressures is not straight, and that the organization of the flows depends on the heterogeneity of the hydraulic properties and their spatial correlation. Strong channelling effects are observed in highly heterogeneous porous media. The development of flow channelling {{as a function of the}} variance of the natural log permeability values and the correlation lengths is demonstrated. The integrated multi-disciplinary geological characterization at the La Frasse test site combined with the hydrogeological and lithological data of several additional case studies led to the proposal of a global conceptual model. The following assumptions are considered to enable a subsequent quantification of flow components: The flow occurs under confined to leaky conditions, with leakage varying in space; The flow framework is controlled by a complex multi-layer system, isolated lenses or perched aquifer; The aquifer system is divided into interconnected hydrological zones presenting various degrees of saturation; Each hydrological zone may function individually from the others; Horizontally and vertically, the flow direction in the porous matrix is affected by prevailing structural patterns generating channeling effects; The flow is multidirectional, free and channelized, and is affected by temporal and spatial changes; The aquifer is under an unsteady flow regime due to seasonal variation of natural gradients; A conceptual model based on a simple reservoir approach is proposed. It allows the representation of most of the field observations and the main characteristics, namely the organized heterogeneity and the duality of the aquifers. The system is represented by various reservoirs more or less connected and saturated. Complex storage capacities and plug-flow effects may record past events and reactive sliding processes several months after the last important rainy event. The analysis shows that function of the capacity and the degree of saturation of the system, an important hydrological event is not necessarily associated to a reactivation. And, according to the degree of complexity of the system (saturation, connectivity [...] .) a localized geological modification (variation of permeability, reservoir burst [...] .) may produce a chain reaction, and generate failures in unexpected places. The conductive fraction favours the drainage of the system, whereas the capacitive fraction controls the distribution of the hydraulic heads. The role of the phreatic nappe, through the conductive fraction, is to drain and control the hydrologic equilibrium of the system. Therefore landslide remediation with the help of a deep drainage gallery is obviously the most valuable method for this type of landslide. It supports and enhances the natural effects of the conductive fraction in draining the system. Finally, in this context the efficiency of civil engineering works was evaluated according to the heterogeneity of the medium. This study describes transient hydrogeological and geomechanical models realized jointly in 2006 by the EPFL and GeoMod SA within the framework of the stabilization work of the La Frasse landslide. These models evaluate the impact of a deep drainage gallery with subvertical pipes towards the surface in terms of reduction of the deformation velocities and increase of the factor of safety of the landslide. Three variants consisting of different inter pipe spacings are tested. Considering the local heterogeneities, the results show that a mean spacing between the pipes of the order of 10 m is able to control the temporal head fluctuations between the wells within a range of some meters. Moreover, this solution induces a strong diminution of the predicted displacements during a specific crisis, from 101 cm for the model without drainage to around 14 cm for the drained model, and a significant gain of security (from 1. 05 to 1. 30) ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} known that a trapped {{longitudinal}} magnetic field has a stabilizing influence on a linear pinch. Once such a <b>stabilized</b> <b>pinch</b> is set up, how-ever, diffusion will lead to mixing of the initially crossed fields; the torsion of the field lines will di-minish and the plasma may ultimately become unstable. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to study continuous plasma and field distributions in order to see at what point instability might be expected. A variational principle has been given 1 which applies very nicely to the problem at hand. Briefly, one subjects the plasma to a displacement Ç and calculates the resulting change in the total energy, SW, of the hydromagnetic system. Stability then hinges on whether or not some can produce a diminution of the energy. If we define the vector Q = V X [Ç X B] it turns out that the change in energy is bW = Çd*x 0 - 0 - 4 т 7 J. [Q x Ç] (1) where y is the specific heat ratio and p is the pressure. The integration is taken over the complete volume. If a displacement exists which makes SW negative, we have instability. In the linear pinch we are dealing with axial symmetry and the components of the magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates are В = (0, В в, Bz). Moreover, it is assumed that Bd, Bz and p are functions of r alone. It is then possible to analyze Ç in terms of displacements of the form. Ш (2) The integration with respect to 6 and z can be carried out and bW can be minimized with respect to £e and £z by purely algebraic means.

40|$|At {{this first}} {{opportunity}} for open scientific dis-cussions {{on this subject}} we look forward with eagerness to exchanging experiences with others and hearing of the courses taken towards the common goal in the various laboratories of the world. Early Development At this laboratory, the peculiarly intriguing {{nature of the problem}} and the admirable consequences of its solution have long been recognized. Lively discussions of such matters as plasma drift in a torus and its effect on achieving a laboratory thermonuclear reac-tion occurred between Fermi, Kerst, Landshoff, Teller, R. R. Wilson and the writer in 1946, and an unsuccessful search for neutrons from colliding Munroe jets of metal deuterides was made at about the same time, based on an earlier paper by Ulam and the writer. When the subject was reopened in 1951, the toroidal pinch (as proposed, with a superimposed Bz field, by the writer in 1948) was selected as the confinement geometry for initial study and it passed through the usual vicissitudes and modifications— instability, linear dynamic pinches (Columbus), rf pinches, so called Bz and wall stabilized pinches; while parallel speculations and experimental forays were made into cusped geometries (Picket Fence), spinning plasmas, shocks in axial and convergent geometries and magnetic mirrors. Our ideas and plans have undergone profound changes during the last seven years and are in process of undergoing another. As little as half a year ago, the chief obstacle to the achievement of a thermonuclear reaction via the <b>stabilized</b> <b>pinch</b> appeared to be contamination of the plasma by foreign atoms sputtered or evaporated off the walls. Doubtless this particular obstacle is still there, but in the meantime a crevasse has opened at our feet, in the form of our new experimental observa-tions of high energy losses from the pinched plasma. If these turn out to be due to the newly predicted surface hydromagnetic instabilities, then we know how to overcome these and the outlook may be better than ever.
