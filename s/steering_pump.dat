25|$|Two {{models were}} offered: AN68/1R (9.4m in length) and AN68/2R (10.2m in length). Power {{assisted}} steering was standard on the AN68/2R and optional on the AN68/1R. The <b>steering</b> <b>pump</b> was power driven, which replaced the early belt driven system, while the only available engine {{was the new}} Leyland O.680. A wide variety of body styles from various manufacturers continued to be offered, allowing the Atlantean to be tailor made to requirements from operators ranging from the small independent to the large city corporation.|$|E
25|$|Also {{new to the}} GS {{line was}} an Electric Power Steering (EPS) system {{replacing}} the previous model's hydraulic <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> while the V8 model featured a Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. In August 2005, the GS 430 was the first car by Toyota with Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). AVS monitors and adjusts the shock-absorber settings at each wheel, depending on the conditions. On rough roads, for example, damping is reduced for a more comfortable ride. And, while cornering, the suspension is tightened to help reduce body lean and provide even greater responsiveness. Using the EPS system the GS can automatically compensate for crosswinds.|$|E
2500|$|For 1969, a new one-piece, full-width grille, new {{taillights}} {{and trim}} were featured. Standard engines were unchanged, although refinements in the Chrysler Clean Air System (formerly Clean Air Package) produced better operating economy from the 6-cylinder engines. Improved drum brake self-adjusters, {{a more efficient}} power <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> and improvements to the optional Sure-Grip differential were also highlighted. [...] Starting with cars built on January 1, 1969, front seat headrests were now standard. 1969 Valiants did not have side marker lamps, they would return in 1970.|$|E

25|$|Drive train, {{front and}} rear suspension, brakes, radiators, master cylinders, trunnions, {{steering}} columns, power <b>steering</b> <b>pumps,</b> engines, transmissions, brake drums and rotors are interchangeable with 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors and Classics. Some parts are even interchangeable back to 1958 and earlier, while other components were used by AMC into the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the power}} <b>steering</b> <b>pumps</b> were sourced from General Motors' Saginaw Gear division, while others were sourced from Atsugi. This was the second Nissan to use US-sourced parts besides the Borg-Warner T-5 {{transmission}} used in the 82-86 Nissan ZX Turbos. The use of USA-made parts was phased in prior {{to the passage of}} local content laws imposed by the U.S. Government.|$|R
2500|$|Differences to the RHD Australian AMXs (compared to the U.S. models) {{included}} different outside rear-view mirrors, {{and black}} vinyl trim inside the [...] "AMX" [...] circle logo on the C-pillars, As with Rambler sedans built in right hand drive, windscreen wipers were not reversed, remaining LHD pattern, {{but the power}} brake booster and heater on the firewall were swapped over. Although the power <b>steering</b> <b>pump</b> remained in its usual left location, {{the remainder of the}} steering components were {{on the right side of}} the car. The cars came with [...] and automatic transmission, power steering, power disk brakes, [...] "twin-grip" [...] rear axle, and other items that were optional on the U.S. models. All of the Australian AMX interiors were finished in black and featured unique seats, door panels, and a fiberglass RHD dashboard with a wood-grained instrument cluster in front of the driver. The Australian AMXs came with a large high level of equipment and were promoted as [...] "super" [...] personal luxury cars.|$|E
2500|$|The RX 400h {{gasoline}} engine switched off automatically {{and the car}} ran completely on electricity when either stationary, decelerating, or being driven at slow speedsâ€”less than [...] Not only did the hybrid drive in the RX 400h improve fuel economy, but {{with the assistance of}} the electric motor, the RX 400h could reach [...] in 7.3 seconds, quicker than the gasoline-only RX. Despite the increased performance, the RX 400h/Harrier Hybrid consumed roughly the same amount of gasoline as a compact four-cylinder sedan and it qualified as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) in the US. Passing power at lower and mid engine rpm's was noticeably improved due to the electric motor. The water pump for the {{gasoline engine}} is driven by the camshaft belt. To improve efficiency, and because the gasoline engine shuts down during electric-only operation, the alternator, power <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> and air conditioner compressor are beltless; rather than being tied to engine output, these components are powered by electric motors via the battery instead.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the power <b>steering</b> <b>pump</b> driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the gear drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E
25|$|During {{much of the}} 20th century, Saginaw's {{economy was}} {{dominated}} by manufacturing related to the automotive industry; most notably, manual transmission assemblies, steering gear boxes and power <b>steering</b> <b>pumps.</b> At the height of manufacturing in the 1960s and 1970s, the city and neighboring Buena Vista Township hosted 12 General Motors plants, an Eaton Manufacturing plant where 5,000 people turned out auto parts (demolished 2008), and numerous smaller concerns.|$|R

5000|$|Minimal noise {{pollution}} - Unlike trams or gasoline and diesel buses, trolleybuses are almost silent, lacking {{the noise of}} an engine or wheels on rails. Most noise comes from auxiliary systems such as power <b>steering</b> <b>pumps</b> and air conditioning. Early trolleybuses without these systems were even quieter and, in the UK at least, were {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Silent Service". This however can also be seen as a disadvantage, with some pedestrians falling victim to what was known as [...] "Silent Death" [...] (in Britain) or [...] "Whispering Death" [...] (in Australia).|$|R

50|$|An {{underdrive}} pulley {{refers to}} a crankshaft or accessory pulley (a/c, alternator, power <b>steering,</b> water <b>pump,</b> etc.) designed to turn at a slower speed than stock. To Underdrive means to slow the rate of rotation in a system. Underdrive is achieved by either making the crank/main (drive) pulley smaller or the accessory (driven) pulley larger than the original diameter pulleys.|$|R
40|$|In modern {{vehicles}} {{the steering}} systems are still widely equipped with power-assisted <b>steering</b> <b>pumps.</b> In most cases vane pumps are used which limit the fluid volume flow in dependence of required pressure and running speed {{by a special}} design of the internal control valve. This control valve internally redirects the volume flow inside the pump leading still to unnecessary fluid circulation. Variable displacement pumps now offer an additional opportunity to eliminate the internal volume flow in dependence of the required load with reduced losses and hence increased efficiency. This is realized by a variable adjustment of the displacement cells, but simultaneously the variable force and load distributions inside the pump make the acoustic optimization even more difficult. In this paper the kinematics of the vane pump are modelled with a combined analytical and numerical approach. The data out of this model are used as input data for the hydraulic model of the variable displacement vane pump with a commercial tool. Both models are validated with data from test rig investigations. With this validated virtual prototype different design options are developed and finally successfully investigated on a test rig and in a passenger vehicle...|$|R
