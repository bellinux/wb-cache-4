40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the design, {{manufacturing}} and characterization of an active push/pull toggle RF MEMS switch for <b>satellite</b> <b>redundancy</b> networks. The actively controlled pullup mechanism allows for extended restoring capabilities of the switch in case of down-state stiction due to long time continuous bias voltage. As a proof of concept an active push/pull MEMS capacitive switch was modeled, designed and manufactured in shunt configuration on a 50 Ω coplanar transmission line. RF measurement results show a return loss better than 20 dB in the 0. 1 – 40 GHz range and an insertion loss better than 0. 2 dB up to 20 GHz. Long term stress characterization is performed, proving the lifetime of the proposed device for over 50 million cycles. Finally the capability of restoring the membrane OFF state position after down-state stiction has been demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|This {{doctorate}} thesis {{focuses on}} the analysis, design and characterization of Radio-Frequency (RF) Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) switches for space applications. The work was inspired {{and supported by the}} European Space Agency (ESA) Contract No. ITT AO/ 1 - 5288 / 06 /NL/GLC ?High Reliability Redundancy Switch?. The main purpose of the project is the design and realization of high-reliability RF MEMS switches for <b>satellite</b> payload <b>redundancy</b> networks. Up to now, the common <b>satellite</b> architecture implements <b>redundancy</b> networks by means of bulky devices. RF MEMS switches allow for extremely miniaturized networks along with outstanding performances in terms of losses, power consumption and linearity, not really achievable with solid state devices. As requirements for such an application, RF MEMS switches have to survive under extremely harsh environmental and operating conditions. In particular the device should handle continuous bias voltage (at least for 10 years), 5 W of RF input power and around 1000 actuation cycles without meaningful electrical and mechanical failure. The thesis proposes novel mechanical solutions to accomplish this task, exploiting active restoring mechanisms able to restore the previous status of switch in case of reversible failure. This work also provides a deep insight on the main reliability aspects of a RF MEMS device such as dielectric charging, contact degradation and power handling...|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the time}} of the licence award, Amstrad withdrew its backing as they {{believed}} {{it was not possible to}} sell a satellite dish for £250. Australian businessman Alan Bond joined the consortium along with Reed International, Chargeurs, Next plc and London Merchant Securities amongst others. BSB earmarked the bulk of the first round of financing for buying and launching two <b>satellites</b> (for <b>redundancy</b> and provision of further channels later) and planned a second round close to the commencement of broadcasting operations. It commissioned Hughes Aircraft to provide two high-powered satellites using launch vehicles from McDonnell Douglas. Both companies were American and had established reputations for reliability. Crucially, Hughes was main contractor and offered a commercial space industry first, [...] "in orbit delivery", whereby BSB's risk was reduced because payments were due after the satellites were launched and operational.|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} maintenance of space systems consists in building reliable <b>satellites</b> through <b>redundancy</b> and replacing them {{in case of}} failure, or whenever an upgrade is necessary. On-orbit servicing could change this paradigm. What would be the missions for which servicing would be most interesting, and what price would they {{be willing to pay}} for the capability to be serviced? The answer to these questions would provide valuable guidelines as to which servicing technologies to develop, and at what cost. Assuming that the technologies enabling automated servicing are available, traditional metrics and models are first proposed to systematically evaluate servicing cost-effectiveness within a representative trade space of serviceable missions and servicing infrastructures. It is shown that though it can capture some elements of cost-effectiveness, the traditional approach tends to underestimate the value of servicing and demonstrate cost advantages smaller than the cost uncertainty. This issue is solved by then proposing a new approach to on-orbit servicing. First, the intrinsic value of servicing is studied separately from its cost. Furthermore, a first framework to evaluate the flexibility provided by on-orbit servicing to space systems is developed. Thi...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- A {{formation}} of satellites flying in deep space {{can be specified}} {{in terms of the}} relative satellite positions and absolute <b>satellite</b> orientations. The <b>redundancy</b> in the relative position specification generates a family of con-trol topologies with equivalent stability and reference tracking performance, one of which can be implemented without requiring communication between the spacecraft. A relative position design formulation is inherently unobservable, and a methodology f o r circumventing this problem is presented. Additional redundancy in the control actuation space can be exploited f o r feed-forward control of the formation centroid's location in space, or for minimization of total fuel consumption. The collective behavior of spacecraft flying in formation can be used to synthesize instruments of greater utility than could otherwise be achieved with a single spacecraft. One example, which motivates much of our work, is an interferometric imaging system composed of multiple space-craft. Several interferometric flight projects, based on formation flying, have been propose...|$|R
50|$|Global Positioning System and {{communications}} satellites orbit at higher altitudes of 20,000 km and 36,000 km respectively, putting {{them out of}} range of solid-fueled Intercontinental ballistic missiles. Liquid-fueled space launch vehicles could reach those altitudes, but they are more time-consuming to launch and could be attacked on the ground before being able to launch in rapid succession. The constellation of 30 GPS <b>satellites</b> provides <b>redundancy</b> where at least four satellites can be received in six orbital planes at any one time, so an attacker would need to disable at least six satellites to disrupt the network. Even if this is achieved, signal degradation only lasts for 95 minutes, leaving little time to take much decisive action, and backup inertial navigation systems (INS) would still be available for relatively accurate movement as well as laser guidance for weapons targeting. For communications, the Naval Telecommunications System (NTS) used by the U.S. Navy uses three elements: tactical communications among a battle group; long-haul communications between shore-based forward Naval Communications Stations (NAVCOMSTAs) and deployed afloat units; and strategic communication connecting NAVCOMSTAs with National Command Authorities (NCA). The first two elements use line-of-sight (25 - 30 km) and extended line-of-sight (300 - 500 km) radios respectively, so only strategic communications are dependent on satellites. China would prefer to cut off deployed units from each other and then negotiate with the NCA to have the battle group withdraw or stand down, but ASATs could only achieve the opposite. Even if somehow a communications satellite were hit, a battle group could still perform its missions in the absence of direct guidance from the NCA.|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{communication}} is expanding rapidly, finding new uses and pushing {{the development of}} terminals. There are many systems in use today, for example mobile phone systems for voice communication, satellite navigation/positioning systems, and short range data communication. Soon new systems for high speed data communication are expected to emerge, and also systems that use much higher frequencies than today. When {{it comes to the}} mobile terminals, some general trends in the development are: shrinking size, more advanced antennas with carefully designed radiation characteristics, larger production volumes, and shorter lead times. This dissertation presents three new antenna types for mobile communication terminals, each studied experimentally. These are the dual feed monopole antenna, a broadband dual RC-loaded loop antenna, and the capacitance-short-load antenna, suitable for different applications. The dual feed monopole antenna is with its two ports suitable for example in <b>satellites</b> where <b>redundancy</b> is required. The RC-loaded loop antenna and the capacitance-short-load antenna are suitable in mobile terminals that are very small compared to the wavelength, e. g. ear plugs and wrist watches. The capacitance-short-load antenna is also highly suitable for electrical tunability over a very wide frequency range. Furthermore, reverberation chamber antenna measurement techniques are studied theoretically and experimentally. The studies include measurement of correlation coefficient between antennas, reflective measurements of free-space reflection coefficient and radiation efficiency, models for mechanical and frequency mode stirring efficiency, a chamber with a Rice distributed signal amplitude, a chamber with an anisotropic signal environment, and a finite probability distribution for random signals with limited power. All these studies serve to expand the usefulness of reverberation chambers as a means for fast, accurate, and cheap antenna characterization, in both product development and production. Finally, information retrieval from phaseless radiation measurements is studied theoretically. Phaseless measurements are common when characterizing the radiation properties of complete mobile terminals, for example in production tests...|$|R
50|$|Like larger satellites, CubeSats often feature {{multiple}} computers handling different {{tasks in}} parallel including the attitude control, power management, payload operation, and primary control tasks. COTS attitude control systems typically include their own computer, {{as do the}} power management systems. Payloads {{must be able to}} interface with the primary computer to be useful, which sometimes requires the use of another small computer. This may be due to limitations in the primary computer's ability to control the payload with limited communication protocols, to prevent overloading the primary computer with raw data handling, or to ensure payload's operation continues uninterrupted by the spacecraft's other computing needs such as communication. Still, the primary computer may be used for payload related tasks, which might include image processing, data analysis, and data compression. Tasks which the primary computer typically handles include the delegation of tasks to the other computers, attitude control, calculations for orbital maneuvers, scheduling, and activation of active thermal control components. CubeSat computers are highly susceptible to radiation and builders will take special steps to ensure proper operation in the high radiation of space, {{such as the use of}} the ECC RAM. Some <b>satellites</b> may incorporate <b>redundancy</b> by implementing multiple primary computers, this could be done on valuable missions to lessen the risk of mission failure. Consumer smartphones have been used for computing in some CubeSats, such as NASA's PhoneSats.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{extensive}} interest in Special Purpose Inexpensive Satellite’s (SPINSAT) that perform cost effective space oriented missions. Reduced reliability and short delivery schedules are two key issues relating {{to the design of}} such satellites for minimizing acquisition costs. These issues are important factors in the design of a spacecraft power system which can be considered to be the heart of the entire satellite. The power system constitutes {{a substantial portion of the}} overall satellite system cost that must be reduced for SPINSAT missions. Minimum cost or inexpensive satellite implies prudent power system design with minimal redundancy, inexpensive energy source and battery with high cycle life. All of these factors must be considered during the design phase of a small SPINSAT and in particular, of the power system. Fairchild Space Company was recently awarded a contract to build such a small satellite for the Profile (Passive Radio Frequency Interference Location Experiment) program. The power system for the Profile program has gone through the considerations mentioned above in terms of cost, reliability, mission life and requirements compliance. Some of the major factors that were addressed during the design phase for Profile are the selection of battery type, battery charge control, main bus voltage level, power control and conditioning, dependence on other parts of the <b>satellite,</b> and system <b>redundancy.</b> Various trade-off studies were conducted in order to achieve an optimum design for minimizing the satellite acquisition costs. This paper describes the Profile power system design, the rationale for component selection (including system topology and bus voltage), and how the system design satisfies the primary SPINSAT objectives...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains a}} detailed account of a study to investigate the interactions between space system cost-effectiveness and spacecraft reliability and redundancy. It is submitted to the University of Surrey for the degree of MPhil by research (in collaboration with the Defence Research Agency). Currently there is a strong drive from within the UK to understand the cost drivers and minimise the costs of government funded space ventures. Present programmes are concerned with satellite communications systems and remote sensing satellite systems. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate and improve understanding of the interactions between the cost-effectiveness of such systems and the reliability and <b>redundancy</b> of the <b>satellites</b> within them. A broad review of other work reveals that limited research has been carried out in this particular field and that there is scope for further investigation. To gain added insight into the process of optimising reliability and redundancy with respect to system cost a study of the failure histories of satellites is conducted. Failures of a wear-out nature are almost as common as random failures; and the AOCS, power subsystem and payload are found to be the most failure prone parts of a satellite. A model is constructed which relates <b>satellite</b> reliability and <b>redundancy</b> to system cost-effectiveness, after first making a number of simplifying assumptions. Results from using this model indicate that a cost optimum amount of redundancy can be found for the spacecraft in this type of system. Also an interesting and potentially useful algorithm is derived which allows satellite designers to make an objective choice between whether to use cheap low quality/ technology components or more expensive high quality/ technology versions in a satellite. A critical review of the model and results forms the basis of a series of recommendations for further research...|$|R
