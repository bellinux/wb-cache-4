6000|$|... "Well, yes, I do," [...] confessed Nelly suddenly; {{and then}} it was fully five minutes before Winslow gave her a chance to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad to see {{you both}} so ruddy; Cobhurst air must agree with you. And now, before we <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> {{let me ask you a}} question: Have you had your supper?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if she had lost the power of <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> or even of varying the phrase which, with such effort, she had {{compelled}} herself to utter.|$|R
5000|$|The student {{repeatedly}} {{asks the}} coach, [...] "Do birds fly?" [...] or [...] "Do fish swim?" [...] If the coach answers the question, the student acknowledges the answer. If the coach <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> the student advises the coach {{that he will}} repeat the question, and then does so.|$|R
50|$|At {{the police}} station, Brennan is interrogated by Detective Harding, before Booth and {{attorney}} Caroline Julian enter to shut Brennan up before she convicts herself. Detective Harding leaves after Caroline informs her that Brennan {{will not be}} <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Sam Potter tells Booth and Brennan that the mojo bags are being left with Brennan to prolong her amnesia. They then find out that according {{to the results of}} the toxicology screen, Brennan had not been drugged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unkind! How can I <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{than what}} you would call unkind? I {{disapprove}} of him altogether. And he is coming here with the express object of taking you away from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Afore I {{could say}} 'No' he 'ad come, bag and all; and afore I could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> he 'ad nipped {{into the office}} and stood there with his 'and on his chest panting.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{wonder at}} myself if I {{could look at}} your face and <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Oatmeal is a capital restorative; all your energy is coming back. There, {{that will make a}} {{magnificent}} blaze presently." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrades," [...] {{said the}} President, {{suddenly}} rising, [...] "we have spun out this farce long enough. I have called you {{down here to}} tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs (long inured to our levities) might hear some new seriousness in my voice. Comrades, we were discussing plans and naming places. I propose, before <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> that those plans and places should not be voted by this meeting, but should be left wholly in the control of some one reliable member. I suggest Comrade Saturday, Dr. Bull." ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK. Well, {{either they}} were too flabbergasted to <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> or <b>else</b> Crofts had {{prepared}} your mother. Anyhow, she didn't say anything; and Crofts didn't say anything; and Praddy only stared. After tea they got up and went; and I've not seen them since.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not sorry}} I am, your honour, to be turning {{my back on}} this country," [...] Mike said, as they rode out from the gate. [...] "The wine is good, {{which is more than}} I can <b>say</b> for <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in it, except that the people are good Catholics." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do {{not know}} that I can <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to you just at present. The bargain was a fair bargain, and you have no ground for any claim. You come to me with some mysterious threat------' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir--on my word of honor, on my sacred word of honor, you are mistaken--you are, indeed! I said Mr. Armadale--how could I <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else?</b> Please {{to let me}} go, sir--I'm {{pressed for}} time. I do assure you I'm dreadfully pressed for time!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} they’d ha’ done it," [...] said Mr. Burge frankly. [...] "I’ve ’ad all sorts trying to convert me; crying {{over me and}} praying over me.

5000|$|During {{the last}} day of the hearing, Dr. Colfield calls House {{brilliant}} but a fiasco; however, the patient's wife speaks up on House's behalf, saying House [...] "saved my husband's life." [...] At this point Colfield decides that House is an important part of the hospital and he would damage the hospital by sending him back to prison. Therefore, he rules that the accident was [...] "nobody's fault." [...] House before leaving accuses Colfield of being a coward; he then goes to see Chase, who is doing his rehabilitation exercises. House tells Chase how Colfield decided that his stabbing was nobody's fault, but he then says [...] "they're wrong, I'm sorry." [...] Chase blows him off, asking him if he's done, stating that he's kind of busy at the moment. House leaves without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no! Nothing of the kind, my dear!" [...] Hilary {{had to say}} this; he {{felt that}} it would be inhuman to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> else; nothing <b>else</b> would have been possible. [...] "Those newspapers--confound them!--you know how they get things all--You needn't mind what the papers say." ...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2011, at San Diego Comic-Con, Ono {{revealed}} {{during the}} Street Fighter X Tekken panel that while a new Darkstalkers title {{had not been}} approved, he reassured the series fans that [...] "Darkstalkers is not dead". He then proceeded to take {{a photo of the}} attendees at the panel holding up their money to send to decision makers at Capcom to show support for the game. In June 2012, a message [...] "Darkstalkers are not dead" [...] appeared in a trailer for the PlayStation Vita version of Street Fighter X Tekken; when asked about it, Ono wrote on his Twitter: [...] "I cant announce about Darkstalkers yet." [...] Ono later teased the presence of Darkstalkers at a panel for Street Fighters 25th Anniversary Celebration at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2012. Instead of taking a photo to send proof of demand to Capcoms upper management like he had done in the past, he stated, [...] "This year, you don’t have to do that, and it’s not necessarily bad news!", but refrained himself from <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
60|$|TANNER. You have {{no desire}} {{for that sort of}} notoriety. Bless you, I knew that answer would come as well as I know that a box of matches will come out of an {{automatic}} machine when I put a penny in the slot: you would be ashamed to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
6000|$|BRODIE. Perhaps {{you may be}} able to {{do without}} it altogether. I hope so. For you'll never have it.... Mary! ... I hate to see you look like that. If I could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> believe me, I would say it. But I have said all; every word is spoken; there's the end.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have saved}} my life, Zaki," [...] Gregory said, taking his hand. [...] "I must have fallen--every man {{tied to a}} tree is, as you see, dead; but before we <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> cut that patch off your clothes, or you might be shot as a Dervish by the first man you come across.|$|E
60|$|The Graftons had not arrived, {{but were}} daily expected. He really {{could not stand}} them. As for Lady Afy, he execrated the greenhornism which had made him feign a passion, and then get caught where he meant to capture. As for Sir Lucius, he wished to Heaven he would just take it into his head to repay him the fifteen {{thousand}} he had lent him at that confounded election, to <b>say</b> nothing of <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
5|$|Tony gets Meadow's boyfriend Finn De Trolio {{a summer}} job at a {{construction}} site, which is run by Aprile crew capo Vito Spatafore. Finn comes in early one morning and catches Vito performing fellatio on a security guard. Vito tries to buddy up to Finn so {{that he does not}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to anybody <b>else.</b> He even asks Finn to a Yankees game, which Finn does not attend. Finn soon quits the job out of fear.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{it is an}} irritating and pathetic {{thing that}} the three most popular phrases about Shaw are false. Modern criticism, like all weak things, is {{overloaded}} with words. In a healthy condition of language a man finds {{it very difficult to}} say the right thing, but at last says it. In this empire of journalese a man finds it so very easy to say the wrong thing that he never thinks of <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> False or meaningless phrases lie so ready to his hand that it is easier to use them than not to use them. These wrong terms picked up through idleness are retained through habit, and so the man has begun to think wrong almost before he has begun to think at all. Such lumbering logomachy is always injurious and oppressive to men of spirit, imagination or intellectual honour, and it has dealt very recklessly and wrongly with Bernard Shaw. He has contrived to get about three newspaper phrases tied to his tail; and those newspaper phrases are all and separately wrong. The three superstitions about him, it will be conceded, are generally these: first that he desires [...] "problem plays," [...] second that he is [...] "paradoxical," [...] and third that in his dramas as elsewhere he is specially [...] "a Socialist." [...] And {{the interesting thing is that}} when we come to his philosophy, all these three phrases are quite peculiarly inapplicable.|$|R
6000|$|... "And did she ask {{you also}} {{particularly}} {{to see him}} here in town?" [...] Mrs. Brigstock's hideous bonnet seemed to argue for the unsophisticated truth; {{and it was on}} Fleda's lips to reply that such had indeed been Mrs. Gereth's request. But she checked herself, and before she could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> Owen had addressed their companion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{and what}} of it?" [...] he cried. [...] "They {{are not likely to}} bully you or {{cross-examine}} you. Just tell them what you saw from the balcony. Indeed you can't very well <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> or they will see that you are lying, and then heaven alone knows what may happen to you, as well as to me." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was easier}} to say that at first than to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> They sat looking at each other. It {{seemed as if the}} {{interview}} must end without more speech, for speech was very difficult. Each felt that there would be something scorching in the words that would recall the irretrievable wrong. But soon, as Maggie looked, every distinct thought began to be overflowed by a wave of loving penitence, and words burst forth with a sob.|$|E
40|$|An essay {{submitted}} by Sean O'Sullivan to Professor W. A. Matheson, 25 April 1977. The {{focus of the}} essay is stable government, "As one of the chief, if not the predominant, force in giving Confederation its political shape, Ontario helped bring about a central government designed to promote, and dedicated to preserve, stability. In the governing of their own province, the people of Ontario have been faithful to that same goal of stability. Perhaps that steadfast attitude <b>says</b> more than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> about the political culture of Ontario. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{they were}} not in your way, eh?" [...] {{he said in a}} mocking smile. [...] "Well, they were very condescending--at least for such great people. An earl! Earl de Mowbray,--I suppose he came over with William the Conqueror. Mr Trafford makes a show of the place, and it amuses their {{visitors}} I dare <b>say,</b> like <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that's strange. There were some young gentlemen with them, who did not seem to know much about anything. I thought I had a right to be amused too; and I must say I liked very much to see one of them looking at the machinery through his eye-glass. There was one very venturesome chap: I {{thought he was going to}} catch hold of the fly-wheel, but I gave him a spin which I believed saved his life, though he did rather stare. He was a lord." ...|$|R
25|$|Emma Lockhart as Gwen Stanton Will's sister, {{the only}} girl of the Stanton family {{and the only one}} to give Will a proper present on his birthday. A kind girl, she is the first of his family to unintentionally witness his power as he takes her to a Viking battle where she rescues a lost kitten. She {{promises}} not to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to anyone <b>else,</b> showing her and Will's close relationship. This is seen further when Will is threatened with the death of the person he loves most, and this person turns out to be Gwen.|$|R
60|$|Now, I can say that; and I believe it; and God grant I {{may never}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> And yet I cannot {{prove it to}} you by any argument. But I believe it; and I dare say many of you believe it (you all must believe it, before all is over), by {{something}} better than any argument. By faith--faith, which speaks to the very core and root of a man's heart and reason, and teaches him things surer and deeper than all sermons and books, all proofs and arguments.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{my father}} had {{suspected}} you of being a faithless man," [...] said Romola, {{in a tone of}} bitter scorn, which insisted on darting out before she could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> [...] "he would have placed the library safely out of your power. But death overtook him too soon, and when you were sure his ear was deaf, and his hand stiff, you robbed him." [...] She paused an instant, and then said, with gathered passion, [...] "Have you robbed somebody else, who is not dead? Is that the reason you wear armour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{asked him}} at once {{what he was}} doing there; it {{occurred}} to me that Jim might have come on a visit. I own I was pleased and excited at the thought. Tamb' Itam looked as if he did not know what to say. [...] "Is Tuan Jim inside?" [...] I asked impatiently. [...] "No," [...] he mumbled, hanging his head for a moment, and then with sudden earnestness, [...] "He would not fight. He would not fight," [...] he repeated twice. As he seemed unable to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> I pushed him aside and went in.|$|E
6000|$|... "However, I see {{no chance}} of such a change coming, and we must be content to observe our vows as well as may be, {{so long as we}} are willing to remain monks and try to obtain {{dispensation}} from our vows should we desire to alter our mode of life. We ought either to have remained monks pure and simple, spending our lives in deeds of charity, a life which suits many men, and against which I should be the last to <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> or <b>else</b> soldiers pure and simple, as were the crusaders, who wrested the Holy Sepulchre from the hands of the infidels. At present, Gervaise, your vocation lies wholly in the way of fighting, but {{it may be that the}} time will come when you may have other aims and ambitions, and when the vows of the Order will gall you." ...|$|R

2500|$|It {{was said}} that over the years, Yang {{displayed}} a serious, magnanimous, and respectful personality. [...] He displayed no displeasure at Xu and Xu's sons' having the actual reins of the state, and Xu did not suspect him of intent to seize power personally. [...] However, it {{was said that}} after the declaration of the independent Wu state, which he himself did not want to see, he became depressed. [...] He drank often and ate little, and thus became ill. [...] As of summer 920, he was near death. [...] Xu Wen arrived from Run Prefecture to oversee the transition. [...] Some of Xu's followers urged that he take over the throne himself, but Xu himself disavowed such an intent, stating, [...] "If I had the intent to do so, I would have done so when I killed Zhang Hao and would not have waited until today. [...] Even if the Yangs were out of males, I would have supported a female to take the throne. [...] Anyone who <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> will be decapitated!" [...] However, while Yang Longyan's oldest younger brother was Yang Meng the Duke of Lujiang, Xu had often been suspicious at Yang Meng's intent if he took the throne since Yang Meng was known to have complained about the Xus' hold on power, and therefore decided to skip Yang Meng. [...] Instead, he issued an order in Yang Longyan's name summoning his next younger brother, Yang Pu the Duke of Danyang, to Guangling to formally serve as regent, while moving Yang Meng, who had been made the military prefect of Chu Prefecture (楚州, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), to be the military prefect of Shu Prefecture (舒州, in modern Anqing, Anhui). [...] Yang Longyan died shortly after, and Yang Pu took the throne.|$|R
