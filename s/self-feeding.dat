Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening began {{within the first}} six days of life. Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and <b>self-feeding</b> took place within forty days.

40|$|Offspring of {{many animals}} signal their {{nutritional}} needs using conspicuous begging displays. Theoretical {{models for the}} evolution of begging suggest that costly begging signals provide an evolutionarily stable resolution to parent [...] offspring conflict because they provide parents with honest information on offspring need. However, other models suggest that cost-free or low-cost begging can evolve because parents and offspring have overlapping interests. Empirical studies on birds provide mixed and ambiguous evidence for begging costs. Here, we examine begging costs in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. Larval begging may incur a growth cost as in birds or an opportunity cost because larvae cannot beg for food and <b>self-feed</b> at the same time. We used a novel experimental design, in which we controlled begging through {{the presence or absence of}} a dead parent simultaneously as we controlled the opportunity to <b>self-feed</b> through the presence or absence of food. As intended, the presence of a dead parent stimulated larval begging, whereas larvae never begged when the dead parent was absent. However, the presence or absence of a dead parent had no effect on larval growth. Likewise, the interaction between the presence or absence of food and the presence or absence of a dead parent had no effect on growth. Thus, our study provides no evidence of either a growth cost or an opportunity cost of larval begging in N. vespilloides. The lack of evidence for any significant begging costs suggests that cost-free or low-cost begging could be more common than hitherto recognized. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|Classical {{models of}} {{evolution}} seldom predict {{the rate at}} which populations evolve in the wild. One explanation is that the social environment affects how traits change in response to natural selection. Here, we determine how social interactions between parents and offspring, and among larvae, influence the response to experimental selection on adult size. Our experiments focus on burying beetles (Nicrophorus vespilloides), whose larvae develop within a carrion nest. Some broods exclusively <b>self-feed</b> on the carrion while others are also fed by their parents. We found populations responded to selection for larger adults but only when parents cared for their offspring. We also found populations responded to selection for smaller adults too, but only by removing parents and causing larval interactions to exert more influence on eventual adult size. Comparative analyses revealed a similar pattern: evolutionary increases in species size within the genus Nicrophorus are associated with the obligate provision of care. Synthesising our results with previous studies, we suggest that cooperative social environments enhance the response to selection whereas excessive conflict can prevent further directional selection...|$|R

These areas are thought to have been inhibited by the site of injury through a GABA-mediated mechanism and the inhibition was modified by zolpidem which is a GABA agonist.

40|$|Question: Animals of {{many species}} work {{as members of}} a group such as a pair or colony to {{provision}} various resources to a central place. Group members could work as generalists (all group members <b>self-feed</b> to obtain fuel and deliver cargo; e. g. food items for offspring, non-food items such as building materials) or as specialists (collect only fuel, or only cargo). Mathematical method: We developed a simple analytical model to investigate conditions favouring these basic alternatives. Key assumptions: We assumed that natural selection favours mechanisms that maximize the delivery rate of cargo, fuel being important only in so far as it enables the work of the delivery of cargo to be supported. Conclusions: The model shows that this division of labour boosts the aggregate rate of cargo delivery when the round trip time a provisioner saves by not having to forage for its own fuel more than offsets the required allocation of group members to exclusive fuel collection. We note that groups with this provisioning division of labour are common in social insects, but appear absent among vertebrates. Several hypotheses may explain this marked difference. We suggest that provisioning by division of labour represents an early step in social evolution that was greatly elaborated in the bees and ants. </p...|$|R
