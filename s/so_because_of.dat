5|$|Daft Punk were {{scheduled}} {{to appear on the}} episode of The Colbert Report on 6 August 2013 to promote Random Access Memories, but were unable to do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> contractual obligations regarding the duo's later appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Turner {{appeared}} {{in her first}} Technicolor film, as Lady de Winter in The Three Musketeers, opposite Gene Kelly, Van Heflin, and June Allyson. In November 1947, she agreed to do the film, thereby giving up an unfinished film project called Bedeviled. However, in January 1948, {{it was reported that}} she had withdrawn from the film. Initially, Louis B. Mayer gave her permission for doing <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her schedule, but she was later that month put on suspension. Eventually, Turner agreed to make the film, but did not start production until March due to having to lose weight.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} of a similar design to other local power {{stations}} at Carville and Lemington, and was a large triple-gabled brick building. However Dunston A was built several years after the other local stations, and <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> advances in power station design, was larger {{and was able to}} produce more electricity than the others. The station was originally equipped with two turbo-alternators rated at 7.2megawatts (MW), made by AEG of Germany, and two turbo alternators rated at 6.25MW and 13.2MW, made by Brown Boveri of Switzerland, for a total generating capacity of 33.85MW. The turbo alternators were supplied with steam from 24coal burning Babcock & Wilcox marine water-tube boilers.|$|E
5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E
5|$|Operating near Taegu {{during the}} Battle of Taegu, {{elements}} of the U.S. Army's 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division were surrounded by North Korean troops crossing the Naktong River at Hill 303. Most of the U.S. troops were able to escape but one platoon of mortar operators misidentified North Korean troops as South Korean army reinforcements and was captured. North Korean troops held the Americans on the hill and initially tried to move them across the river {{and out of the}} battle, but they were unable to do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> heavy counterattack. American forces eventually broke the North Korean advance, routing the force. As the North Koreans began to retreat one of their officers ordered the prisoners to be shot so they would not slow the North Koreans down.|$|E

5|$|The Completion Force sailed on 10February 1945 and was sighted leaving port by a Royal Navy submarine. However, {{attempts}} {{by it and}} several United States Navy submarines to attack between 11 and 14February were unsuccessful. More than 88 USAAF aircraft attempted to bomb the Completion Force on 13 and 14February, but were unable to do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> bad weather. A further submarine attack on 16February did not damage any of the Japanese ships. As a result, the Completion Force reached its destination of Kure in Japan on 20February without having suffered any casualties. Despite this success, the Japanese Government was forced to discontinue its efforts to ship oil from Southeast Asia to Japan in March due to the heavy losses Allied submarines were inflicting on oil tankers, and all the ships of the Completion Force were sunk in or near Japanese home waters {{before the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{supports}} downloadable tracks for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions; several free and for-cost downloadable songs and song packs {{are available on}} both the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store. In July 2008, Activision {{announced that it would}} release downloadable content for the Wii {{in the first quarter of}} 2008, but eventually was unable to do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> limitations with the Wii's internal memory storage, an issue that was overcome in the sequel, Guitar Hero World Tour. When rock band Metallica released their album Death Magnetic on September 12, 2008, it was also made available as a downloadable song pack for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, Guitar Hero World Tour and the 2009 spin-off Guitar Hero Metallica. In addition, the compact disc soundtrack for the game offers a code used to redeem three exclusive playable tracks on the Xbox Live Marketplace.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Khánh {{since the start of the}} year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E

5|$|Dinges {{wrote that}} in the early 1970s the U.S. Justice Department had enough {{evidence}} to bring an indictment of Noriega on drug charges in a U.S. court, but chose not to do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the diplomatic consequences involved. This evidence included the testimony of an arrested boat courier, and of a drug smuggler arrested in New York. Though Torrijos frequently promised the U.S. cooperation in dealing with drug smuggling, Noriega would have headed any effort at enforcement, and the U.S. began to see him as the real problem. Dinges writes that the U.S. government considered several options to move Noriega out of the drug trafficking business, including assassinating him, and linking him to a fictional plot against Torrijos. Though no assassination attempt was made, the other ploys may have been tried in the early 1970s, according to Dinges. Beginning in 1972, however, Dinges writes that the U.S. relaxed its efforts at trapping individuals involved with smuggling within the Panama government, possibly {{as a result of an}} agreement between Torrijos and U.S. president Richard Nixon. Moreover, during the same period Noriega was becoming a trusted ally of the CIA, including acting as the U.S. emissary to Cuba during negotiations following the Johnny Express incident. Noriega, too, made an effort during this period to portray Panama as a hub of enforcement against drug smuggling, possibly as a result of pressure from Torrijos. Noriega's drug-related activities came to the U.S. government's attention once again during the ratification process for the Panama Canal treaties, but were once again downplayed by the U.S. intelligence services in order to get the treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months later}} royalist general Pío Tristán {{advanced}} {{in the north}} with more than three thousand men, prepared to invade the United Provinces. Once again outnumbered by larger armies, Belgrano organised a great exodus {{of the city of}} Jujuy: the entire population of the city would have to retreat with the army and not leave behind anything that might be of value to the royalists (such as animals, crops, or housing). By September a proper formation of columns provided them with a victory against a royalist task force of 500men during the Battle of Las Piedras. The First Triumvirate commanded Belgrano to retreat to Cordoba without fighting, but he thought that doing so would mean the loss of the northern provinces. Thus, instead of continuing to Cordoba, he was convinced by the people of San Miguel de Tucumán to make a stand there. His forces had increased by then to nearly 1,800 soldiers, still much less than the 3,000 at Tristan's command. Even so, he obtained a victory in the Battle of Tucumán. By that time, the First Triumvirate was replaced by the Second Triumvirate, which provided greater support for Belgrano. The Second Triumvirate called the Assembly of Year XIII soon after taking power, which was intended to declare independence and enact a national constitution, but failed to do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> political disputes between the members. It did not take measures regarding the national flag, but allowed Belgrano to use the blue and white flag as the flag of the Army of the North.|$|E
25|$|According to a Gallup Poll taken February 911 2007, {{responders}} {{who supported}} Giuliani were {{asked why they}} supported him. The results showed that 13% of supporters did <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Giuliani's strong leadership and 53% did <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> leadership related topics such as time as mayor and handling of 9/11. Another poll taken by Marist showed that 42% of Giuliani supporters believed that leadership {{is the most important}} quality for a candidate, compared to 34% of McCain supporters who believed the same.|$|E
