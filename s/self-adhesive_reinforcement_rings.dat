40|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of dual-mobility sockets in {{achieving}} implant stability in primary hip replace-ment, surgeons have started to use the implant in revision hip arthroplasty. However, very little is known yet about the postoperative complication rate of this type of implant when fixation in a reinforce-ment ring is required. In our department, 37 dual-mobility sockets were cemented in a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> for revision hip arthroplasty in 36 patients over a period of two years. The mean follow-up period was 16 months (range, 6 - 27 months). Indications for revision hip arthroplasty included, among others, recurrent dislocation (3 cases) and implant loosening (9 cases) with extensive bone loss. We observed two single re-dislocations (5. 40 %), one infection and one mechanical failure of the reinforcement ring; the literature mentions dislocation rates of 2. 7 to 10. 6 % after revisions not specifically for recurrent disloca-tion. Revision hip arthoplasty combining dual-mobil-ity sockets with <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> fixation thus had a relatively low early postoperative complication rate in this challenging group of patients. The design therefore seems to be a valid alternative to con-strained implants, especially in high-risk revision cases. Despite the short follow-up period, cemented dual-mobility sockets seem to be a valuable option when <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rings</b> need to be used, with an acceptable dislocation rate in this challenging group of patients.

40|$|Abstract: Acetabular defects, {{particularly}} {{as a result}} of protrusion of acetabular components into the hemipelvis, may cause serious complications during revision procedures {{as a result of}} iatrogenic injury to surrounding anatomical structures. In these challenging cases, we advocate the utilisation of preoperative three dimensional imaging.

Appropriate preoperative planning may also prevent major complications during the removal of the pre-existing hardware, prior to re-implantation of implants. Potential complications include injury of nerves, blood vessels and other intrapelvic structures. In our case, a major bony defect of the acetabulum was a result of the protrusion of an implanted <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring.</b> A preoperative, contrast-enhanced CT scan showed that the urethra was in close proximity to the hook of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring.</b> The preoperative imaging aided in identifying and understanding the potential complications that could occur intraoperatively.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionTreatment of {{acetabular}} loosening {{and accompanying}} bone defects {{requires that the}} bone stock be rebuilt, the primary stability ensured, and the hip center of rotation restored to its anatomical location. HypothesisAcetabular reconstruction using morselized allograft and a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> will meet these requirements and ensure medium-term survival. Patients and methodsA retrospective study was performed on 95 acetabular revision cases (95 patients) performed between 1987 and 1995. The average age at revision was 69. 5 years (42 to 86 years). Among these acetabular loosening cases, 12 cases had a type II Paprosky acetabular bone defect and 83 cases had a type III defect. ResultsThe average follow-up was 8 years (5 to 13 years). There were seven post-operative dislocations, three deep infections, and two cases of repeated acetabular loosening. The cumulative survival rate at 14 years was 77. 9 % (95 % CI: 61. 96 % to 93. 84 %). The average Postel Merle d’Aubigné (PMA) score improved from 8 (range 6 – 11) preoperatively to 14. 8 (range 8 – 18) at follow-up; the Harris score improved from 35. 3 (range 11 – 52) to 71. 1 (range 40 – 94) (P< 0. 001). Based on the parameters outlined by Ranawat, the optimal centre of rotation was restored in 45 % of cases. Graft integration {{was found to be}} good in 60 % of cases. The <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> had migrated in five cases, including two cases of acetabular loosening that required an additional revision. The functional result was better when the hip center of rotation was restored (P< 0. 05). Conversely, the position of the hip center of rotation had no effect on graft integration or acetabular fixation. DiscussionThis series confirmed that acetabular reconstruction using morselized allograft and a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> is effective in the medium term as a treatment for acetabular loosening with severe bone deficiency. It also revealed that restoring the hip center of rotation can improve functional results. Level of evidenceLevel IV, retrospective study...|$|R

When MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) sells a crane the design {{must be approved by}} a classification society. One of the classification societies did not approve the design on one of the foundation types MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) uses. The reinforcements used today are designed and implemented by demands from the classification society Germanischer Lloyd. The problem with these reinforcements is the design, which increases the manufacturing time and cost. Therefore the purpose with this thesis is to analyze the current design, examine the need of the reinforcements and if necessary design a new reinforcement. At the beginning of the project focus was on gathering information about how and why the reinforcements are used today. Unfortunately there has been no opportunity to have contact with the reinforcement designer Germanischer Lloyd. Instead the knowledge about the reinforcement, how and why they exist, come from interviews with well-informed personnel at MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division). To investigate how the reinforcements affect the stress distribution on the foundation, a simplified model of the whole crane with bearing, crane house and crane arm was modeled. Finite element analyses in I-deas were performed on the model with eight node sheet elements. The result from the first simulations showed that the reinforcements were unnecessary. These simulations led the thesis into further analyses instead of designing a new reinforcement. Further analyses show that the reinforcement lowers the stress in the foundation at the worst places with ≈ 12 %. The result led to analyses with different thicknesses of both the foundations sheet case and also the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring.</b> By having a thicker plates in the sheet case of the foundation the stress lowers in a satisfying way, but the total weight and the material cost increases. By increasing the thickness of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> the stress decreases and a safety margin of 1. 5 can be retained.

Methods: Total hip arthroplasty with acetabular <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rings</b> were performed in 18 hips in 18 patients from 1996 to 2011 in United Christian Hospital. Both clinical and radiographical assessment were performed during follow-up. Results: Eight patients died of unrelated diseases with average follow-up of 30. 5 months.

The remaining 10 patients with mean age of 77. 9 years (range, 65 – 88) at the time of operation were followed-up for an average of 67. 4 months (range, 11 – 121).

40|$|International audienceBackgroundAcetabular cup {{loosening}} {{is among}} {{the main reasons for}} revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). The implantation of a cryopreserved morsellised bone allograft is a reference method for filling bone defects. However, the outcomes of bone grafts treated with viral inactivation and secured into the host bone (notably using a reinforcement device) are unclear. We therefore retrospectively reviewed cases of acetabular revision with morsellised bone allograft implanted into a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> for acetabular revision to assess: (1) clinical survival of the acetabular implant (time to new revision with acetabular component removal), (2) radiological implant survival, (3) and bone graft osseointegration evaluated using Oswestry's criteria. HypothesisVirus-inactivated bone allografts provide similar outcomes to cryopreserved allografts. Material and methodsFrom 2004 to 2009, 95 patients underwent acetabular revision. There were 60 (63 %) females and 35 (37 %) males {{with a mean age of}} 71. 7 years (range: 44. 2 – 90 years). Over 90 % of patients had bone defects type 2 or higher in the AAOS classification. Each patient was evaluated after at least 5 years, by an examiner who had not been involved in the revision and who determined the Postel-Merle d’Aubigné (PMA) score and patient satisfaction. We assessed the clinical survival of the acetabular implant (time to new revision with acetabular implant removal), radiological implant survival (migration > 5 mm, active radiolucent line, failure of graft osseointegration, or <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> failure), and allograft osteointegration evaluated using Oswestry's criteria. ResultsAfter a mean follow-up of 7 years (range: 5. 2 – 10 years), 7 (7. 4 %) patients had been lost to follow-up and 3 (3. 4 %) had required surgical revision, after 3 to 73 months (for aseptic loosening in 2 cases and infection in 1 case). The estimated 10 -year survival rate was 96. 2 % (95 % confidence interval [95 %CI]: 88. 2 – 98. 7). The mean PMA score at last follow-up had increased significantly, by 2. 8 points (p < 0. 05), to 13. 8 (95 %CI: 78. 4 – 88. 1). Of the 88 re-evaluated patients, 78 (89 %) were satisfied or very satisfied. The overall radiological survival rate was 84. 5 % (95 %CI: 78. 4 – 88. 1) after a mean of 5. 9 years (range: 0. 5 – 10). Allograft osseointegration was satisfactory (Oswestry score ≥ 2) in 95. 8 % of patients.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{report the}} results of a {{titanium}} acetabular <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> with a hook (ARRH) in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), which was introduced in 1987 and continues to be used routinely in our center. The favorable results of this device in arthroplasty for developmental dysplasia and difficult revisions motivated its use in primary THA. With this implant only minimal acetabular reaming is necessary, anatomic positioning is achieved by placing the hook around the teardrop and a homogenous base for cementing the polyethylene cup is provided. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 1987 and December 1991, 241 THAs with insertion of an ARRH were performed in 178 unselected, consecutive patients (average age 58 years; range 30 - 84 years) with a secondary osteoarthrosis in 41 % of the cases. RESULTS: At the time of the latest follow-up, 33 patients (39 hips) had died and 17 cases had been lost to follow-up. The median follow-up was 122 months with a minimum of 10 years. Eight hips had been revised, leaving 177 hips in 120 living patients without revision. Six cups were revised because of aseptic loosening. Two hips were revised for sepsis. The mean Merle d'Aubigné score for the remaining hips was 16 (range 7 - 18) at the latest follow-up. For aseptic loosening, the probability of survival of the cup was 0. 97 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 94 - 0. 99). However, analysis of radiographs implied loosening in seven other cups without clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results of primary THA using an acetabular <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> parallel the excellent results of these implants often observed in difficult primary and revision arthroplasty at a minimum of 10 years. Survivorship is comparable to modern cementless implants. Medial migration that occurs with loosening of the acetabular component seems to be prevented with this implant.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study of the {{performance}} of two forms of cutout and various edge reinforcements in a composite C-section beam under static shear load. Firstly, cutout shape effect on stress concentration was studied. This was followed by a comparative study of a range of reinforcement doublers, which were 20 mm wide rings made of a steel alloy or composite laminate, or by a novel fibre tow placement technique. The comparisons are made in terms of the stress and strain reductions at a hot spot at the cutout edge. Good agreement between the numerical and test results has been achieved for different cutout shapes and reinforcements, and this study has demonstrated that the cutout induced stress concentration can be reduced significantly by appropriate cutout shape and edge reinforcements. The stress reduction magnitude is found to be strongly related to the stiffness of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rings.</b> The diamond-shaped cutout and the fibre tows reinforcement show clear advantages over the widely adapted circular cutout and laminated <b>ring</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> These findings should contribute to future design improvement of composite aircraft structures in similar shape and loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} - Porous {{tantalum}} cups {{have been introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} various <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rings</b> in revision hip surgery. We hypothesized that porous tantalum cups would be superior to muller acetabular roof <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rings</b> (MARRs) in revision hip surgery with re-revision for aseptic loosening as the primary outcome measure. Patients and methods - 207 hips operated with either a porous tantalum cup (TM cup, n = 111) or a MARR (n = 96) at index procedure were identified in our local arthroplasty register. Acetabular defects were classified according to Paprosky. There were 96 men and 111 women with a median age of 71 (35 - 95) years, presenting acetabular defect size type I in 39 cases, IIA in 22, IIB in 27, IIC in 43, IIIA in 32, and IIIB in 37 cases. Analysis of medical records identified all patients with subsequent re-revision and reasons for re-revisions. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were used to estimate implant survival. Results - With re-revision for aseptic loosening as the end-point, the 6 -year unadjusted cumulative survival was 97 % (95 % CI: 94 - 100) for TM cups and 96 % (CI: 92 - 100) for MARR (p = 0. 6). Using re-revision for any reason as the endpoint, 6 -year survival was 87 % (CI: 81 - 94) for TM cups and 95 % (CI: 90 - 99) for MARR (p = 0. 06). The main reason for re-revision in the TM group was dislocation (n = 10), followed by loosening (n = 3), whereas the main reason for re-revision in the MARR group was aseptic loosening (n = 8). Duration of the index procedure and perioperative blood loss were lower in the TM group. Interpretation - Both TM and MARR lead to good 6 -year results in acetabular revision surgery. The methods differ in their respective failure mechanisms. We conclude that TM cups are a valuable treatment option in acetabular revision surgery, but the reasons underlying dislocations after the use of TM cups must be analyzed further...|$|R

30|$|Acetabular bone defect {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{difficulties}} in acetabular reconstruction in revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). Several techniques have been described for the repair of acetabular bone defect, including the use of cemented cup onto the structural bone graft (Paprosky and Magnus 1994), bilobed cup (Moskal et al. 2008), metal mesh (Jasty and Harris 1988), acetabular cage (Sembrano and Cheng 2008), Müller <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> (Stöckl et al. 1997), and reinforcement plate, such as Kerboull or KT plate (Okano et al. 2010; Kawanabe et al. 2007; Baba and Shitoto 2010) with or without allografting. In 120 revision THA cases conducted in our department, only two demonstrated acetabular bone defect with pelvic discontinuity. While the frequency of pelvic discontinuity in the revision THA is within a clinically acceptable range, reconstruction of the acetabulum with massive bone defect, including pelvic discontinuity, is a still perplexing problem in revision THA despite the currently available solutions. In this short communication, we describe acetabular reconstruction surgical technique for periprosthetic pelvic discontinuity.|$|R

30|$|Dislocations of HAHs are {{generally}} {{associated with an}} insufficient restoration of the centre of rotation or other mechanical problems due to a wrong primary implantation. The conversion of an unstable HAH to a standard THA is a procedure with {{a high risk of}} further dislocations, with an incidence often higher than revision THA itself [2, 20 – 22, 41, 42]. Several reasons have been advocated: the reduction of the diameter and offset of the femoral head, which may produce an inadequate soft tissues tension; the inappropriate positioning of a retained femoral stem, frequently maintained to avoid long surgical procedures in critical patients; and the insufficient retaining properties of the acetabular cup/liner complex. Several other options {{such as the use of}} a cemented cup with a structural bone graft fixed with screws, threaded cups with or without bone grafting, constrained cups, <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rings,</b> or “anti-protrusio” cages have been proposed over the decades. Variable results have been obtained in cases of acetabular discontinuity or severe bone loss, poor acetabular rim coverage, and substantial alterations of shape of the acetabulum [43, 44]. In the remaining cases, outcomes were not satisfactory.|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that cup {{loosening}} produces cup migration and bone loss in both cemented [14] and uncemented [6, 16] THA. Different options are being used to manage acetabular bone defects: techniques such as impaction bone grafting and a cemented cup (according to Slooff et al.) provide excellent results [13, 33], <b>reinforcement</b> <b>rings</b> have also been used with different results in large defects [3, 7, 38], as have trabecular metal cups and augments [24]. Although uncemented hemispherical cups are a valid option in small acetabular defects, it is accepted that they provide poor results when acetabular bone defects are > 50  % [12]. Although extra-large uncemented components have achieved good results, the extensive reaming required in order to obtain good bone contact with the host bone (which is more important in the anteroposterior diameter of the acetabulum) can ultimately affect implant stability [39]. The purpose of an oblong cup is to obtain enough stability in both the anterior and posterior column of the acetabulum without sacrificing the longitudinal axis [9, 22]. Since achieving an anatomic center of hip rotation is desirable in order to obtain good results in acetabular revision surgery, we assessed the clinical and radiological results of two different types of oblong cup with regard to the preoperative bone loss and postoperative radiological position of the cup after surgery.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: "Acetabular bone loss" {{presents}} a major reconstructive challenge in total hip arthroplasty. Loss of acetabular bone stock {{is a consequence}} of removal of bone during the original procedure, subsequent prosthetic failure and osteolysis resulting from wear particles of cement and polyethylene. In case of severe bone loss treatment options are rather limited, as fixation requires either biological (cancellous allograft with cage or structural allograft) or non-biological (trabecular metal, triflange implant, etc.) scaffolds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen acetabular revisions with a cemented cup, supported by a deep frozen structural periacetabular allograft without using a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> or an antiprotrusio cage were performed. Clinical assessment was done using a Harris hip score. Graft resorption was radiographically quantified using a digital measurement program. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survivorship was 67. 1 % at 42 months. After a mean follow-up of 3. 6 years, 9 out of 14 patients had good clinical results. Mean resorption of 17. 1 % in six out of ten patients was observed. No sound evidence for union was found in nine out of ten patients. In the four re-revised patients, no bone stock restoration was found. CONCLUSION: The bicortical allograft without protective device seems to function as a passive biocompatible dead scaffold, which has a less intrinsic strength at intermediate term follow-up, compared to the by ring or cage protected structural allografts. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} {{in patients}} with developmental dysplasia of the hip can be a complex procedure due to acetabular and proximal femoral deformities. Presentation of case: A 59 -year-old male patient underwent a total hip arthroplasty {{for the treatment of}} end-stage dysplastic osteoarthritis. A roof <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring,</b> a cemented polyethylene cup, and a cementless stem were used. A portion of the superior rim of the ring was uncovered by the host bone. Morsellized autogenous femoral-head graft was impacted to fill the space between the superior rim of the ring and the superior part of the dysplastic acetabulum. At the follow-up after 5 -years, the patient had no complaints and was very satisfied with the operation result. The hip radiograph revealed no signs of instability of the acetabular component, and no bone graft resorption. Discussion: Favorable results were described using metal rings and conical femoral stems for the treatment of the developmental dysplasia of the hip. The superior rim of the metal ring should be against host bone for 60 % of its support. Despite the suboptimal implantation of the ring compromising, apparently, mechanical stability of the arthroplasty, the outcome was favorable. Conclusion: This result can be supported by the good fixation of the metal ring to the pelvis with screws, the adequate orientation of both components of the total hip arthroplasty, and the bone graft incorporation...|$|R
40|$|Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) still {{carries a}} higher failure rate {{in patients with}} avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVN) than in a similar patient population with THA for other reasons. This is particularly true for the acetabular component. One of the major factors accounting {{for this is the}} compromised acetabular bone quality with structural defects subsequent to collapsing of the femoral head in high-grade AVN. In this study we implanted an acetabular <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring</b> with hook (ARRH), which had been used successfully for other indications with acetabular bone stock deficiency, in 32 consecutive THA’s in 29 patients with AVN. Five patients died during the observation period of causes unrelated to the surgery, one patient was lost to follow-up and one patient could not be followed up due to chronic illness, leaving 25 hips (23 patients) with a minimum follow-up of ten years (mean: 11. 8; range: 10 – 15). The mean Merle d’Aubigne score increased significantly from 7. 7 preoperatively to 16. 6 postoperatively (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). One revision was performed for aseptic stem loosening. Of the unrevised hips, one acetabular component was classified as definitively loose. The cumulative 12 -year survivorship for THA with ARRH in AVN was 95. 2 % (confidence interval: 86. 1 – 100 %) for both components, 100 % for the cup and 95. 2 % for the stem (86. 1 – 100 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to assess results of {{different}} revision techniques for large acetabular defects and the identification of possible predictors of these results. Materials and methods This retrospective study was carried out on 33 consecutive patients (22 females, 11 males) who underwent acetabular revision at our Institution for Paprosky grade II B and III (GIR 3 or 4) acetabular bone defects. The average age at surgery was 67. 1 years (range 42 – 86 years). Burch-Schneider reinforcement cage and cemented cup was used in 25 cases, trabecular metal revision shell in 6 cases, and LOR cup in 2 cases. The mean time between primary and revision procedure was 9. 1 years and the mean follow-up was 48 months (range 14 – 112). The Harris Hip Score (HHS) was obtained before surgery and at the latest follow-up control in all patients. Pain at follow-up was evaluated using a 10 -cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). In 27 patients a follow-up radiographic evaluation was also performed. Determinants of HHS score at follow-up were assessed by linear regression analysis, using age, sex, BMI, rate of co-morbidity (FCI), use of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>ring,</b> and time elapsed from the primary surgery as explanatory variables. Results The average pre-operative and follow-up HHS score was 41 ± 16 and 79 ± 13, respectively (p. 001). The average pain reported by patients on the VAS scale at follow-up was 3. 2 ± 1. 7. The overall re-revision rate was of 18...|$|R
