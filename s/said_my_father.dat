6000|$|... "All I {{remember}} about my mother," [...] Nibs told them, [...] "is that she often <b>said</b> to <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> 'Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!' I don't {{know what a}} cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my mother one." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You seem to forget, sir," [...] said Leonard, {{keeping his}} temper with difficulty, [...] "that not {{six months ago}} you and I had a long {{conversation}} on this very subject, and decided that nothing should be <b>said</b> to <b>my</b> <b>father</b> of the matter until I had taken my degree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} will go," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> [...] "Poor girl, I {{wonder what the}} cause can be. She {{used to be so}} free from {{everything}} of the kind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "King Harald {{came with}} a fully-manned boat, {{and a number of}} followers. He was very condescending and full of fun, as he had been the night before.
