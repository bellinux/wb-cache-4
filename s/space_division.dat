25|$|In 1975, she {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in research at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell near Oxford, England, as a visiting scientist. Her work there involved the wetting behavior of liquids on solid substrates. Following her work in England, she accepted a senior research engineer position with Rockwell International <b>Space</b> <b>Division</b> in Downey, California. Her responsibilities there included developing equipment and processes for the manufacture of the Space Shuttle thermal protection system in Palmdale, California. She also represented Rockwell International {{as a member of the}} Dr. Kraft Ehricke evaluation committee on prospective space industrialization concepts. Dunbar completed her doctorate at the University of Houston in Houston, Texas. Her multi-disciplinary dissertation (materials science and physiology) involved evaluating the effects of simulated space flight on bone strength and fracture toughness. These results were correlated to alterations in hormonal and metabolic activity. Dr. Dunbar has served as an adjunct assistant professor in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Houston.|$|E

500|$|Landsat 2 was {{manufactured}} by General Electric's <b>Space</b> <b>Division</b> in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. This satellite {{was considered an}} experiment, unlike Landsat 1. Landsat 2 was originally designated as ERTS-B (Earth Resources Technology Satellite-B) and was renamed prior to launch. The satellite was designed to operate {{for a minimum of}} one year. The primary objective of the MSS was to acquire global, seasonal data in medium resolution from a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. NASA administrator James C. Fletcher said, [...] "If I had to pick one spacecraft, one space age development to save the world, I would pick ERTS and the satellites which I believe will be evolved from it later in this decade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pournelle's {{work in the}} {{aerospace}} industry includes time he worked at Boeing in the late 1950s. While there, he worked on Project Thor, conceiving of [...] "hypervelocity rod bundles", also known as [...] "rods from God". He edited Project 75, a 1964 study of 1975 defense requirements. He worked in operations research at The Aerospace Corporation, and North American Rockwell <b>Space</b> <b>Division,</b> and was founding President of the Pepperdine Research Institute. In 1989, Pournelle, Max Hunter, and retired Army Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham made a presentation to then Vice President Dan Quayle promoting development of the DC-X rocket.|$|E
2500|$|Stamatios [...] "Tom" [...] Krimigis, {{head of the}} Applied Physics Laboratory's <b>space</b> <b>division,</b> one of many {{entrants}} in the New Frontiers Program competition, {{formed the}} New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000. [...] Appointed as the project's principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as [...] "the personification of the Pluto mission". New Horizons was based largely on Stern's work since Pluto 350 and involved most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express. The New Horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA. It was later selected as one of two finalists {{to be subject to}} a three-month concept study, in June 2001. The other finalist, POSSE (Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer), was a separate, but similar Pluto mission concept by the University of Colorado Boulder, led by principal investigator Larry W. Esposito, and supported by the JPL, Lockheed Martin and the University of California. However, the APL, in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University, were at an advantage; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier in the year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare.|$|E
