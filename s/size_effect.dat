40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of MEMS and electronic industry, {{the demands for}} micro-parts are increasing gradually. However, <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> make the traditional forming theories and deformation mechanism not suitable in micro forming field. In this paper, we introduced the classification of the <b>size</b> <b>effects.</b> It {{pointed out that the}} <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> can be divided into the first order and the second order <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> in the micro-forming. For the first order <b>size</b> <b>effects,</b> the theory model was established based on the surface layer model. It also clarified the phenomenon that flow stress of the blank reduced with the increase of the ratio of grain size and thickness (t decreases or d increases). Finally, the model was verified with the experimental results of the first order <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> in the references, confirming the effectiveness of the theoretical model. It provides a method to theoretically and experimentally study the micro-plastic forming...|$|R
2500|$|A {{variation}} of the static method is to add a solution of the substance in a non-aqueous solvent, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, to an aqueous buffer mixture. Immediate precipitation may occur giving a cloudy mixture. The solubility measured for such a mixture is known as [...] "kinetic solubility". The cloudiness {{is due to the}} fact that the precipitate particles are very small resulting in Tyndall scattering. In fact the particles are so small that the particle <b>size</b> <b>effect</b> comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility. Over time the cloudiness will disappear as the size of the crystallites increases, and eventually equilibrium will be reached in a process known as precipitate ageing.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{injection}} of electrons in {{the bulk of}} carbon nanotube which is connected to ideal Fermi liquid leads is considered. While {{the presence of the}} leads gives a cancellation of the noise cross-correlations, the auto-correlation noise has a Fano factor which deviates strongly from the Schottky behavior at voltages where finite <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> are expected. Indeed, as the voltage is increased from zero, the noise is first super-poissonian, then sub-poissonian, and eventually it reaches the Schottky limit. These finite <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> are also tested using a diagnosis of photo-assisted transport, where a small AC modulation is superposed to the DC bias voltage between the injection tip and the nanotube. When finite <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> are at play, we obtain a stepwise behavior for the noise derivative, as expected for normal metal systems, whereas in the absence of finite <b>size</b> <b>effects,</b> due to the presence of Coulomb interactions, a smoothed staircase is observed.

40|$|Structures exhibit {{uncommon}} {{physical properties}} such as ultra-high quality factor, nonlinear damping, and the abrupt change of Young&# 039;s modulus when their size approaches 1 nm to 100 nm. Such amazing properties upon the length scale {{is the so-called}} <b>size</b> <b>effects.</b> Though previous experimental studies reveal that the nanostructures do not comply with the classical continuum theories at nano-scale, their inherent mechanism is still unclear yet. The work in this dissertation aims to develop a computational method to predict the <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> for nanoporous materials and introduce the method of structural topology optimisation into the utilization of <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> in micro/nano-electrical/mechanical system, ultra-high sensitive sensor, lightweight structure and high-strength material. To achieve the aforementioned aims, a framework {{in terms of the}} combination of surface elasticity theory and the generalized Young-Laplace equation is established to evaluate the <b>size</b> <b>effects.</b> By modelling the nanoporous gold as a complex cellular architecture in theoretical analysis, the abrupt change in Young&# 039;s modulus at nano-level is formulated and can be verified in previous experiments. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm based on finite element analysis is developed to allow this method applicable to the nanostructures in an arbitrary shape. The proposed computational method clearly shows that <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> are highly dependent on the structural shape and topology at the nanoscale. By assuming the complex structures as a system of interconnected beams, I proposed a beam element to incorporate the <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> in finite element analysis.

To account {{for the possibility that}} family <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> may only show up in words that resemble words in the native language of the bilinguals, the materials included, in addition to purely English items, Dutch-English cognates (identical and non-identical in form). As expected, the monolingual data revealed facilitatory effects of English primary family size. Moreover, while the monolingual data did not show a main effect of cognate status, only form-identical cognates revealed an inhibitory effect of English secondary family size. The bilingual data showed stronger facilitation for identical cognates, but as for monolinguals, this effect was attenuated for words with a large secondary family size. In all, the Dutch-English primary and secondary family <b>size</b> <b>effects</b> in bilinguals were strikingly similar to those of monolinguals.
