500|$|The International Olympic Committee {{commissioned}} a song by Björk specially for the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The singer {{revealed that the}} committee asked her to do a kind of [...] "Ebony and Ivory" [...] or [...] "We Are the World" [...] type of song, which are [...] "smashing tunes" [...] according to her, but she thought, [...] "'Maybe there's another angle to this'. When I tried to write an Olympic lyric, though, {{it was full of}} sports socks and ribbons. I ended up pissing myself laughing". Then, she called Sjón, an Icelandic poet who had previously collaborated with her on songs such as [...] "Bachelorette" [...] from her fourth studio album Homogenic (1997). When <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that they would need something [...] "suitably epic" [...] for the Olympics, the poet even took a short course about Greek mythology at Reykjavík University. [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last song recorded for Medúlla. Björk said about the song: [...] "I am incredibly honoured to have been asked to write a song and sing it at the Olympics. The song is written {{from the point of view}} of the ocean that surrounds all the land and watches over the humans to see how they are doing after millions of years of evolution. It sees no borders, different races or religion which has always been at the core of these [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Theatre {{critic and}} former actress Blanche Marvin, {{a friend of}} Williams, says the playwright used her name for the {{character}} Blanche DuBois, named the character's sister Stella after Marvin's former surname [...] "Zohar" [...] (which means [...] "Star"), and took the play's line [...] "I've always depended on the kindness of strangers" [...] from something <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An anecdote {{characteristic}} of rabbinical sympathy for inferiors and domestics is thus related: The wife of R. Jose had a quarrel with her maid, {{and her husband}} declared her in the wrong; whereupon <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Wherefore didst thou declare me wrong {{in the presence of}} my maid?" [...] To which the rabbi replied, [...] "Did not Job (xxxi. 13) say, 'If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me, what then shall I do when God riseth up? And when He visiteth, what shall I answer Him?'" [...] (Gen. R. xlviii. 3). When Assi died, R. Hiya b. Abba, who had been his associate as judge and as teacher, went into mourning as for a relative (Yer. Ber. iii. 6a). The day of his death is recorded as coincident with a destructive hurricane (M. Ḳ. 26b).|$|E

2500|$|According to Eusebius of Caesarea (in his Ecclesiastical History, {{composed}} {{in the early}} 300s), Papias (circa AD 110) refers to a story of Jesus and a woman [...] "accused of many sins" [...] as being found in the Gospel of the Hebrews, which might refer to this passage or to one like it. In the Syriac Didascalia Apostolorum, {{composed in}} the mid-200s, the author, {{in the course of}} instructing bishops to exercise a measure of clemency, states that a bishop who does not receive a repentant person would be doing wrong – [...] "for you do not obey our Savior and our God, to do as He also did with her that had sinned, whom the elders set before Him, and leaving the judgment in His hands, departed. [...] But He, the searcher of hearts, asked her and said to her, 'Have the elders condemned thee, my daughter?' <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>Him,</b> 'No, Lord.' [...] And He said unto her, 'Go your way; neither do I condemn thee.' In Him therefore, our Savior and King and God, be your pattern, O bishops." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pocahontas and Rolfe {{lived in}} the suburb of Brentford, Middlesex, for some time, {{as well as at}} Rolfe's family home at Heacham Hall, Heacham, Norfolk. In early 1617, Smith met the couple at a social gathering, and later wrote that when Pocahontas saw him, [...] "without any words, she turned about, {{obscured}} her face, as not seeming well contented", and was left alone for two or three hours. Later, they spoke more; Smith's record of what <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> is fragmentary and enigmatic. She reminded him of the [...] "courtesies she had done", saying, [...] "you did promise Powhatan what was yours would be his, and he the like to you". She then discomfited him by calling him [...] "father", explaining Smith had called Powhatan [...] "father" [...] when a stranger in Virginia, [...] "and by the same reason so must I do you". Smith did not accept this form of address because, he wrote, Pocahontas outranked him as [...] "a King's daughter". Pocahontas then, [...] "with a well-set countenance", said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Molloy {{never again}} held another command. He had married Juliana Laforey, {{one of the}} daughters of Admiral Sir John Laforey, and the couple had at least three children, Charles, John and Mary. Mary married Sir John Beresford, another naval officer. In time a story began to {{circulate}} that before his marriage to Juliana, he had been engaged to marry another woman, but had behaved dishonourably. Her friends had pressed her {{to bring an action}} for breach of promise, but she refused, saying that God would judge him. The two happened to meet accidentally at Bath, whereupon <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> [...] "Captain Molloy, you are a bad man. I wish you the greatest curse that can befall a British officer. When the day of battle comes, may your false heart fail you!" [...] Molloy's actions at the Glorious First of June, and his subsequent disgrace at the court martial were then presumed {{to be the result of}} her curse. Molloy's problems with women were not over, with the suggestion that he was dominated by his wife. A short refrain appeared in print, running: I, Anthony James Pye MolloyCan burn, take, sink and destroy;There's only one thing I can't do, upon my life!And that is, to stop the d-d tongue of my wife.|$|E

2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words [...] "He withdraws not {{his eyes from}} the righteous" [...] in [...] to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty as shown in her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, but my father is a trickster, and he will outwit you." [...] Jacob replied, [...] "I am his brother in trickery." [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?" [...] He replied, [...] "Yes, with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself subtle." [...] He asked her, [...] "What is his trickery?" [...] She replied: [...] "I have a sister older than I am, and he will not let me marry before her." [...] So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, she said to herself, [...] "Now my sister will be put to shame," [...] so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah," [...] we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not know until then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants..|$|E
