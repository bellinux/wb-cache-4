However, phase measurements has an inherent difficulty, which is the ambiguity determination in number of wavelength of signal. The purpose of this work is to estimate the position coordinates of a GPS receiver using phase double difference positioning techniques. Performance of carrier phase ambiguity resolution with LAMBDA method using real static and kinematic data is evaluated. Results, using a least-squares method as estimator, show errors with half <b>meter</b> <b>level</b> for <b>static</b> and <b>meter</b> <b>level</b> for kinematic positioning...|$|R

30|$|Figure  10 (A, B and C), {{shows that}} {{rainfall}} variation influences river flow and borehole <b>static</b> <b>level.</b> Also, borehole <b>static</b> <b>level</b> {{seems to be}} influenced by time (years). The weak correlation between borehole <b>static</b> <b>level</b> and rainfall could be {{explained by the fact that}} the change does not occur immediately after a rainfall event. The poor correlation between the years and the borehole <b>static</b> <b>level</b> from 1981 to 1996 could mean that, could mean that other factors influence the <b>static</b> <b>level.</b> The basin is a fractured nappe (Jourda et al. 2006). Although some fractures are interconnected, they are not evenly distributed across the basin. Also, the population density is quite low in most major cities of the study area. It’s about 14 inhabitants/km 2, 15 inhabitants/km 2 and 32 inhabitants/km 2 in Ferké, M'Bengué and Korhogo, respectively. Moreover, boreholes are only used for drinking purpose and not for agricultural activities that may need much more water. For all these reasons, we agree that even if anthropogenic ground water abstraction may exist, that can not caused a general decrease of <b>static</b> <b>levels</b> in all parts of the basin. A general decrease, as observed, may be mainly linked to a factor that affects the entire basin, like rainfall (mean rainfall). Hence, the long period of deficit could play an important role in lowering the water <b>static</b> <b>level</b> in the basin. This has been demonstrated by Mahé et al. (2000) who using the method of coefficients, have analyzed the differences between rainfall, streamflow and piezometric levels of 27 boreholes in the Bani basin of Mali. Their results show a decreased <b>static</b> <b>level</b> that correlated with rainfall. Adja et al. (2009), analyzing satellite images (from 1999 to 2000) of the WBB, showed that three months after the rainy season, rivers lose about 20 % of their water due to evaporation. This rate increases to 66 %, four months after the rainy season. The rivers of the study area experienced a rapid reduction between 50 and 60  days (Jourda et al. 2006). This may explain the high rate of recession coefficient in the basin between 1981 and 1996. Indeed, there are complex relationships between rivers and groundwater that vary over the seasons. The recession coefficient is proportional to the rate of drying up and increases in dry periods. This relationship between rainfall and river flow, is confirmed by our results especially through the water balance.|$|R
