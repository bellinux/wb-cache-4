40|$|This study {{investigated}} the formulation mechanism of microspheres via internal surfactant distribution. Eudragit L 100 based microspheres loaded with bovine serum albumin were prepared by solid in oil in oil emulsion solvent evaporation method using acetone and liquid paraffin system containing <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> as a surfactant. The fabricated microspheres were evaluated for encapsulation efficiency, particle size, production yield, and in vitro release characteristics. The internal structures of microspheres were characterized using synchrotron radiation X-ray microcomputed tomography (SR-µCT). The enhanced contrast made the <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> distinguished from Eudragit to have its three dimensional (3 D) distribution. Results indicated that the content and concentration determined the state of <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> and had significant influences on the release kinetics of protein. The dispersity of <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> was the primary factor that controlled {{the structure of the}} microspheres and further affected the encapsulation efficiency, effective drug loading, as well as in vitro release behavior. In conclusion, the 3 D internal distribution of surfactant in microspheres and its effects on protein release behaviors have been revealed for the first time. The highly resolved 3 D architecture provides new evidence for the deep understanding of the microsphere formation mechanism...|$|E

The yield values of microspheres were over the 78 %, and the encapsulation efficiencies were found to be ∼ 735. Particle sizes of microspheres prepared with aluminum tristearate were between 76 and 448 μm, while that of the microspheres containing <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> were between 521 and 2000 μm. Morphological and physicochemical properties of microspheres were investigated by scanning electron micrography and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). DSC analysis indicated that verapamil hydrochloride formed a solid solution with acrylic polymers. In vitro release studies were performed using the flow-through cell method. While ∼ 80 % of drug was released from the microspheres containing aluminum tristearate in 480 minutes, the same amount of drug was released from microspheres containing <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> in only 60 minutes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the preparation of hollow colloidosomes using two steps preparation by Shahidan et al. (2013) method with different structural polymers and different surfactant which are biocompatible and biodegradable. In this study, two structural polymers were used; polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and polycaprolactone (PCL). The surfactants used were <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> (S 1570) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). There are three different parameters used in preparation of PVA/PCL hollow colloidosomes; speed homogenizer, evaporation temperature and feeding rate of oil phase. In S 1570 /PCL hollow colloidosomes preparation, an effect of polymer surfactant concentration and a brief study on the preparation scale were proposed. There are two different scales used in S 1570 /PCL hollow colloidosomes preparation which are small scale and large scale preparation. In this study, hollow colloidosomes were prepared using an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion solvent evaporation method. Another study proposed is S 1570 /PHA hollow colloidosomes. PHA is a structural polymer that does not affect the environment because it is a biodegradable material. The physical properties of hollow colloidosomes prepared using different parameters, surfactant and polymer was characterized and analyzed. The interesting phenomenon in this study is the birefringence phenomenon of hollow colloidosomes which confirmed the colloidosomes shell was made of small particles...|$|E
40|$|Sucrose esters (SEs) are {{biodegradable}} surfactants {{that can}} be manufactured in various hydrophilic-lipophilic balances (HLB) {{through the use of}} different fatty acids. They are used in food and in industries, such as the cosmetics, detergents and pharmaceutical industries. In aqueous media they can form gels, which can affectvarious industrial processes. The pharmaceutical industry is currently showing an increasing preference for biomaterials and environmentally sensitive gels, and in particular thermo-sensitive gels. By virtue of the nontoxic, biodegradable and gel-forming properties of SEs, they are promising materials with which to formthermo-sensitive delivery systems. In this study, the gelling properties of some <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearates</b> were investigated by rheological measurements, and compared with each other. The effects of the release of gel-forming SEs on a model drug (paracetamol) were evaluated through in vitro drug release studies. The rheological results indicated that the <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearates</b> with lower HLB values have higher gel strengths than those of the more hydrophilic <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearates.</b> The gelling of the SEs is concentration- and temperature-dependent, and this gelling behaviour is responsible for the great effect of <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearates</b> on drug release...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selected}} nonionic emulsifiers on the physicochemical characteristics of astaxanthin nanodispersions produced by an emulsification/evaporation technique were studied. The emulsifiers used were polysorbates (Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 40, Polysorbate 60 and Polysorbate 80) and sucrose esters of fatty acids (<b>sucrose</b> laurate, palmitate, <b>stearate</b> and oleate). The mean particle diameters of the nanodispersions ranged from 70 nm to 150 nm, {{depending on the}} emulsifier used. In the prepared nanodispersions, the astaxanthin particle diameter decreased with increasing emulsifier hydrophilicity and decreasing carbon number of the fatty acid in the emulsifier structure. Astaxanthin nanodispersions with the smallest particle diameters were produced with Polysorbate 20 and sucrose laurate among the polysorbates and the sucrose esters, respectively. We {{also found that the}} Polysorbate 80 - and sucrose oleate-stabilized nanodispersions had the highest astaxanthin losses (i. e., the lowest astaxanthin contents in the final products) among the nanodispersions.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate microencapsulated controlled release preparation of theophylline using Eudragit RS 100 as the retardant material with high entrapment efficiency. Methods: Microspheres were prepared by the emulsion-solvent evaporation method. A mixed solvent system consisting of methanol and acetone and light liquid paraffin as oily phase were chosen. <b>Sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> was used as the surfactant to stabilize the emulsification process. The prepared microspheres were characterized by drug loading, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The in vitro release studies were performed at pH 1. 2 and 7. 4 aqueous medium. Results: Increasing the concentration of emulsifier, sucrose fatty acid ester F- 70, decreased the particle size which contributed to increased drug release rate. The drug loading microparticle Eudragit RS 100 (1 : 6) showed 60 - 75 % of entrapment and mean particle size 205. 93 - 352. 76 µm. The results showed that, an increase in the ratio of polymer: drug (F 5, 6 : 1) resulted in a reduction in the release rate of the drug which may be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the polymer. Conclusion: The release of theophylline is influenced by the drug to polymer ratio and particle size. Drug release is controlled by diffusion and the best-fit release kinetic is Higuchi model...|$|E

In this context, the objective {{of the present study was}} to analyze the action of sorbitan tristearate (STS) and <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> (SE) as potential modifiers of crystallization of the unsaturated triacylglycerols and to evaluate their effects on the physical properties of zero trans fat from soybean oil and fully hydrogenated soybean oil. The zero trans fat was obtained via chemical interesterification of a blend of soybean oil (70 g/ 100 g) and fully hydrogenated soybean oil (30 g/ 100 g). Samples containing 1 g/ 100 g, 3 g/ 100 g, and 5 g/ 100 g STS or SE were prepared and their crystallization properties were evaluated on the basis of the solid fat content (SFC), melting point, consistency, microstructure and visualization of the three-dimensional crystalline network. Both emulsifiers contributed to SFC adequacy, enhancing the consistency of the fat. As for compatibility, both emulsifiers were compatible with the interesterified fat. This was confirmed by the change in linearity of the curves at 15 - 20 degrees C. Samples with STS presented higher fractal dimension, indicating greater organization of the crystal lattice. Similarly, the visualization of three-dimensional crystalline network showed firmer structures for samples with STS compared with the samples SE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of main emulsion components namely, modified starch, propylene glycol alginate (PGA), sucrose laurate and <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> on creaming index, cloudiness, average droplet size and conductivity of soursop beverage emulsions. Generally, the use of different emulsifiers or a mixture of emulsifiers has a significant (p < 0. 05) effect on the response variables studied. The addition of PGA had a significant (p < 0. 05) effect on the creaming index at 55 °C, while PGA-stabilized (PGA 1) emulsions showed low creaming stability at both 25 °C and 55 °C. Conversely, the utilization of PGA either as a mixture or sole emulsifier, showed significantly (p < 0. 05) higher cloudiness, as larger average droplet size will affect the refractive index of the oil and aqueous phases. Additionally, the cloudiness was directly proportional to the mean droplet size of the dispersed phase. The inclusion of PGA into the formulation could have disrupted the properties of the interfacial film, thus resulting in larger droplet size. While unadsorbed ionized PGA could have contributed to higher conductivity of emulsions prepared at low pH. Generally, emulsions prepared using sucrose monoesters or as a mixture with modified starch emulsions have significantly (p < 0. 05) lower creaming index and conductivity values, but higher cloudiness and average droplet size...|$|E

40|$|Mild {{non-ionic}} {{sucrose ester}} surfactants {{can be employed}} to produce lipid-based drug delivery systems for dermal application. Moreover, sucrose esters of intermediate lipophilicity such as <b>sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> S- 970 possess a peculiar rheological behavior which can be employed to create highly viscous semi-solid formulations without any further additives. Interestingly, {{it was possible to}} develop both viscous macroemulsions and fluid nanoemulsions with the same chemical composition merely by slight alteration of the production process. Optical light microscopy and cryo transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the sucrose ester {{led to the formation of}} an astonishing hydrophilic network at a concentration of only 5 % w/w in the macroemulsion system. A small number of more finely structured aggregates composed of surplus surfactant were likewise detected in the nanoemulsions. These discoveries offer interesting possibilities to adapt the low viscosity of fluid O/W nanoemulsions for a more convenient application. Moreover, a simple and rapid production method for skin-friendly creamy O/W emulsions with excellent visual long-term stability is presented. It could be shown by franz-cell diffusion studies and in vitro tape stripping that the microviscosity within the semi-solid formulations was apparently not influenced by their increased macroviscosity: the release of three model drugs was not impaired by the complex network-like internal structure of the macroemulsions. These results indicate that the developed semi-solid emulsions with advantageous application properties are highly suitable for the unhindered delivery of lipophilic drugs despite their comparatively large particle size and high viscosity...|$|E

This study aimed to gain insight into the use of SE as controlled release agents for direct compacted matrix tablets. The study focused {{on the effect of}} hydrophilic-lipophilic properties on tableting properties and drug release. <b>Sucrose</b> <b>stearate</b> with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values ranging from 0 to 16 was systematically tested. Tablet formulations contained SE, metoprolol tartrate as a highly soluble model drug and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate as a tablet formulation filler in the ratio 1 : 1 : 2. The compaction behaviour of matrix tablets was compared with the compacts of individual starting materials as reference. SE incorporation improved the plasticity, compressibility and lubricating property of powder mixtures. The hydrophilic-lipophilic properties of SE affected tableting properties, drug release rate and release mechanism. Increasing hydrophilicity corresponding to the increased monoesters in SE composition increased the relative porosity, elastic recovery and tensile strength of the tablets due to the increased hydrogen bonding between the monoesters. This also facilitated the swelling behaviour of SE, which sustained the drug release rate. A sustained release effect prevailed in tablets containing SE with HLB values of 3 - 16. The ability to improve the tableting properties as well as sustain the drug release rate of the highly soluble model drug via gelation of SE highlights SE as promising controlled release regulators for direct compacted matrix tablets comprising drugs with various solubilities according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System...|$|E
