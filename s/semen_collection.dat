25|$|Embryo {{collection}} is more demanding and requires more training than <b>semen</b> <b>collection</b> because the female reproductive organs are located {{inside of the}} body cavity. Superovulation is a technique used {{in order to have}} a female release more oocytes than normal. This can be achieved by using hormones to manipulate the female's reproductive organs. The hormones used are typically gonadotropin-like, meaning they stimulate the gonads. Follicle stimulating hormone is the preferred hormone in cattle, sheep and goats. While in pigs, equine chorionic gonadotropin is preferred. However, this is not commonly done in the swine industry because gilts and sows (female pigs) naturally ovulate more than one oocyte at one time. Superovulation can be difficult because not all females will respond the same way and success will vary by species. Once the female has released the oocytes, they are fertilized internally—in vivo—and flushed out of her body. In vivo fertilization is more successful than in vitro fertilization. In cattle, usually 10 or more embryos are removed from the flushing process. In order to flush the uterus, a technician will first seal off the female's cervix and add fluid, which allows the ovum to be flushed out of the uterine horns and into a cylinder for analysis. This process typically takes 30 minutes or less. Technicians are able to determine the sex of the embryo, which can be especially beneficial in the dairy industry because it is more desirable for the embryo to be a female. Vitrification is the preferred method of embryo freezing because it yields higher quality embryos. It is crucial technicians handle the embryos with care and freeze them within 3–4 hours in order to preserve viability of the greatest percentage of embryos.|$|E

500|$|<b>Semen</b> <b>collection</b> is {{naturally}} an integral component of this entire process. [...] Once semen has been collected {{it can be}} used immediately for insemination or slowly frozen for use at a later date. Fresh semen is recognized as the method of choice as it lives longer and yields higher conception rates. Frozen semen will work but it must be the highest quality of semen and the ewes must be inseminated twice in the same day. The marketing of ram semen is a major part of this industry.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effect of varicocelectomy on sperm {{function}} (DNA integrity and mitochondrial activity) and levels of lipid peroxidation in seminal plasma of adolescents. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Patients recruited from a local public school. Patient(s) : Adolescents (14 - 19 years old), Tanner stages IV or V with varicocele grades II or III, attending a local public school. Intervention(s) : Two <b>semen</b> <b>collections</b> with a one week interval between collections before bilateral varicocele repair using subinguinal microsurgical varicocelectomy, and two <b>semen</b> <b>collections</b> with a one week interval between collections {{three months after the}} surgery. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Rate of sperm DNA fragmentation as assessed by the Comet assay and categorized as classes I (no DNA fragmentation) to IV (high DNA fragmentation). Rate of mitochondrial activity as assessed by the diaminobenzidine assay and categorized as grades I (all mitochondria active) to IV (all mitochondria inactive). Levels of lipid peroxidation in seminal plasma by a colorimetric method that quantifies a lipid peroxidation subproduct (malondialdehyde). Result(s) : Concerning DNA integrity, the samples after varicocelectomy showed more spermatozoa with intact nuclear DNA (grade I) and less spermatozoa with Comet grades II, III, and IV. Regarding mitochondrial activity, the samples after varicocelectomy showed less cells with inactive mitochondria (class III). No differences were observed in classes I, II, and IV. Concerning lipid peroxidation, no significant differences were observed. Conclusion(s) : This study was able to demonstrate that varicocelectomy in adolescents is associated with increased sperm DNA integrity and mitochondrial activity. However, levels of seminal products of lipid degradation (malondialdehyde) are not different. (Fertil Steril (R) 2011; 95 : 994 - 9. (C) 2011 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ...|$|R

2500|$|Freezing semen is a {{commonly}} used technique {{in the modern}} animal agriculture industry, which is well researched with established methods Semen is often collected using an artificial vagina, electroejaculation, gloved-hand technique, abdominal stroking, or epididymal sperm collection. Preferred collection techniques vary based on species and available tools. [...] Patience and technique are keys to successful collection of semen. There are several styles and types of artificial vaginas {{that can be used}} depending on the breed and species of the male. During this process the penis enters a tube that is the approximate pressure and temperature of the female's vagina. There is a disposable bag inside the tube that collects the semen. During this process it may be beneficial to have a teaser animal—an animal used to sexually tease but not impregnate the animal—to increase the arousal of the male. Electroejaculation is a method of <b>semen</b> <b>collection</b> in the cattle industry because it yields high quality semen. However, this process requires the animal to be trained and securely held, thus it is not ideal when working with wild or feral animals. When performing this process the electroejaculator is inserted into the rectum of the male. The electroejaculator stimulates the male causing an ejaculation, after which the semen is collected. The glove hand collection technique is used mainly in the swine industry. During this process, the boar mounts a dummy, while the handler grasps the penis of the boar between the ridges of his fingers and collects the semen. Abdominal stroking is exclusively used in the poultry industry. During the technique, one technician will hold the bird, while a second technician massages the bird's cloaca. However, feces and semen both exit the male bird's body through the cloaca, so the semen quality is often low.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} route of {{transmission}} is from bull to cow.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate variation in the ratio of X- to Y-bearing sperm of individual ejaculates and to determine any relationship between skewed sex ratio and either routine mor-phological evaluation or computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Semen was collected from bulls weekly for 6 consecutive weeks, sperm DNA was recovered and quantitative, and real-time PCR was used to determine the ratio of X- to Y-bearing sperm in each ejaculate. The overall mean of X-bearing sperm within ejaculates was 54. 7 % over the 6 weeks of <b>semen</b> <b>collections.</b> The percen-tages of X-bearing sperm were similar (P> 0. 5) across all collections. Between bulls, there were differences (P < 0. 05) in the mean percentage of X-bearing sperm.

Different combinations of CASA and/or morphological parameters were found to correlate with the percentage of X-bearing sperm but the prediction equations were spe-cific for individual bulls and unlikely to be of use across bulls. These results confirm that the ratio of X- to Y-bearing sperm may be skewed in some ejaculates of bull semen. Some sperm parameter...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the reproductive performance of Santa Ines rams subjected to successive <b>semen</b> <b>collections</b> in an Amazonian climate. Four rams were subjected to successive ejaculations during a maximum period of three hours. This procedure was repeated three times at 15 -day intervals. Sexual and behavioural (libido) and andrological (testicular and seminal) assessments were performed. A total of 81 ejaculates were collected. Libido and semen vigour, volume, appearance and concentration decreased as the ejaculation frequency increased (P< 0. 05) and sperm motility showed a decreasing trend (P= 0. 06). The seminal pH increased over the sequence of collections (P< 0. 05). The only significant differences observed between individual rams were the variable scrotal circumference and the percentages of live sperm and sperm abnormalities (P< 0. 05). All the parameters of the first ejaculation were within the normal range for this species, which suggests that the local climatic conditions (high temperature and humidity) did not affect the behavioural, testicular or seminal parameters of experimental rams. Our findings indicate that the reproductive performance of Santa Ines rams could be affected by the intensification of ejaculation frequency; however, individual male variation needs to be taken into consideration...|$|R

To that end 5 rabbits were utilized; ten <b>semen</b> <b>collections</b> were taken from each (n = 50). The semen was collected by artificial vagina, and evaluated for volume, motility, vigour, and concentration. The semen was diluted (20 x 10 (6) spermatozoa/mL) in pre-warmed micro tube at 37 ºC in the three extenders, {{and then it was}} incubated in water bath at 37 ºC during 120 minutes, performing evaluation every 30 minutes. Immediately after the dilution (time 0) the sperm motility was not different among extenders (P>; 0. 05), however, decreased (P< 0. 05) in Ringer extender when compared to in natura semen.
