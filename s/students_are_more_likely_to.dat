25|$|On March 5, 2014, the College Board {{announced}} {{its plan to}} redesign the SAT in order to link the exam more closely to the work high school students encounter in the classroom. The new exam was administered {{for the first time}} in March, 2016. Some of the major changes are: an emphasis on the use of evidence to support answers, a shift away from obscure vocabulary to words that <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> encounter in college and career, a math section that is focused on fewer areas, a return to the 1600-point score scale, an optional essay, and the removal of penalty for wrong answers (rights-only scoring). To combat the perceived advantage of costly test preparation courses, the College Board announced a new partnership with Khan Academy to offer free online practice problems and instructional videos.|$|E

40|$|Ethics is an {{integral}} part of the accountancy profession. As the profession becomes <b>more</b> internationalized, it <b>is</b> critical to accept that different nations may still advocate differing treatments for similar issues. This study evaluates whether the accountants of tomorrow already display differences in their attitudes, based upon nationality. The attitudes of final year accountancy students from three countries, Malaysia, Australia and Ire land we re compared across some ethical scenarios. Significant differences were found to exist based upon nationality. When confronted with bribery/corruption scenarios, Malaysian <b>students</b> <b>were</b> most likely to refuse participation but do nothing about them. Australian <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to inform the relevant authorities. Irish <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to participate than their Malaysian and Australian counterparts. Malaysian <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to cheat in an exam than participate in corruption, whereas Irish and Australian <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to do the opposite. Hence, ethical attitudes are affected by nationalistic traits. The ramifications for professional training should therefore be considered...|$|R

2500|$|For many parents, the {{decision}} {{of whether or not}} to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to perform a needs {{assessment}} for pharmacy practitioners and measure the attitudes of both pharmacy practitioners and students regarding alternative therapies. A 15 -item-five-point scale questionnaire designed to measure the educational needs and attitudes of pharmacists regarding complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was developed and mailed to 200 randomly selected practitioners. After two mailings, 94 (47 percent) were returned. A {{modified version of the}} questionnaire was administered to 35 students pharmacy students. The returned questionnaires were tabulated and identical items were statistically compared using nonparametric analyses. Significant differences were the following: practitioners were less likely to favor pharmacists becoming practitioners of CAM; practitioners believed those alternative therapies offered by pharmacists would decrease the public’s respect for the profession; <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to believe that sufficient evidence exists supporting the use of some alternative therapies; <b>student’s</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to believe that pharmacy as a profession should aggressively pursue opportunities in alternative medicine; <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to refer a patient to a practitioner of CAM; and <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to believe that alternative therapies will offer new means for the pharmacist to develop primary care services. We do not know if other rural and urban states have similar disparities between pharmacy practitioners and students, but we share this data in case a needs assessment should be done in other states...|$|R
50|$|Different {{schools have}} {{different}} effects on similar students. Children of color {{tend to be}} concentrated in low-achieving, highly segregated schools.
