Measurements in more than 50 German Gothic churches show a narrow range for mid-frequency reverberation depending on volume being typical for this architectural style but differing for churches with plaster or brick surfaces. The dimensions of the columns lead to the effect that the first high-frequency reflections (coming from <b>side</b> <b>directions)</b> reach the listeners earlier than the low-frequency reflections (coming from above).

Using the spectral element method, we derive a finite-dimensional state-space model d from an infinite-dimensional model d of a monopile wind turbine tower stabilised by a TMD located in the nacelle. and d {{can be used to}} represent the dynamics of the tower and TMD in either the fore–aft direction or the side– <b>side</b> <b>direction.</b> The wind turbine tower subsystem of is modelled as a non-uniform SCOLE (NASA Spacecraft Control Laboratory Experiment) system consisting of an Euler–Bernoulli beam equation describing the dynamics of the flexible tower and the Newton–Euler rigid body equations describing the dynamics of the heavy rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA) by neglecting any coupling with blade motions. d can be used for fast and accurate simulation for the dynamics of the wind turbine tower as well as for optimal TMD designs. We show that d agrees very well with the FAST (fatigue, aerodynamics, structures and turbulence) simulation of the NREL 5 -MW wind turbine model. We optimise the parameters of the TMD by minimising the frequency-limited H 2 -norm of the transfer function matrix of d which has input of force and torque acting on the RNA, and output of tower-top displacement. The performances of the optimal TMDs in the fore–aft and side–side directions are tested through FAST simulations, which achieve substantial fatigue load reductions. This research also demonstrates how to optimally tune TMDs to reduce vibrations of flexible structures described by partial differential equations...|$|R

The analysis of the underlying complexity of the ball movement characteristics and the players’ action zones constitute promising possibilities for future studies to capture such behaviours. Another possible limitation of this study is the order in that the SSCGs were played (i.e., first the 3 v 3, then the 4 v 4 and finally the 5 v 5). More studies are needed using a randomized SSCGs order to its effects on performance.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the overall burst-instability of isolated coal pillars by means of the possibility index diagnosis method (PIDM). First, the abutment pressure calculation model of the gob in <b>side</b> <b>direction</b> was established to derive the abutment pressure distribution curve of the isolated coal pillar. Second, the overall burst-instability ratio of the isolated coal pillars was defined. Finally, the PIDM was utilized to judge the possibility of overall burst-instability and recoverability of isolated coal pillars. The results show that an overall burst-instability may occur due to a large gob width or a small pillar width. If the width of the isolated coal pillar is not large enough, the shallow coal seam will be damaged at first, and then the high abutment pressure will be transferred to the deep coal seam, which may cause an overall burst-instability accident. This approach can be adopted to design widths of gobs and isolated coal pillars and to evaluate whether an existing isolated coal pillar is recoverable in skip-mining mines...|$|R
50|$|Route {{panorama}} is {{a continuous}} 2D image that includes all the scenes visible from a route, as it {{first appeared in}} Zheng and Tsuji′s work of panoramic views in 1990. Different from a local panorama at a static viewpoint, a digital route panorama is constructed from partial views at consecutive viewpoints along a path. A general approach to obtain such a complete route panorama {{is to use a}} line camera or slit camera mounted on a vehicle moving along the path smoothly. The camera scans temporal scenes in the <b>side</b> <b>direction</b> of the path and connect them to the spatial image. This is realized by a program that processes temporal image data or video data in a computer. The route panorama can extend to a long distance for indexing scenes and navigation on the Internet.
