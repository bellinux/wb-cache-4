Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall {{and listen to the}} other for company, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.|$|E
25|$|PGP {{can be used}} to send {{messages}} confidentially. For this, PGP combines symmetric-key encryption and public-key encryption. The message is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm, which requires a symmetric key. Each symmetric key is used only once and is also called a session key. The message and its session key are sent to the receiver. The session key must be sent to the receiver <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> how to decrypt the message, but to protect it during transmission it is encrypted with the receiver's public key. Only the private key belonging to the receiver can decrypt the session key.|$|E

An ETD could {{be attached to}} the rear of the train to detect the train's air brake pressure and report any problems to the locomotive. The ETD also detects movement of the train upon start-up and radios this information to the engineers <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> all of the slack is out of the couplings and additional power could be applied. The machines also have blinking red lights to warn following trains that a train is ahead. With the introduction of the ETD, the conductor moved up to the front of the train with the engineer.|$|E

25|$|Martin and Sugarman {{describe}} {{memory and}} imagination as two ontic (real) characteristics {{of human nature}} which are vital to humans' capacity for dialogue. According to Martin and Sugarman, it is through both that {{people are able to}} remember the conversations that “we furnished with the symbolic and relational tools we require to consider past experiences and previous learning, and to entertain future possibilities” because memory allows humans to reconstruct their past while imagination allows them “to project selves into the future”. In other words, when humans converse with others, they recall memories and imagine future possibilities to help themselves mentally construct potential ways for understanding themselves (self-interpretation) and their world, and their place in it, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> how to relate to others.|$|E

60|$|Such is oftenest {{the young}} man's {{introduction}} to the forest, and the most original part of himself. He goes thither at first as a hunter and fisher, until at last, if he has the seeds {{of a better life}} in him, he distinguishes his proper objects, as a poet or naturalist it may be, and leaves the gun and fish-pole behind. The mass of men are still and always young in this respect. In some countries a hunting parson is no uncommon sight. Such a one might make a good shepherd's dog, but is far from being the Good Shepherd. I have been surprised to consider that the only obvious employment, except wood-chopping, ice-cutting, or the like business, which ever to my knowledge detained at Walden Pond for a whole half-day any of my fellow-citizens, whether fathers or children of the town, with just one exception, was fishing. Commonly they did not think that they were lucky, or well paid for their time, unless they got a long string of fish, though they had the opportunity of seeing the pond all the while. They might go there a thousand times before the sediment of fishing would sink to the bottom and leave their purpose pure; but no doubt such a clarifying process would be going on all the while. The Governor and his Council faintly remember the pond, for they went a-fishing there when they were boys; but now they are too old and dignified to go a-fishing, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> it no more forever. Yet even they expect to go to heaven at last. If the legislature regards it, it is chiefly to regulate the number of hooks to be used there; but they know nothing about the hook of hooks with which to angle for the pond itself, impaling the legislature for a bait. Thus, even in civilized communities, the embryo man passes through the hunter stage of development.|$|E

[...] then sat down suddenly on the hatch and took his head between his hands. All looked at Singleton, gazing upwards from the deck, staring out of dark corners, or turning their heads with curious glances. They were expectant and appeased as if that old man, who looked at no one, had possessed the secret of their uneasy indignations and desires, a sharper vision, a clearer knowledge. And indeed standing there amongst them, he had the uninterested appearance of one who had seen multitudes of ships, had listened many times to voices such as theirs, had already seen all that could happen on the wide seas. They heard his voice rumble in his broad chest as though the words had been rolling towards them out of a rugged past. [...] "What {{do you want to}} do?" [...] he asked. No one answered. Only Knowles muttered--"Aye, aye," [...] and somebody said low:--"It's a bloomin' shame." [...] He waited, made a contemptuous gesture.--"I have seen rows aboard ship before some of you were born," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "for something or nothing; but never for such a thing."--"The man is dying, I tell ye," [...] repeated Belfast, woefully, sitting at Singleton's feet.--"And a black fellow, too," [...] went on the old seaman, [...] "I have seen them die like flies." [...] He stopped, thoughtful, as if trying to recollect gruesome things, details of horrors, hecatombs of niggers. They looked at him fascinated. He was old enough to remember slavers, bloody mutinies, pirates perhaps; who could tell through what violences and terrors he had lived! What would he say? He said:--"You can't help him; die he must." [...] He made another pause. His moustache and beard stirred. He chewed words, mumbled behind tangled white hairs; incomprehensible and exciting, like an oracle behind a veil....--"Stop ashore------sick.-------Instead------bringing all this head wind. Afraid.

6000|$|This suited {{very well}} with our purpose; so I {{resolved}} now that we would leave off being pirates and turn merchants; so we told them what goods we had on board, and that if they would bring their supercargoes or merchants on board, we would trade with them. They were very willing to trade with us, but terribly afraid to trust us; nor was it an unjust fear, for we had plundered them already of what they had. On the other hand, we were as diffident as they, and very uncertain what to do; but William the Quaker put this matter into a way of barter. He {{came to me and}} told me he really thought the merchants looked like fair men, that meant honestly. [...] "And besides," [...] says William, [...] "it is their interest to be honest now, for, as they know upon what terms we got the goods we are to truck with them, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> we can afford good pennyworths; and in the next place, it saves them going the whole voyage, so that the southerly monsoons yet holding, if they traded with us, they could immediately return with their cargo to China;" [...] though, by the way, we afterwards found they intended for Japan; but that was all one, for by this means they saved at least eight months' voyage. Upon these foundations, William said he was satisfied we might trust them; [...] "for," [...] says William, [...] "I would as soon trust a man whose interest binds him to be just to me as a man whose principle binds himself." [...] Upon the whole, William proposed that two of the merchants should be left on board our ship as hostages, and that part of our goods should be loaded in their vessel, and let the third go with it into the port where their ship lay; and when he had delivered the spices, he should bring back such things as it was agreed should be exchanged. This was concluded on, and William the Quaker ventured to go along with them, which, upon my word, I should not have cared to have done, nor was I willing that he should, but he went still upon the notion that it was their interest to treat him friendly.|$|E
