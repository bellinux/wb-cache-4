25|$|A glove (Middle English from Old English glof) is {{a garment}} {{covering}} the whole hand. Gloves have separate sheaths or openings for each finger and the thumb; {{if there is}} an opening but no (or a <b>short)</b> <b>covering</b> sheath for each finger they are called fingerless gloves. Fingerless gloves having one large opening rather than individual openings for each finger are sometimes called gauntlets, though gauntlets are not necessarily fingerless. Gloves which cover the entire hand or fist but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called mittens. Mittens are warmer than other styles of gloves made of the same material because fingers maintain their warmth better when they are in contact with each other. Reduced surface area reduces heat loss.|$|E

50|$|Short squeezes result when short sellers {{cover their}} {{positions}} on a stock, resulting in buying volume that drives the stock price up. This can occur if the price has risen {{to a point where}} short sellers must make margin calls, or more loosely if short sellers simply decide to cut their losses and get out. This may happen in an automated manner for example if the short sellers had previously placed stop-loss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional margin calls and <b>short</b> <b>covering.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{have seen}} how mapping by {{hybridization}} can be abstracted into the <b>shortest</b> <b>covering</b> string problem SCS which is NP-hard when the probes are non unique. However, we showed that even when the probes are non unique, a polynomial time algorithm exists for computing a <b>shortest</b> <b>covering</b> string for a given permutation pi of the clones. This polynomial time algorithm was used to develop a heuristic algorithm for the general SCS problem with non unique probes. Now {{we look at the}} SCS problem when probes are unique and we show that it can be solved in polynomial time. SCS with unique probes As for the case of non unique probes, we will assume that we have no hybridization errors. Under this assumption, (1) the length of the <b>shortest</b> <b>covering</b> string in equal to the number of probes (assume a probe hybridizes with at least one clone), and (2) the shortest ocvering string is therefore a permutation of the probes. Both (1) and (2) imply that the matrix D satisfy the consecutive 1 ’s property C 1 P: C 1 P: There exists a permutation of the columns of D (probes), such that all 1 s in each row occur in consecutive positions. Note that in the presence of hybridization errors, the C 1 P property might not be satisfied, below is an example where we cannot permute the columns of D to make it C 1 P: 1...|$|R

5000|$|It is a long-bodied black beetle. At about 20 - 32 mm, {{it is one}} of {{the larger}} British beetles. Its wing covers (elytra) are <b>short,</b> <b>covering</b> only its thorax, exposing the {{abdominal}} segments. The abdominal musculature is powerful and the abdominal segments are covered with sclerotized plates. It is capable of flight, but its wings are rarely used. It is covered with fine, black hairs. It is well known for its habit of raising its long and uncovered abdomen and opening its jaws, rather like a scorpion when threatened. [...] Although it has no sting, it can give a painful bite with its strong, pincer-like jaws. It also emits a foul-smelling odour, as a defensive secretion, from a pair of white glands at the end of its abdomen.|$|E
5000|$|One of the Vatican's leading Latin experts, Bacci {{strongly}} opposed {{the introduction of}} the vernacular into the Mass. In what was known as the Ottaviani Intervention, the then 84-year-old Bacci, together with 79-year-old Alfredo Ottaviani, sent to Pope Paul VI, with a <b>short</b> <b>covering</b> letter from themselves, a study by a group of theologians under the direction of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre criticizing the draft Order of Mass of the revision of the Roman Missal. In their letter the two cardinals said that the study showed that the new Order of Mass [...] "represents, both as a whole and in its details, a striking departure from the Catholic theology of the Mass as it was formulated in Session 22 of the Council of Trent...to which, nonetheless, the Catholic conscience is bound forever. With the promulgation of the Novus Ordo, the loyal Catholic is thus faced with a most tragic alternative."Among Bacci's publications was Lexicon Eorum Vocabulorum Quae Difficilius Latine Redduntur, a dictionary of modern terms in Latin; he invented such words as gummis salivaria ("chewing gum"), barbara saltatio ("the twist"), and diurnarius scriptor ("newspaper reporter"). This was a standard reference for writers of Modern Latin, especially at the Vatican, until it was superseded by the Lexicon Recentis Latinitatis.|$|E

50|$|On 25 July the 55th Division was {{relieved}} and travelled south {{to join in}} the Somme offensive. It moved into the line opposite Guillemont on 30 July and prepared to attack on 8 August (the Battle of Guillemont). 164th (North Lancashire) Brigade made the initial attack, and 1/5th Loyals moved out early on to support it. B and C Companies were sent on to occupy trenches running north between the Trones-Guillemont road and Railway Support Trench, C Company then continuing to join 1/8th Bn King's Liverpool Regiment (the Liverpool Irish) in the front line. Soon afterwards A and D Companies were ordered up to join 2/5th Bn Lancashire Fusiliers. However, the attack had failed with heavy casualties and the division was ordered to repeat it the following day. This time 1/5th Loyals and the 1/10th King's Liverpool (Liverpool Scottish) were to lead. There was no preliminary bombardment, only a <b>short</b> <b>covering</b> barrage beginning at 04.20. The Liverpool Scottish followed this barrage closely and got as far as the enemy wire, which was uncut. But because of the late arrival of the orders and the crowded trenches on the way up, the 1/5th Loyals could not get into position until after 05.00, long after the barrage had ended. Nevertheless, the battalion 'made a most gallant assault' at 05.25; unable to reach the enemy trenches they were forced back to their starting point. Every officer with the right hand companies became a casualty. Battalion losses totalled 33 killed, 85 wounded and 20 missing.|$|E

The geometric behavior of extended balls is discussed. As the main result, we investigate a "large" arrangement of vectors whose extended balls are "highly intersecting".
