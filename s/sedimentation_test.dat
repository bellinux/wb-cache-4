Bendien (2) himself claims that his test is a superior prognostic test to the sedimentation rate, but does not offer convincing data in support of this claim.

40|$|Industrial waste {{containing}} colloidal {{particulate matter}} such as coal and mineral processing tailings presents many {{environmental and economic}} challenges. Effective management solutions for these challenges require an improved understanding of colloidal forces between tailings particles which control their flocculation and subsequent dewatering. In this paper, the colloidal and dewatering behaviours of four coal processing tailings were investigated {{in the presence of}} four high molecular weight anionic polyelectrolytes using the AFM (atomic force microscope) colloid probe technique, flocculation and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>testing,</b> and colloid and surface characterisation. Averaged snap-off distances statistically determined from thousands of force curves measured by AFM were obtained by dividing the area between the force curve and the horizontal axis by the maximum adhesion force. This novel assessment of the AFM results showed that for each of the tailing samples and flocculants tested there was statistically a maximum snap-off distance, which on average would correspond to the optimum flocculant concentration. Under this optimum concentration condition the adhesive strength is the strongest to resist potential floc breakage caused by external hydrodynamic forces. Flocculation and <b>sedimentation</b> <b>tests</b> also showed optimum flocculant concentrations for the different tailings samples but these concentrations were much higher than those corresponding to the optimum adhesive strength found with the AFM measurements.

Grain quality was determined using the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) <b>sedimentation</b> <b>test,</b> a significant predictor of bread baking quality. The percent change in SDS <b>sedimentation</b> <b>test</b> scores between the heat and control populations was used to identify QTLs associated with quality stability. Four QTLs were identified, located one each on chromosomes 1 B, 1 D, 4 A, and 7 A. Three of the QTLs, those on 1 B, 1 D, and 4 A, were associated with variations in SDS sedimentation level. The QTL on chromosome 7 A was associated with the percent change in SDS sedimentation scores between heat-stressed and control conditions. This indicated a relationship between the identified QTL and quality stability. To confirm the detected QTLs, eighty advanced lines grown at three Texas nurseries were genotyped and tested for relationships between QTL-associated markers, quality traits, and stability of the quality traits. Quality trait stability was estimated using the coefficient of variability (CV%) of quality traits between growing sites. Quality characters analyzed in the advanced lines included kernel hardness, mixograph peak time, kernel weight, flour yield, SDS sedimentation, and grain yield.

The results clearly show that N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolodone, acetone, tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane are good solvents. to debundle and disperse the multi-walled carbon nanotubes. In contrast, much precipitation can be obviously observed for systems of the carbon nanotubes in water, ethanol and toluene. Additionally, Tyndall effect tests suggest that the upper dispersions of the carbon nanotubes in acetone, tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane with a concentration of 0. 1 mg/mL and the {{dispersion of}} carbon nanotubes in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolodone with a concentration of 0. 05 mg/mL are colloidal systems rather than solutions. Finally, based on the above results, a possible mechanism is briefly discussed. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company...|$|R

Sodium carbonate can act as both pH modifiers and a favorable dispersant for aluminositicates. High performance of sodium polyacrylate on flocculation for diaspore was due to that carboxyl of sodium polyacrylate interacted with active Al sets of diaspore by chemical absorption or formed hydrogen bond via hydroxyl group of macromolecule with surface Al-OH to enhance the sedimentation rate of diaspore.
