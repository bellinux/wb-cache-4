That spirit that was Paul now renders confirmation of the [...] "high spirits" [...] message that it was Christ's life of love, tolerance, and forgiveness that communicated further salvation from Darkness and the evil created from it. Salvation was declared by the Father since “Let there be Light”, so no work or suffering or belief could be considered any sort of earning one's salvation.|$|E

While the ceremonial and <b>sacrificial</b> <b>laws</b> of the Old Testament were fulfilled {{by the death of}} Jesus Christ, the 10 commandments are held to remain in force for Christian believers. The words of Jesus Christ in [...] are foundational to this conviction: ...|$|R
25|$|Rabbenu Asher’s {{best known}} work is his {{abstract}} of Talmudic law. This work specifies the final, practical halakha, leaving out the intermediate discussion and concisely stating the final decision. It omits areas of law limited to Eretz Yisrael (such as agricultural and <b>sacrificial</b> <b>laws)</b> {{as well as}} the aggadic portions of the Talmud. Asher’s son Jacob compiled a list of the decisions found in the work, under the title Piskei Ha-ROSH (decisions of the ROSH). Commentaries on his Halachot were written by a number of later Talmudists. In yeshivot, this work is studied as a regular part of the daily Talmud study.|$|R
2500|$|The 20th century Reform Rabbi Bernard Bamberger {{noted that}} while the Rabbis {{introduced}} into the synagogue a number of practices formerly associated with the Temple, they made no provision for [...] "interim” sacrifices, even though they could have found precedents for sacrifice outside Jerusalem. When the Roman Empire destroyed the Jerusalem Temple, the Rabbis did not choose to follow those precedents for sacrifice elsewhere, but instead set up a substitute, declaring {{the study of the}} <b>sacrificial</b> <b>laws</b> as acceptable to God as sacrifices. Bamberger suggested that some scholars may have felt that the day of sacrifice had passed.|$|R

5000|$|... “The Westerners had {{reverted to}} the early Seventh-day Adventist {{position}} that the law Paul here {{referred to as the}} ‘schoolmaster to bring us to Christ’ (verse 24) was the whole body of the moral law including the Ten Commandments. This position the Adventists had almost entirely abandoned during the 1860s and 1870s; the ‘schoolmaster’ was reinterpreted to mean the ceremonial and <b>sacrificial</b> <b>laws</b> of Moses which pointed forward to the Messiah. This reinterpretation had developed largely as a reaction to Protestant clergymen who interpreted Paul’s statement in Galatians 3:25 (‘we are no longer under the schoolmaster’) to mean that the Ten Commandment law had been abrogated; thus, the seventh-day Sabbath was no longer viable.” ...|$|R
50|$|In his youth, he briefly studied Talmud in Yeshiva University {{and before}} {{traveling}} to Europe to study under Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz in the Yeshiva in Kaminetz {{and then in}} Mir Yeshiva. While in Europe, he married Liba Gulevsky. Before returning to America, Rabbi Zohn developed a close student relationship with the Jewish rabbinical leader of the time, Rabbi Israel Meir Kagan. Upon returning to America {{in anticipation of the}} Holocaust, he assumed a position in Torah Vodaas (in Brooklyn as a professor of Talmud, eventually becoming one of the school's deans. Eventually, Rabbi Zohn retired from his position in Torah Vodaas to immigrate to Israel. There, Rabbi Schachne Zohn headed for forty years a study group for adult men in Jerusalem which analyzed <b>sacrificial</b> <b>laws</b> in a Talmudic contxt. He lived in the Ezrat Torah neighborhood of Jerusalem.|$|R

5000|$|Ben Azzai's {{observations}} on sacrifices (Sifre, Num. 143) are obviously directed against Gnosticism. As against {{the doctrine of}} the Gnostics, that the part of the Law containing the rules of sacrifice could have originated only with a secondary god, the demiurge, who is merely just, not beneficent, Ben Azzai maintains, that in connection with the <b>sacrificial</b> <b>laws,</b> not any one of the various names of God in Judaism is there used, but precisely the distinctive name, the Tetragrammaton, in which especially the goodness of God is emphasized, in order that the [...] "minim" [...] (disbelievers) might not have an opportunity to prove their views by the Bible. Ben Azzai's symbolic interpretation of the first word of Lamentations (איכה) is also polemical and probably directed against Pauline Christianity. He holds that in the numerical value of the four letters of this word is indicated that the Israelites did not go into exile until after they had denied the one God (א), the ten commandments (י), the law of circumcision, given to the twentieth generation after Adam (כ), and the five (ה) books of the Torah (Lam. R. i.1).|$|R

5000|$|Belief {{that the}} basic Old Testament law is not [...] "done away with" [...] and is carried over into the [...] "New Covenant" [...] such that certain commandments apply to Christians today, {{including}} the Ten Commandments and teachings such as clean and unclean meats, literal observance of Holy Day festivals such as eating unleavened bread during the 'Days of Unleavened Bread', and living in 'temporary habitations' during the 'Feast of Tabernacles'. These beliefs exclude civil and <b>sacrificial</b> temple <b>laws,</b> but includes the literal observance of the seventh-day Sabbath (from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset) and the Holy Days of the Old Testament Hebrew calendar, dietary restrictions, and the condemnation of practicing any and all sexual sin as identified by God in the Holy Scriptures.|$|R
