40|$|The project ”Design {{solution}} {{in the end}} stripper system for the Grate, to define {{the impact of the}} thermal properties” is about the design {{solution in}} the end stripping system that has been suggested to keep the clearance between the Grate conveyor and the tip of the end stripper more constant. In order to investigate the reason behind the varying clearance, the idea was to make measurements on different parameters in the system. Due to some difficulties in getting the measurement equipment in to the system without affecting the production, the measurements could not be done during the project time. For this project, much time where spent on collecting information and drawings, as well as interviewing employees at LKAB that has experience of working with the end stripping system, or in other way is familiar with the problem the system has caused. The collected information and drawings have formed the basis for a CAD model of the end stripping system, as well as a set of requirements that the new solution must meet. The design solution suggested in this work to define the impact of the thermal properties on the <b>steering</b> <b>rod</b> and thus the clearance, is an extension of the cooling duct and the heat insulation as well as a relocation of the attachment between the end stripper plate and the <b>steering</b> <b>rod.</b> The extension of the cooling duct resulted in an additional 500 millimetres of the <b>steering</b> <b>rod,</b> being cooled. After some minor changes in {{the upper part of the}} <b>steering</b> <b>rod,</b> could the heat insulation be extended by 553 millimetres. The efforts to move the attachment between the end stripping plate and the <b>steering</b> <b>rod</b> resulted in a decreased factor for the change in clearance, from 4, 2 to 2, 2. The extension of the cooling duct and the heat insulation was validated by inserting the new <b>steering</b> <b>rod</b> in the model for the system. To validate the durability of the components after the modifications, a FEM (Finite Element Method) -analyses was performed with Nastran as solver.

50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control <b>rods,</b> <b>steering</b> links, tie <b>rods,</b> or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|R
50|$|Similar gaiters {{to those}} {{described}} above find multiple uses on most vehicles. They are used {{at both ends}} of driveshafts, protecting constant-velocity joints from the ingress of dirt, and retaining the grease. They also prevent the ingress of dirt where one component slides within another, for example, on suspension struts or the ends of steering racks. Finally, they are also usually used to perform the same function on ball joints, which appear on suspension wishbones and <b>steering</b> tie <b>rod</b> ends. The gear stick gaiter is to resist dirt entering the ball joint {{at the bottom of the}} stick and to not have oil or grease from the joint exposed to passengers. They are commonly leather, faux leather, rubber or a waterproof cloth.|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{demands in}} the {{automotive}} industry {{in areas such as}} safety, driving pleasure and environmental care require new complex functionality to be implemented in cars. This evolution will to a large extent depend on the introduction of drive-by-wire systems in cars. A drive-by-wire system can replace traditional mechanical linkages, such as <b>steering</b> <b>rods,</b> with sensors, actuators, electronics, and software. Furthermore, many of these functions will be realized in distributed real-time systems with demands for high dependability and low cost. To design systems with such demands, there is a requirement for a structured design process with system focus. Important factors in such a design process are hazard analysis, design methods, and design principles. This thesis presents several approaches in the area suitable for the design of distributed drive-by-wire systems. The main contribution of this thesis is a system perspective on the design of safety critical drive-by-wire systems. Related research tends to focus on the design of components in a system and not the whole system. However, safety is a system property {{and it has to be}} considered at the system level. Therefore, safety can not be guaranteed at component level. Even if a complete design process is not presented here, several parts of a design process for these systems are included. The contribution of this work can be divided into several areas. Firstly, the development of two novel approaches for hazard analysis, one based on functionality described with a user focus and one based on actuators. These two approaches complement each other. Secondly, three different electrical system architectures are presented. The architectures represent different concepts for safety-critical drive-by-wire systems. Based on these electrical architectures, one design method for safety-critical control-by-wire architectures was developed. The method gives one electrical architecture with minimal communication and hardware given certain design requirements. As an integrated part of the design method, two design principles are presented. One principle is related to implementation and allocation of redundancy to meet dependability requirements. The second principle is related to time-triggered communication and arbitrary fault coverage. Further, the design methods and design principles have been successfully validated in three case studies...|$|R
40|$|Multiaxle {{steering}} {{is widely}} used in commercial vehicles. However, the mechanism of the self-excited shimmy produced by the multiaxle steering system is not clear until now. This study takes a dual-front axle heavy truck as sample vehicle and considers the influences of mid-shift transmission and dry friction to develop a 9 DOF dynamics model based on Lagrange’s equation. Based on the Hopf bifurcation theorem and center manifold theory, the study shows that dual-front axle shimmy is a self-excited vibration produced from Hopf bifurcation. The numerical method is adopted {{to determine how the}} size of dry friction torque influences the Hopf bifurcation characteristics of the system and to analyze the speed range of limit cycles and numerical characteristics of the shimmy system. The consistency of results of the qualitative and numerical methods shows that qualitative methods can predict the bifurcation characteristics of shimmy systems. The influences of the main system parameters on the shimmy system are also discussed. Improving the <b>steering</b> transition <b>rod</b> stiffness and dry friction torque and selecting a smaller pneumatic trail and caster angle can reduce the self-excited shimmy, reduce tire wear, and improve the driving stability of vehicles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Many {{instructions}} in a dynamically scheduled superscalar processor spend a significant {{time in the}} Instruction Window (IW) waiting to be selected even though their depen-dencies are satisfied.

In this paper, we study the “delay ” and criticality characteristics of instructions based on their readi-ness during dispatch. We observe that most ready-on-dispatch (ROD) instructions are non critical and show that 57 % of these instructions spend more than 1 cycle in the IW. We analyze the impact of (i) <b>steering</b> <b>ROD</b> instructions to slow low power func-tional units and (ii) early issue of ROD instructions, on power and performance.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{feasibility}} study of a special electric traction wheel-set for a micro-car for disabled customers. In our university department some solutions on the topic had already been developed in the past. The design has not been carried out in a sequential way, {{but it has been}} lead in “concurrent-engineering” style and it has been speeded up thanks to the employment of solid modelling. The 3 D design technology has helped in a very efficient way {{to take into account the}} impact of any modification on any component to the neighbouring items. The following topics have been considered: design for disabled customers, maximum ease of use and low cost technology. This job therefore has coped the main problems related to designing a new car. Some innovative solutions have been proposed and an overall design procedure has been experienced. This paper in particular describes the results of a research activity connected with the study of the general lay-out of such a wheel set. Some different configurations were explored, each showing its strong and weak points. It is to point out that, while the traditional arrangements connected with gasoline or diesel engines were hugely studied, with the electric traction all the wheel sets must be reshaped. In fact too many car designers tend to use the same lay-out used before, wasting much of the potential advantages offered by electric motors. During this study some radically new designs were explored, for example not using any live axle for transmission or trying to use thrust ball bearing for steering axles. In the following a gallery of proposed and studied solutions will be exposed, showing the most characteristic points. We developed the study and design phases starting from some specifications: the group must be composed by electric motor (geared or not), brake, wheel hub, front or rear traction, in case of front traction the group must have steering pivots (attachments for <b>steering</b> <b>rods).</b> This apparatus has been designed to be used in a light car (which is under development in our faculty). However the proposed design may fit even standard city cars. Design goals were: 1) Keeping very low steering radius (intended use in city environment) 2) Absence of traditional suspension system (our light car has some innovative design in this) 3) Respect of Ackermann geometry. Some different design solution have been developed and are exposed in the paper. The most relevant feature is that every wheel has its own motor, so achieving a dramatic reduction in encumbrance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The uses of Acoustic Emission (AE) {{in process}} monitoring, {{particularly}} in the automotive sector, are little known but very varied (welding, straightening, drawing, machining, etc.) The most common use {{is no doubt in}} the straightening of gear box and <b>steering</b> rack <b>rods.</b> Tears or cracks may occur when tubes are formed or deep drawn. AE can be used to detect the point in the process where the crack occurs (in the case of multiple step processes or multi-station presses). Once this crucial point has been identified, it is then possible to adapt the production process or the metallurgy in order to prevent this damage from occurring. A press has been instrumented {{in order to be able}} to continuously control the production process. The first step when defining the feasibility of a process is performed using a multi-purpose AE system such as those used in research laboratories. Once the process has been clearly identified and the process noise has been characterized, a simplified control system is then defined and put in place on the production lines. Today, the mill decided to first study the localization of the weld seam before implemented the AE process monitoring.
