500|$|While many of {{the changes}} were down to the {{logistics}} of filming in Venice, some were for creative reasons, the most prominent being {{the inclusion of the}} famous love scene. [...] The scene was in fact an unscripted last minute improvisation by Roeg, who felt that without it there would be too many scenes of the couple arguing. The scene set in the church where Laura lights a candle for Christine was mostly improvised too. Originally intended to show the gulf between John's and Laura's mental states—John's denial and Laura's inability to let go—the script included two pages of dialogue to illustrate John's unease at Laura's marked display of grief. After a break in filming to allow the crew to set up the equipment, Donald Sutherland returned to the set and commented that he did not like the church, to which Julie Christie retorted that he was being [...] "silly", and the church was [...] "beautiful". Roeg felt that the exchange was more true to life {{in terms of what the}} characters would actually <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and that the scripted version was [...] "overwritten", so opted to ditch the scripted dialogue and included the real-life exchange instead.|$|E
500|$|The Incredible Melting Man {{was written}} and {{directed}} by filmmaker William Sachs. The idea for the film came to him when his mother, working in the office of a spray paint company, showed him [...] "gooey stuff" [...] which was used as a basis for spray paint and jokingly suggested that he should do a film featuring that material. During writing, Sachs was influenced by The Night of the Living Dead and wanted to give the film a 1950s horror film feeling. But the final film, with its structure changed by the producers in post-production, has been described by some sources – including the film magazine Cinefantastique and the 1995 book Cult Science Fiction Films – as a remake of First Man into Space (1959), another film about an astronaut who becomes a monster after an accident in space. Science fiction film historian Gene Wright suggested that the final film was heavily influenced by The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), a British horror film about an astronaut who begins mutating into an alien organism after a spaceflight. Sachs, however, had never seen either of those films, and his original screenplay had a very different structure. He had originally written the script for The Incredible Melting Man as a parody of horror films. According to Michael Adams, a film reviewer who interviewed Sachs, this was the reason that the film mixed horror with comedic moments, such as when Steve West's detached ear gets stuck on a tree, and when a janitor sweeps West's melted body into a garbage can {{at the end of the}} film. Adams claims that this explains several comedic lines of dialogue otherwise inconsistent with the rest of the film, including one moment when homeless men notice the melting West and <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> [...] "You think we've got trouble, look at that dude". In Sachs' original version, the film opened with the wide-angle shot of the nurse running through the hallway; this would not have been in slow motion, unlike the final film, where the producers played it back slowed down. Only later would viewers have gradually learned the background of the melting man. All the scenes showing the astronauts in space and the lead character in the hospital were re-shot during post-production without influence by the director, and Sachs criticized both the acting in those scenes and how they restructure the film. There are logical problems in the final film due to the re-shot scenes; it is never fully explained how West's spacecraft returned to Earth from Saturn when West himself was so seriously injured and the other two members of his crew were both killed.|$|E
2500|$|Kate Winslet sent {{producer}} Scott Rudin {{the script}} {{and he told her}} that her then husband, director Sam Mendes, would be perfect to direct it. She gave Mendes Yates' novel and told him, [...] "I really want to play this part". He read Haythe's script and then the book in quick succession. Haythe's first draft was very faithful to the novel, using large parts of Yates' own language, but Mendes told him to find ways to externalize what Frank and April do not <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... (2007) Experts {{studied the}} {{protective}} properties of full face masks. The measurements {{showed that the}} workers were adequately protected. The duration of the measurements was 1–3 hours. In these circumstances, of the 52 measurements, in 2 cases, the workers had removed the mask (because they had something to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other)</b> - and these results were not {{taken into account in}} the analysis. However, use of respirators intermittently drastically reduces their efficiency. This shows how important to correctly organize the use of respirators, and to provide workers with the intercom stations (if necessary).|$|E
2500|$|Hopper's Room in New York (1932) and Cape Cod Evening (1939) {{are prime}} {{examples}} of his [...] "couple" [...] paintings. In the first, {{a young couple}} appear alienated and uncommunicative—he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes {{on the role of}} a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with Excursion into Philosophy [...] (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly {{on the edge of a}} bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, [...] "he open book is Plato, reread too late".|$|E
2500|$|Goforth then {{traveled}} {{to hold a}} series of meetings at the Liaoyang congregation. [...] "The revival at Liaoyang {{was the beginning of a}} movement which spread throughout the whole surrounding country. Bands of revived Christians went here and there preaching the Gospel with telling effect. At one out-station there was a Christian who had a notoriously bad son. During the meetings that were held by one of the revival bands at his village, the young man quite broken up, confessed his sins and came out strongly for Christ. His conversion produced a remarkable effect upon the whole village. Heathen would <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> on the streets: [...] "The Christian's God has come. Why, He has even entered that bad fellow, and driven all the badness out of him. And now he's just like other Christians. So, if you don't want to go the same way you had better keep away from that crowd." [...] " ...|$|E
60|$|It was, indeed, very late, {{but behind}} the {{partially}} closed shutters of a lower room of the house sat old Mrs Keswick, gazing at the light that was streaming {{from the window of}} the office, and wondering what those two men were <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> that was keeping them sitting up together until after midnight.|$|R

60|$|While {{those words}} were passing between the brothers, my {{attention}} remained fixed on Lucilla. Her head had turned slowly towards the new position which Nugent occupied {{when he spoke}} to Oscar. With this exception, no other movement had escaped her. No sense of what the two men were <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> seemed <b>to</b> have entered her mind. To all appearance she had heard nothing, since Nugent had started the first doubt in her whether she was blind for life.|$|R

60|$|When he {{discovered}} that I was looking at him, he entreated me by a gesture not to betray his presence. He had evidently heard what we had been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> before I detected him--for he touched his eyes, and lifted his hands pityingly in allusion to Lucilla's blindness. Whatever his mood might be, that melancholy discovery must surely have affected him--Lucilla's influence over him now, could only be an influence for good. I signed to him to remain--and told Lucilla {{that there was nothing}} to be alarmed about. She went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well?" [...] said she, as {{she came}} up the steps.
