50|$|Headgear mounted mirrors {{were first}} {{developed}} in the early 1970s as a bicycle <b>safety</b> <b>accessory</b> by a dentist, Dr. Jack Greenlaw. His idea of using small, round dental mirrors to be mounted on headgear as safety devices was quickly accepted. Demand for the mirror outpaced his ability to manufacture them by hand resulting in outsourcing the manufacturing to that of injection molded plastic (3). Several other brands followed, initially designed for the bicycle industry then later as an industrial and tactical device. The success of mirrors mounted on bicycle helmets continued for decades, finally being adopted by construction and industrial workers as a safety device, on helmets of snowmobilers (3), and in tactical environments like Airsoft and SWAT applications adding a similar level of safety as mirrors on vehicles.|$|E

40|$|LNG is the {{abbreviation}} for liquefied natural gas, which {{is recognized as}} one of the world’s clean energies. LNG is one product at natural gas that through purification and ultra-low temperature is liquefied. The liquefied natural gas is very suitable for LNG transportation by a truck. China is a big country rich in natural resources. The use of natural gas is in favor of Chinese energy structure adjustment. It has important strategic significance to improve the ecological environment and the quality of people’s lives. A LNG carrier vehicle is a cryogenic liquid tanker truck used to transport liquefied natural gas in an ultra-low temperature environment. Because LNG is flammable, explosive, and cryogenic and so on, it is very important the safety design of LNG carrier vehicle demanded in the road transport safety. LNG carrier vehicles usually consist of LNG cryogenic liquid storage tanks, trailer running gears, piping systems, a control box and other components. Among them prone to accidents are mainly LNG cryogenic liquid storage tanks and <b>safety</b> <b>accessories.</b> This paper dealt with the safety design research to these two systems. The main tasks included the following...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess current MRI safety {{practices}} among MRI facilities in Ghana, and their compliance with the 2013 American College of Radiology (ACR) guidance document on MR safe practices. Material and methods: A questionnaire developed from the 2013 ACR Guidance Document was used to collect information on magnetic field strengths, MR safety policy and compliance, patient screening, emergency preparedness, infection control, MRI <b>safety</b> <b>accessories,</b> equipment <b>safety,</b> signage and barriers, report of adverse incidents, and access and communication. Results: Out of the 13 MRI facilities identified, response rate of 92 % was obtained. Six (50 %) facilities indicated they have MRI safety policy and have it present and readily available to facility staff. Five (42 %) facilities indicated they have handheld magnets, and 1 (8 %) has ferromagnetic detection system. Only one (8 %) had crash carts. Seven (58 %) facilities have zone 4 clearly marked with a red light and lighted sign stating “The Magnet is On”. One (8 %) recorded projectile incident and fire outbreak. Eight (67 %) facilities have direct visual observation of access corridors to zone IV. Conclusion: There was compliance in some areas of MRI safety practice, however there were some shortfalls which need to be addressed. We therefore recommend improvement in the following areas: (1) establishment, implementation, and maintenance of current MRI safety policy, (2) patient screening, (3) provision of training and routine drills on emergency response protocols with documentations, (4) emergency preparedness, and (5) provision of colour codes for equipment used within MRI environment...|$|R
40|$|This report {{covers the}} design and {{construction}} of the recumbent racing tricycle for Mr. Robert T. Kelly, a disabled veteran. Unfortunately Rob’s right leg is five inches shorter than his left one and therefore is unable to properly operate standard cranks. Our team HandiTrike is composed of Sean Higginson, Kevin Howie, and Vinay Patel and our project requires us {{to come up with}} a design that is feasible to complete within the given three quarters, as well as allow Rob to gain full use of his tricycle. Currently Rob ‘s trike uses the standard crank set up found on most bicycles and tricycles today, but to overcome the five-inch difference a previous group attempted to solve this problem by adding an extension member to the right crank. The overall thought was that this rotating member would allow Rob to potentially gain full use of the crank system. However, there were several flaws in their design due to lack of communication between the group and sponsor. Throughout this report you will find our various conceptual solutions to our problem, as well as our overall final design to solving this problem. Along with solving the crank issue, HandiTrike has been asked to also construct a completely new trike for Rob Kelly. Currently Rob is not satisfied with the performance he receives from his current GreenSpeed tricycle. Therefore, our group has been asked to solve the crank issue, as well as, design a rear suspension system, improve seat conditions, and include a collapsibility feature to allow for easier transportation in a vehicle. Along with these requested features, HandiTrike will also be including standard <b>safety</b> <b>accessories,</b> such as, lights, reflectors, and flags. As you will read later in the report, there are no clear leaders in developing components for disabled riders. Therefore most of our problem solving will be based off of completely new and innovative ideas that will hopefully help benefit Rob and future riders as well. We believe that the solutions we come up with by the end of the report will fully satisfy Rob’s needs out of a tricycle, thus allowing him once again to get back on the road and enjoy those long rides...|$|R

Work in a command is important for many reasons: it promotes optimization the structure of business-processes and the business-activity of the company, provides distribution, preservation and augmentation {{of knowledge and skills}} among the personnel for maintenance of more effective work. Besides command work allows to provide satisfaction of such human needs, as <b>safety,</b> an <b>accessory</b> to group, a recognition (respect), influence, self-realization, achievement of the purpose, etc. Despite of relative investigation the themes of formation of commands and the organizations of effective command work, in the theory and practice of management remain the questions connected with sex-age, professional, psychological differentiation of participants of commands, branch specificity of the companies, models of management, etc. In the lead research undertake attempt to reveal some features of command-role behaviour of the managers, caused by gender and professional differentiation of employees on an example international and the Russian companies. ...|$|R
