5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a <b>saucepan,</b> flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Saucepans</b> (or just [...] "pots") are vessels with {{vertical}} sides {{about the}} same height as their diameter, used for simmering or boiling. <b>Saucepans</b> generally have one long handle. Larger pots of the same shape generally have two handles close {{to the sides of}} the pot (so they can be lifted with both hands), and are called sauce-pots or soup pots (3-12 litres). <b>Saucepans</b> and saucepots are measured by volume (usually 1-8 l). While saucepots often resemble Dutch ovens in shape, {{they do not have the}} same heat capacity characteristics. Very small <b>saucepans</b> used for heating milk are referred to as , such <b>saucepans</b> usually have a lip for pouring the heated milk.|$|R

25|$|Ironically, the <b>saucepan</b> is not {{the ideal}} vessel to use for making sauces. It is more {{efficient}} to use saucepans with sloping sides, called Windsor pans, or saucepans with rounded sides, called sauciers. These provide quicker evaporation than straight sided pans, and {{make it easier to}} stir a sauce while reducing.|$|E
25|$|Whale {{meat and}} blubber are Faroese delicacies. Well into the 20th century, meat and blubber {{from the pilot}} whale was used to feed people {{for long periods of}} time. Everybody got a share, as is the custom to this day. The meat and blubber can be stored and {{prepared}} in a variety of ways, in Faroese it is called Tvøst og spik. When fresh, the meat is boiled or served as steaks. A pilot whale steak is called in Faroese: grindabúffur. Whale meat with blubber and potatoes in their skins are put into a <b>saucepan</b> with salt and then boiled for an hour or so. Slivers of the blubber are also a popular accompaniment to dried fish.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, newer {{materials}} were superseding Bakelite in many areas. Phenolics are less frequently used in general consumer products today {{due to their}} cost and complexity of production and their brittle nature. They still appear in some applications where their specific properties are required, such as small precision-shaped components, molded disc brake cylinders, <b>saucepan</b> handles, electrical plugs, switches and parts for electrical irons, {{as well as in}} the area of inexpensive board and tabletop games produced in China, Hong Kong and India. Items such as billiard balls, dominoes and pieces for board games like chess, checkers, and backgammon are constructed of Bakelite for its look, durability, fine polish, weight, and sound. Common dice are sometimes made of Bakelite for weight and sound, but the majority are made of a thermoplastic polymer such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS).|$|E

The Enchanted Wood, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child. According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from [...] "thinking up a story one day and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the <b>Saucepan</b> Man {{and the rest of the}} characters. She had all she needed."

2500|$|Many of the characters, props, {{and ideas}} in the novel were drawn from Baum's experiences. As a child, Baum {{frequently}} had nightmares of a scarecrow pursuing him across a field. Moments before the scarecrow's [...] "ragged hay fingers" [...] nearly gripped his neck, it would fall apart before his eyes. Decades later, as an adult, Baum integrated his tormentor into the novel as the Scarecrow. According to his son Harry, the Tin Woodman was born from Baum's attraction to window displays. He wished to make something captivating for the window displays, so he used an eclectic assortment of scraps to craft a striking figure. From a washboiler he made a body, from bolted stovepipes he made arms and legs, and {{from the bottom of}} a <b>saucepan</b> he made a face. Baum then placed a funnel hat on the figure, which ultimately became the Tin Woodman. John D. Rockefeller was the nemesis of Baum's father, an oil baron who declined to purchase Standard Oil shares in exchange for selling his own oil refinery. Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz posited that Rockefeller inspired one of the Wizard's numerous faces. In one scene in the novel, the Wizard is seen as a [...] "tyrannical, hairless head". When Rockefeller was 54 years old, the medical condition alopecia caused him to lose every strand of hair on his head, making people fearful of speaking to him.|$|E
