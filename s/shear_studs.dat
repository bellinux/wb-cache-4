A three-dimensional finite element model was developed using general purpose finite element program ABAQUS to study the behaviour of through-deck welded <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> in the composite slabs with trapezoidal deck ribs oriented perpendicular to the beam. Both static and dynamic procedures were investigated using Drucker Prager model and Concrete Damaged Plasticity model respectively.

A total of 240 push tests were analysed with different sheeting thicknesses, positions of the <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> in the trough, concrete strengths and transverse spacings. The {{results showed that the}} sheeting thickness influenced the shear connector resistance of studs placed in the unfavourable position more than studs placed in favourable and central positions. The strength of the shear connector placed in the unfavourable position increased by as much as 30 % when the sheeting thickness was increased. The shear connector resistance of the unfavourable stud was found to be primarily a function of the strength and the thickness of the profiled sheeting rather than the concrete strength. The strength prediction equations for unfavourable and central studs were also proposed. The results suggested that the strength of the shear connector increased as the distance of the <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> increased from the mid-height of the deck rib in the load bearing direction of the stud. The load¿slip behaviour of the studs in the unfavourable position was more ductile than the studs in the favourable position, with slip of 2 - 4 times higher. It was found that the increase in sheeting thickness and transverse spacing improved the ductility of the stud in unfavourable position, but had no effect on the stud in the favourable position. The failure modes suggested that the favourable and central studs failed by concrete cone failure and unfavourable studs failed by rib punching together with crushing of the narrow strip of the concrete in front of the stud...|$|R

A solid counterbalance abutment on the back span end was built to compensate the corresponding scope of works performed imbalance in dead load.

40|$|Shear {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} used in steel bridges to join the concrete deck and steel superstructure, providing a mechanism for shear transfer across the steel-concrete interface. The most common shear connector is the headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud.</b> In the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications on composite design, <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> fatigue often governs over static strength, {{and a large number}} of shear connectors often result. This dissertation investigates headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> fatigue capacities and demands, and provides insight into conservancies in existing design specifications through examination of existing high-traffic bridge performance. To investigate stud capacity, a total of six high-cycle fatigue tests are conducted on stud pushout specimens at low stress ranges and combined with existing experimental data to develop probabilistic S-N fatigue capacity curves. Results from composite push-out specimens tested at stress ranges between 4. 4 and 8. 7 ksi suggest a fatigue limit of 6. 5 ksi, which is near the existing limit of 7 ksi. Recommendations for modification of the existing AASHTO finite-life <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> S-N fatigue capacity curve are proposed. In addition to experimental testing, a finite element parametric study considers the effects of stud pitch, girder depth, and girder span on shear flow demands. Results from the parametric study indicate that the <b>shear</b> forces within <b>stud</b> clusters are not captured by current AASHTO shear flow demand estimations. A new design method and updated formulation for predicting stud demands are presented. To examine high-traffic bridge performance, residual fatigue life is investigated by further fatigue testing, as well as magnetic particle inspection and dye penetrant testing on two existing bridges. The lack of discovered fatigue cracks within the studs of the bridges investigated suggests that the shear stress range estimation in AASHTO specification is higher than what is actually experienced. This discrepancy is likely due to shear transfer through adhesion and friction, which are not considered in AASHTO design calculations. Fatigue tests from sections of the decommissioned bridge exceeded the design life expectancy of approximately 850, 000 cycles (at 11. 6 ksi) by over 2, 500, 000 cycles.

This study presents experimental investigation for strengthening RC slabs under impact loads using shear reinforcement. Slabs were strengthened against punching shear with two methods: using <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> as shear reinforcement and using steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) instead of plain concrete. Eight RC slabs with dimensions of 2150 x 2150 x 150 mm were tested. Four of the specimens, two identical pairs, were cast with <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> around the point of impact. Remaining four specimens, again two identical pairs, were cast with 1 % steel fibers. Pairs in each group contained two different levels of longitudinal reinforcement.

Specimens were tested with a test setup that provides simply supported conditions. Support loads, displacements, accelerations, and strains on bars were measured during the tests. The study revealed that using <b>shear</b> <b>studs</b> and SFRC prevents brittle punching shear failure for both static and impact loading.

40|$|Extensive {{research}} {{dating back}} to 1965 has been conducted on the fatigue performance of headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> connectors in steel and cast-in-place composite girders. However, {{little research has been}} conducted specifically on the fatigue performance of headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> connectors clustered into pockets. It seems that design provisions for pocketed shear connectors have been established assuming their performance is no different than that of continuous connectors, based on limited tests, terminated before failure, primarily on direct shear specimens that do not precisely model the loading that a shear connector is subjected to in a bridge girder. This research study investigates the fatigue behaviour of continuous and grouped <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> connectors for cast-in-place and precast deck applications, respectively. A total of six cast-in-place and six precast composite beams have been fabricated, instrumented, fatigued to failure, and monitored in order to generate new, valuable fatigue data. This data will improve the understanding of the fatigue behaviour of headed studs in composite beam specimens subjected to static and variable amplitude loading. An autopsy program is implemented to further investigate the fatigue cracking behaviour of the shear connectors. The findings provide clear evidence that studs in precast application perform differently compared to cast-in-place as different fatigue cracking patterns were observed. Two non-linear finite element models have also been assembled in ABAQUS and compared to the results collected from the physical experiments. Additionally, a concrete shrinkage simulation is completed on the cast-in-place model to investigate its effect on the fatigue cracking behaviour. The results from this simulation are found to agree with the observed cracking patterns. S-N regression analyses are completed to determine the mean regression curve corresponding to a 50 % survival probability. In this analysis, the stress ranges assigned to the studs were determined utilizing three methods that introduced three levels of conservatism.

The findings in this study propose that the cast-in-place and precast specimens have a greater conformity with a fatigue resistance curve defined by a Category D and Category C detail, respectively.

The models are able to predict the headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> capacity, the load-slip characteristic of the shear connection and modes of failure. The results obtained show good agreement with specified data from Codes of practice and results of available numerical and experimental literature. Parametric {{studies were carried out}} using both models to investigate the effects of the change in different parameters on the behaviour of shear connections. Full-scale push-off tests with solid and precast hollow core slabs have been carried out to verify the finite element models. The shear connection capacity, load-slip curves and modes of failure were detected from experimental investigation. Both numerical and experimental results were compared and good agreement has been achieved. The comparison has shown that the model is able to predict accurately the behaviour of headed studs in composite girders with both types of slabs. The non-linear load-slip characteristics of the headed <b>shear</b> <b>stud</b> connector obtained from FE models of push-off tests were used in modelling the structural behaviour of composite steel-solid slab concrete and steel-precast hollow core slab girders. A finite element model has been developed for the analysis of each type. The models took into account the non-linear behaviour of concrete slab, steel beam and shear connectors. The accuracy and efficiency of the models have been demonstrated by comparing finite element results with available published experimental and numerical research. An effective parametric study for the evaluation of the effective width for steel-precast concrete slab composite girders is presented. ...|$|R
