40|$|SummaryAlthough {{very late}} <b>stent</b> {{thrombosis}} after drug-eluting <b>stent</b> implantation {{is a critical}} event, its cause has not been clarified. This is the first report of a case with very late <b>stent</b> thrombosis after drug-eluting <b>stent</b> implantation for which prior angioscopic image of the culprit lesion is available. A 54 -year-old Japanese male patient with stable angina who received implantation of sirolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> at the culprit lesion and 1 -year follow-up angiographic and angioscopic examinations came back with chest pain at rest at 2. 5 years after the <b>stent</b> implantation. Very late <b>stent</b> thrombosis was diagnosed by emergent angiographic and angioscopic examinations and was treated by zotarolimus-eluting <b>stent.</b> One-year angiographic and angioscopic follow-up examinations after zotarolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> were performed. Angioscopy revealed uncovered <b>stent</b> strut, yellow plaques, and thrombus at 1 -year follow-up after sirolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> implantation, and it confirmed the thrombotic occlusion inside the sirolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> {{at the time of}} emergent catheterization. This is a case of very late <b>stent</b> thrombosis in the drug-eluting <b>stent</b> where uncovered <b>stent</b> strut, yellow plaques, and thrombus had been detected by angioscopy 1. 5 years before the onset.

5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic <b>stents</b> are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal <b>stents</b> with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCoronary <b>stent</b> {{fracture}} is {{an often}} unrecognized cause of target vessel failure, however, {{it has been}} reported more frequently in the drug-eluting <b>stent</b> era. Clinical presentation of <b>stent</b> fracture may range from benign in-stent restenosis to potentially fatal acute <b>stent</b> thrombosis. Interventional treatment of <b>stent</b> thrombosis can be carried out by high pressure balloon dilatation or second <b>stent</b> implantation into the <b>stented</b> segment after thrombus aspiration. Intravascular ultrasound is mandatory in order to exclude mechanical problems in the background of the <b>stent</b> thrombosis and to achieve good final <b>stent</b> apposition and expansion. We report on a <b>stent</b> fracture induced <b>stent</b> thrombosis occurring in a highly calcified proximal right coronary artery. (Treated previously with rotational atherectomy in the middle part, but not in the aortoostial location.)

40|$|Balloon {{angioplasty}} of ostial left anterior descending {{coronary artery}} (LAD) lesions {{has been associated}} with a high rate of acute complications and late restenosis. Recently, coronary <b>stenting</b> has been proposed as an effective treatment modality for ostial LAD lesions. To evaluate the effects of <b>stent</b> design on the development of late restenosis, we retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of slotted-tube <b>stent</b> implantation (40 patients, Palmaz-Schatz <b>stent)</b> and coil <b>stent</b> implantation (15 patients, tantalum Cordis <b>stent)</b> of ostial LAD stenosis. Six-month angiographic follow-up data were obtained in 31 patients (82 %) with slotted-tube <b>stent</b> implantation and 12 patients (86 %) with coil <b>stent</b> implantation. Angiographic restenosis was defined as > or = 50 % diameter stenosis. The angiographic restenosis rate was significantly lower in slotted-tube <b>stent</b> implantation (32 %) than in coil <b>stent</b> implantation (67 %) (p< 0. 05). Target lesion revascularization rate of slotted tube <b>stent</b> implantation was significantly lower (26 %) than that of coil <b>stent</b> implantation (57 %) (p< 0. 05). Coil <b>stent</b> implantation of ostial left anterior descending artery lesions was associated with higher late restenosis compared with slotted tube <b>stent</b> implantation. In conclusion, slotted-tube <b>stent</b> implantation might be considered to improve late clinical outcomes of ostial LAD lesions...|$|R

5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place <b>stents</b> or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} of the drug-eluting <b>stent</b> (DES) has brought about revolutionary changes {{in the field of}} interventional cardiology. In the DES era, in-stent restenosis has declined but new issues such as <b>stent</b> thrombosis have emerged. One of the emerging paradigms in the DES era is <b>stent</b> fracture.

25|$|Although {{drug-eluting}} <b>stents</b> {{continue to}} represent a major medical advance for angioplasty, evidence has always shown new clot thrombosis formation with <b>stents</b> to be a problem, thus clotting suppressant agents are routinely given during placement, and anticlotting agents should be continued; the question is for how long.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{randomized}} trials have showed {{the superiority of}} Paclitaxel-eluting <b>stent</b> over bare metal <b>stent</b> in angiographic and clinical outcomes. Coroflex Pleaseâ„¢ <b>stent</b> is a newly developed drug eluting <b>stent</b> using the Coroflexâ„¢ <b>stent</b> platform combined with the drug paclitaxel contained in a polymer coating. PECOPS I trial, one-arm observational study, showed that the clinical and angiographic outcomes of Coroflex Pleaseâ„¢ <b>stent</b> were {{within the range of}} those of Taxus, the 1 st generation paclitaxel-eluting <b>stent</b> (PES). However, there have been no studies directly comparing the Coroflex Pleaseâ„¢ <b>stent</b> with the Taxus Liberteâ„¢ <b>stent</b> that is the newest version of Taxus. Therefore, prospective, randomized trial is required to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Coroflex Pleaseâ„¢ <b>stent</b> compared with Taxus Liberteâ„¢ <b>stent</b> in a head-to-head manner. Methods In the comparison of Efficacy between COroflex PLEASeâ„¢ ANd Taxusâ„¢ stent(ECO-PLEASANT) trial, approximately 900 patients are being prospectively and randomly assigned to the either type of Coroflex Pleaseâ„¢ <b>stent</b> and Taxus Liberteâ„¢ <b>stent</b> via web-based randomization. The primary endpoint is clinically driven target vessel revascularization at 9 months.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Stent</b> underexpansion is {{the most}} {{powerful}} predictor of long-term <b>stent</b> patency and clinical outcome. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the incidence and predictors of <b>stent</b> underexpansion despite adjunctive post-dilatation with non-compliant balloon. METHODS: After elective coronary <b>stent</b> implantation and adjunctive post-dilatation with noncompliant balloon and optimal angiographic result confirmed by the operator, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed for all the treated lesions. If the treated lesions fulfilled the IVUS criteria, they are considered as the optimal <b>stent</b> group; if not, they are considered as the suboptimal group. RESULTS: From 50 patients enrolled in this study 39 (78) had optimal <b>stent</b> deployment and 11 (22) had suboptimal <b>stent</b> deployment. In the suboptimal group 7 (14) had underexpansion, 2 (4) malposition, and 2 (4) had asymmetry. There were no <b>stent</b> edge dissections detected by IVUS. We did not find any correlation between lesion calcification, ostial lesions, <b>stent</b> length, and <b>stent</b> underexpansion. <b>Stent</b> diameter Ã¢ï¿½Â¤ 2. 75 mm had a strong correlation with <b>stent</b> underexpansion. CONCLUSION: Despite adjunctive post-dilatation with noncompliant balloon, using a relatively small <b>stent</b> diameter was a strong predictor for underexpansion.

Methods and results We randomly assigned 193 patients with lesions carrying a high risk of restenosis to have the Genous <b>stent</b> or the Taxus <b>stent</b> implanted. Lesions were considered high risk of restenosis if one of the following applied: chronic total occlusion, lesion length > 23 mm, vessel diameter < 2. 8 mm, or any lesion in a diabetic patient. At 1 -year, the rate of the primary end point, target vessel failure (TVF), was 17. 3 % in the Genous <b>stent</b> group when compared with 10. 5 % in the Taxus <b>stent</b> group [risk difference (RD) 6. 8 %, 95 % CI - 3. 1 to 16. 7 %], a difference predominantly due to a higher incidence of repeat revascularization in patients treated with the Genous <b>stent.</b> In contrast, no <b>stent</b> thrombosis was observed in the Genous <b>stent</b> group compared to 4 <b>stent</b> thromboses in the Taxus <b>stent</b> group (RD - 4. 2 %; 95 % CI - 10. 3 to 0. 3 %).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAcute <b>stent</b> recoil {{has been}} often {{observed}} following <b>stent</b> delivery balloon deflation in coronary arteries and the recoil rate varies by <b>stent</b> design. Accordingly, {{the purpose of}} the present study was to evaluate the impact of <b>stent</b> designs on acute <b>stent</b> recoil after new generation drug-eluting <b>stent</b> implantation. Methods and resultsA total of 154 lesions [56 treated with biolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> (BES), 46 with cobalt chromium everolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> (CoCr-EES), and 52 with platinum chromium everolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> (PtCr-EES) ] were evaluated. Quantitative coronary angiography was used to measure the minimal lumen diameter (MLD). MLD 1 was defined as a MLD of complete expansion of the last <b>stent</b> delivery balloon at the highest pressure. MLD 2 was defined as a MLD immediately after the last <b>stent</b> delivery balloon deflation. Acute <b>stent</b> recoil was determined by the calculation as (MLD 1 âˆ’MLD 2) /MLD 1. Acute <b>stent</b> recoil was significantly higher in the CoCr-EES group versus the BES group and PtCr-EES group (10. 1 Â± 6. 9 %, 6. 7 Â± 5. 5 %, and 6. 5 Â± 4. 8 %, respectively, p= 0. 01). Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that the use of CoCr-EES and the number of <b>stent</b> delivery balloon inflations were independent predictors of acute <b>stent</b> recoil (r= 0. 26, Î²= 0. 21, p= 0. 01 and r=âˆ’ 0. 51, Î²=âˆ’ 0. 58, p< 0. 01, respectively).

30|$|<b>Stent</b> {{placement}} for an occluded artery was routinely performed after EVAR in {{the present}} cases. Previous studies suggested that primary <b>stenting</b> produced a better patency rate when compared with balloon angioplasty with provisional <b>stenting</b> when used for iliac artery occlusion (Ichihashi et al. 2011). <b>Stent</b> placement in the iliac artery prior to EVAR may interfere {{the passage of the}} sheath or touch-up balloon. Lam et al. (2008) described a case of migrated self-expanding <b>stent</b> after endograft passage. Whether complications during the stentgraft delivery, such as <b>stent</b> migration or <b>stent</b> collapse occur or not depends on the degree of the expansion of the <b>stent</b> itself. If the <b>stent</b> expands insufficiently due to the arterial recoil or calcification, the risk of complications could become higher. Except when using the technique of internal endoconduit, we believe the <b>stent</b> placement should be performed after EVAR to lower the complication risk.|$|R
