40|$|<b>Services</b> <b>of</b> general interest, such as {{telecommunications}} services, postal services, and {{the supply}} of electricity and gas have received much attention over the last decade. Welfare-oriented public service models have come {{under the pressure of}} market-oriented approaches. Whilst access to <b>services</b> <b>of</b> general interest is frequently regarded as an important element of citizenship in the EC, recent consumer law programmes have placed them into the context of consumer law. This article discusses the implications that a consumer law approach could have on <b>services</b> <b>of</b> general interest. It concludes that consumer law cannot deal with <b>services</b> <b>of</b> general interest in a comprehensive manner but that their citizenship dimension requires special instruments that safeguard access to <b>services</b> <b>of</b> general interest where market failure is predictable.
