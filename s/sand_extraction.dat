Before the invention of modern dredging techniques the sediment deposited by flooding created hazards to ships navigating the river. Even medium-sized vessels no longer travel up the Brisbane River beyond the city reach, and dredging of the upper reaches has ceased, allowing the river to recover substantially from the fine silt dislodged by gravel and <b>sand</b> <b>extraction.</b>|$|E

25|$|Jacob Owen Absher: In the mid-1920s, a {{remarkable}} and persistent experimenter named Jacob Owen Absher incorporated the Bituminous <b>Sand</b> <b>Extraction</b> Company. In 1926, Absher received a Canadian patent for his in situ experiments, and he carried on numerous experiments {{over the following}} five years - efforts that drew the interest of oil sands pioneers Sidney Ells and Karl Clark. Absher not only used steam to melt the bitumen, but also tried igniting fires within his wells. In the end, however, {{he was unable to}} produce oil from the oil sands. His activities ended as the Great Depression raged.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s Great Canadian Oil Sands, Ltd., a small, {{indigenous}} Canadian firm, {{relied on}} {{new technology and}} heavy capital investment to pioneer oil <b>sand</b> <b>extraction</b> in the Athabascan region. Unfavorable leasing terms from the provincial government and the strong financial risk inherent in the project forced the firm to seek an investment partner. The large American oil company Sun Oil Company took the risk, but as the investment burden on Sun increased, the company became compelled to assume both financial and managerial control of the operation. Thus, the native Canadian firm had to yield its autonomy {{as the price of}} pursuing a pioneering but complicated industrial project. In 1995 Sun sold its interest to Suncor Energy, based in Calgary. Suncor is second to Syncrude in the oil sands, but Syncrude is controlled by a consortium of international oil companies.|$|E

2500|$|In 1965 {{the driver}} of a {{mechanical}} digger spotted a shiny object in a newly exposed face. It {{turned out to be}} an early Bronze Age Cinerary Urn. The field between the village and the M1 on the north side of Collingtree Road is an area designated by Northamptonshire County Council for <b>sand</b> <b>extraction.</b> The sand is stated by the county council to be of the 'soft sand' type suitable for mortar. The site is in Milton Malsor parish and only ca.200m from houses in the village. It was originally called the [...] "Collingtree site" [...] but the county council finally referred to it as the Milton site in late 2008. It has so far not been developed probably due to its triangular shape and stranded location between the motorway along one edge, the railway line another and a road unsuited to heavy lorries on the third. The site is included in the county council's mineral's and waste plan, the subject of a Public Inquiry in 2009. A third Public Inquiry in 2010 retained the site.|$|E
2500|$|Oil sands {{extraction}} {{can affect}} the land when the bitumen is initially mined, water resources by its requirement for large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due {{to the release of}} carbon dioxide and other emissions. [...] Heavy metals such as vanadium, nickel, lead, cobalt, mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc are naturally present in oil sands and may be concentrated by the extraction process. [...] The environmental impact caused by oil <b>sand</b> <b>extraction</b> is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, Pembina Institute, 350.org, MoveOn.org, League of Conservation Voters, Patagonia, Sierra Club, and Energy Action Coalition. In particular, mercury contamination has been found around oil sands production in Alberta, Canada. The European Union has indicated that it may vote to label oil sands oil as [...] "highly polluting". Although oil sands exports to Europe are minimal, the issue has caused friction between the EU and Canada. According to the California-based Jacobs Consultancy, the European Union used inaccurate and incomplete data in assigning a high greenhouse gas rating to gasoline derived from Alberta’s oilsands. Also, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Russia do not provide data on how much natural gas is released via flaring or venting in the oil extraction process. The Jacobs report pointed out that extra carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12 percent higher than from regular crude, although it was assigned a GHG rating 22% above the conventional benchmark by EU.|$|E
