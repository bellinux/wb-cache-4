500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{felt that}} while the episode was [...] "still an {{entertaining}} half-hour, {{there was nothing to}} it that was incredibly memorable." [...] He said that Tracy Jordan was [...] "quickly becoming one of the more enjoyable aspects of the show". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that [...] "this outing fell a bit flat for [...] ". He thought that [...] "the best moment this week, by far, had to be that big, fat wink to Aaron Sorkin's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (and West Wing, and Sports Night..., where Liz and Pete, upon realizing that they had traveled in a small circle {{over the course of a}} banter exchange, <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Nice walk-and-talk', and then bumped fists. Nice." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its initial publication, The Fountainhead has received relatively little attention from literary critics. Assessing the novel's legacy, philosopher Douglas Den Uyl described The Fountainhead as relatively neglected compared to her later novel, Atlas <b>Shrugged,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "our problem is to find those topics that arise clearly with The Fountainhead and yet do not force us to read it simply {{through the eyes of}} Atlas Shrugged." [...] Among critics who have addressed it, some consider The Fountainhead to be Rand's best novel, although in some cases this assessment is tempered by an overall negative judgment of Rand's writings. Purely negative evaluations have also continued; a 2011 overview of American literature said [...] "mainstream literary culture dismissed [...] in the 1940s and continues to dismiss it".|$|E
6000|$|Eva laughed, but Alice <b>shrugged</b> her shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> tranquilly, [...] "I don't mind. She wouldn't {{expect much}} wisdom from school-girls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, he {{was very}} good about it. He laughed, I remember, <b>and</b> <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> there was no use denying {{anything}} to a woman, for she would have her way." ...|$|R
6000|$|I had not listened, as I was at {{that moment}} {{astonished}} to see the saddle slowly slide under Chu Chu's belly, and her figure resume, as if by magic, its former slim proportions. Enriquez followed my eyes, lifted his shoulders, <b>shrugged</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> smilingly, [...] "Ah, you see!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Gein's {{house and}} {{property}} {{were scheduled to}} be auctioned March 30, 1958, amid rumors the house {{was to become a}} tourist attraction. On March 27, the house was destroyed by fire. Arson was suspected, but the cause was never officially determined. When Gein learned of the incident while in detention, he <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Just as well." [...] Gein's car, which he used to haul the bodies of his victims, was sold at public auction for $760 to carnival sideshow operator Bunny Gibbons. Gibbons later charged carnival goers 25¢ admission to see it.|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 2008, Michael Moore was a {{guest on}} Larry King Live and was shown a clip from the film where Malone (while lying down on his bed, {{drinking}} a Big Gulp and watching archival footage of JFK's inaugural address) is startled by Kennedy, who materializes out of Malone's television screen, and confronts him on his misguided views of American history. Moore {{said that he was}} vaguely familiar with the film, and then jokingly said he thought that Viggo Mortensen should be portraying him. When King asked him his opinion, Moore <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I hope it's funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Salerno {{was convicted}} {{on charges of}} murder and {{racketeering}} and sentenced to 100 years in prison along with top members of the other Five Families in {{what was called the}} Mafia Commission Trial. Genovese family informant Vincent Cafaro revealed to the FBI during the trial that Salerno was just a figurehead; Gigante had been the real boss of the family since 1981. [...] Before then, the FBI had missed a number of clues that Gigante was the real boss. [...] For instance, FBI bugs caught several instances of mafiosi discussing how Gigante had ordered murders—under Mafia rules, a power solely reserved to the boss. [...] Most tellingly, an FBI bug captured a conversation in which Salerno and capo Matthew [...] "Matty the Horse" [...] Ianniello were reviewing a list of prospective candidates to be made in another family. Frustrated that the nicknames of the wannabes hadn't been included, Salerno <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'll leave this up to the boss." ...|$|E
6000|$|Don Miguel, much {{astonished}} at this unexpected outburst of passion, {{gazed at her}} with a sneer, then he <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders <b>and</b> <b>said</b> coldly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> little Dolly <b>shrugged</b> her shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with {{a pretty}} pettishness, [...] "Now, Father, you're not to tease! You know I don't want to be bride's-maid to anybody!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad to see {{you take}} the last blow so well." [...] There was an ironical little twang to that speech, and Polly could n't help it. Tom colored up and looked hurt for a minute, then seemed to right himself with a <b>shrug,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in his outspoken way, [...] "To tell the honest truth, Polly, {{it was not a}} very hard one. I 've had a feeling for some time that Trix and I were not suited to one another, and it might be wiser to stop short. But she did not or would not see it; and I was not going to back out, and leave her to wear any more willows, so here we are. I don't bear malice, but hope she 'll do better, and not be {{disappointed}} again, upon my word I do." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1986, {{shortly after}} Salerno's {{conviction}} in the Commission Trial, Salerno's longtime right-hand man, Vincent [...] "The Fish" [...] Cafaro, told the FBI that Salerno {{was only a}} front for Gigante. [...] Cafaro, who had by this time turned informer, also revealed that the Genovese family had been keeping up this ruse since 1969. [...] However, investigators had missed several clues that Salerno wasn't the real boss before then. [...] Most tellingly, an FBI bug captured a conversation in which Salerno and capo Matthew [...] "Matty the Horse" [...] Ianniello were reviewing a list of prospective candidates {{to be made in}} another family. [...] Frustrated that the nicknames of the wannabes hadn't been included, Salerno <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'll leave this up to the boss"—a clear sign that he was not the real leader of the family. [...] Nonetheless, this revelation would not have been enough to endanger Salerno's conviction and sentence in the Commission Trial; he had been convicted of specific crimes and not merely of being a boss. In any event, his 70-year sentence in the separate racketeering trial would have assured that he would die in prison.|$|E
5000|$|In {{reply to}} a 2010 {{question}} as to whether she would support Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky's continuing as the Republican leader of the Senate, O’Donnell <b>shrugged,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> “I wouldn’t not support him.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Mangione {{appeared}} in a commercial for Memorex in 1979 performing [...] "Feels So Good". Ella Fitzgerald, who became famous for Memorex commercials in 1970s, heard Mangione and musicians perform it, then it was played back for her. When she was asked [...] "if it was live or it is Memorex?", Ella <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Beats me!".|$|E
6000|$|Bernardo <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Romola, wilt thou see if my servant is without? I {{ordered him to}} wait for me here." [...] Then, when Romola was at a sufficient distance, he leaned forward <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to Bardo in a low, emphatic tone-- ...|$|R
6000|$|His Eminence threw a {{quick look}} at the young man, a look half of pity, half of contempt. For a moment it seemed as if an angry retort hovered upon his lips. But he merely <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> <b>said</b> blandly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Dermot <b>shrugged</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "How {{is one to}} help oneself if one has been born some two thousand years too late, or not in the new half-baked hemisphere where demigods still walk the earth in their simplicity?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "'I Want You To Want Me' was {{a fabulous}} dancehall type of song, {{and a perfect}} pop tune, and {{it was meant to}} be a little campy. I put the piano on—a guy named Jai Winding played it. I {{remember}} asking the band what they thought of it, and Rick Nielsen kind of <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You’re the producer.'" [...] Further: [...] "It was a burlesque song, like a 30’s number. That is what they wrote it as." ...|$|E

60|$|Now I {{would have}} {{followed}} them, guessing {{that they had}} some good reason for this sudden departure. But Higgs refused to come, and Orme, in whom his foolish taunt seemed still to rankle, only <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|R
6000|$|This time too, {{after that}} instant's hesitation, the reserve which {{every now and}} then seemed entirely to detach the Duke of Wessex from his surroundings, quickly {{disappeared}} again.

60|$|Charlie {{saw that}} it would be useless to try and alter the man's decision, {{especially}} as he knew so little of the language. He therefore <b>shrugged</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that he was ready to go with them, if it must be so.|$|R

5000|$|Following {{their last}} album, 20/20, Brian Wilson {{proposed}} that the group change their name from [...] "the Beach Boys" [...] to [...] "the Beach", reasoning for {{the simple fact that}} the band members were now grown men. Going to the effort of acquiring a contract which would declare a five-way agreement to officially rename the group, engineer Stephen Desper reported, [...] "They all just kind of <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Aw, come on, Brian, we don't wanna do that. That's how the public knows us, man. And that was it. He put the paper on the piano and it stayed there until I picked it up and took it away." ...|$|E
