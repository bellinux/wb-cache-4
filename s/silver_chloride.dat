5|$|The {{three main}} forms of {{deterioration}} in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> due to long-term immersion in salt water, {{as well as}} reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen. Fresh <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly {{from the surface of}} the artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.|$|E
5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as <b>silver</b> <b>chloride.</b> Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5|$|By extension, any pentadienyl cation {{regardless}} of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization. There have been {{a large number of}} examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements.

The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble <b>silver</b> <b>chloride.</b>|$|E

Corrosion products were mainly <b>silver</b> <b>chlorides</b> (AgCl), chlorargyrite. Some objects displayed copper inclusions {{both in the}} metallic core and in the inner layer. Highly mineralized objects contained other oxygen-rich phases (with Si, Ca) in the inner layer. Soil markers were detected in the outer layer.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} of the Washoe process {{was developed in the}} Reese River mining district around Austin, Nevada. The Washoe process was found not to work well for ores with arsenic or antimony sulfides, or with galena or sphalerite. In 1869, Carl A. Stetefeldt of Reno found that roasting the ore with salt converted the silver sulfides to <b>silver</b> <b>chlorides,</b> which could then be recovered in amalgamation pans. [...] The process was introduced in the Reese River District in 1879, with great success.|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{chlorides}} of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the lanthanides and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular chlorides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. <b>Silver</b> <b>chloride</b> is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{was one of}} {{the seven}} metals of antiquity that were known to prehistoric humans and whose {{discovery}} is thus lost to history. In particular, the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering. However, unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of metallurgy on account of its low structural strength, and was more often used ornamentally or as money. Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold. For example, silver was more expensive than gold in Egypt until around the fifteenth century BC: the Egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt, and then reducing the <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> produced to the metal.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form +; silver salts are dissolved in photography due {{to the formation of}} the thiosulfate complex 3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex −. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes +.|$|E

The <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> electrode is simple to manufacture and provides high reproducibility. The reference electrode usually consists of a platinum wire that has contact with a silver / <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> mixture, which is immersed in a potassium chloride solution.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of scientific examinations and analyses carried out on the archaeological coins discovered in Najran, Saudi Arabia. Optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate morphological corrosion features, to clear the nature of the patina and to analyze the elementary composition. Morphologically, it was revealed that there are reniform, coral reef and dendritic shapes of corrosion products and heterogeneous multicolor patina on the studied coin surfaces. It was proven that those coins were made of a silver-copper alloy and were covered by three superficial corrosion layers. The main composition of the coin corrosion compounds was identified as copper carbonate, copper <b>chloride,</b> copper silicates, <b>silver</b> <b>chlorides</b> and <b>silver</b> sulphide. The proposed corrosion mechanism revealed that those coins were characterized by heavy degradation phenomena, induced by corrosive species and soil contaminants. The corrosion processes led to the depletion of the copper and silver enrichment near the surface, as compared to the core composition.

Resultant corrosion products from air pollutants which were successfully measured were copper oxides (CuO and Cu 2 O), copper sulphides (Cu 2 S), <b>silver</b> <b>chlorides</b> (AgCl) and <b>silver</b> sulphides (Ag 2 S).

Sulfur dioxide emission could be eliminated "if it were possible to reduce the metal directly from the sulfide by a method which yields only the more easily handled elemental sulfur as a by-product It is known that base metal sulfides are soluble in chloride melts particularly those containing a cation common to the sulfide (1 - 4). Further, {{it has been found}} that such melts when dilute in sulfide (containing less than 0. 1 mole fraction sulfide) are electrolytes (5, 6).
