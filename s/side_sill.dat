2500|$|In November 1981 {{the updated}} [...] "Alfetta '82" [...] range was launched, {{comprising}} 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 and 2.0 Turbo Diesel models. All variants adopted the bodyshell and {{interior of the}} 2.0-litre models; standard equipment became richer. All Alfettas had black plastic rubbing strips, <b>side</b> <b>sill</b> mouldings, tail light surround and hubcaps; the 2000 sported a satin silver grille and a simulated mahogany steering wheel rim.|$|E
2500|$|Early diesel {{locomotives}} were also painted black. Yard switchers had diagonal orange stripes {{on the ends}} for visibility, earning this scheme the nickname of Tiger Stripe. Road freight units were black with a red band {{at the bottom of}} the car body and a silver and orange [...] "winged" [...] nose. [...] "SOUTHERN PACIFIC" [...] was in a large serif font in Lettering Gray (a very light gray). Railfans call this paint scheme Black Widow. An experimental scheme, all-over black with a variety of orange end and <b>side</b> <b>sill</b> treatments was called the Halloween scheme. Over 200 locomotives were so painted between March 1957 and mid-1958.|$|E

2500|$|For 2004 both coupe and sedans were altered, with updated {{interiors}} {{and improved}} transmissions. The five-speed automatic transmission on the 350GT Premium now included synchro rev control, while the 6-speed manual transmission {{was made to}} vibrate less. For the sedan, the front grill/bumper, foot panel, head lamp, rear bumper, and rear combination lamps were changed. The front seats received active head rest, while the rear middle seat now have a three-point seat belt as standard. There were also some new wheels and a 19-inch option for the coupé. The Skyline's 2005 update again included changes to the head and rear lamps, front bumper, and <b>side</b> <b>sill</b> protectors. Also, 19-inch aluminium alloy wheel became standard for automatic transmission cars. A [...] "plasma cluster ion" [...] full air conditioner with left/right independent temperature settings, heated door mirrors, head lamp auto levelizer (compliant with new legislation) was made standard equipment.|$|E

50|$|An EMD GP15AC is a 4-axle {{diesel-electric}} locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between November and December 1982. This locomotive {{differs from the}} otherwise identical EMD GP15-1 due to Missouri Pacific specifying new AR10 AC alternators instead of rebuilt D32 DC generators.

50|$|The Monaro {{featured}} a different grille, wide lower air intake and bonnet scoops, <b>side</b> <b>sills</b> with shark gills and unique 19 in alloy wheels and VXR branded brake calipers on later build numbers. It {{was replaced by}} the four-door VXR8, also from Holden.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Class {{identity of}} each Class 39-000 locomotive can be visually {{determined by the}} difference between their left <b>side</b> <b>sills.</b> The three ex Class 34-600 locomotives have thicker fishbelly-shaped left sills, compared to the thinner straight left sills of the two ex Class 34-800 locomotives.|$|R

50|$|The Faran Car Co. Ltd. was a U.K based {{company that}} offered both D-I-Y kit and {{in-house}} assembled options for their Eliminator kit. The design featured replacement fibreglass mouldings {{for the front}} and rear wings, together with front and rear integrated bumper sections. The external modifications were completed by <b>side</b> <b>sill</b> skirts and a rear boot spoiler which was not dissimilar in style to that found on a De Tomaso Pantera. Faran also offered conversions using Lancia or Fiat Twin Cam engine units, although some owners opted to keep the original SOHC setup. Production of the Faran kits ended following an unfortunate factory fire.|$|E

40|$|Scour {{downstream}} (DS) of hydraulic structures (HS) may {{endanger the}} safety of the structures if the necessary precuations are not considered during the design stage. Normally, different measures produce different effects on reducing the maximum scour depth DS of HS. One of the important HSs is the abruptly enlarged (or sudden expanding) stilling basins. In this paper, the effects of different arrangements of sills inside an abruptly enlarged stilling basin will be discussed. An experimental program was conducted to investigate the effects of continuous end <b>sill,</b> one asymmetric <b>side</b> side, double staggered asymmetric <b>side</b> <b>sills,</b> symmetric <b>side</b> <b>sills,</b> central sill and continuous central sill. The flow patterns were observed and the maximum scour depths were recorded. The results revealed that in most of the cases the flow patterns are asymmetric resulting in asymmetric scours. The reduction in the maximum scour depth depends on the type of arrangement of the used sill and on the flow conditions represented by Froude number. Both of the central sill with limited width and continuous central sill improved the flow patterns towards symmetric type and yielded minimized maaximum scour depth with preference to the continuous sill...|$|R

50|$|It {{was offered}} {{as both a}} coupé and a cabriolet. Both the M6 coupé and {{convertible}} can be visually distinguished from the 630i, 645Ci and 650i by their deeper front valance with air intakes, more contoured <b>side</b> <b>sills,</b> aerodynamic <b>side</b> view mirrors, an additional rear valance with diffuser {{and the absence of}} front fog lights. Only 701 examples were produced with a true 6-speed manual gearbox. (323 Coupes + 378 Convertibles).|$|R
