5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} often {{considered}} the first true survival horror, due {{to having the}} most influence on Resident Evil, was the 1989 release Sweet Home, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was created by Tokuro Fujiwara, who would later go on to create Resident Evil. Sweet Homes gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory, while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures, {{which could lead to}} permanent death for any of the characters, thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival. It was also the first attempt at creating a <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> frightening storyline within a game, mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game. Developed by Capcom, the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil. Its horrific imagery prevented its release in the Western world, though its influence was felt through Resident Evil, which was originally intended to be a remake of the game. Some consider Sweet Home to be the first true survival horror game.|$|E

2500|$|Organizations such as SIECUS {{have called}} abstinence-only {{programs}} [...] "fear-based," [...] and [...] "designed to control young people’s sexual behavior by instilling fear, shame, and guilt." [...] Author Judith Levine {{has argued that}} there might be a natural tendency of abstinence educators to escalate their messages: [...] "Like advertising, which must continually jack up its seduction just to stay visible as other advertising proliferates, abstinence education had to make sex <b>scarier</b> <b>and</b> <b>scarier</b> <b>and,</b> at the same time, chastity sweeter." ...|$|R

500|$|According to Robyn, [...] "Indestructible" [...] {{describes}} how meeting new people and {{falling in love}} can be <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> fun at the same time. The song is a synthpop ballad with string sounds, pulsing bass and an electronic arrangement. The song was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its production and Robyn's songwriting. It reached number four on the Sverigetopplistan chart, becoming Robyn's ninth top ten hit in her native country. It charted moderately elsewhere, reaching number thirteen in Denmark and number twenty-one on the UK Dance Chart.|$|E
500|$|... "Signs and Wonders" [...] {{was written}} by The X-Files staff writer Jeffrey Bell. Bell had long desired to write a [...] "down-and-dirty" [...] horror story for the series. In addition, he had informally studied the {{practice}} of snake handling, concluding that [...] "anything involving snakes would be <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> I saw the church stuff as {{something that would be}} really fascinating." [...] However, unlike most stories featuring the radical religious, the theme of the episode was that in certain circumstances, [...] "intolerance can be good", according to executive producer Frank Spotnitz.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{spoke to}} Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly during a [...] "Behind the Scenes" [...] {{episode of the}} shoot, about her inspirations for the video. She {{wanted to have a}} [...] "giant" [...] dance video with [...] "LoveGame", {{describing}} it as [...] "plastic, beautiful, gorgeous, sweaty, tar on the floor". There would be <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> dangerous looking men also in the video. Gaga had the idea of portraying herself and her co-actors as New York inhabitants taking on the role of designers, performance artists, dancers etc. She enlisted people from downtown New York as dancers, who normally would not get cast in a video.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by producer Glen Morgan's desire for [...] "an episode with more of a sexy edge"; the writers {{found it difficult to}} write a story that showed sex as <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> introduced an Amish-like community as well. [...] "Gender Bender" [...] was seen by approximately 6.8million households in its initial broadcast. The episode has subsequently been met with mixed critical responses, facing criticism for its abrupt deus ex machina ending. Academic analysis of the episode has placed it within a science-fiction tradition that attributes a powerful, supernatural element to physical contact with aliens. It has also been seen as reflecting anxieties about emerging gender roles in the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Night School {{wanted the}} story to have <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> supernatural elements, without verging on horror. [...] "We wanted to {{something}} a little bit more [...] Spielberg-ian, and sort of give it a sense of wonder and have it, for awhile, just be actually interacting with these supernatural creatures where it's almost a little bit fun, and hopefully, gives you butterflies in your stomach before it gets pretty crazy," [...] Krankel said. The developers were influenced by other coming-of-age stories like Stand By Me when developing the characters and story; Krankel cited the character of Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks as the biggest outside influence on the character of Alex.|$|E
500|$|Nowak {{wanted to}} start the design process after talking through the story with the filmmakers {{so that he could}} {{formulate}} [...] "a sense of the atmosphere" [...] which they wanted to create for the film. He wanted to create a [...] "dark, <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> oppressive environment" [...] for the characters, especially Mulder. While familiar with the television series, Nowak decided not to review any episodes as preparation {{for his role in the}} production. Explaining this decision, he said, [...] "I wanted the movie to be as fresh and new as possible in its design. Of course, there were some elements from the show that had to be retained." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The {{theme of}} sexual violence, {{of what it}} means to be a man, is a big part of that episode," [...] creator Matthew Weiner said of [...] "Mystery Date". [...] "There's this idea of this carnal, {{dangerous}} impulsive male. Of the dream sequence, Hamm said, [...] "Unlike a lot of things on our show, it's very visceral and immediate and <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> weird" [...] with Hamm noting that Weiner compared the episode to a horror film. The scene in which Peggy blackmails Roger was one of Elisabeth Moss's favorite moments, with Moss saying that she was [...] "playing Roger Sterling" [...] in that scene.|$|E
500|$|... "Night Terrors" [...] was {{inspired}} by Gatiss's fear of dolls, and {{the ones in the}} episode were designed to be <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> crude-looking. The episode was moved from {{the first half of the}} series to the second, which necessitated changes to make it fit into the series' story arc. It was the first to be filmed, with production taking place in September 2010 at a council estate in Redcliffe, Bristol and at Dyrham Park, where the doll's house interior scenes were filmed. The episode was watched by 7.07 million viewers in the UK and received generally positive to mixed reviews from critics, though some were critical of how it fitted into the overarching story as it came after a heavy story-arc episode.|$|E
500|$|Haley is {{contracted}} {{for three}} films, {{which includes the}} remake and two sequels. Englund stated he agreed with the casting of Haley, noting that he feels Haley's physical size works for him in this role. Explaining why they chose {{to take away the}} comical aspect of Freddy's personality, Form and Fuller stated, [...] "We've never been attracted to a jokey antagonist because it feels less <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> less real". Even though the character is closer to how he was portrayed in the original film, Haley has stated that he does not intend to have Englund's performances influence his own. Haley stated that he used the frustration of having to sit in the make-up chair {{for three and a half}} hours as his motivation to get into character.|$|E

500|$|According to film site {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes, 91 {{percent of}} critics were favorable about The Fellowship of the Ring. Entertainment Weekly columnist Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film [...] "thrilling – a great picture, a triumphant picture, a joyfully conceived work of cinema that (based on this first installment, {{with two more}} ready for release {{in the next two}} years) would appear to embrace Tolkien's classic with love and delight, and rewards both adepts and novices with the highest compliment of all: an intelligence and artistry as a movie independent of blind fidelity to the page." [...] Nev Pierce of BBC added, [...] "Funny, <b>scary</b> <b>and,</b> totally involving, Peter Jackson's assured adaptation of J. R. R Tolkien's The Lord of The Rings turns the book's least screen-worthy volume into a gripping and powerful adventure movie." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{wanted the}} video {{to show her}} without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not have done in the past. There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, it was <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E
500|$|Writing for GamesRadar, David Houghton {{highlighted}} the alien's advanced artificial intelligence, stating that [...] "progress becomes {{a case of}} 'if' and 'how', not 'when'. Movement is measured in inches and feet rather than metres, and simply remaining alive becomes more exhilarating than any objective achieved." [...] Peterson praised the gameplay for being tense, <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> effective, commenting that Alien: Isolation is [...] "a solid, incredibly striking example of the [...] genre that uses its first person perspective to greater personalize the horror." [...] PC Gamer credited the crafting system for giving the game [...] "a lot of unexpected depth", allowing players to outsmart enemies in multiple ways. The game's Survivor Mode was praised by Chris Carter of Destructoid, who felt it offered players different feelings and experiences each time they played it.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian {{published}} three {{reviews of}} the episode. Sam Wollaston gave the episode a positive review; {{he thought it was}} a [...] "wonderful episode" [...] that [...] "would be hard to top". Wollaston joked in his review about Richard Dawkins's cameo, and compared his anti-theological mannerisms to the Daleks. Gareth McLean described the end of the episode as a [...] "genuine, jaw-dropping, outta-nowhere cliffhanger". [...] He commended the production team for successfully suppressing information about the regeneration in an industry often stifled by leaks. Stephen Brook of The Guardians media blog Organgrinder, thought the episode was [...] "unbelievably good" [...] and [...] "genuinely <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> exciting". [...] He theorised about the questionable regeneration: whether it was genuine and, if so, who would portray the next incarnation of the Doctor; and which companion will die in [...] "Journey's End".|$|E
500|$|The second segment, [...] "Terror at 5½ Feet", {{was written}} by Oakley and Weinstein. It was {{inspired}} by an episode of The Twilight Zone called [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", in which William Shatner's character is inside an airplane watching a gremlin tear apart the wing. Silverman watched the episode to get inspiration for Bart's facial expressions. Oakley {{said there was a}} lot of work put into the design of the gremlin in [...] "Terror at 5½ Feet" [...] to make him scary [...] "within The Simpsons universe". Mirkin said he felt the gremlin was well-done because he looked <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> [...] "yet it looks like a completely organic Simpsons character". Üter, a character from Germany, makes his first appearance on the show in this segment; he was conceived as a one-time joke, but reappeared in later episodes because Mirkin felt he was [...] "such a perfect stereotype".|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time reacted {{positively}} to the episode, exclaiming that it [...] "paints a thoroughly convincing postapocalyptic world, both visually and emotionally." [...] Variety Brian Lowry avouched that [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] was [...] "surprisingly fresh", despite having initial thoughts of a stale premise. He wrote: [...] "The Walking Dead draws {{the audience in}} almost instantly with its cinematic 90-minute pilot, then incorporates tasty soap-like elements meant to animate the ensuing episodes. Although we've seen no shortage of zombies and post-apocalyptic stories, producer-writer-director Frank Darabont has deftly tackled the seemingly perilous task of adapting a comic book about zombies into a viable episodic series." [...] In a {{three out of four}} star review, Linda Stasi of New York Post summarized, [...] "The zombies are truly <b>scary</b> <b>and</b> disgusting. The survivors are terrific characters, and the gore is enough for any lunatic to love." ...|$|E
