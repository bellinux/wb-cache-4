50|$|The {{most easily}} {{recognized}} AKM {{feature is the}} gas block design (45 degree versus 90 degree). Incidentally, although the gas block is purely AKM, the gas vent in the barrel did change to a 90-degree design to minimize bullet shearing (a problem with early Soviet AK-74s with 45-degree gas blocks). This means the Romanian PA md. 86 has a double-angle gas port, which makes it much harder to clean the gas vent. This variant also uses the AK-47 rear trunnion, and thus the <b>siderail</b> is lengthened.|$|E
40|$|Researchers have {{demonstrated}} {{that the use of}} physical restraints in nursing homes can be reduced, particularly where advanced practice nurses (APNs) are utilized. We examined the link between APN practice, <b>siderail</b> reduction, and the costs of <b>siderail</b> alternatives in 273 residents in four Philadelphia nursing homes. The majority of participants were cognitively and physically impaired with multiple co-morbidities. APNs recommended a total of 1, 275 siderail-alternative interventions aimed at reducing fall risk. The median cost of <b>siderail</b> alternatives to prevent falls per resident was $ 135. Residents with a fall history experienced a significantly higher cost of recommendation compared to non-fallers. Findings suggest that an APN consultation model can effectively be implemented through comprehensive, individualized assessment without incurring substantial costs to the nursing home. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the presence of}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in areas close to patients in a General Intensive Care Unit. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, in which microbiological samples were collected from five surfaces (left / right bed <b>siderails,</b> bed crank, table, buttons on the infusion pump, and cotton gowns) from each of ten patient rooms, totaling 63 samples. To collect samples, the Petri FilmTM Staph Express Count System 3 M TM was used to screen for methicillin resistance, with the Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 4 % sodium chloride and 6 µg / ml of oxacillin. Descriptive analysis was conducted to determine the frequency (n) and percentage (%) of contamination of environmental surfaces. RESULTS: Of 48 samples positive for Staphylococcus aureus, 29 (60. 4 %) were resistant to methicillin. The incidence on the <b>siderails</b> and bed cranks, table, buttons on the infusion pumps and aprons were, respectively, 55. 5 %, 57. 1 %, 57. 1 %, 60. 0 % and 75. 0 %.

The hydroforming simulation model is described and correlated to test measurements.

The frame <b>siderail</b> was subjected to a representative crash load; LS-DYNA was used for both forming and crash simulations. The effect of thickness, work hardening and residual stresses on the crashworthiness results is quantified; crash response is seen to be significantly affected when the effects of forming are included...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} {{in the area of}} cryogenics for space exploration in the next millennium is providing the capability for inexpensive, frequent, access to space. Faced with this challenge during the International Space Station (ISS) build era, when other Space Shuttle manifesting opportunities are unavailable, a "proof of concept" cryostat has been developed to demonstrate the ability to accommodate low temperature science investigations within the constraints of the Hitchhiker <b>siderail</b> carrier. The Hitchhiker <b>siderail</b> carrier is available on a "mass available" basis during the ISS build era. In fact, several hitchhiker payloads flew with the deployment of the Unity module. Hitchhiker <b>siderail</b> carrier payloads have historically flown an average of about four times a year. A hybrid Solid Neon - Superfluid Helium cryostat has been developed with Janis Research Company to accommodate instruments of 16. 5 cm diameter and 30 cm. length. This hybrid approach was taken in part to provide adequate on-orbit lifetime for instruments with high (conducted) heat loads from the instrumentation wiring. Mass, volume, lifetime and the launch hold scenario were all design drivers. In addition, with Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation, a multichannel VME architecture Germanium Resistance Thermometer (GRT) readout and heater control servo system has been developed. In a flight system, the cryostat and electronics payloads would be umbilically attached in a paired Hitchhiker <b>siderail</b> mount, and permit on-orbit command and telemetry capability. The results of performance tests of both the cryostat, and a helium sample instrument will be presented. The instrument features a self contained, miniaturized, nano-Kelvin resolution High Resolution Thermometer (HRT). This high level of thermal resolution is achieved through the utilization of a dc Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). Although developed for the Low Temperature Microgravity Fundamental Physics investigator community, many design features are applicable in fields such as infrared and x-ray astronomy...|$|E
40|$|To {{address the}} gap in {{manifest}} opportunities for low temperature microgravity payloads that has accompanied {{the start of the}} build era for the International Space Station (ISS), development of a new facility compatible with one or more carriers in the baseline shuttle manifest has been undertaken. This new facility is called the Fast Alternative Cryogenic Experiment Testbed (FACET). During the past year, a ground prototype was designed, built and tested to prove the feasibility of a flight facility for conducting low temperature microgravity fundamental physics investigations within the constraints of the Space Shuttle Hitchhiker <b>Siderail</b> carrier. To accomplish this, significant reductions in cryostat mass and volume, while maintaining cryogen lifetime performance, were necessary. Measurements of ground performance agree well with theoretical modeling and indicate that a flight system would be capable of cooling an instrument for nearly the full duration of even the longest shuttle missions (16 days). In addition, a new modular electronics architecture has been demonstrated, which will provide added flexibility for reflights of the facility with different investigations. This project serves as a pathfinder for the Low Temperatur...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} is to present the {{different}} aspects of modern high complexity electric beds of the period 1940 until 2000 exclusively. The chronology of the product has been strictly divided into three big stages: electric and semi-electric beds (until the 90 ’s), mechatronic beds (90 ’s until 2000) and, mechatronic intelligent beds of the last 15 years. The latter are not considered in this work due to the extension for its analysis. The justification for classifying the product is presented under the concepts of medical, assistive and mobility devices. Relevant aspects of common immobility problems of {{the different types of}} patients for which the beds are mainly addressed are shown in detail. The basic functioning of the patient’s movement generator and the implementation of actuators, together with IT programs, specific accessories and connectivity means and network-communication shown in this work, were those that gave origin to current mechatronic beds. We present the historical evolution of high complexity electric beds by illustrating cases extracted from a meticulous time line, based on patents, inventions and publications in newspapers and magazines of the world. The criteria adopted to evaluate the innovation were: characteristics of controls; accessories (mattresses, lighting, <b>siderails,</b> etc.), aesthetic and morphologic properties and outstanding functionalitiesFil: Ghersi, Ignacio.
