40|$|Abstract: Laboratory {{experiments}} should simulate to a {{high degree}} the conditions in the field, especially in term of compaction procedures. Presently available laboratory compaction methods {{do not seem to}} be able to produce specimens that can truly represent the mixtures as it exists in the field, especially for Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) mixtures. SMA is highly dependent on the method of compaction. As the application of the SMA is rapidly gaining acceptance worldwide, a suitable laboratory compaction method is evidently needed. Turamesin, a laboratory <b>slab</b> <b>roller</b> compactor was developed to enable laboratory compaction of asphalt mixtures in field simulation conditions. This study was carried out in order to establish criteria for slab compaction and identify the potential of the newly developed Turamesin. A total of nine slabs were prepared with different combination of compactive efforts and data were then analyzed to develop correlation and thus to determine the appropriate values of the compactive efforts that resulted in optimum performance of the asphalt mix slab due to 4 % air voids. For the asphalt mix slab to be compacted to the desired ultimate compaction of 4 % air voids, the compactive efforts of 8. 0 kgf/cm of applied pressure and 75 numbers of passes of the roller compactor were required. These values of compactive efforts were considered as typical parameters for Turamesin in achieving a target air void of 4 % regardless of SMA mixtures...|$|E

40|$|A {{finite element}} method {{algorithm}} is presented that enables numerical simulation of real phenomena that take place during an industrial process of continuous casting of steel. The algorithm takes into account all known kinds of nonlinearities: material nonlinearity connected to the nonlinear temperature dependence of material properties, large deformations from the process of material forming and contacts between the <b>slab</b> and <b>rollers</b> of the strand. Received results describe {{the sensitivity of the}} product to crack initiation, not only during the process of continuous casting itself but also in the finished and cooled slab...|$|R
5000|$|A {{craftsman}} {{known as}} a sugar boiler then proceeds to [...] "spin out", or stretch, the boiling onto a long flat <b>slab,</b> where <b>rollers</b> {{make sure it is}} kept rolling until it has set hard enough to maintain its round shape. The process of spinning out is what turns the very thick boiling into the much longer and much thinner final size. Once set, the strings of toffee are cut to length and wrapped in clear paper with a label, {{known as a}} [...] "view" [...] as it usually has a view of a landmark.|$|R
5000|$|Nanzhuangtou (12,600-11,300 cal BP or 11,500-11,000 cal BP, roughly 9500-9000 BC) was a Neolithic {{site near}} Lake Baiyangdian in Xushui County, Hebei, China. The site was {{discovered}} under a peat bog. [...] Over 47 pieces of pottery were discovered at the site. Nanzhuangtou {{is also the}} earliest Neolithic site yet discovered in northern China. There {{is evidence that the}} people at Nanzhuangtou domesticated the dog. Stone grinding <b>slabs</b> and <b>rollers</b> and bone artifacts were also discovered at the site. It is one of the earliest site showing evidence of millet cultivation dating to 10,500 BP. [...] Pottery can also be dated to 10,200 BP.|$|R
40|$|Bulge {{deformation}} of the slab {{is one of}} the main factors that affect slab quality in continuous casting. This paper describes an investigation into bulge deformation using ABAQUS to model the solidification process. A three-dimensional finite element analysis model of the slab solidification process has been first established because the bulge deformation is closely related to slab temperature distributions. Based on slab temperature distributions, a three-dimensional thermomechanical coupling model including the <b>slab,</b> the <b>rollers,</b> and the dynamic contact between them has also been constructed and applied to a case study. The thermomechanical coupling model produces outputs such as the rules of bulge deformation. Moreover, the three-dimensional model has been compared with a two-dimensional model to discuss the differences between the two models in calculating the bulge deformation. The results show that the platform zone exists in the wide side of the slab and the bulge deformation is affected strongly by the ratio of width-to-thickness. The indications are also that the difference of the bulge deformation for the two modeling ways is little when the ratio of width-to-thickness is larger than six...|$|R

Holcus, when dear, sells at forty pounds per dollar, at seventy pounds when cheap. It is usually levigated with <b>slab</b> and <b>roller,</b> and made into sour cakes.

Of the former grain the people make a sweet cake called Sabaya, resembling the Fatirah of Egypt: a favourite dish also is [...] "harisah"--flesh, rice flour, and boiled wheat, all finely pounded and mixed together. Milk is not procurable during the hot weather; after rain every house is full of it; the Bedouins bring it in skins and sell it for a nominal sum.|$|R

While this completes phase 1 of the construction, {{there remains a}} phase 2 {{to be completed in}} 2018. The second phase would include rebuilding the top section of the spillway (which was not rebuilt this season), putting <b>slabs</b> over the <b>roller</b> compacted concrete section, constructing a concrete secant cutoff wall for the emergency spillway. The cost estimate at this point is over $500 million. Things that added to the cost included relocating power lines, dredging the river downstream of the dam, as well as the discovery that the bedrock under the spillway was weak, necessitating deeper excavations and more concrete.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{reports the}} {{investigation}} results of {{hot mix asphalt}} compacted at rain water simulation (HMA-CARS). Objectives of the research are to analysis the characteristics of HMA-CARS and reclaimed HMA-CARS after certain treatments. Research method was developed through the two main programs. First, is to investigate the characteristics of hot mix asphalt compacted using <b>roller</b> <b>slab</b> with water spraying. Second, is to investigate the characteristics of reclaimed HMA-CARS with developing three alternatives treatments. The results {{can be described in}} two main points. First, due to water spraying during compaction process, the performance of HMA-CARS decrease and does not meet the general specification of Bina Marga 2010. Second, the performance of reclaimed HMA-CARS can be improved by the treatments; however it cannot help the reclaimed mixture to meet the specification requirements. Key words- Hot mix asphalt.
