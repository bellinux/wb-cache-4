5|$|After {{completion}} of NSYNC's PopOdyssey Tour, Bass moved to Star City, Russia, in much publicized {{pursuit of a}} <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Soyuz space capsule. Bass was certified by both NASA and the Russian Space Program after several months of cosmonaut training, and planned to join the TMA-1 mission to the International Space Station. However, after his financial sponsors backed out, Bass was denied {{a seat on the}} mission.|$|E
5|$|Despite the loss, Weaver still {{believed}} the Populist cause would triumph. He {{agreed to be}} nominated one last time for his old 6th district House <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Democratic-Populist fusion ticket. As he had ten years earlier, Republican John Lacey defeated Weaver. In 1900, Weaver attended a convention of fusionist Populists in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the party having split {{on the issue of}} cooperation with the Democrats. The fusionists backed Bryan, the Democratic nominee, but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, Weaver was elected to office for the last time as the mayor of his hometown, Colfax, Iowa.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks {{was arrested}} for refusing {{to give up her}} <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> city bus. The Montgomery bus boycott, urged and planned by Nixon and led by King, soon followed. The boycott lasted for 385 days, and the {{situation}} became so tense that King's house was bombed. King was arrested during this campaign, which concluded with a United States District Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.|$|E

5|$|By 1913 Silvester was {{suffering}} from continual poor health. He resigned his position at the tabernacle on medical advice in January 1914, and intended to resign his parliamentary <b>seat.</b> <b>On</b> <b>a</b> speaking tour of the US and Canada he lectured at Yale University, and then took the ferry to Toronto; as it entered the harbour, he collapsed and died, aged 49; Horne was aged seven at the time. From September that year Horne attended St George's School, Harpenden as a boarder—the seventh of the Horne children to attend the school. Although he was not strong academically, he developed into a good sportsman, representing the school in rugby and cricket, and during the summer holidays {{took part in the}} Public Schoolboys Lawn Tennis Championship at Queen's Club; in his final appearance in 1925 he was knocked out by the future Wimbledon finalist Bunny Austin.|$|E
5|$|Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, {{formed an}} action group, later {{to be called}} the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of {{progress}} in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman. Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and Boys' Brigade officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the interview was cancelled. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bus in Alabama and the ensuing Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.|$|E
5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E

25|$|Hewitt {{was one of}} the MPs {{named in}} the 2010 sting {{operation}} into political lobbying by the Channel 4 Dispatches programme, in which she appeared to claim that she was paid £3,000 a day to help a client obtain a key <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Government advisory group. On 22 March 2010, Hewitt, along with Geoff Hoon and Stephen Byers were suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party over the allegations.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of its Jewish heritage, there are several streets named after Jewish {{community}} figures in the western portion of Brownsville. In 1913, nine years after writer Theodor Herzl died, residents successfully petitioned to rename Ames Street to Herzl Street, marking one of the few streets outside Israel that are named Herzl Street. One block away, the incorrectly spelled Strauss Street was named after two former Macy's co-owners, brothers Nathan and Isidor Straus, the latter of whom died when his wife Ida gave up a <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lifeboat off the sinking RMS Titanic.|$|E
25|$|On {{his second}} try at the 1928 federal election, Chifley won the Division of Macquarie in the House of Representatives, which covered Bathurst, Lithgow, and the Blue Mountains. He was in general a {{supporter}} of the James Scullin government's economic policies, and in 1931 he became Minister for Defence. At the 1931 federal election, the Scullin government was defeated in a landslide and Chifley lost his <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 16-point swing to the UAP's John Lawson. During the Great Depression in Australia he survived on his wife's family's money and his part-ownership of the Bathurst newspaper the National Advocate.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th {{century the}} wealth {{had been built}} on shipping, trade, and real estate. Despite the later generations' {{inheritance}} {{they were expected to}} pursue a career. The acceptable careers in Philadelphia were medicine and law, with insurance, banking, and brokerage next in line on the ladder of acceptability. Running the family business was also acceptable especially if it related to iron and steel making, coal, and the railroads. Beyond their careers, the Philadelphia elite strived to have a <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> board, particularly as the chairman of the board. Business boards such as the boards for the Pennsylvania Railroad and Philadelphia Savings Fund Society were important, but so were charitable, institutional, cultural and social boards.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} the night sleeping in his <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> train trip from Buffalo to Westfield, New York, George Pullman was inspired to design an improved passenger railcar that contained sleeper berths for all its passengers. During the day, the upper berth was folded up somewhat like a modern airliner's overhead luggage compartment. At night the upper berth folded down and the two facing seats below it folded over to provide a relatively comfortable bunk for the night. Although this was somewhat spartan accommodation by today's standards, {{it was a great}} improvement on the previous layout. Curtains provided privacy, and there were washrooms {{at each end of the}} car for men and women.|$|E

500|$|In Montgomery, Rosa Parks {{attended}} a rally for Till, led by Martin Luther King Jr. She soon after, {{refused to give}} up her <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> segregated bus to a white passenger. The incident sparked a year-long well-organized grassroots boycott of the public bus system. The boycott was designed to force the city to change its segregation policies. Parks later said when she did not get up and move {{to the rear of the}} bus, [...] "I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Chaffee {{served as}} capsule {{communicator}} (CAPCOM) in March 1965 for Gemini 3. Later that year, he was CAPCOM, along with Virgil [...] "Gus" [...] Grissom and Eugene Cernan, for the Gemini 4 mission, in which Edward H. White II performed the first spacewalk by an American. As CAPCOM, Chaffee relayed information between {{the crew members}} and the Director of Flight Operations, Chris Kraft. He never got a <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Gemini mission, but was assigned to work on flight control, communications, instrumentation, and attitude and translation control systems in the Apollo program.

500|$|Following public {{response}} {{surrounding his}} coming out, Bass {{announced that he}} was releasing an autobiography. The book, entitled Out of Sync, was published on October 23, 2007. It was co-written by The New York Times best-selling biographer Marc Eliot, who also wrote the book's introduction, and was published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment, a division of Simon & Schuster. The 208-page book covers what Bass describes as [...] "the first chapter" [...] in his life, from his childhood growing up in rural Mississippi, to his efforts to obtain a <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Russian space capsule and the proceeding financial issues he had with his sponsors, and culminating with Bass's decision to go public with his sexuality. The book includes details about boyfriends that he kept from family and friends, and recounts NSYNC's 2002 decision to go on an [...] "extended hiatus". Bass stated that Justin Timberlake was the sole reason NSYNC did not get back together. Out of Sync debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list for the week of November 11, 2007.|$|E

500|$|When Arthur {{joined the}} firm, Culver and New York {{attorney}} John Jay (the grandson of the Founding Father {{of the same}} name) were pursuing a habeas corpus action against Jonathan Lemmon, a Virginia slaveholder who was passing through New York with his eight slaves. [...] In Lemmon v. New York, Culver argued that, as New York law did not permit slavery, any slave arriving in New York was automatically freed. [...] The argument was successful, and after several appeals was upheld by the New York Court of Appeals in 1860. [...] Campaign biographers would later give Arthur {{much of the credit}} for the victory; in fact his role was minor, although he was certainly an active participant in the case. [...] In another civil rights case in 1854, Arthur was the lead attorney representing Elizabeth Jennings Graham after she was denied a <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> streetcar because she was black. [...] He won the case, and the verdict led to the desegregation of the New York City streetcar lines.|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the novel deals with what book {{reviewer}} Harding LeMay termed [...] "the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it [...] "reasonable to believe" [...] that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told {{from the perspective of the}} 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2002, Lena Banks, a space {{advocate}} and founder/producer of Think Tank Ink Productions, contacted Lance Bass to propose {{his involvement in}} her Youngest Person in Space project. Banks brought her longtime associate David Krieff of Destiny Productions on board and {{through a series of}} events in August 2002, Bass entered cosmonaut training in Star City, Russia. Bass was considered as the US host of a space competition show to be entitled The Big Mission, which had been successful in Denmark, in which several contestants would go through rigorous training in order to win a <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Russian Soyuz space capsule. However, the game show concept was reconsidered, as the producers of the show decided it would be a much better idea to shoot a documentary of a celebrity actually training and going into space, and airing it on a major network. Lena Banks {{came up with the idea}} of the Youngest Person in Space many years before Dennis Tito had his historical flight. Through a series of events in early 2002 the chance of using Bass was presented when a colleague mentioned her space project to a friend and the friend's daughter shouted out, [...] "Lance Bass wants to go into space!" [...] The girl, who was an NSYNC fan, learned of Bass' lifelong dream of space travel when she read it online via a MTV forum. Lena Banks spoke to Lance Bass's management who then went to him with the proposal. [...] "At first he thought we were joking," [...] Lena Banks remarks. [...] "I assured him it was for real; he accepted and we moved forward with the project." ...|$|E
