25|$|In {{part because}} of its {{advances}} in technology and a top speed greater than existing Navy aircraft, numerous technical problems had to be solved before the Corsair entered <b>service.</b> <b>Carrier</b> suitability was a major development issue, prompting changes to the main landing gear, tail wheel and tailhook. Early F4U-1s had difficulty recovering from developed spins, since the inverted gull wing's shape interfered with elevator authority. It was {{also found that the}} Corsair's right wing could stall and drop rapidly and without warning during slow carrier landings. In addition, if the throttle were suddenly advanced (for example, during an aborted landing) the left wing could stall and drop so quickly that the fighter could flip over with the rapid increase in power. These potentially lethal characteristics were later solved through the addition of a small, -long stall strip to {{the leading edge of the}} outer right wing, just inboard of the gun ports. This allowed the right wing to stall at the same time as the left.|$|E

In December 2014, financial losses and unpaid dues led to cancellation of many domestic flights. Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued a warning to the airline over non-payment of salaries and dues and the carrier was put on cash-and-carry mode by airport operators, meaning the airline can use the airport facilities only upon prior payment of money. On 17 December 2014, all flights were grounded after oil companies refused to refuel its planes due to non-payment of dues with flights resuming the next day. [...] Flights resumed the next day.

With India opening up its airline sector for 49 percent foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2012, Tata and SIA once again decided to float a JV airline company in India.

India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board approved the JV in October 2013, allowing SIA to take a 49 percent stake in the airline.

This was part of Tata's second major foray into the aviation sector along with a minority stake in AirAsia India.
