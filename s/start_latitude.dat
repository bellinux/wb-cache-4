40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} climate change on rich and poor countries across the world. We measure two indices of the relative impact of climate across countries, impact per capita, and impact per GDP. These measures sum market impacts across the climate-sensitive economic sectors of each country. Both indices reveal that climate change will have serious distributional impact across countries, grouped by income per capita. We predict that poor countries will suffer {{the bulk of the}} damages from climate change. Although adaptation, wealth, and technology may influence distributional consequences across countries, we argue that the primary reason that poor countries are so vulnerable is their location. Countries in the low <b>latitudes</b> <b>start</b> with very high temperatures. Further warming pushes these countries ever further away from optimal temperatures for climatesensitive economic sectors. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study {{the effect of the}} Coriolis force due to solar {{rotation}} on rising magnetic flux, the authors consider a flux ring, azimuthally symmetric around the rotation axis, starting from rest {{at the bottom of the}} convection zone, and then follow the trajectory of the flux ring as it rises. If it is assumed that the flux ring remains azimuthally symmetric during its ascent, then the problem can be described essentially in terms of two parameters: the value of the initial magnetic field in the ring when it starts, and the effective drag experienced by it. For field strengths at the bottom of the convection zone of order 10, 000 G or less, it is found that the Coriolis force plays a dominant role and flux rings <b>starting</b> from low <b>latitudes</b> at the bottom are deflected and emerge at latitudes significantly poleward of sunspot zones...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of the {{observations}} of a coronal mass ejection (CME), which occurred on May 13, 2009. The most important feature of these observations is that the CME was observed from the very early stage (the solar surface) up to a distance of 15 solar radii (R_). Below 2 R_, we used the data from the TESIS EUV telescopes obtained in the Fe 171 A and He 304 A lines, and above 2 R_, we used the observations of the LASCO C 2 and C 3 coronagraphs. The CME was formed at a distance of 0. 2 - 0. 5 R_from the Sun's surface as a U-shaped structure, which was observed both in the 171 A images and in white-light. Observations in the He 304 A line showed that the CME was associated with an erupting prominence, which was located not above-as predicts the standard model-but in the lowest part of the U-shaped structure close to the magnetic X-point. The prominence location can be explained with the CME breakout model. Estimates showed that CME mass increased with time. The CME trajectory was curved-its helio-latitude decreased with time. The CME <b>started</b> at <b>latitude</b> of 50 ^∘ and reached the ecliptic plane at distances of 2. 5 R_.

40|$|We posit that accreting compact objects, {{including}} stellar mass {{black holes}} and neutron stars {{as well as}} supermassive black holes, may undergo extended periods of accretion during which the angular momentum of the disk at large scales is misaligned {{with that of the}} compact object. In such a scenario, Lense-Thirring precession caused by the rotating compact object can dramatically affect the disk. In this presentation we describe results from a three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an MRI turbulent disk accreting onto a tilted rapidly rotating black hole. For this case, the disk does not achieve the commonly described Bardeen-Petterson configuration; rather, it remains nearly planar, undergoing a slow global precession. Accretion from the disk onto the hole occurs predominantly through two opposing plunging streams that <b>start</b> from high <b>latitudes</b> with respect to both the black-hole and disk midplanes.

40|$|Observations {{show that}} solar {{activity}} is distributed non-axisymmetrically, concentrating at "preferred longitudes". This indicates {{the important role}} of non-axisymmetric magnetic fields in the origin of solar activity. We investigate the generation of the non-axisymmetric fields and their coupling with axisymmetric solar magnetic field. Our kinematic generation (dynamo) model operating in a sphere includes solar differential rotation, which approximates the differential rotation obtained by inversion of helioseismic data, modelled distributions of the turbulent resistivity, non-axisymmetric mean helicity, and meridional circulation in the convection zone. We find that (1) the non-axisymmetric modes are localised near the base of the convection zone, where the formation of active regions <b>starts,</b> and at <b>latitudes</b> around 30 ^∘; (2) the coupling of non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric modes causes the non-axisymmetric mode to follow the solar cycle; the phase relations between the modes are found.

40|$|International audienceTo {{assess the}} whole-sward maturity, {{which is a}} primary concern for {{grassland}} managers, we studied three forage grass species with contrasting phenology over a range of climatic conditions among sites. We considered two main issues: (i) How is grass population maturity related to population phenology, and is this relation affected by environmental factors? and (ii) Is the sum of temperatures a good index to describe phenological development under contrasting climates? To explore the role of temperature accumulation in species population development, we described the phenological development of populations of three grass species along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients at eight locations across France. We used a numerical index of tiller development to quantify sward morphological structure and discriminate phenological peak from average maturity. We report that phenological development rates were similar among sites for each species, but required fewer growing degree days to <b>start</b> at higher <b>latitudes</b> and altitudes. However, we found that population maturity and phenological peak differed significantly due to among-site variability in vegetative tiller percentage in whole-population biomass. Our results underlined the importance of considering tiller distribution among phenological stages, especially tiller development synchrony, together with phenology to assess sward maturity in semi-natural permanent grasslands...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{investigate}} the difference of characteristics of the auroral bulge developing during substorms related to the CME and recurrent high-speed streams. It is shown that the CME related substorms <b>start</b> at lower <b>latitudes</b> {{in comparison with the}} substorms during the recurrent streams. The longitudinal dimension of the auroral bulge is larger, but latitudinal dimension is smaller for the CME-related substorms. The influence of the solar wind parameters (solar wind velocity, V, and southward component of interplanetary magnetic field, Bs) on the bulge development is different. During the recurrent streams, the larger are V and Bs the higher is the maximal latitude of the auroral bulge. During CME the increase of V and Bs leads to decrease of the substorm maximal latitude. We suggest that these features {{can be explained by the}} different configuration of the magnetotail during solar wind streams of different nature. The results are in agreement with some earlier studies, which demonstrate that preferable conditions for the substorms to appear at very high latitudes are the recurrent high-speed solar wind streams occurred at declining stage and minimum of the solar activity cycle...|$|R

40|$|Using a 1988 - 1994 {{data set}} of {{original}} photospheric vector magnetograms {{as well as}} published data, we have studied the average magnetic helicity of 69 diverse active regions, adopting the linear force-free field parameter alpha as a measure. This average value was determined by minimizing {{the differences between the}} computed constant-alpha force-free and observed horizontal magnetic fields. The average magnetic helicity shows a sign difference at the 2 sigma level in opposite hemispheres. In our data set, 76 % of the active regions in the northern hemisphere have negative helicity, and 69 % in the southern hemisphere, positive. Although the data show considerable variation from one active region to the next, the data set as a whole suggest that the magnitude of the average helicity increases with solar <b>latitude,</b> <b>starting</b> at zero near the equator, reaches a maximum near 15 deg - 25 deg in both hemispheres, and drops back toward smaller values avove 35 deg - 40 deg.

Putting these low-latitude measurements in context with the global dynamics of the storm, we will present results from simulations and observations in our efforts to better understand the effects of this storm on the different regions of the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere. The consequences of the magnetospheric penetration electric field and their role in the occurrence of these equatorial spread F observations will be investigated through the results of the SAMI 3 -RCM numerical model, a coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere model with self-consistent large-scale electrodynamics. Specifically, we will investigate the transient signatures of the interplanetary magnetic field component, Bz, and its role in driving the global convection electric field and ionospheric density redistribution. Lastly, measurements from the AMPERE Birkeland currents, DMSP drift velocities and the particle flux dropouts observed from the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) will be correlated with the FPMU density depletions and each other.

40|$|A global {{climatology}} of warm {{conveyor belts}} (WCBs) is presented {{for the years}} 1979 – 2010, based on trajectories calculated with Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data. WCB trajectories are identified as strongly ascending air parcels (600 hPa in 2 days) near extratropical cyclones. Corroborating earlier studies, WCBs are more frequent during winter than summer and they ascend preferentially in the western ocean basins between 25 ° and 50 ° latitude. Before ascending, WCB trajectories typically approach from the subtropics in summer and from more midlatitude regions in winter. Considering humidity, cloud water, and potential temperature along WCBs confirms that they experience strong condensation and integrated latent heating during the ascent (typically > 20 K). Liquid and ice water contents along WCBs peak at about 700 and 550 hPa, respectively. The mean potential vorticity (PV) evolution shows typical tropospheric values near 900 hPa, followed by an increase to almost 1 potential vorticity unit (PVU) at 700 hPa, and a decrease to less than 0. 5 PVU at 300 hPa. These low PV values in the upper troposphere constitute significant negative anomalies with amplitudes of 1 – 3 PVU, which can strongly influence the downstream flow. Considering the low-level diabatic PV production, (i) WCBs <b>starting</b> at low <b>latitudes</b> (< 40 °) are unlikely to attain high PV (due to weak planetary vorticity) although they exhibit the strongest latent heating, and (ii) for those ascending at higher latitudes, a strong vertical heating gradient and high absolute vorticity are both important.

40|$|E. Walter Maunder {{created his}} first "Butterfly Diagram" showing the equatorward drift of the sunspot latitudes {{over the course}} of each of two solar cycles in 1903. This diagram was {{constructed}} from data obtained through the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) starting in 1874. The RGO continued to acquire data up until 1976. Fortunately, the US Air Force (USAF) and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have continued to acquire similar data since that time. This combined RGO/USAF/NOAA dataset on sunspot group positions and areas now extends virtually unbroken from the 19 th century to the 21 st century. The data represented in the Butterfly Diagram contain a wealth of information about solar activity and the solar cycle. Solar activity (as represented by the sunspots) appears at mid-latitudes at the start of each cycle. The bands of activity spread in each hemisphere and then drift toward the equator as the cycle progresses. Although the equator itself tends to be avoided, the spread of activity reaches the equator at about the time of cycle maximum. The cycles overlap at minimum with old cycle spots appearing near the equator while new cycle spots emerge in the mid-latitudes. Large amplitude cycles tend to have activity <b>starting</b> at higher <b>latitudes</b> with the activity spreading to higher latitudes as well. Large amplitude cycles also tend to be preceded by earlier cycles with faster drift rates. These drift rates may be tied to the Sun s meridional circulation - a component in many dynamo theories for the origin of the sunspot cycle. The Butterfly Diagram must be reproduced in any successful dynamo model for the Sun...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a continuation of}} our efforts to numerically study accretion disks that are misaligned (tilted) {{with respect to the}} rotation axis of a Kerr black hole. Here we present results of a global numerical simulation which fully incorporates the effects of the black hole spacetime as well as magnetorotational turbulence that is the primary source of angular momentum transport in the flow. This simulation shows dramatic differences from comparable simulations of untilted disks. Accretion onto the hole occurs predominantly through two opposing plunging streams that <b>start</b> from high <b>latitudes</b> with respect to both the black-hole and disk midplanes. This is due to the aspherical nature of the gravitational spacetime around the rotating black hole. These plunging streams start from a larger radius than would be expected for an untilted disk. In this regard the tilted black hole effectively acts like an untilted black hole of lesser spin. Throughout the duration of the simulation, {{the main body of the}} disk remains tilted with respect to the symmetry plane of the black hole; thus there is no indication of a Bardeen-Petterson effect in the disk at large. The torque of the black hole instead principally causes a global precession of the main disk body. In this simulation the precession has a frequency of 3 (M_/M) Hz, a value consistent with many observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations. However, this value is strongly dependent on the size of the disk, so this frequency may be expected to vary over a large range. Comment: Accepted to ApJ. 32 pages, 16 fig.

40|$|International audienceWe {{carried out}} {{detailed}} geomorphological mapping of Titan's mid-latitude region {{south of the}} Belet Sand Sea. We used radar data collected by Cassini's Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as our basemap, supplemented by spectro-images from VIMS, images from ISS, SARtopo, and microwave emissivity datasets. We mapped at a scale of 1 : 800, 000 {{in all areas of}} the South Belet region covered by SAR swaths, taking into consideration the 300 m/pixel resolution of the swaths. For the mid-latitudes, we have defined five broad classes of terrains following Malaska et al. (2016). These terrain classes are craters, hummocky/mountainous, labyrinth, plains, and dunes. We have found that the hummocky/mountainous terrains are the oldest, with a radiometric signature consistent with icy materials. Dunes are the youngest units and return a radiometric signature consistent with organic sediments. The South Belet region of Titan is primarily covered by the dune and plain units (specifically the undifferentiated plains) typical of the mid-latitudes (Malaska et al. 2016). Previous mapping efforts of the mid-latitude regions of Titan (Lopes et al. 2016; Malaska et al. 2016) have indicated that these regions are predominately modified and influenced by aeolian activities. A plain unit designated "scalloped plains" is prominently featured between the 50 °S and 60 °S latitudes of this region. In this area we also find a terrain unit (dark irregular plains) that has been interpreted as damp materials saturated with liquid hydrocarbons (Malaska et al 2016; Hayes et al. 2008). We also note a higher identification of fluvial channels <b>starting</b> at this <b>latitude</b> zone and extending poleward. We suggest that these features demark the transition zone between mid-latitude/equatorial aeolian-dominated processes and fluvial-dominated processes prevailing at the poles. References: Lopes, R. M.

40|$|Since {{the last}} decades, the {{functioning}} of society depends {{more and more on}} well-functioning communication and navigation systems. As the availability and reliability of most of these satellite-based systems can be severely impacted by ionospheric storms, the accurate forecast of these events becomes a required task for mitigating social and economic risks. Here we aim to make initial steps toward an empirical model for ionospheric perturbations related to space weather events that are observable in the total electron content (TEC). The perturbation TEC forecast model will be a fast and robust approach, improving TEC forecasts based on climatological models during storm conditions. The derivation of such a model is a challenging task, because although a general dependence of the storm features (enhancement or depletion of electron density) on the storm onset time, local time, season and geomagnetic latitude is well known, there is a large deviation from the mean behavior. For a better understanding of storm conditions, this paper presents analyses of ionospheric storms observed in the TEC, broken down into diverse classes of storms. It provides a detailed characterization of the typical ionospheric storm behavior over Europe from high to midlatitudes, beyond case studies. Generally, the typical clear strong TEC enhancement <b>starting</b> in high <b>latitudes</b> and propagating equatorward is found to be strongest for storms starting in the morning hours independent of the season. In midlatitudes, it is strongest during noon. In addition, a clear difference between summer and winter storms is reported. While only winter storms develop high-latitude TEC enhancements, only summer storms typically exhibit TEC depletions during the storm recovery phase. During winter storms TEC enhancements can also occur the day following the storm onset, in contrast to summer storms. Strong correlation of TEC perturbation amplitudes to the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field and to a proxy of the polar cap potential are shown especially for summer midlatitude TEC enhancements during storms with and onset in the morning hours (6 to 12 UT over Europe) and for winter high-latitude TEC enhancements (around 60 ∘N). The results indicate the potential to derive improved predictions of maximum TEC deviations during space weather events, based on solar wind measurements...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of variance (ANOVA) study was conducted for historical hurricane data dating back to 1851 that {{was obtained from the}} U. S. Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The data set was chosen because it is a large, publicly available collection of information, exhibiting great variability which has made the forecasting of future states, from current and previous states, difficult. The availability of substantial, high-fidelity validation data, however, made for an excellent uncertainty assessment study. Several factors (independent variables) were identified from the data set, which could potentially influence the track and intensity of the storms. The values of these factors, along with the values of responses of interest (dependent variables) were extracted from the data base, and provided to a commercial software package for processing via the ANOVA technique. The primary goal {{of the study was to}} document the ANOVA modeling uncertainty and predictive errors in making predictions about hurricane location and intensity 24 to 120 hours beyond known conditions, as reported by the data set. A secondary goal was to expose the ANOVA technique to a broader community within NASA. The independent factors considered to have an influence on the hurricane track included the current and <b>starting</b> longitudes and <b>latitudes</b> (measured in degrees), and current and starting maximum sustained wind speeds (measured in knots), and the storm starting date, its current duration from its first appearance, and the current year fraction of each reading, all measured in years. The year fraction and starting date were included in order to attempt to account for long duration cyclic behaviors, such as seasonal weather patterns, and years in which the sea or atmosphere were unusually warm or cold. The effect of short duration weather patterns and ocean conditions could not be examined with the current data set. The responses analyzed were the storm latitude, longitude and intensity, as recorded in the data set, 24 or 120 hours beyond the current state. Several ANOVA modeling schemes were examined. Two forms of validation were used: 1) comparison with official hurricane prediction performance metrics and 2) cases studies conducted on hurricanes from the 2005 season, which were not included within the model construction and ANOVA assessment. In general, the ANOVA technique did not perform as well as the established official prediction performance metrics published by NOAA; still, the technique did remarkably well in this demonstration with a difficult data set and could probably be made to perform better with more knowledge of hurricane development and dynamics applied to the problem. The technique provides a repeatable prediction process that eliminates the need for judgment in the forecast...|$|R
