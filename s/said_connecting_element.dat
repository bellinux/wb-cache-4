30|$|The <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> is the {{key part}} to make steel {{supports}} yieldable. The steel support should maintain certain resistance force when it retracts, which can not only accommodate some rock deformation, but also restrain too large rock deformation to keep roadways stable. To meet the requirements mentioned above, the mechanical performance of the <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> is very important. Any <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> contains a lock unit and a friction unit. The lock unit binds the overlapping part of two segments in the support and offers compressive force. When the steel support overcomes the frictions between two segments of U-shaped steel and the <b>connecting</b> <b>element,</b> it will retract. According to the locking units, the <b>connecting</b> <b>elements</b> {{can be divided into}} bolt and wedge types. Bolt <b>connecting</b> <b>elements</b> can be subdivided into three types: a U-shaped bolt with clamping plate, double U-shaped clamping plates, and pushing bolt. Wedge <b>connecting</b> <b>elements</b> can also be subdivided into three types: wedge block (single-wedge or two-wedges), ear-shaped wedge, and buckled wedge.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{describes a}} process for the shaping of electrically conducting terminal bumps on electrically conducting microelectronic <b>connecting</b> <b>elements.</b> In conventional processes, a terminal bump is produced in a deep-draw process, whereby the <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> is pressed by a die into a recess of a substrate on which the <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> is fixed. The disadvantage is that a recess occurs next to the terminal bump on the side facing the die, said recess being deleterious for the mechanical loading capability and also for subsequent tab bonding. In the process according to the invention, however, a shaping tool is pressed onto part of {{the surface of a}} <b>connecting</b> <b>element,</b> whereby one or more terminal bumps are formed by the plastic deformation of the <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> material {{in this part of the}} surface due to the geometry of the shaping tool, however, the <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> suffers no further deformation outside said part of the surface. The advantages of the process according t o the invention are that no shaping substrate matched to the desired terminal bumps is required, that conventional wire bonding units can be used, that the process is fast, low-priced and precise and that the mechanical loading capability of a <b>connecting</b> <b>element,</b> in particular a metal lead, is [...] due to the formation. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{performed}} at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on 100 kN (22 kip) BRUbelt, produced by the Brugg Group 1. As stated on the BRUbelt website, this product consists {{of a series of}} small diameter steel cords encased in a viscoelastic material consisting of a surface that is in contact with the cords and a non-abrasive outer layer. This outer layer is predominantly used to provide corrosion protection. BRUbelt was identified as a possible candidate for implementation into various protective barrier systems being studied by the Pennsylvania State University in affiliation with the United States Department of State. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln was contracted by Penn State to ascertain mechanical properties of 100 kN (22 kip) BRUbelt with and without <b>connecting</b> <b>elements</b> in place under static and dynamic loads. These tests were intended to ascertain capacities under demands that mimicked possible conditions encountered in various protective barrier systems in the field and to provide constitutive property data to the Pennsylvania State University for possible implementation into computational models used to ascertain protective barrier system performance. Tests included static tension tests of BRUbelt specimens with and without <b>connecting</b> <b>elements,</b> static bending BRUbelt specimen tests and, based on findings during the test program, dynamic tension tests of BRUbelt specimens with and without <b>connecting</b> <b>elements.</b> Static tension tests showed consistent material properties, with the material largely failing in a brittle fashion and with a mean static tensile capacity of 112 kN (25 kips), an ultimate strength of 2316 MPa (336 ksi) and an elastic modulus of 18047 MPa (2618 ksi). BRUbelt with and without <b>connecting</b> <b>elements</b> displayed identical behavior under static loads, which indicated that the examined <b>connecting</b> <b>elements</b> did not adversely degrade specimen strength or stiffness. Static out-of-plane tests showed minimal flexural stiffness but did show that local bearing effects can affect the strength under tight radius bearing points.

These equations serve as useful tools for analyzing the relative merits of candidate station locations for <b>connected</b> <b>element</b> interferometry (CEI). The navigation performance of a short baseline interferometer located at the Deep Space Network's (DSN's) Goldstone intracomplex is compared with that which is presently achievable using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) over intercontinental baselines.
