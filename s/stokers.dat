5|$|Designed for {{overseas}} service protecting Germany's maritime trade, Hansa {{spent the first}} nine years of her career abroad. In 1884, {{it was found that}} her hull was badly corroded; this stemmed from the lengthy construction period, during which the iron had already begun to corrode. As a result of the poor shape of her hull, Hansa was removed from active service in 1884 and used as a guard ship in Kiel. While in Kiel, she was also used as a training ship for engine-room personnel and <b>stokers.</b> She was formally stricken from the naval register on 6 August 1888. She was then used as a floating barracks in Kiel, until 1905. Hansa was then moved to Mönkeberg, hulked, and used to train <b>stokers.</b> The ship did not last long in this service, and was sold in March 1906 for 96,000marks. Hansa was broken up later that year in Swinemünde.|$|E
5|$|Saint Louis was {{disarmed}} and decommissioned on 8 February {{and became}} a training ship for <b>stokers</b> and engineers in Toulon. The ship was condemned on 20 June 1920, although she was converted into an accommodation hulk. Saint Louis listed for disposal on 29 June 1931, but was not purchased, for 600,230 francs, until 24 May 1933.|$|E
5|$|In March 1919, Princess Matoika and Rijndam raced {{each other}} from Saint-Nazaire to Newport News in a {{friendly}} competition that received national press coverage in the United States. Rijndam, the slower ship, was just able to edge out the Princess—and cut two days from her previous fastest crossing time—by appealing to {{the honor of the}} soldiers of the 133rd Field Artillery (returning home aboard the former Holland America liner) and employing them as extra <b>stokers</b> for her boilers.|$|E
50|$|Dracula the Un-dead is {{a sequel}} to Bram <b>Stoker's</b> classic novel Dracula. The book was written by Bram <b>Stoker's</b> great grand-nephew Dacre <b>Stoker</b> and Ian Holt. Previously, Holt had been a direct-to-DVD horror screenwriter, and <b>Stoker</b> a track and field coach.|$|R

5000|$|Canadian writer Dacre <b>Stoker,</b> a great-grandnephew of Bram <b>Stoker,</b> {{decided to}} write [...] "a sequel that bore the <b>Stoker</b> name" [...] to [...] "reestablish {{creative}} control over" [...] the original novel, with encouragement from screenwriter Ian Holt, because of the Stokers' frustrating history with Dracula's copyright. In 2009, Dracula: The Un-Dead was released, written by Dacre <b>Stoker</b> and Ian Holt. Both writers [...] "based work on Bram <b>Stoker's</b> own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition" [...] along with their own research for the sequel. This also marked Dacre <b>Stoker's</b> writing debut.|$|R
5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of <b>stokers</b> {{to do it}} by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This meant that the boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{fitted in}} well at Stoke, as Waddington built {{a team of}} veteran players who were judged {{by some to be}} past their best. The Potters {{struggled}} near the foot of the First Division table in the 1967–68 and 1968–69 campaigns, before rising to ninth place in the 1969–70 season. Banks remained a reliable stopper for the club, though on 1 March 1969 he was knocked unconscious at Roker Park by Sunderland's Malcolm Moore, and his replacement David Herd conceded four goals in a 4–1 defeat. Banks also played a season for the Cleveland <b>Stokers</b> of the American United Soccer Association in the summer of 1968: he played seven of the short-lived club's 12 games in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Psara and {{her sisters}} saw {{extensive}} service with the Greek Navy. They participated in the Greco–Turkish War in 1897 until the Great Powers intervened and prevented the Greek Navy from capitalizing on their superiority over the Ottoman Navy. Psara saw action in the First Balkan War at the Naval Battle of Elli and {{was present at the}} Naval Battle of Lemnos, but was too slow to actively engage the Ottoman forces. She did not see action during World War I, and was reduced to a training ship for <b>stokers</b> {{after the end of the}} war. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1932.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commanded}} by 62-year-old Captain Edward John Smith, {{the most senior}} of the White Star Line's captains. He had four decades of seafaring experience and had served as captain of , from which he was transferred to command Titanic. The {{vast majority of the}} crew who served under him were not trained sailors, but were either engineers, firemen, or <b>stokers,</b> responsible for looking after the engines; or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers. The 6watch officers and 39able-bodied seamen constituted only around 5percent of the crew, and most of these had been taken on at Southampton so had not had time to familiarise themselves with the ship.|$|E
5|$|From 1905, Giovanni Bausan {{served as}} a {{training}} ship for <b>stokers</b> and mechanics until {{the outbreak of the}} Italo-Turkish War in 1912. Returning to active duty as Flagship Cyrenaica, she served in the shore bombardment role {{until the end of the}} war, when she was again returned to second-line service as a distilling ship. Fitted with four distillers and capable of producing 200 tons of fresh water every 24 hours, she was operating in this role at the start of the First World War. Because of the pressing need for artillery for service with the army, Giovanni Bausan was partially disarmed in 1915, losing her 10-inch guns and two of the 6-inch pieces. Later in the war, the rest of her armament was removed. She was reassigned for service as a seaplane depot ship at Brindisi. Decommissioned in 1919, she was sold for scrap in March 1920 and broken up soon after.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{after he was}} called back for army service and he was {{stationed}} in the northern suburb of Broadmeadows. However, he had disciplinary problems and disliked taking orders from his officers, whom he often felt were inferior to him. He left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as <b>stokers.</b> When the navy would not take his friend, Miller tore up his paperwork in protest, left the recruiting office, and walked {{around the corner to}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office. He was acutely aware of the risks, as many of his playing colleagues had been killed, injured or captured. The threat of combat increased when the Pacific Theatre of World War II opened on 7 December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The 194142 cricket season was cancelled and many cricket and football grounds were converted into army bases.|$|E
5000|$|On 8 November 1847, Abraham (Bram) <b>Stoker</b> {{was born}} in Dublin, Ireland. His father worked as a civil servant {{and his mother was}} a charity worker and writer. During <b>Stoker's</b> {{childhood}} he spend many days in bed due to different illnesses. While <b>Stoker</b> was bedridden, his mother would tell him horror stories which may have influenced his novels and writings. In 1864 <b>Stoker</b> began school at the Trinity College, Dublin. During his time at the university, he worked part time as a freelance journalist and drama critic. [...] A few years later in 1878, <b>Stoker</b> met Henry Irving and they became friends. Two years later <b>Stoker</b> accepted a job to work as Irving's personal assistant in London. <b>Stoker's</b> first book, The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland, was written in Dublin and published in 1879. His first fictional book, Under the Sunset was published in 1881. <b>Stoker</b> wrote many other novels and short stories however the author is best known for Dracula. <b>Stoker</b> died of exhaustion at the age of 64 after writing a total of eighteen books.|$|R

5|$|Australian ships {{first saw}} action Asian and Pacific theatre; {{assisting}} {{in the attack}} on German New Guinea by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN). Germany had colonised the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups in 1884, and the colony was currently used as a wireless radio base, Britain required the wireless installations to be destroyed because they were used by the German East Asia Squadron which threatened merchant shipping in the region. The objectives of the force were the German stations at Yap in the Caroline Islands, Nauru, and Rabaul in New Britain. On 30 August 1914, the AN left Sydney {{under the protection of}} Australia and Melbourne for Port Moresby, where the force met the Queensland contingent, aboard the transport HMAHS Kanowna. The force then sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, leaving Kanowna behind when her <b>stokers</b> refused to work. Sydney and her escorting destroyers met the AN off the eastern tip of New Guinea. Melbourne was detached to destroy the wireless station on Nauru, while on 14 September, Encounter bombarded a ridge near Rabaul, while half a battalion advanced towards the town. The only major loss of the campaign was the disappearance of the submarine AE1 during a patrol off Rabaul on 14 September 1914.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, Zähringen and {{her four}} sisters sortied {{in an attempt}} to locate Russian {{warships}} off Gotland, but returned to port two days later without having engaged any opponents. Additionally, the threat from submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships from active service. Zähringen and most of the other IV Squadron ships left Libau on 10 November, bound for Kiel; upon arrival the following day, they were designated the Reserve Division of the Baltic. The ships were anchored in Schilksee in Kiel. On 31 January, the division was dissolved, and the ships were dispersed for subsidiary duties. Zähringen was initially used as a training ship in Kiel. In 1917, the ship was used to train <b>stokers</b> but then became a target ship for torpedo boats and the old ironclad , which had by that time become a torpedo training ship. Later, the Kaiserliche Marine considered replacing the cruiser , then the gunnery training ship, with Zähringen, and work began to refit her for this duty on 22 July 1918. The repairs and modifications had not been completed {{by the end of the}} war, however. The ship was left in Germany, and on 13 December was placed out of service.|$|E
5|$|The AN {{comprised}} one {{battalion of}} infantry of 1,000men hurriedly enlisted in Sydney, plus 500naval reservists and ex-sailors who {{would serve as}} infantry. The 1st Battalion, AN was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell Watson, while the naval reservists were formed into six companies under Commander Joseph Beresford. Also included were two machine gun sections, a signals section and a medical detachment. Another battalion of militia from the Queensland-based Kennedy Regiment—which had been dispatched to garrison Thursday Island—also contributed 500volunteers. Recruitment began on 11 August, with the {{very few of the}} infantry having had previous military experience. Under the overall command of Colonel William Holmes, the force departed Sydney on 19 August aboard HMAS Berrima and halted at Palm Island off Townsville until a New Zealand force, escorted by the battlecruiser HMAS Australia, cruiser HMAS Melbourne and the French cruiser Montcalm, occupied Samoa on 30 August. The AN then moved to Port Moresby, where it met the Queensland contingent already aboard the transport Kanowna. The force sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, although Kanowna was left behind when her <b>stokers</b> refused to work. The militia were also left in Port Moresby after Holmes decided they were not sufficiently trained or equipped to be committed to the anticipated fighting.|$|E

5|$|After {{taking the}} place of winger Gerry Bridgwood in the first team, he made an instant impact on his debut on 6 September 1967, by scoring the winning goal in a 3–2 victory over Leicester City at the Victoria Ground. Though Conway only made nine league {{appearances}} in the 1967–68 season, he was present {{on the final day}} 2–1 win over Liverpool which kept Stoke out of the First Division relegation zone. He was again registered with the Cleveland <b>Stokers</b> – now in the North American Soccer League – in the summer of 1968, but did not play a first team game for the club. He started to become a first team regular for Stoke in the 1968–69 season after scoring against Liverpool at Anfield on 20 August, and went on to score in four consecutive games over the Christmas period. Waddington did though sometimes prefer to play John Mahoney to Conroy, using Mahoney as an extra defensive midfielder to make Stoke more solid defensively. Conroy also damaged cartilage in his knee after being challenged heavily by Manchester City's left-half Alan Oakes in a 3–1 defeat at Maine Road on 29 March, and was ruled out of action for five months. After recovering he went on to make 33 appearances in the 1969–70 campaign, and got some measure of revenge over Manchester City at Maine Road on 17 January by scoring the only goal of the game after dribbling past three defenders from the half-way line.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 March, while sailing near the Louisiade Islands, one of the ship's <b>stokers</b> was stabbed {{fourteen}} times, and died from peritonitis during the night. Before dying, the stoker informed the ship's surgeon that he had threatened to expose the homosexual relationship between two other <b>stokers,</b> {{which led to the}} attack. The two accused <b>stokers</b> were imprisoned, and a court-martial was held between 15 and 18 March, while the ship was anchored at Nouméa. The <b>stokers</b> were found guilty of the first ever murder aboard an Australian warship; under British naval regulations (which the RAN was operating under), the men were to be hanged from the cruiser's yardarm. However, despite Captain Harold Farncomb's aggressive prosecution of the two men, he successfully requested that the death sentences be put off at least until the ship returned home. As the men were convicted under British military law, the matter of commuting their sentences was out of Australian hands until an appeal for clemency was made to King George VI, who downgraded the sentence to life imprisonment. This situation had arisen because the Australian government had not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster 1931, a British Act which defined the Dominions as sovereign governments capable of amending or repealing previous British legislation affecting them, while preventing the British government from legislating on the Dominions' behalf unless requested. Prompted by the murder, along with issues relating to the legal control of shipping in Australian ports, and the National Security Act, a bill ratifying the Statute was passed on 9 October and backdated {{to the start of the}} war. The sentences of the two <b>stokers</b> were reduced several times, and they were freed in September 1950.|$|E
