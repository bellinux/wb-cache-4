A major hindrance to full industrialisation was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first <b>state-owned</b> <b>oil</b> <b>company</b> in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.|$|E

However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} oil elite {{formation in}} light of the wider transformation that is taking place in the global oil order due to the rise of powers from the Global South, including Russia: in particular, the expansion and integration of the <b>state-owned</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> into the global oil market. This is done by analysing the networks that the directors of the world's largest <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> create through their affiliations with a) other corporations, b) policy planning bodies and c) with the state. The most important finding is that the increased cooperation between the Western private <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> and the non-Western <b>state-owned</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> has not yet translated into increased integration between their respective elite networks. It is argued that this indicates we are witnessing a transition towards a more multi-polar global oil order that increasingly needs {{to take into account the}} rising powers of the Global South. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|R

A decade earlier, the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor Robert Baltosser, but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by Pemex corporate policy of the time. Penfield found another arc on the peninsula itself, the ends of which pointed northward. Comparing the two maps, he found the separate arcs formed a circle, [...] wide, centered near the Yucatán village Chicxulub; he felt certain the shape had been created by a cataclysmic event in geologic history.|$|E
500|$|Since 1975, {{and as a}} {{response}} to the shock caused by the first oil crisis, the Brazilian government implemented the National Alcohol Program -Pró-Álcool- (...) , a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out automotive fuels derived from fossil fuels in favor of ethanol made from sugar cane. It began with a low blend of anhydrous alcohol with regular gasoline in 1976, and since July 2007 the mandatory blend is 25% of alcohol or gasohol E25. In 1979, and as {{a response}} to the second oil crisis, the first vehicle capable of running with pure hydrous ethanol (E100) was launched to the market, the Fiat 147, after testing with several prototypes developed by Fiat, Volkswagen, GM and Ford. The Brazilian government provided three important initial drivers for the ethanol industry: guaranteed purchases by the <b>state-owned</b> <b>oil</b> <b>company</b> Petrobras, low-interest loans for agro-industrial ethanol firms, and fixed gasoline and ethanol prices. After reaching more than 4 million cars and light trucks running on pure ethanol by the late 1980s, the use of E100-only vehicles sharply declined after increases in sugar prices produced shortages of ethanol fuel.|$|E

On 12 July 2017, he received a sentence of nine {{and a half years in}} prison. However, he remained free pending his appeal. Lula's lawyer accused the judge of bias, and the judge replied that nobody – not even the former president – should be above the rule of law. The sentence will be reviewed by an appeals court, a process that may take nearly eight months. If the sentence is confirmed, Lula will be barred from running for office for almost 19 years, twice as long as his sentence. He also faces other charges including money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice. If Lula cannot run for president as he plans, this would have a strong effect on the 2018 presidential elections, as Lula is a popular candidate and his absence would generate a big power vacuum in the left.|$|E
