40|$|AbstractThe {{extremely}} high superheat degree of regenerative extraction steam in double reheat systems {{lead to a}} large temperature difference in the heat transfer process and worse thermal performance. This paper presents two typical systems that {{can contribute to the}} reasonable use of the extraction steam superheat. These systems are double reheat <b>system</b> <b>with</b> outer steam coolers and double reheat <b>system</b> <b>with</b> a regenerative steam turbine. Thermodynamic and techno-economic analyses are conducted to reveal the energy-saving effects of different systems. The results show that: the power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>with</b> outer steam coolers increases by 0. 16 %-points compared with the conventional double reheat system. The power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>with</b> a regenerative steam turbine can further increase by 0. 51 % points. Moreover, the cost of electricity of the <b>system</b> <b>with</b> a regenerative steam turbine is relatively lower than the <b>system</b> <b>with</b> outer steam coolers. This indicates that the two measures are both effective to use the superheat of the extraction steam. In addition, the <b>system</b> <b>with</b> a regenerative steam turbine is better than the <b>system</b> <b>with</b> outer steam coolers in both thermal and economic performances...|$|R
