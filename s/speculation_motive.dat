40|$|The {{subprime}} crisis {{that occurred in}} the United States in 2007 / 2008 is clear evidence of major role of the housing sector in the business cycle and economic stability. Theoretically, there is direction causality between property prices and bank credit. The availability of bank credit will increase demand for housing {{and at the same time}} can increase the price of housing, as a result of lower loan interest rates as a signal on expectations of good economic conditions and liquidity convenience faced by households (Oikarinen 2009). Based on studies in several countries, the property sector has the multiplier-effect which triggers series of other economic sectors will activities, both directly and indirectly. The attention of Bank Indonesia as the monetary policy regulator on the growth of housing financing or mortgages and property prices is intensified due to {{subprime crisis}}. Moreover, with the increasing of housing financing data and residential property price index in the primary market which has been outpacing the growth of GDP since 2013. Bank Indonesia had enforced the regulation of the LTV/FTV to increase the bank's prudential aspects in property ownership lending and collateral based-property consumer credit since June 2012 and continue to be revised in accordance with the conditions of economic development and growth of the national credit. Despite conventional banking and Islamic banking housing financing are parts of the aggregate national banking credit, the response shown in facing the macroeconomic changes and property prices can be estimated different. It is because the tenor of its housing financing is usually longer than other financing, also due to sufficient collateral. Due to the differences of system banking operational, the response of Islamic banking housing financing and its NPF is estimated different from the response of the conventional banking housing financing and its NPL. It is because Islamic banking has a regulation that the funds management by and granted to the debtor should be based on clear goods (materiality), while in the conventional banks have no such regulation. This study therefore aims to; 1) Analyze the causality between the variables of macroeconomic changes and aggregate and disaggregate residential property price and the housing financing of conventional banking and Islamic banking, including their NPF / NPL, 2) Analyze the response of the housing financing of conventional banking and Islamic banking and their NPF / NPL in facing macroeconomic changes and aggregate property prices, 3) Analyze the response of the housing financing of conventional banking and Islamic banking and their NPF / NPL in facing macroeconomic changes and disaggregate property prices 4) Formulate alternative managerial implications for policy maker and both types of banks in responding to macroeconomic changes. This study applied quantitative methods with econometric approach and Vector Error Correction Models. Based on disaggregate data, conventional banking mortgage in all types of house (large, medium, small) is influenced by GDP and is not sensitive to interest rates and property prices changes. This indicates its debtor behavior is oriented to investment with <b>speculation</b> <b>motive.</b> It is in accordance with the classical economic theory, that households are likely to increase consumption and investment in line with economic growth. By investing in residential property assets, households have expected to obtain capital gains on house prices in the future. Similarly the middle segment of Islamic banking which also gives the same behavior and even inclines to show wealth effect symptoms, that the increasing of house prices led to homeowners feel wealthier so that it will induce households to increase levels of consumption and investment which resulted to an increase in demand for credit. On the other hand, the segment of small and large Sharia housing provide different behaviors that disposed to make the house for consumption prominence (occupied). When the household income increases, households tend to pay off the outstanding financing owned. The implications that can be formulated is the intervention policy in stimulate or dampening housing financing should be more focused to the stabilization of house prices, GDP growth, monetary policy and the right target without hampering economic growth. Based on disaggregate data analysis, Bank Indonesia needs to be conservative on the growth of conventional mortgage in all types whether it is large, medium or small, especially second and subsequent house ownership. It is also required in-depth review in regards to ease the implementation of FTV for Islamic banking considering the behavioral responses which is given by Islamic banking financing for large house segment tend to opposite the wealth effect theory. By leniency or easing of the FTV policy in this segment, growth of Islamic banking assets is expectedly boosted considering the composition of Islamic mortgage banking is only 20 percent of the total national mortgage financing. In addition, it may consider implementing fiscal policy to dampen the growth of financing and house price increasing since the reference interest rate is uneffective in reducing the rate of growth of mortgage financing. The strategies that can be applied by both type of banks are : to maintain the quality of growth mortgage loan by establishing loan review process and monitoring process in comply with credit / financing policy; applying the funding limit exposure to every segment of the house types; considering the growth factors of house prices, interest rates and GDP in formulating strategy...|$|E

Early <b>speculation</b> about <b>motive</b> suggested that Gale, who was a Pantera fan, might have turned to violence in response to the breakup of the band, or the public dispute between Abbott and Pantera singer Phil Anselmo, but these were later ruled out by investigators. In VH1's documentary, Behind the Music, Damageplan's sound engineer Aaron Barnes stated that the whole time, after shooting Dimebag, Gale was looking for Vinnie, possibly planning to murder him too. Another conjecture was that Gale believed Abbott had stolen a song that he had written. About six months prior to the shooting, Gale got into an altercation at a Damageplan concert in Cincinnati where he damaged $5,000 worth of equipment while being removed from the stage by security.|$|R

5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity.

The Cambridge theory did not assume that money demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant steps toward the concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions and to maintain liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third <b>motive,</b> <b>speculation,</b> to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|R
5000|$|He {{notes that}} a {{particular}} datum almost entirely ignored by whiteness studies scholars is religion, which has played {{a prominent role in}} conflicts among various American classes. He says that a type of [...] "keyword literalism" [...] persists in whiteness studies, where important words and phrases from primary sources are taken out of their historical context. Whiteness has so many different definitions that the word is [...] "nothing less than a moving target." [...] Arnesen notes that whiteness studies scholars are entirely on the far left of the political spectrum, and suggests that their apparent vitriol towards white Americans {{is due in part to}} white workers not fulfilling the predictions of Marxist theory that the proletariat would overcome racial, national and class distinctions to unite and overthrow capitalism. He cites, as an example, David Roediger’s afterword to the seminal Wages of Whiteness, which asserts that the book was written as a reaction to [...] "the appalling extent to which white male workers voted for Reaganism in the 1980s." [...] Arnesen argues that in the absence of supporting evidence, whiteness studies often rely on amateurish Freudian <b>speculation</b> about the <b>motives</b> of white people: [...] "The psychoanalysis of whiteness here differs from the 'talking cure' of Freudianism partly in its neglect of the speech of those under study." [...] Without more accurate scholarship, Arnesen writes that [...] "it is time to retire whiteness for more precise historical categories and analytical tools." ...|$|R
5000|$|Not long after, on August 26, Ebenezer Mackintosh led a riot that {{destroyed}} three houses, {{including that of}} lieutenant governor Thomas Hutchinson. Afterwards Mackintosh had to run for his life, breaking up his possessions, including his many manuscripts, and stealing his money. He was, however, caught and arrested, but leading Whigs stopped the Suffolk County policeman Stephen Greenleaf from keeping him by swearing peace would be maintained in Boston only if Mackintosh was set free. Andrew Eliot, a witness of the events, {{wrote in a letter}} to a colleague, Thomas Hollis, in England: [...] "The good people of Boston are very careful to distinguish between the 14th and the 26th of August. The attack on Secretary Oliver…it is supposed was under direction of some persons of character. It is certain, people in general were not displeased. The 26th of August was under a very different direction. It was a scene of riot, drunkenness, profaneness and robbery." [...] Today there is debate about whether Mackintosh and his companions went beyond the tame protests wanted by the wealthier class. There is also <b>speculation</b> about the <b>motives</b> behind the August 26 riot and whether it was not the idea of someone other than the Loyal Nine, such as perhaps Mackintosh. Samuel Adams was, unlike with August 14, displeased by what happened on August 26, describing it as [...] "a lawless attack upon property in a case where if there had been right there was remedy." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} year the Cuban Missile Crisis threatened {{to turn the}} Cold War into a nuclear one. Soviet nuclear missiles were brought to Cuba, provocatively close to the US. The American president, John F Kennedy, insisted {{that they must be}} removed, and many thought that the world was on the brink of catastrophe with nuclear exchanges between the two super-powers. [...] Despite a public image of unflappable calm, Macmillan was by nature nervous and highly strung. During the missile crisis, Home, whose calm was genuine and innate, strengthened the Prime Minister's resolve, and encouraged him to back up Kennedy's defiance of Soviet threats of nuclear attack. [...] The Lord Chancellor (Lord Dilhorne), the Attorney General (Sir John Hobson) and the Solicitor General, (Sir Peter Rawlinson) privately gave Home their opinion that the American blockade of Cuba was a breach of international law, but he continued to advocate a policy of strong support for Kennedy. When Khrushchev backed down and removed the Soviet missiles from Cuba, Home commented: There has been a good deal of <b>speculation</b> about Russia's <b>motives.</b> To me they are quite clear. Their motive was to test the will of the United States and to see how the President of the United States, in particular, would react against a threat of force. If the President had failed for one moment in a matter which affected the security of the United States, no ally of America would have had confidence in United States protection ever again.|$|R
5000|$|Robinson {{wrote that}} The Assault on Truth was an {{indication}} of an [...] "anti-Freudian mood" [...] that was growing more aggressive in the 1980s, and of which Masson was the [...] "foremost spokesman". He suggested that Masson interpreted Freud's work {{in terms of an}} exclusive preoccupation with the seduction theory, and described him as writing in [...] "the charged language of moral indignation". Robinson accused Masson of maintaining without clear evidence that the seduction theory was correct, of largely ignoring the reasons Freud gave for abandoning the theory, and of failing to show that Freud did not consider those reasons persuasive. He noted that Masson's <b>speculations</b> about Freud's <b>motives</b> could never be conclusively disproved, but considered it implausible that Freud would surrender to peer pressure. He accused Masson of misleadingly editing Freud's letters with Fliess, and maintained that opposition to the seduction theory was based on rational skepticism rather than an inability to accept the existence of childhood sexual abuse, and that it was extremely unlikely that Freud would abandon the seduction theory out of cowardice only to then adopt the provocative theory of infantile sexuality. He was unconvinced by Masson's attempts to use evidence such as Freud's treatment of Emma Eckstein and a paper by Sándor Ferenczi to support his views. He argued that Masson favored a view of [...] "human relations in which children are both innocent and inert", and suggested that Masson's work was part of a reaction against the sexual revolution, arguing that Masson dealt with sex with [...] "joyless puritanism". He compared Masson's book to works such as Frank Sulloway's Freud, Biologist of the Mind (1979) and Marianne Krüll's Freud and His Father (1979).|$|R
