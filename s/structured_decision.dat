The blend is then used to identify a basic model to buttress the capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> of group-associated and non-group firms. In universal, the results corroborate that affiliated firms are significantly different from their independent counterparts. In terms of their capital <b>structure</b> <b>decision</b> the results show that the average leverage of affiliated firms is higher than the equivalent measures for non-affiliated firms. In terms of the main determinants of capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions,</b> we found that group association has a strong result on capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> such that group profitability has a sturdy negative effect on the leverage decisions of affiliated firms. This may be that profitable groups create internal capital markets to avoid having to resort to expensive external finance. Researchers also find that size, as well as growth, does not matter for the capital structure of group-affiliated firms, whereas these factors are critical for the capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> of independent firms. In addition, only liquidity has a positive force on the capital <b>structure</b> <b>decisions</b> of affiliated firms while intangibility and profitability, group debt and group size has a negative effect.

40|$|Natural {{resource}} management may {{be improved by}} synthesizing approaches for framing and addressing complex social-ecological issues. This dissertation examines how <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> making processes, including adaptive management, can incorporate resilience thinking. <b>Structured</b> <b>decision</b> making is a process for establishing a solid understanding of the problem, values, management options, and potential consequences. Adaptive management {{is a form of}} <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> making in which uncertainty is reduced for iterative decisions through designed monitoring and review. Resilience thinking can help conceptualize complex social-ecological systems and draws attention to the risks of managing for narrowly-focused objectives. ^ This dissertation provides practical advice to managers and can facilitate discussions regarding how to make wise decisions in complex social-ecological systems. Specifically, I explore how an iterative <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> making process can contribute to the resilience of an oak forest in southeastern Nebraska. Chapter 2 discusses how a <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> making process can emphasize principles of resilience thinking. I present a suite of management recommendations, drawing on information from practitioners’ guides and using oak forest conservation as a case study. Chapter 3 demonstrates how oak forest models can reflect elements of resilience thinking and be used to identify optimal policies. I quantify a state-and-transition model into a Markov decision process by establishing transition probabilities based on resilience assumptions and setting the time horizon (infinite), discount factor, and reward function. Limitations are discussed, including that the optimal policy is sensitive to uncertainty about aspects of the Markov decision process. Chapter 4 provides a practical method for incorporating adaptive management projects into State Wildlife Action Plans, in part based on experience with conservation planning in Nebraska. I present a dichotomous key for identifying when to use adaptive management and a basic introduction to developing adaptive management projects are presented. Chapter 5 describes an initial effort to reduce uncertainty for oak forest conservation in southeastern Nebraska. I use multimodel inference to explore different hypotheses about what environmental and management variables are correlated with oak seedling abundance. The results indicate that the number of large oaks is an important factor. I discuss adaptive management as a potential means for further investigating management effects. Chapter 6 synthesizes the dissertation by considering the management implications for oak forest conservation in southeastern Nebraska, identifying general challenges and limitations, presenting methods for improving the framework, and returning to the broader goal of implementing the social-ecological systems paradigm. ...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a framework for <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> making that has been developed in a neonatal intensive care unit and to demonstrate its impact on the healthcare team and on survival of critically ill neonates. This framework attempts to integrate the best interests of the infants and their parents, the possibilities of high-tech neonatal intensive care interventions, and the perspective of the nurses and doctors. An external evaluation of 84 sessions over 3 y revealed a beneficial effect on the quality of the decision-making process itself and on the quality of the teamwork in the unit. Survival time was shorter (median 2 d, interquartile range 1 – 7 d) in 26 infants that died after <b>structured</b> <b>decision</b> making compared with 26 controls matched for gestational age, malformation and intracranial haemorrhage (median 7 d, interquartile range 4 – 15 d).

More importantly, we extend this framework in two directions: (i) We introduce a separate management claim. (ii) We introduce asymmetric information between managers and investors by assuming that claimants receive noisy signals, which they process according to rational expectation principles. Our results show, that managers always try to avoid debt, and that their optimal bankruptcy threshold is always lower, than the threshold set by equity holders.
