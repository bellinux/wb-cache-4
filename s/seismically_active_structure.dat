40|$|One {{purpose of}} {{monitoring}} earthquake activity in northeastern North America is to discover which geologic <b>structures</b> are seis-mically <b>active</b> in this region. If <b>seismically</b> <b>active</b> <b>structures</b> can be found, {{they can be}} studied to decipher their seismic history and their potential for strong earthquakes. No <b>seismically</b> <b>active</b> geologic <b>structures</b> have yet been confirmed in the northeast-ern United States (Ebel and Kafka 1991). The only earthquake with observed surface faulting in northeastern North America {{took place in the}} Ungava Peninsula of northern Quebec in 1989 (Adams et al. 1991). Other than some minor offsets of glacial striations (Oliver et al. 1970), no geologic evidence of Holocene surface faulting in the northeastern United States has been reported in the literature. Furthermore, the seismicity that has been detected by modern regional seismic networks in the northeastern United States does not align convincingly along known or suspected geologic structures. Nevertheless, the per-sistence of small-earthquake activity over time and the historic occurrences of past damaging earthquakes (e. g., Ebel 1996; Ebel 2000; Ebel et al. 2000; Ebel 2006) indicate that there must be some <b>seismically</b> <b>active</b> <b>structures</b> in the region that are capa-ble of hosting earthquakes above magnitude 6. 0. Because such earthquakes are capable of causing significant damage, there is great incentive to learn which <b>structures</b> are <b>seismically</b> <b>active</b> in this heavily populated region. Between fall 2006 and spring 2007, a sequence of earth-quakes took place near the town of Bar Harbor on Mount Desert Island on the coast of Maine (figure 1).

40|$|While nascent oceanic {{lithosphere}} at slow to fast spreading mid-ocean ridges (MOR) {{is relatively}} well studied, much less {{is known about}} the lithospheric structure and properties at ultraslow MORs. Here we present microearthquake data from a 1 year ocean bottom seismometer deployment at the amagmatic, oblique supersegment of the ultraslow spreading Southwest Indian Ridge. A refraction seismic experiment was performed to constrain upper lithosphere P-velocities and results were used to construct a 1 D velocity model for earthquake location. Earthquake foci were located individually and subsequently relocated relative to each other to sharpen the image of <b>seismically</b> <b>active</b> <b>structures.</b> Frequent earthquake activity extends to 31 km beneath the seafloor, indicating an exceptionally thick brittle lithosphere and an undulating brittle-ductile transition that implies significant variations in the along-axis thermal structure of the lithosphere. We observe a strong relation between petrology, microseismicity distribution, and topography along the ridge axis: Peridotite-dominated areas associate with deepest hypocenters, vast volumes of lithosphere that deforms aseismically as a consequence of alteration, and the deepest axial rift valley. Areas of basalt exposure correspond to shallower hypocenters, shallower and more rugged axial seafloor. Focal mechanisms deviate from pure extension and are spatially variable. Earthquakes form an undulating band of background seismicity and do not delineate discrete detachment faults as common on slow spreading ridges. Instead, the seismicity band sharply terminates to the south, immediately beneath the rift boundary. Considering the deep alteration, large steep boundary faults might be present but are entirely aseismic...|$|R
30|$|We present new {{seismicity}} and focal-mechanism {{data for}} the Fergana basin and surrounding mountain belts in western Kyrgyzstan from a temporary local seismic network. A total of 210 crustal earthquakes with hypocentral depths shallower than 25 km were observed during a 12 -month period in 2009 / 2010. The hypocenter distribution indicates a complex net of <b>seismically</b> <b>active</b> <b>structures.</b> The seismicity derived {{in this study is}} mainly concentrated {{at the edges of the}} Fergana basin, whereas the observed rate of seismicity within the basin is low. The seismicity at the dominant tectonic feature of the region, the Talas-Fergana fault, is likewise low, so the fault seems to be inactive or locked. To estimate the uncertainties of earthquake locations derived in this study, a strong explosion with known origin time and location is used as a ground truth calibration event which suggests a horizontal and vertical accuracy of about 1 km for our relocations. We derived 35 focal mechanisms using first motion polarities and retrieved a set of nine moment tensor solutions for earthquakes with moment magnitude (Mw) ranging from 3.3 to 4.9 by waveform inversion. The solutions reveal both thrust and strike-slip mechanisms compatible with a NW-SE direction of compression for the Fergana region. Two previously unknown tectonic structures in the Fergana region could be identified, both featuring strike-slip kinematics. The combined analysis of the results derived in this study allowed a detailed insight into the currently <b>active</b> tectonic <b>structures</b> and their kinematics where little information had previously been available.|$|R
40|$|Active {{deformation}} at {{the boundary}} between the Eurasia and Africa plates varies in style. The belt between the Alpine mountain range and the Mediterranean Sea, for example, differs markedly in its western and eastern parts. In the western part, around southeast France, the mountains are higher, but the seismicity lower, than in the eastern part, around northern Italy and Greece. Yet the inter-plate convergence rate of 6 mm=yr varies by less than 15 % between these two areas. To better understand the behaviour of this complex plate boundary, we use geodesy to map the spatial distribution of the deformation. In this paper, we focus on southeast France, a tectonic crossroads between three different domains (Alps, Ligurian Sea, and Massif Central) which exhibits a moderate level of seismicity. Here, the geodetic measurements imply low rates of horizontal deformation. By combining historical triangulation measurements mostly from 1947 to 1983 with Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys in 1993 and 1994, we estimate the rate of angular shear in triangular subnetworks covering the study area. The estimated strain rates in thirteen of nineteen triangles are smaller than their (1 standard deviation) uncertainties of about 0. 1 microradian=yr. This value bounds the rate of deformation for a 100 -km wide zone in Provence, between Marseilles to the south and the Ventoux massif to the north. The geodetic estimates place an upper bound of 1 to 2 mm=yr on the slip rates of two <b>seismically</b> <b>active</b> <b>structures,</b> the Durance fault and the Nı̂mes fault, assuming a fault zone 20 km wide in each case.

40|$|Low-angle normal faults {{have been}} {{extensively}} documented {{in areas of}} regional extension, in both continental and oceanic lithosphere, but their existence as <b>seismically</b> <b>active</b> <b>structures</b> remains controversial. Low-angle normal faults {{do not conform to}} 'traditional’ frictional fault theory, and large earthquakes on low-angle normal faults appear to be rare. Their enigmatic nature suggests that they may hold important clues regarding the rheology of fault zones in general, controls on frictional behaviour, and the deformation histories of the mid- to upper-crust. In this study, I investigate the internal structure, mechanical properties, and fluid flow conditions along a large-displacement low-angle normal fault exposed on the Island of Elba, Italy. Using field relationships, microstructural analysis, stable isotope geochemistry, and rock deformation experiments, I document the most important characteristics of the fault zone, and test hypotheses concerning the mechanical behaviour and evolution of low-angle normal faults. The Zuccale low-angle normal fault crosscuts and displaces a lithologically heterogeneous sequence of wall rocks. Field relationships suggest that it was active in the upper crust during the emplacement of large plutonic complexes. On a regional-scale, the Zuccale fault appears to have a long-wavelength domal morphology, which may have resulted from the intrusion of an upper-crust igneous pluton in to the shallow footwall of the fault. Pluton intrusion strongly influenced the fluid flow regimes and fault rock evolution along the Zuccale fault. Geometric and kinematic relationships between the Zuccale fault and a network of minor footwall faults suggest that the Zuccale fault slipped at a low-angle throughout most of its history. The footwall faults were active broadly contemporaneously with movement along the Zuccale fault, and controlled the distribution and connectivity of different fault rock components. This imparted a distinct mechanical structure to the fault core, potentially influencing fault zone rheology. The central core of the Zuccale fault contains a sequence of fault rocks that deformed by a variety of deformation mechanisms, and formed during progressive exhumation of the fault zone. Triaxial deformation experiments indicate that the frictional strength of many of the fault rocks is too high to explain slip along the Zuccale fault. However, several potential mechanisms of fault zone weakening have been identified, including fluid-assisted dissolution-precipitation creep, grain-size sensitive creep in calcite mylonites, frictional sliding within phyllosilicate-rich areas of the fault core, high fluid pressures, and particulate flow accommodated by fine-grained clay minerals. Fluids associated with the Zuccale fault were derived from two main sources. During the relatively early stages of movement, and particularly during the intrusion of plutonic complexes, fluids were of meteoric-hydrothermal origin. During the late stages of exhumation, fluids were derived from a seawater source that infiltrated downwards through faulted and fractured wall rocks. Sub-horizontal tensile veins carrying both fluid signatures are found adjacent to and within the fault core, suggesting that supra-lithostatic fluid pressures were able to develop throughout the exhumation history. One of the consequences of high fluid pressures was the development of a suite of fluidized fault breccias, a newly recognized type of fault rock that may be indicative of the interseismic stage of the earthquake cycle.

40|$|Carbonate-bearing normal faults are {{important}} structures for controlling fluid flow and seismogenesis within the brittle upper crust. Numerous studies {{have tried to}} characterize fault zone structure and earthquake slip processes along carbonate-bearing faults. However, due to the different scales of investigation, these studies are not often integrated to provide a comprehensive fault image. Here we present a multi-scale investigation of a normal fault exhumed from seismogenic depths. The fault extends for a length of 10 km with a maximum width of about 1. 5 km and consists of 5 sub-parallel and interacting segments. The maximum displacement (370 - 650 m) of each fault segment is partitioned along sub-parallel slipping zones extending for a total width of about 50 m. Each slipping zone is characterized by slipping surfaces exhibiting different slip plane phenomena. Fault rock development {{is controlled by the}} protolith lithology. In massive limestone, moving away from the slip surface, we observe a thin layer (< 2 cm) of ultracataclasite, cataclasite (2 - 10 cm) and fault breccia. In marly limestone, the fault rock consists of a cataclasite with hydrofractures and smectite-rich pressure solution seams. At the micro-nanoscale, the slip surface consists of a continuous and thin (< 300 μm) layer composed of coarse calcite grains (~ 5 - 20 μm in size) associated with sub-micrometer grains showing fading grain boundaries, voids and/or vesicles, and suggesting thermal decomposition processes. Micrometer-sized calcite crystals show nanoscale polysynthetic twinning affected by the occurrence of subgrain boundaries and polygonalized nanostructures. Investigations at the kilometres-tens of meter scale provide fault images that can be directly compared with high-resolution seismological data and when combined can be used to develop a comprehensive characterization of <b>seismically</b> <b>active</b> fault <b>structures</b> in carbonate lithologies. Micro and nanoscale investigations along the principal slipping zone suggest that different deformation processes, including plastic deformation and thermal decomposition, were active during seismic slip. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
