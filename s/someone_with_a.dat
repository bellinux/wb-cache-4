5|$|Though {{the episode}} itself was penned by Jeremy Carver, the writing staff contributed their {{ideas to the}} storyline. Within five minutes of brainstorming, they envisioned three scenes they had to do: the teaser, where a {{grandfather}} pretending to be Santa is pulled up the chimney and slaughtered; a boy witnessing the Santa-dressed villain brutally killing his father and then eating one of the cookies for Santa; and the Winchesters killing <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Christmas tree.|$|E
5|$|Despite the one-sided {{national}} loss in 1984, Ferraro {{was still}} viewed as <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bright political future. Many {{expected her to}} run in the 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in , she said she would not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.|$|E
5|$|In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle {{group who}} {{were looking for}} <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> proper drum kit so that the group could {{transition}} from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as Starr Time.|$|E

5|$|On June24,2011, it was {{reported}} that Brulé had been traded along with a fourth-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for forward Ryan Smyth. Due to health concerns, the deal never materialized as Brulé had not yet been cleared to play following his concussion (under league rules, an injured player can be traded but cannot be bought out, which is what the Kings had planned on doing). Furthermore, Kings General Manager Dean Lombardi made it apparent to the media that the team wanted <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smaller salary cap hit if Brulé could not be bought out. The Oilers ultimately acquired Smyth in exchange for forward Colin Fraser (whose cap hit was over $1 million less) and a seventh-round pick in the 2012 draft.|$|E
5|$|While Osborn {{lies in the}} morgue, it is {{revealed}} that the goblin formula gave him a previously-unknown healing factor which restores him to life; {{in the process of}} sneaking out, he kills <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> similar physique to himself to feign his death. No longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, Norman escapes to Europe, where he can move freely and unnoticed. During this time abroad, believed dead by the general public, he orchestrates several plots, including replacing Aunt May with a genetically altered actress, and faking his own son's death.|$|E
5|$|World War II was raging at this time, and <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{doctorate}} {{in such a}} topic area was highly sought after by the wartime Manhattan Project, but Reynolds turned down an offer to join it. An avid surf fisherman and sailor, he aspired to join the United States Navy. He attempted to enlist, but was turned down because he wore glasses. He then lobbied the Navy, which waived this requirement. He was then commissioned as an ensign in 1943, and married Virginia Rendall, a librarian, {{while he waited for}} his first assignment.|$|E

5|$|Before Romney took over, {{the event}} was $379million short of its revenue goals. Officials had made plans to scale back the Games to {{compensate}} for the fiscal crisis, and there were fears it might be moved away entirely. In addition, the image of the Games had been damaged by allegations of bribery against top officials including prior committee president and CEO Frank Joklik. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee forced Joklik and committee vice president Dave Johnson to resign. Utah power brokers, including Governor Mike Leavitt, searched for <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scandal-free reputation to take charge of the Olympics. They chose Romney based on his business and legal expertise as well as his connections to both the LDS Church and the state. The appointment faced some initial criticism from both non-Mormons and Mormons that it represented cronyism and made the Games seem too Mormon-dominated.|$|E
5|$|Persons {{suspected}} of having sexual relations with non-Aryans were charged with Rassenschande (racial defilement) and tried in the regular courts. Evidence provided to the Gestapo for such cases was largely provided by ordinary citizens such as neighbours, co-workers, or other informants. Persons accused of race defilement were publicly humiliated by being paraded through the streets with a placard around their necks detailing their crime. Those convicted were typically sentenced to prison terms, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. As the law did not permit capital punishment for racial defilement, special courts were convened to allow {{the death penalty for}} some cases. From the end of 1935 through 1940, 1,911 people were convicted of Rassenschande. Over time, the law was extended to include non-sexual forms of physical contact such as greeting <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> kiss or an embrace.|$|E

25|$|A {{handicap}} is {{a numerical}} measure of an amateur golfer's {{ability to play}} golf {{over the course of}} 18 holes. A player's handicap generally represents the number of strokes above par that the player will make over the course of an above-average round of golf. The better the player the lower their handicap is. <b>Someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> handicap of 0 or less is often called a scratch golfer, and would typically score or beat the course par on a round of play (depending on course difficulty).|$|E
25|$|Studies such as Belief in Conspiracy Theories {{state that}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{relating to the}} assassination of JFK, the moon landing and the September 11th attacks are united by a common thread: distrust of the government-endorsed story. This leads the believer to attach other conspiracies as well. <b>Someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> distrust of the government will likely reject any and all stories or reports directly issued by state agencies or other authorities that are {{seen as part of}} the establishment. Thus, any conspiracy will seem more plausible to the conspiracy theorist because this fits with their worldview.|$|E

25|$|For the 2001 {{outbreak}} of Sudan virus in Uganda, attending a funeral of an Ebola victim was rated by the CDC {{as one of}} the top three risk factors for contracting Ebola, along with contact with a family member with Ebola or providing medical care to <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> case of Ebola virus disease. The main start of the outbreak in Sierra Leone was linked to a single funeral in which the WHO estimates as many as 365 died from Ebola disease after getting the disease at the funeral.|$|E
25|$|The Strong Egypt Party, {{headed by}} Aboul Fotouh, himself {{a former member}} of the Muslim Brotherhood, opposed el-Sisi's candidacy. Sabahi has criticized the {{possibility}} of having <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> military background become the next president, arguing that such an outcome would run counter to the goals of the Egyptian revolution. He also expressed doubt about Sisi's commitment to democracy, and argued that the Field Marshal bears a measure of direct and indirect responsibility for the human rights violations carried out during the period of the interim government. he denounced what he deemed to be the interim government's hostility toward the goals of the revolution.|$|E
25|$|The first {{emergency}} services call was reported at 11:43:14 by a student, {{though it was}} initially reported that the victim in question was bleeding from a bump to his head. The operator alerted two ambulances at 11:44:11. During the alert, gunshots were heard in the background, but the operator either did not hear them or was unable to identify them. The caller then tried to inform the operator that there was <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gun, {{but he was in}} a state of panic at the time and the operator couldn't understand the situation. At 11:46, it was finally determined a shooter was involved, and the incident was reclassified as a shooting.|$|E
40|$|Faculty {{perceptions}} of the viability of candidates with online doctorates for a tenure-track assistant professor position in management were examined. Survey results of U. S. faculty members in management departments at institutions accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) indicated that most (90 %) would not hire <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> online degree for a tenure-track faculty position. Given comparable teaching and research records, all candidates with traditional doctorates were rated higher than those with online doctorates. Common reasons given by respondents {{as to why they}} would not consider <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> online doctorate included poor quality of instruction, lack of credibility of an online degree, lack of face-to-face contact, lack of AACSB accreditation, lack of rigorous discourse, and lack of mentoring...|$|R
50|$|Criminal homicides {{also include}} {{voluntary}} and involuntary manslaughter.

25|$|In 335 BC, Corvus {{was elected}} consul {{for a fourth}} time, once again in {{response}} to an escalation in the military situation in Italy. The Sidicini had formed an alliance with the Ausones of Cales, and the Senate was keen to send out <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> proven military record. In a break with tradition, the consuls did not cast lots for their provinces, but the Senate instead assigned the area around Cales directly to Corvus. He besieged and successfully stormed the town; after its capture, the Romans established a colony there of 2,500 men. For this victory, Corvus was granted a third triumph, and the honor of carrying the agnomen Calenus.|$|E
25|$|In Puerto Rico {{they adopted}} the local customs and intermarried with the locals. One of the {{consequences}} of the diversification of the cultures is that there are many Puerto Ricans and people of Puerto Rican descent who have non-Hispanic surnames. The surnames of Puerto Ricans are not limited to those which originated in Spain. In Puerto Rico it is common for people to use both their father's and mother's surnames. It is thus not unusual to find <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-Hispanic surname and a Hispanic surname. Two examples are Ramón Power y Giralt and Demetrio O'Daly y Puente. Both of these Puerto Ricans have their father’s Irish surname and their mother’s Spanish surname.|$|E
25|$|Modigliani {{settled in}} Le Bateau-Lavoir, a commune for penniless artists in Montmartre, renting himself {{a studio in}} Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was {{characterized}} by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented—initially, at least—as one would expect {{the son of a}} family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.|$|E
