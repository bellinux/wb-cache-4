50|$|Not {{using an}} {{international}} <b>standard</b> <b>pallet</b> can increase transport costs of international trade. Export goods {{may have to}} be repalletized to suit the requirements of the destination country. In some cases they must be repalletized twice in the distribution chain, once on to a pallet suitable for international containers and again at the destination country if they are also not using a <b>standard</b> <b>pallet.</b> Likewise, import goods will not arrive on an Australian <b>standard</b> <b>pallet</b> and need repalletizing for RACE containers. The intrinsic advantage of palletized transport is that it minimises manual handling operations. These repalletizations detract from that advantage.|$|R
5000|$|Two-thirds of {{palletized}} transport within Australia {{uses the}} 1165 × 1165 <b>standard</b> <b>pallet.</b> For external use, where goods {{are to be}} shipped in ISO containers, an 1100 × 1100 mm pallet is used. [...] This is a pallet size widely used by Japan and Korea, but is also specified in the Australian <b>standard</b> for <b>pallets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A 2002 report {{commissioned}} by the Australian Department of Transport and Regional Services examined the possibility of replacing the Australian <b>standard</b> <b>pallet</b> with the ISO standard size of 1200×1000 mm. Two thirds of Australia's trade is with countries that use either this size, or the near equivalent US standard size of 48×40 inches so changing to this standard would be less costly than to other <b>standard</b> <b>pallet</b> sizes. [...] The report concluded that making this change would be worth a net present value of $2.5 billion at a discount rate of 30%, or $5.1 billion at discount rate of 20%.|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} {{width of}} 1.85 m {{was good for}} agility, but became problematic when <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> became more common. The contemporary <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> could not be placed two-across the width. The State Railways planned to modify the vehicles by replacing the platforms with the 2 m wide type, but the plan was abandoned.|$|E

50|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>pallet</b> collars are {{manufactured}} in four heights: 100, 200, 300 and 400 mm. By using the needed heights and combining them together {{it is possible}} to closely match every single package to particular products.|$|R
5000|$|No universally {{accepted}} <b>standards</b> for <b>pallet</b> dimensions exist. Companies and organizations utilize hundreds of different pallet sizes around the globe. [...] While no single dimensional <b>standard</b> governs <b>pallet</b> production, {{a few different}} sizes are widely used.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} organizations and associations around the world work towards establishing and promulgating <b>standards</b> for <b>pallets.</b> Some strive to develop universal <b>standards</b> for <b>pallet</b> dimensions, types of material used in construction, performance standards, and testing procedures. Other organizations choose to focus on <b>pallet</b> <b>standards</b> for a specific industry (such as groceries) or type of material (such as wood).|$|R
50|$|Australian RACE {{containers}} {{are also}} slightly wider to optimise {{them for the}} use of Australia <b>Standard</b> <b>Pallets.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Australian <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> {{are defined}} by Australian Standard AS:4068-1993 Flat pallets for {{materials}} handling. [...] They are usually manufactured in Hardwood, but 1165 × 1165 mm pallets can also be manufactured using lighter timber suitable for use as disposable pallets using 16 millimetre boards. Australian <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> are extensively used in Australian storage and warehousing as racking pallets {{because they can be}} removed from transport directly onto warehouse racking for storage.|$|E
50|$|Australian <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> are square {{hardwood}} pallets {{that are}} standard in Australia and non-standard {{anywhere else in}} the world.|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{a single}} {{international}} <b>standard</b> for <b>pallets</b> causes substantial continuing expense in international trade. A single standard is difficult because of {{the wide variety of}} needs a <b>standard</b> <b>pallet</b> would have to satisfy: passing doorways, fitting in standard containers, and bringing low labor costs. For example, organizations already handling large pallets often see no reason to pay the higher handling cost of using smaller pallets that can fit through doors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>pallet</b> collars are {{manufactured}} from wood plywood which provides the necessary quality. At {{the same time}} plywood, OSB or plastic pallet collars are also often used as an option. Each of the materials {{has advantages and disadvantages}} if compared to others.|$|R
50|$|Australia {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} to develop a <b>standard</b> <b>pallet.</b> During World War II the United States, as part of their logistics effort, used palletized transport on a scale never before seen. This especially impressed the Australians who were still mostly handling goods by manual effort. When the war ended, the Americans left behind in Australia their materials handling equipment and a very large stock of pallets. The Australian government formed the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool (CHEP) to exploit these assets, and it was CHEP that introduced the Australian <b>standard</b> <b>pallet.</b> The government sold the assets of CHEP in the 1950s, mostly to port authorities, but the trading name of CHEP was taken by Brambles Limited and is now the largest pallet rental business in the world.|$|R
50|$|Three {{standard}} {{sizes are}} manufactured: 600x800, 800x1200 and 1000x1200 mm. These standard sizes fill compliment {{the majority of}} most commonly used <b>standard</b> <b>pallets.</b>|$|E
5000|$|EcoDuro's <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> weigh just 9 to 19 pounds, which {{us about}} 1/3 {{the weight of}} wood pallets that are {{historically}} used. Lighter weight has advantages for reduced fuel consumption and reduced air and LTL (Less than Truck Load) shipping costs, as well as help with OSHA compliance.|$|E
5000|$|In 1951, Van Meter found {{thousands}} of discarded 3 x 3 ft <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> {{from a local}} Schlitz Brewing Company plant. This gave him the idea of building some sort of structure from these. He gathered up five truckloads of these discarded pallets and began building a tower structure in his backyard.|$|E
50|$|LTL {{shipments}} {{range from}} 50 to 7000 kg, being less than 2.5 to 8.5 m {{the majority of}} times. The average single piece of LTL freight is 600 kg {{and the size of}} a <b>standard</b> <b>pallet.</b> Long freight and/or large freight are subject to extreme length and cubic capacity surcharges.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the other standards it publishes, the European Committee for Standardization, {{also known as the}} Comité Européen de Normalisation (CEN), produces <b>standards</b> for <b>pallets.</b> While the <b>standards</b> are voluntary in nature, many companies and organizations involved in transportation have adopted them. The major <b>standard</b> for <b>pallets</b> produced by CEN is ICS: 55.180.20 General purpose pallets ...|$|R
5000|$|Able {{to carry}} 100 kg, {{large enough to}} hold full size <b>standard</b> EU <b>pallets</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Truckload {{shipments}} {{are sometimes}} {{broken down into}} individual containers and further shipped by LTL or express carriers. Packaging for TL often needs to withstand the more severe handling of individual shipments. A typical full truckload for a dry van trailer consists of 24 <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> of cargo that weighs up to 42,000 lbs. (or more).|$|E
50|$|Organizations using <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> for {{loading and}} {{unloading}} can have much lower costs for handling and storage, with faster material movement than businesses that do not. The exceptions are establishments that move small items such as jewelry or large items such as cars. But even they can be improved. For instance, the distributors of costume jewelry normally use pallets in their warehouses and car manufacturers use pallets to move components and spare parts.|$|E
50|$|Railways of Australia Container Express or RACE was a {{slightly}} wider {{version of the}} standard ISO shipping container able to take 2 Australia <b>Standard</b> <b>Pallets</b> side by side. More than 1000 units were operated by the Railways of Australia, an association of the Government-owned railways which comprised Australian National, the State Rail Authority of New South Wales, Queensland Railways, the Victorian State Transport Authority and Westrail. These entities operated in Australia prior to privatisation of freight services.|$|E
50|$|The Australian <b>Standard</b> <b>Pallet</b> {{dates back}} to World War II, while ISO {{containers}} date to the late 1950s. Although the pallet's dimensions pre-date the ISO containers, it requires less dunnage, is square, and leaves less wasted space than other pallets, including the GMA pallet. In 2010, Australia adopted the globally accepted ISPM 15 wood packaging material regulations (before {{this time it was}} hardwood and more expensive).|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s, Australia {{converted}} to the metric system. Australia pushed ahead with metrication quickly, and did this with less fuss and opposition than occurred {{in other countries}} such as the United States or the United Kingdom. In order to proceed rapidly, a quick decision was needed on pallet sizes before decisions on metrication of packaging could be made. Because of this, {{it was decided to}} retain the Australian <b>standard</b> <b>pallet,</b> despite it being peculiar to Australia.|$|R
50|$|The Australian <b>standard</b> <b>pallet</b> is {{designed}} for use with the RACE container of Australian railways. Originally the pallet was specified at 46 × 46 inches (from a nominal size of 48 × 48 inches, or 4 ft × 4 ft), but this has been metricated to the marginally smaller 1165 × 1165 mm dimensions. Two pallets will fit closely side-by-side in a RACE container. They can be stacked on two levels and one container can thus hold 20 <b>pallets.</b> A <b>standard</b> railway wagon carries three containers and can thus hold 60 pallets.|$|R
50|$|This {{small group}} of 20 wagons was {{constructed}} over the period 1963 to 1965. The design is basically a stretched version of the VLX louvre van, with many similar concepts. The interior was expanded from 20 to 26 <b>standard</b> <b>pallets.</b> The vans were also limited to 50 LT maximum capacity. The sides of the wagon were limited internally to 7 ft tall. There was more room in the centre, but the door heights {{would have been an}} issue.|$|E
50|$|They {{usually have}} loading docks to load and unload goods from trucks. Sometimes {{warehouses}} {{are designed for}} the loading and unloading of goods directly from railways, airports, or seaports. They often have cranes and forklifts for moving goods, which are usually placed on ISO <b>standard</b> <b>pallets</b> loaded into pallet racks. Stored goods can include any raw materials, packing materials, spare parts, components, or finished goods associated with agriculture, manufacturing and production. In Indian English a warehouse may {{be referred to as}} a godown.|$|E
50|$|These {{modified}} aircraft {{were designated}} C-141B. Additional 'plug' sections were added {{before and after}} the wings, lengthening the fuselage by 23 ft 4 in (7.11 m) and allowing the carriage of 103 litters for wounded, 13 <b>standard</b> <b>pallets,</b> 205 troops, 168 paratroopers, or an equivalent increase in other loads. Also added at this time was a boom receptacle for inflight refueling which gave the C-141 truly intercontinental range. The conversion program took place between 1977 and 1982, with first delivery taking place in December 1979. It was estimated that this stretching program was the equivalent of buying 90 new aircraft, in terms of increased capacity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pallet rack}} safety bolt is {{installed}} by pushing the pin through two aligning accessory {{holes in the}} pallet rack cross beam and pallet rack upright frame. The top hat or [...]75 circle {{at the top of}} the pin stops it from going all the way through the hole. The pin has a J design so it is installed horizontally and then turns vertical as it enters the upright frame. Gravity holds the pallet rack safety bolt in place. Estimated 5 seconds to install compared to 30-60 seconds for a <b>standard</b> <b>pallet</b> rack clip.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{analysis}} in the report, Australia continues to use the Australian <b>standard</b> <b>pallet.</b> [...] The cost of making the change is estimated at $600 million over ten years, which includes not only the change to the pallets themselves, but also to storage racking and other equipment. Operating costs are estimated to increase by $100 million over the same ten years: the smaller pallet means more handling operations {{for the same amount}} of goods, and a less efficient usage of truck and warehouse space (larger pallets have a greater ratio of goods to pallet and packaging).|$|R
50|$|It is amphibious {{and has a}} low ground pressure, {{enabling}} it {{to traverse}} rough terrain whilst carrying up to eight troops (and two crew), a <b>standard</b> NATO <b>pallet</b> or other stores (ammunition etc.).|$|R
