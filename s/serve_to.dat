5|$|Mantas {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial, and mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They {{have one of the}} highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M.

Many hours are spent practicing, studying game films, and strategizing {{in the hopes of}} finding valuable predictors of success. 	It is widely accepted that the primary predictor of team success lies in players ability <b>to</b> both <b>serve</b> effectively and receive serve effectively (McGown, Fronske, & Moser 2001; Papageorgiou & Spitzley 2003). Thus, it is imperative that players and coaches are aware of the best <b>serving</b> strategies <b>to</b> utilize {{during the course of a}} match. 	Though many studies have attempted <b>to</b> investigate <b>serve</b> success predictors such as mode of serves, force of serves, and rotational velocity of serves, there is a lack of research that identifies the success rates of <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> various locations on the court. 	This study investigated the success levels of <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> zones 1, 5, and 6. A total of 120 <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> each zone (total n= 360) were quality analyzed using a 0 - 3 scale (USA Volleyball, 2009). The results were then compared using an analysis of variance (p= 0. 05) to determine if there were significant differences among the means. It was found that <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> zone 6 (m= 2. 34) were received significantly easier than <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> zone 1 (m= 2. 11).

5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking the silhouette of a small fish from below.

If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community.

On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
