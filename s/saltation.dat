5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} <b>saltation.</b> The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E

Cicadas can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|E
50|$|Charles Darwin was {{influenced}} by Lyell's Principles of Geology, which explained both uniformitarian methodology and theory. Using uniformitarianism, which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed (see catastrophism), Darwin theorized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually, not in <b>saltations,</b> since <b>saltations</b> are not presently observed, and extreme deviations from the usual phenotypic variation {{would be more likely}} to be selected against.|$|R

5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during <b>saltation.</b> The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, <b>saltation</b> and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
25|$|In walking, and {{for many}} animals running, the motion of legs {{on either side of}} the body {{alternate}}s, i.e. is out of phase. Other animals, such as a horse when galloping, or an inchworm, alternate between their front and back legs. An alternative to a gait that alternates between legs is hopping or <b>saltation,</b> where all legs move together. As a main means of locomotion, this is usually found in bipeds or semi-bipeds. Among the mammals <b>saltation</b> is commonly used among macropods (kangaroos and their relatives), jerboas, springhares, kangaroo rats, hopping mice, gerbils, and sportive lemurs. Certain tendons in kangaroo hind legs are very elastic, allowing kangaroos to effectively bounce along conserving energy from hop to hop, making hopping a very energy efficient way to move around in their nutrient poor environment. <b>Saltation</b> is also used by many small birds. Frogs and fleas also hop.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Vital {{fluorescence}} staining {{has been}} used in conjunction with time-lapse video image intensification microscopy to analyze the distribution and movement of endosomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria in cultured rat ovarian granulosa cells. Exposure of 5 -d granulosa cell cultures to pyrene-concanavalin A (P-Con A) or 3, 3 '-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled low-density lipoprotein (dil-LDL) at 4 °C results in the formation of randomly distributed endosomes 10 min after warming to 37 °C that exhibit saltatory motion for 20 min. If granulosa cells are labeled at 4 °C with both P-Con A and dil-LDL and warmed to 37 °C, both ligands are found within the same endosomes which migrate centripetally to the cell center where label accumulates within phase-dense structures by 60 min. The initial endosome <b>saltations</b> occur over short distances (mean distance = 4. 6 jm) with a mean velocity of 0. 03 Am/s. Endosome <b>saltations</b> then cease and are followed by a gradual centripetal migration of endosomes to the cell center where they accumulate and fuse with phase-dense structures. The second phase of movement involves a continuous, unidirectional migration of endosomes over distances ranging from 5 to 40 um at a mean velocity of 0. 05 pm/s.

25|$|A {{dust storm}} or sandstorm, a {{meteorological}} phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions, arises when a gust front passes {{or when the}} wind force exceeds the threshold value where loose sand and dust are removed from the dry surface.

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century {{he was one}} of the {{minority}} of biologists who believed that natural selection was the main driving force of evolution, and that evolution occurred by small steps and not by <b>saltation</b> (jumps). These opinions are now standard.Though his time as an academic was quite brief, he taught and encouraged a number of evolutionary biologists at the University of Oxford in the 1920s. Charles Elton (ecology), Alister Hardy (marine biology) and John Baker (cytology) all became highly successful, and Baker eventually wrote Huxley's Royal Society obituary memoir. Perhaps the most significant was Edmund Brisco Ford, who founded a field of research called ecological genetics, which played a role in the evolutionary synthesis. Another important disciple was Gavin de Beer, who wrote on evolution and development, and became Director of the Natural History Museum. Both these fine scholars had attended Huxley's lectures on genetics, experimental zoology (including embryology) and ethology. Later, they became his collaborators, and then leaders in their own right.|$|E

Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important; and Cyril Darlington, the chromosome expert, was a notable source of facts and ideas.An analysis of the 'authorities cited' index of Evolution the modern synthesis shows indirectly those whom Huxley regarded as the most important contributors to the synthesis up to 1941 (the book was published in 1942, and references go up to 1941). The authorities cited 20 or more times are:Darlington, Darwin, Dobzhansky, Fisher, Ford, Goldschmidt, Haldane, J. S. Huxley, Muller, Rensch, Turrill, Wright.This list contains a few surprises. Goldschmidt was an influential geneticist who advocated evolution by <b>saltation,</b> and was sometimes mentioned in disagreement. Turrill provided Huxley with botanical information. The list omits three key members of the synthesis who are listed above: Mayr, Stebbins the botanist and Simpson the palaeontologist. Mayr gets 16 citations and more in the two later editions; all three published outstanding and relevant books some years later, and their contribution to the synthesis is unquestionable. Their lesser weight in Huxley's citations was caused by the early publication date of his book. Huxley's book is not strong in palaeontology, which illustrates perfectly why Simpson's later works were such an important contribution.|$|E

40|$|Movements of {{cytoplasmic organelles}} were {{analyzed}} in Vero fibroblasts. In the cells polarized {{at the edge}} of an experimental wound, cytoplasmic granules moved randomly (Brownian motions) and by separate jumps (saltatory movements). The displacement of granules by the Brownian motions exceeded by more than an order of magnitude that of the mitochondria similar by weight. Lipid droplets moved predominantly by <b>saltations,</b> whereas mitochondria and lysosomes moved much less often. In a front part of the polarized cells, the main directions of saltatory movements were from the nucleus to the leading edge of a cell and back, whereas the tangential movements (across the long axis of a cell) were less than 1 %. 90 % of saltatory movements occurred in the area starting 10 - 12 µm from the nucleus and ending 10 - 12 µm from the leading edge of a cell. The average rate of saltatory movements of the granules (2. 38 µm/s) was identical in both directions. The average length of the track was 7. 49 цт; the maximum track length reached 30 µm. An increase in the granule diameter from 0. 3 to 1. 4 µm resulted in a minor (statistically insignificant) decrease in the average rate of the movements. The average rate of saltatory movements of mitochondria was 1. 00 µm/s, and the average track length was 6. 04 µm. Therefore, mitochondria, in contrast to lipid droplets, are rigidly fixed in the cytoplasm, and the force holding mitochondria is equal to the force produced by the microtubule-associated motors.

Within 30 min after the addition of the colchicine, pseudopod-like extensions form rapidly at the cell periphery, and adjacent organelles are seen to stream into them. The pseudopods contain extensive arrays of actinlike microfilament bundles which bind skeletal-muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM). Therefore, in the presence of colchicine, intracellular movements are altered from a normal saltatory pattern into a pattern reminiscent of the type of cytoplasmic streaming seen in amoeboid organisms. The streaming may reflect either the activity or the contractility of submembranous microfilament bundles. Streaming activity is not seen in cells containing well-organized microtubule- 10 -nm filament complexes...|$|R

Dust storms usually start in desert margins rather than the deserts themselves where the finer materials have already been blown away. As a steady wind begins to blow, fine particles lying on the exposed ground begin to vibrate. At greater wind speeds, some particles are lifted into the air stream. When they land, they strike other particles which may be jerked into the air in their turn, starting a chain reaction.

This clustering of lysosomes depends on microtubules. When the interphase microtubules are depolymerized by treatment of the cells with nocodazole or during mitosis, the lysosomes disperse throughout the cytoplasm. Lysosomes recluster rapidly (within 30 - 60 min) {{in the region of}} the centrosomes either upon removal of the drug, or, in telophase, when repolymerization of interphase microtubules has occurred. During this translocation process the lysosomes can be found aligned along centrosomal microtubules. Endosomes and lysosomes can be visualized by incubating living cells with acridine orange. We have analyzed the movement of these labeled endocytic organelles in vivo by video- enhanced fluorescence microscopy. Translocation of endosomes and lysosomes occurs along linear tracks (up to 10 microns long) by discontinuous <b>saltations</b> (with velocities of up to 2. 5 microns/s). Organelles move bidirectionally with respect to the MTOC. This movement ceases when microtubules are depolymerized by treatment of the cells with nocodazole. After nocodazole washout and microtubule repolymerization, the translocation and reclustering of fluorescent organelles predominantly occurs in a unidirectional manner towards the area of the MTOC. Organelle movement remains unaffected when cells are treated with cytochalasin D, or when the collapse of intermediate filaments is induced by microinjected monoclonal antivimentin antibodies.
