5|$|Angelina was {{introduced}} as Angelo's daughter {{who had a}} {{dream of becoming a}} successful recording artist. Angelo's girlfriend Gloria requested that music producer Devon should help her out, only for everyone to find out she had no talent. Angelina developed a crush on Gloria's son, Kevin Fisher, who was already engaged to his girlfriend Chloe. Angelina attempted to seduce Kevin, making Chloe hate her. Angelo put Kevin in charge of keeping Angelina safe from her dangerous ex-boyfriend Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper). Devon found out that Angelina sang well only if <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> Kevin's eyes. At Kevin and Chloe's wedding, Angelina told Kevin that she was pregnant with Carmine's child and that they needed to leave town immediately. Kevin ran away with her after shots were fired during the wedding ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E

25|$|In November 2007, the BBC made four short '2 Dimensional' films where actors {{from the}} series look through a '2' shaped hole {{into a room}} that {{reflects}} the character they play in Heroes. A new short was revealed just before episode one of season three aired on BBC2, featuring Masi Oka <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> an anime-styled montage of Hiro.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor {{builds a}} Delta Wave {{projector}} that would {{wipe out the}} Daleks, but would also eliminate all life on Earth, and finds himself unable to trigger it. However, Rose absorbs energies from the spacetime vortex by <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> {{the heart of the}} TARDIS and uses those energies to pilot the TARDIS back to the Doctor and reduce the Daleks and their fleet to atoms.|$|E

25|$|The {{eyes are}} often a focus of {{abduction}} claims. They are said to not move or focus in any observable way to the naked eye. Claims often describe a Grey <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> the eyes of an abductee when conducting mental procedures. This staring is claimed to induce hallucinogenic states or directly provoke different emotions. Although abduction claimants often say that the Grey was only inches from their face during the staring mindscan procedure, they often subsequently claim to not feeling breath or seeing the Grey's chest move from breathing.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, Homura captures Kyubey and rewrites reality {{so he and}} {{his kind}} take Madoka's place in taking the misery of magical girls in history while she can return to a normal life. But Homura realizes that Madoka will {{eventually}} remember the truth and regain her divinity, accepting that they might become enemies should that time come. A post-credits scene shows Homura seated in a chair while watching over Mitakihara City and a badly-beaten Kyubey in the vicinity. After <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> the horizon, Homura leans over and falls off a cliff.|$|E
25|$|Reporters {{were denied}} access to the prisoners, but not so {{photographer}} Alexander Gardner. On April 27, Gardner began taking photographs {{of those who were}} caught up in the government's dragnet. One by one, each prisoner was brought on deck and photographed in a few positions. Gardner took far more photographs of Powell than anyone else. Powell obliged Gardner by posing seated, standing (with and without restraints), and modeling the overcoat and hat he'd worn the night of the Seward attacks. Among the most famous of these photographs is one in which Powell sits against the gun turret of the Saugus, <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> the camera in a modern fashion, relaxed and direct.|$|E

25|$|Van Norren et al. (1998) {{could not}} find a single example in the medical {{literature}} of a <1nbsp&mW classnbsp&III laser causing eyesight damage. Mainster et al. (2003) provide one case, an 11-year-old child who temporarily damaged her eyesight by holding an approximately 5mW red laser pointer close to the eye and <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> the beam for 10 seconds, she experienced scotoma (a blind spot) but fully recovered after three months. Luttrull & Hallisey (1999) describe a similar case, a 34-year-old male who stared into the beam of a classIIIa 5mW red laser for 30 to 60 seconds, causing temporary central scotoma and visual field loss. His eyesight fully recovered within two days, {{at the time of his}} eye exam. An intravenous fundus fluorescein angiogram, a technique used by ophthalmologists to visualise the retina of the eye in fine detail, identified subtle discoloration of the fovea.|$|E
500|$|Schuringa {{grabbed the}} suspect, {{and pulled him}} to the {{business}} class area {{at the front of}} the plane. A passenger reported that Abdulmutallab, though burned [...] "quite severely" [...] on his leg, seemed [...] "very calm," [...] and like a [...] "normal individual." [...] Schuringa stripped off the suspect's clothes to look for additional weapons, and he and a crew member restrained Abdulmutallab with plastic handcuffs. [...] "He was <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> nothing" [...] and shaking, said Schuringa.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Tennis Court" [...] {{was directed by}} Joel Kefali, who previously worked with Lorde on the accompanying video for her debut single [...] "Royals". The video was filmed as a one-shot. Lorde appears in [...] "black clothing, braided hair, and dark lipstick." [...] It features Lorde <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> the camera as the song plays; she does not lip sync the lyrics except for the word [...] "Yeah!" [...] after each verse and during the chorus. The set lighting fades in and out throughout the video.|$|E
60|$|But {{the captain}} paid no heed. He was <b>staring</b> wild-eyed <b>into</b> vacancy and {{rumpling}} his grey hair until it stood at all angles. His face reflected varying emotions.|$|R

6000|$|... "That isn't {{the way to}} put it," [...] remarked Chubbins, <b>staring</b> back <b>into</b> {{the eyes}} of the squirrel. [...] "You should ask how we {{children}} happened to have birds' bodies." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2006, Flea {{revealed}} that he once again considered leaving the band whilst touring {{in support of the}} album, stating that [...] "throughout the By the Way tour I would play a show and then go and sit on the end of my bed <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> space." [...] He planned to teach full-time at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, but ultimately decided to remain within the band. Flea later stated that [...] "the most painful part of quitting, and the thing that stopped me, was the idea of telling Anthony." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tennis Court" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, who complimented the song's production and musical style. The single garnered success in Oceania, peaking at {{number one on}} the New Zealand singles chart and entering the top 30 chart in Australia. In Europe, it charted in Belgium (in both Flanders and Wallonia), France, the UK and Germany; the song also appeared on multiple US charts. [...] "Tennis Court" [...] was certified platinum by both the Australian Recording Industry Association and Recorded Music NZ. A music video for the song was directed by Joel Kefali and features Lorde <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> the camera during one continuous shot. To promote Pure Heroine and the song, Lorde performed [...] "Tennis Court" [...] several times, including on Live on Letterman.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role, Collins read the Book of Revelation. As well, Collins has said he {{somewhat}} based his character around his younger brother, who has something [...] "angelic about him", as he [...] "has this way of, very calmly, just <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> someone's eyes" [...] making one feel [...] "like he can get into your soul." [...] To avoid the biblically toned dialogue from sounding too [...] "campy", Collins does his best to [...] "play it as real as possible". Because Castiel's true voice shattered windows in his premiere episode, Collins decided to use a [...] "gruff, resonant voice" [...] for the character. However, when portraying the angel's host Jimmy Novak, he tried to create {{a distinction between the}} two characters, providing different physical and personality traits, as well as using a [...] "more boyish kind of sound" [...] for Jimmy's voice.|$|E
6000|$|... “She must be {{a pretty}} old woman now,” he said, <b>staring</b> meditatively <b>into</b> the {{binnacle}} and then jerking a sharp glance at Harrison, who was steering a point off the course.|$|R

500|$|Brown {{grew up in}} the Canadian {{province}} of Quebec, where the majority speaks French, and where Riel is often considered a martyr. [...] However Brown, who grew up speaking only English, said he was largely ignorant of Riel's story until he read Maggie Siggins' 1994 biography Louis Riel: A Life of Revolution. [...] Many of Brown's favourite topics are entwined in Louis Riel: anti-authoritarianism, outsider religion, insanity, and accuracy and objectivity in nonfiction. [...] A central incident in the book is an eight-panel sequence in which Riel has a revelatory experience on a hilltop in Washington, D.C. [...] He experiences visions and talks to God, who declares him Prophet of the New World and instructs him to lead his people to freedom. [...] On the cover of the book, however, we see Riel standing alone in the wilderness, <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> the sky, leaving open the question of whether what he witnessed was real.|$|E
500|$|Common lyrical themes include {{technology}} and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for PopMatters, described the lyrics on The Sophtware Slump as [...] "one's attempt {{to transcend the}} glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search of something more real, more natural, more pastoral". Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band [...] "provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> a computer screen". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's [...] "geeky identification with technology". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's [...] "sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape". Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating [...] "I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects" [...] and how the song [...] "I'm on Standby" [...] is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: [...] "I was {{spending so much time}} learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'".|$|E
500|$|Stories {{including}} Zhou {{have also}} been used to educate. The Secondary School system of Hong Kong teaches children the value of mentorship by making them read about the close teacher-pupil relationship between Zhou and Yue. A morale tale called [...] "Yue Fei Studies Archery" [...] in Children's Pictorial, a Chinese magazine tailored for children ages two through seven, demonstrates how great achievements are only made possible via diligent practice. The story states how young Yue stumbles upon Zhou's training hall in a neighboring town while gathering fire wood. Yue applies to become a student, but Zhou tells him he must first practice {{the art of the}} [...] "far-sighted person" [...] by <b>staring</b> <b>into</b> the morning sun to improve his eyesight. After years of unrelenting practice, Yue is able to spot a lone goose flying off in the distance and two cicadas on a tree far into the forest. Zhou then officially takes him as his disciple and adopted son. Under his tutelage, Yue is able to master the eighteen weapons of war and to shoot a falling leaf from one-hundred paces away.|$|E
