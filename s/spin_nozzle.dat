30|$|Electrospinning is a {{versatile}} method {{for the production}} of fibres with diameters from micrometre to nanometre scale (Szentivanyi et al. 2011). It has gained serious interest for mimicking the structure of fibrillar extracellular matrix components and was proposed for applications in tissue engineering of bone as well (Yoshimatoa et al. 2003). Principally, electrospinning can be performed either with polymeric solutions or melts. In this process, the polymer solution or melt moves under the influence of a strong electric field between two electrodes. One of the electrodes is located in the <b>spinning</b> <b>nozzle,</b> while opposite to it, a grounded collector is located. As the polymer solution leaves the nozzle first, a hemispherical droplet is formed. If a critical strength of the electrical field is achieved, this form becomes conical, which is known as the Taylor cone. The polymer solution is ejected from this cone as the applied electric field is strong enough to overcome the surface tension of the fluid forming a jet that moves in a whipping mode to the grounded electrode. Due to the simultaneously occurring stretching of the jet and evaporation of the solvent, thin and solid fibres are deposited on the collecting electrode. The dimension and the morphology of the electrospun polymeric nanofibres can be influenced by a number of parameters such as composition of solution or blend, strength of the electric field, <b>spinning</b> distance, <b>nozzle</b> diameter, polymer concentration and the surface tension and electric conductivity of the polymer solution (Szentivanyi et al. 2011; Yoshimatoa et al. 2003; Gugutkov et al. 2013; Andiapann et al. 2013). Recent work has shown that electrospinning can be used to produce aligned fibres or combine fibres of different diameter in a sequential manner to achieve structures that guide cell adhesion, movement and differentiation (Gugutkov et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2010; Pham et al. 2006). This allows the generation of structures that resemble the composition of different tissues like the arterial wall, skin and other tissues (Gugutkov et al. 2013; Andiapann et al. 2013; Asran et al. 2010; Nottelet et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|Most {{technical}} polymers {{and many}} biopolymers contain very different molecular species (unlike chain length, molecular architecture and/or chemical composition) {{in contrast to}} pure low molecular weight compounds. This inconsistent constitution of macromolecules proves very adverse in many cases. An adequate fractionation of polydisperse polymers is therefore mandatory. Very efficient means are available for analytical purposes. However, these methods break down {{as soon as the}} required amount of product exceeds some ten grams. In order to gain access to large enough quantities of sufficiently uniform polymer samples, we have developed a special kind of extraction process called Continuous Spin Fractiona-tion (CSF). The better soluble macromolecular species are preferentially transferred from a feed phase (concentrated polymer solution) into a pickup phase (solvent of tai-lored thermodynamic quality).

By capitalizing on existing hardware, the cost and time required for tunnel modifications were significantly reduced. Repeatability of pitot pressure measurements was excellent, and instrumentation errors were reduced by optimizing the pressure range of the transducers used for each test run.

5000|$|After the presoak {{application}}, a {{car wash}} tunnel's layout can vary greatly. In some car washes, presoak application {{is followed by}} an empty space, or idle zone. This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car. In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone. A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels {{in order to achieve}} complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt conveyor prevents the wheels of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel cleaning. Tracking high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor.

30|$|Polymer nanofibres are {{prepared}} by electrospinning a polymer solution, with a high-voltage electric field {{applied to a}} polymer solution ejected from a metal syringe needle. Electrospinning is when the electric forces are utilised within the polymer solution to produce the varied morphology. Moreover, by varying viscosity, surface tension, molecular structure, molecular weight, solution concentration, solvent structure, additive and operational conditions such as rotating speed, <b>spinning</b> head diameter, <b>nozzle</b> diameter and nozzle-collector distance of the same solution may produce a nanofibre web with the various fineness, orientation and surface morphology (Zhang and Lu 2014). Many researchers focus on how to synthesise high surface area nanofibres (less than 1000 [*]nm), which make them useful in fuel cell membranes, tissue engineering, catalysis, sensors, separations, electrochemical cells, drug delivery and chemical filtration (Choi et al. 2008). Some of the researchers also focus on the proton conductivity of electrospun nanofibrous mats (Choi et al. 2008). Nafion® membrane is a perfluorinated state-of-the-art polymer developed by DuPont in the 1970 s. Nafion® at low temperature maintained a high proton conductivity and chemical resistance due to its hydrophobic tetrafluoroethylene backbone and sulfonate groups. Electrospinning Nafion® solution increases the proton conductivity of nanofibres with the reduced nanometre scale (Dong et al. 2010). Electrospinning the plain Nafion® solution is impossible due to the low shear viscosity that makes Nafion® aggregates in the solution (Tran and Kalra 2013; Zhou et al. 2010). Nafion® solution was blended with other polymers such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (Ballengee and Pintauro 2011), poly(acrylic) (PAA) (Mauritz and Moore 2004), or poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA) (Chraska et al. 2000) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) (Tran and Kalra 2013; Sharma et al. 2014) {{in order to enhance}} the mechanical properties and electrospinning. Furthermore, blending Nafion® solution with electron-conducting polymers may enhance their protons’ conductivity and their electrons. PAN is mostly the chosen copolymer for the preparation of fibrous filter media as it can be fabricated easily into nanofibres by electrospinning due to their superior mechanical properties, excellent weatherability and chemical stability (Nie et al. 2013). Moreover, PAN also maintains a good thermal stability at a higher temperature of 130 [*]°C and has a good resistance to many organic solvents. PAN has been studied as a separator material, and PAN-based separators show promising properties, including high ionic conductivity, good thermal stability, high electrolyte uptake and good compatibility, with lithium metal (Gopalan et al. 2008). Electrospinning of composited PAN nanofibres has been found to have multifaceted applications (Sahay et al. 2012), such as electrode materials in supercapacitors and fuel cells (Kim et al. 2004). Zirconium oxide (ZrO 2) has several properties that make it a useful material. These properties include high density, hardness, electrical conductivity, wear resistance, high fracture toughness, low thermal conductivity and relatively high dielectric constant. Because of its high refractive index and high oxygen-ion conduction, ZrO 2 has been applied as resistive heating elements, oxygen sensors, catalysts and fuel cells (Chraska et al. 2000). The use of a totally stabilised zirconia in fuel-cell technology obtains a good ionic conductivity of cubic zirconia at medium and high temperatures (Jones and Rozière 2001). Zirconium phosphates (ZrPs) are inorganic cation-exchange material with high thermal stability. Zirconium phosphate has the features of increasing conductivity due to high proton mobility on the surface of its particles and good water retention. The reduced methanol permeability of the polymer membrane, while maintaining a high power density, is obtained by impregnating it with zirconium phosphate (Jones and Rozière 2001; Carriere et al. 2003). In this work, we study the effect of ZrP nanofillers on the improvement of the morphology and conductivity of blended Nafion®-PAN nanofibres compared with pure PAN nanofibres, which can be fabricated by electrospinning into nanofibre mats.|$|R
