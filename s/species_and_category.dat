The data collected by catching method, using mist nets as trapping equipment. Composition of guild was analyzed {{based on the number}} of individuals and species for every guild category to count the abundance values. Chi-square test was used to find out the interaction between the number of individuals or species and guild category. As a result, we got a total of 78 individuals of birds that belonging to 33 species and 9 guild categories. Insectivore-frugivore (IF) is category guild with the highest number found either for the total number of individuals or species, and the smallest number is the group of aerial frugivore (AF). The greatest of abundance values is IF category, described by the values obtained are 47. 71 % based on the total number of individuals and 21. 21 % based on the total number of species. While the lowest abundance values is AF, 1. 28 % based on the total number of individuals and 3. 03 % based on the total number of species. The abundance values is not always directly proportional between the total number of species and individuals.

40|$|Very little {{research}} has been conducted in Pakistan on Asteraceae. Generic and specific information are lacking on this family. The present research was carried out within the scope of Pakistan. The current venture is two-fold; first, it describes the genera and species of this tribe taxonomic ally, historical reviews and distribution and second indicating the biodiversity of the tribe with particular emphasis on ethnobotanical uses and conservation status. For this aspect collection of species, their preservation and communication with local communities offered information on the tribal biodiversity providing the extensive list of genera and species belonging to this tribe. It includes 34 genera and 207 species. Description of two hundred and seven species have been provided with accurate typification and delimiting them by the keys of sections, genera and species. 60 species are new additions to the flora of Pakistan and seven new species belonging to Silybum, Echinops, Saussurea, Cousinia, Tricholepis, Cirsium and Carduus have been described as an example Saussurea minimerga Akhtar & Khan. Distributional maps have been provided. Distributional pattern of the genera in Pakistan is represented in separate chapter, dividing them in important phytogeographical elements. The tribe includes the 62 % endemic species and 20 % are wide-spread species. The species have been reported from only one locality is considered as endemic and rare and endangered species in our area. Center of endemism is Chitral, Karakorum, Baluchistan and Azad Kashmir. The species are distributed within the altitudinal range of 800 - 4000 m and above. These species were further explored for their ethnobotanical uses by communicating the tribal communities from the rural area. It is recorded that 27 plant species of this tribe were extensively used by the native communities. These are used directly for curing of 70 diseases. These are important as food and brewages also. Ethnobotanically important plant species are Echinops echinatus, Carthamus tinctorius, C. lanatus, Silybum marianum, Saussurea and Dolomiea. For the evaluation of conservation status of the tribe, I have used the distributional data of seven herbaria and the data of my 30 collection trips to different area during fourteen years. Threatened species have been identified by dividing the species into three categories. Category (C) have been used for 16 wide spread <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>category</b> (D) have been used for 116 endemic species. 188 species are critically endangered (Cr), 55 species are endangered (EN), 28 species are vulnerable (Vu), 103 species are uniregionic and 19 species are biregionic. Irano-Turanean elements predominate, but MeditelTanean penetrations are common with sino-Japanese elements in temperate and alpine zones of Northern area and Azad Kashmir. Concerted efforts are required to broaden our understanding of dynamics of floral values and to check the species dec 1 ine of this tribe in our area, conservation of endangered species is implementary and there is need to coordinate much more closely to plan and cover poorly collected areas and concentrate on rare species...|$|E

40|$|All poultry is {{sensitive}} to mycotoxins. This partly depends on the type, age <b>and</b> production <b>categories</b> of poultry, their living conditions and nutritive status and partly on the type, quantity and duration of mycotoxin ingestion. The presence of mycotoxins results in significant health disorders {{and a decrease in}} production performances. This leads to considerable economic loss for the poultry industry - either direct losses, i. e. death of the poultry or the indirect ones, i. e. the decrease in body mass, number and quality of eggs, greater food conversion, and immunosuppression. Immunosuppression results in increased sensitivity to infective agents and a bad vaccinal response. Morevover, mycotoxin residues in poultry meat, eggs and products derived from them pose a threat to human health. In order to prevent and reduce the negative implications of mycotoxins in the poultry production, it is necessary to create both global and national strategies for combatting mycotoxins, advance diagnostic techniques and procedures, intensify the control of food quality, introduce new limits on the maximum amount of mycotoxins allowed in food and poultry feed used for certain <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>categories</b> of animals, <b>and</b> synchronise it with the European standards...|$|R

The FEEDAP Panel developed, based on an approximation using zinc requirements and background data, potential new maximum contents, which could replace the current ones. The newly proposed total maximum contents are: 150 mg Zn/kg complete feed for piglets, sows, rabbits, salmonids, cats and dogs; 120 mg Zn/kg complete feed for turkeys for fattening; 100 mg Zn/kg complete feed for all other <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>categories.</b> The use of phytase in feeding piglets, pigs for fattening and sows would allow a further reduction of the newly proposed total maximum contents by 30 [*]% (from 150 to 110 mg Zn/kg feed for piglets and sows and from 100 to 70 mg Zn/kg feed for pigs for fattening). The newly proposed total maximum contents ensure health, welfare and productivity of the target <b>species</b> <b>and</b> do not affect consumer safety.

The FEEDAP Panel is not in the position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish. Consumption surveys include iron-containing foodstuffs of animal origin. Since the supplementation of animal feed with iron-containing compounds has not essentially changed during the last decades, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the iron levels in food of animal origin used in exposure scenarios originated from animals fed iron-supplemented diets. Since iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, will be used as a substitute for other iron compounds, its use in animal nutrition would not modify consumer exposure to iron. The additive should be considered as a skin, eye and respiratory irritant and, owing to its residual peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. Considering the high background concentration of iron in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, is not expected to pose an environmental risk. Iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, is an effective source of iron for all animal <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>categories.</b> The FEEDAP Panel recommends that the maximum iron contents in complete feed be reduced as follows: bovines and poultry, 450 mg Fe/kg; and pets, 600 mg Fe/kg...|$|R

Primary signs of manganese deficiency are impaired growth, skeletal abnormalities, depressed reproductive function, ataxia of the newborn and faults in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Manganese chelate of amino acids, hydrate is considered a safe source of manganese for all animal species/categories, provided that the current maximum total contents of manganese authorised in feed are respected. Dietary manganese {{does not appear to}} cause any adverse effects in consumers at usual intake levels; manganese intake resulting from the consumption of tissues and products of animal origin is low compared with the intake resulting from the consumption of food of plant origin. The use manganese chelate of amino acids, hydrate, does not result in higher manganese deposition in edible tissues and products than that resulting from commonly used inorganic sources. The use of the additive in animal nutrition is of no concern for the safety of consumers, provided that the current maximum total contents of manganese authorised in feed are respected. Handling the additive is a possible hazard to the respiratory tract and the health of users; in the absence of adequate data regarding irritancy to the skin and eyes and dermal sensitisation, the additive should be considered as a potential skin and eye irritant and, owing to its residual peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. The use of manganese chelate of amino acids, hydrate, in animal nutrition for all animal species is not of concern for the environment, provided that the current maximum total contents of manganese authorised in feed are respected.

Because of insufficient data, the FEEDAP Panel {{is not in a}} position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish; as a provisional measure, the current value (750 mg/kg) could be maintained. The values for total dietary iron for pigs, ovines, horses, fish and other species/categories (except poultry, bovines and pets) are in line with those currently authorised. Iron from ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is unlikely to modify the iron concentration in edible tissues and products of animal origin. Consumer exposure in the EU is not associated with a risk of excess iron intake to the general population. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel does not foresee any concern for consumer safety resulting from the use of ferrous sulphate heptahydrate in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum iron content in complete feedingstuffs is respected. Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is an irritant and corrosive to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract; thus, handling of the additive poses a hazard to the user/worker. Considering the high background concentration of iron and sulphur in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is not expected to pose an environmental risk.

40|$|The safety {{assessment}} of the additive {{is based on the}} separate consideration of its two constituents, bentonite and sepiolite. The currently authorised maximum contents for bentonite and sepiolite when used individually (20   000 mg/kg complete feed) are considered safe for all animal species. In consequence, Toxfin® Dry would be safe for all animals <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>categories</b> up to a maximum concentration of 20   000 mg/kg complete feed. Bentonite and sepiolite, in common with other clays, are not absorbed to any measurable extent. Consequently, {{it is unlikely that the}} consumption of edible tissues/products of treated animals would expose the consumer to harmful amounts of residues of any chemical component derived from Toxfin® Dry. The FEEDAP Panel considers that there is no concern for the safety of consumers of food products derived from animals fed diets containing the additive. Dust generated from Toxfin® Dry during normal handling has the potential to expose the whole of the respiratory tract of users to potentially harmful substances (bentonite, sepiolite and crystalline silica) for which no safe levels of exposure have been identified. Measures must be taken to limit exposure of users to dust. In the absence of data for sepiolite, it would be prudent to treat ToxFin® Dry as a skin and eye irritant and a skin sensitiser. Bentonite and sepiolite are naturally occurring clays widely distributed in the environment. Therefore, it is not expected that the use of the additive in animal nutrition would adversely affect the environment. Since only one in vivo study in chickens has been provided, the FEEDAP Panel considers that there is insufficient evidence to conclude on the efficacy of the additive as a substance for reduction of contamination of feed with mycotoxins...|$|R
40|$|The {{additive}} formaldehyde is an {{aqueous solution}} containing 37 % formaldehyde and 14 % methanol. It {{is intended for}} use in all animal species at concentrations between 68 and 680 mg active substance/kg complete feed. Free and reversibly bound formaldehyde is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and joins the pool of endogenous formaldehyde. It is rapidly oxidised to formic acid further on to carbon dioxide and water. Formaldehyde is a carcinogen by inhalation. While local irritation is expected to strongly promote carcinogenesis, lower local concentrations of formaldehyde are known to produce DNA adducts. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel deems it prudent not to consider the exposure to non-irritant concentration as totally riskless. Moreover, {{on the basis of}} the present knowledge, a causal association between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia cannot be ruled out. The FEEDAP Panel estimated the oral intake of formaldehyde of consumers from food of animal origin to be 4 mg per person per day. A reliable additional exposure of consumers to formaldehyde from supplementing feedingstuffs cannot be calculated. However, the FEEDAP Panel considers that the proposed use of formaldehyde as a feed additive would not increase consumer exposure and consequently would not pose an additional risk for the consumer. A safe feed concentration for all animal <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>categories</b> could not be determined. Formaldehyde is a strong irritant, a potent skin and respiratory sensitiser. Measures should be taken to ensure that the respiratory tract, skin and eyes of any person handling the product are not exposed to any dust, mist or vapour generated by the use of formaldehyde. The use of formaldehyde in animal nutrition is not expected to pose a risk for the environment.

The difference in the estimated rates, early minus late, indicates drought impact. With mortality in two dbh <b>categories</b> <b>and</b> growth in three, there were five measures per species. We checked correlation among the measures, and then tested whether drought impact scores were significant predictors of population performance both {{during and after the}} drought, also estimated from piecewise regression.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to analyze crucial factors in the output from the production of proteins in food of animal origin, such as milk, meat and eggs. We then consider inputs such as land, water, fuel, minerals and feed, as well as characterize emissions. Finally, we estimate footprints for land (land footprint, LF), water (water footprint, WF) and greenhouse gas emissions (i. e., carbon footprint, CF) during the production process. The wide range of different land and water inputs per unit feed between various studies largely influences the results. Further influencing factors are <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>categories</b> of animals that produce edible protein, their yields and the feeding of animals. Coproducts with no or low humanly edible fractions and grassland as feed contribute to a lower need for arable land and lower LF, WF and CF. The most efficient land use or the lowest LF per kilogram of edible protein was estimated for higher milk and egg yields; the highest LF values were calculated for beef, followed by pork. The lowest WF and CF were calculated for edible protein of chicken meat and eggs. Edible protein from ruminants is mostly characterized by a higher CF {{because of the high}} greenhouse gas potential of methane produced in the rumen. A key prerequisite for further progress in this field is the harmonization of data collection and calculation methods. Alternatives to partial or complete replacement of protein of terrestrial animals, such as marine animals, insects, cell cultures, single-cell proteins or simulated animal products from plants, as well as changing eating patterns and reducing food losses are mentioned as further potential ways for more efficient feed production. For all those dealing with plant or animal breeding and cultivation and all those who are working along the whole food production chain, it is a major challenge to enhance the production of more food for more people with, at the same time, less, limited resources and lower emissions...|$|R
