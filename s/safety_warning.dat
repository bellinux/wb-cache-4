Modern uses of strobe lights serve a purpose for <b>safety</b> <b>warning,</b> and motion detection. Strobes can be found atop most police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks. The origin of strobe lighting dates to 1931, when Harold Eugene Edgerton invented a flashing lamp to make an improved stroboscope {{for the study of}} moving objects, eventually resulting in dramatic photographs of objects such as bullets in flight.|$|E

40|$|Background: Throughout 2007 and January 2008, several glitazones health {{warnings}} {{were published}} on rosiglitazone myocardial infarction risk. The {{impact of such}} warnings on glitazones prevalence of utilization has been extensively studied in the United States but only in one European country (England), which has showed different pattern from US studies. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the impact of such <b>safety</b> <b>warnings</b> on glitazones utilization in an area of another European country. Methods: We calculated the number of defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day of glitazones each month during the period from 2006 to 2008 in a health area of Spain. We analyzed the data graphically and through a segmented regression analysis. Results: Rosiglitazone defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day were growing before the <b>safety</b> <b>warnings,</b> after the warnings a change in trend occurred and rosiglitazone utilization showed a downturn slope. Pioglitazone defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day were stable before the <b>safety</b> <b>warnings,</b> and a linear growth was observed after the <b>safety</b> <b>warnings.</b> Throughout the study period, rosiglitazone defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day were higher than pioglitazone defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day until near the end of 2008. Conclusion: Despite the fact that cardiovascular warnings affected rosiglitazone and not pioglitazone, rosiglitazone was more utilized than pioglitazone until near the end of 2008 which is a pattern similar to the one found in another European studies in England, but very different from studies in the United States, where rosiglitazone was less utilized than pioglitazone from the first month after rosiglitazone cardiovascular <b>safety</b> <b>warnings...</b>|$|R

Chase, {{engineer}} of the Portland bridge commission, {{testified that}} the only <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> devices on the Madison Street bridge were the gates at the draw and a red warning light, although in foggy weather a gong was kept sounding when the draw was open. [...] When the draw was open early in the morning, no one was placed at {{the east side of}} bridge to caution traffic, although during the day and the evening, two men were placed on duty.

2500|$|Because the Yugo {{was built}} as a [...] "Yugoslav" [...] car with {{political}} problems and civil war breaking out in 1990–91, production slowed down and the supply of parts was interrupted. Most of the plastic came from Croatia, while the alternators and electrical equipment came from Slovenia. With the start of civil war, economic and transportation ties were broken, resulting in shortage of most parts coming from the two seceded republics. Though the sanctions were not in place until May 1992, Yugos built between June 1991 and early 1996 were built {{with a variety of}} [...] "leftover" [...] parts: as an example, getting a car with a blue dashboard and a brown steering wheel, seats that were mismatched in color, and most likely an [...] "American" [...] instrument cluster with speeds printed in MPH rather than km/h, and with written labels like water and oil instead of small drawings, and a seatbelt <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> light were possible. In some extreme cases, the car would come with different interior panels and a steering wheel from other Zastava products such as the Zastava 750. When exports to United States (and the rest of the world) stopped, a number of federalized Yugos were still left in the factory's parking lots, and many people got these [...] "American" [...] Yugos instead of the European ones. When Yugoslavia broke apart in the early 1990s, production rates steeply declined to 14,000 in 1992, 7,000 in 1993 and 1994, and 9,000 in 1995. In 1996, when sanctions were lifted, production rates slowly increased as living standards in the former Yugoslavia started to improve. Even so, problems for the factory started once again when it was put out of production in mid-1999 as a result of war with NATO.|$|E
