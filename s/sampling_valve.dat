The concentration of the measured elements would normally range from to 1000 and correction for the carry-over was only necessary in special cases. The valve system has also been used with other analytical programs where background correction {{was used for the}} analysis of 20 elements with a total exposure time of 20 s. Because of the valve system one analysis could still be performed in 36 s. The flow rate of Pump 2 was then reduced to 6 ml/min. If the valve system is to be used for programs with exposure times exceeding 20 s, larger loops must be installed...|$|R
40|$|For {{electrospray}} ionization in Fourier-transform mass spectrometry, {{direct injection}} of 5 × 10 − 14 mol (0. 5 μL of 100 nM from a microvolume <b>sample</b> <b>valve)</b> of ubiquitin (8565 Da) into the flowing solvent stream yields a spectrum with 85 : 1 signal-to-noise ratio, 2 -ppm mass accuracy, and isotopic resolution. Gated trapping for 100 μs from a 0. 15 -μL/min injection of 20 -μM ubiquitin consumes 5 × 10 − 18 mol, which produces a spectrum with 23 : 1 signal-to-noise ratio and > 3 × 105 resolving power...|$|R
50|$|A <b>Sampling</b> <b>Valve</b> {{is a type}} of valve used {{in process}} {{industries}} that allows taking a representative portion of a fluid (gases, liquids, fluidized, solids, or slurries) to test (e.g. by physical measurements, chemical analysis, microbiological examination), typically for the purposes of identification, quality control, or regulatory assessment. It is a valve used for sampling.|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} monosegmented flow analyser {{containing a}} <b>sampling</b> <b>valve</b> and a reagent addition module and employing a laboratory-made photodiode array spectrophotometer as detection system is described, The instrument {{was controlled by}} a 386 SX IBM compatible microcomputer through an IC 8255 parallel port that communicates with the interface which controls the <b>sampling</b> <b>valve</b> and reagent addition module, The spectrophotometer was controlled by the same microcomputer through an RS 232 serial standard interface, The software for the instrument was written in QuickBasic 4. 5. Opto-switches were employed to detect the air bubbles limiting the monosegment, allowing precise sample localisation for reagent addition and signal reading. The main characteristics of the analyser are low reagent consumption and high sensitivity which is independent of the sample volume, The instrument was designed to determine glucose, creatinine or urea in blood plasma and serum without hardware modification, The results were compared against those obtained by the Clinical Hospital of UNICAMP using commercial analysers, Correlation coefficients among the methods were 0. 997, 0. 982 and 0. 996 for glucose, creatinine and urea, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Techniques of {{conventional}} chromatography {{do not always}} give convenient results. Analyses are often contaminated with detector noise and baseline drift. Continuous analysis is not possible and anomalous detector response can occur. This report proposes a method which overcomes these difficulties to a certain degree. A pseudo- random sequence controls the injections into a conventional column. Cross-correlation between input and output yields the chromatogram to within a constant factor. <b>Sample</b> <b>valve</b> and detector must be operated in a linear fashion.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{analyzing}} bubbly flow {{in a ball}} valve in a hydraulic circuit is presented. The dynamics of a single bubble can be well described by a quasi-static approximation of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. Hence the presence of bubbles in low volume fractions can be modeled through an effective compressibility of the flow, which is easy to implement in commercial CFD packages. In the <b>sample</b> <b>valve,</b> a volume fraction of 4 % air bubbles results in a mass flux reduction of up to 10 %, as the bubbles expand due to the pressure drop in the valve and partly block it...|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} occurring during head-on flame quench at a {{cold combustion}} chamber wall {{have been studied}} in a cylindrical combustion bomb. Gas samples were withdrawn from the wall layer using an electrohydraulic <b>sampling</b> <b>valve</b> and were analyzed by gas chromatography.

The results indicate that hydrocarbons present in the quench layer are substantially oxidized within 4 ms of flame arrival...|$|E
30|$|The {{residue of}} {{quinalphos}} {{extracted from the}} different experiments was dissolved in methanol and analysed by UFLC-LC 20 AD (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a ternary gradient pump, programmable variable-wavelength PDA detector, column oven, and electric <b>sample</b> <b>valve</b> and ODS- 2, C 18, reverse-phase column (4.6  ×  250  mm ×  5  μm). The quinalphos residue analysis was conducted using an isocratic mobile phase of methanol. The sample injection volume was 20  µL; the mobile phase was programmed at a flow rate of 1  mL min− 1; and quinalphos was detected at 254  nm wavelength under these operating conditions with a retention time of 1.859  min.|$|R
40|$|A {{multipoint}} {{fluid sample}} collection and distribution system is provided wherein the sample inputs are made through {{one or more}} of a number of <b>sampling</b> <b>valves</b> to a progressive cavity pump which is not susceptible to damage by large unfiltered particles.

An effluent sample can be taken and applied to a second progressive cavity pump for pumping to a filter unit that can provide one or more filtered effluent samples. The second pump can also provide an unfiltered effluent sample. Means are provided to periodically back flush each filter unit without shutting off the whole system...|$|R
50|$|In {{plants with}} {{remote-controlled}} process operation, {{such as oil}} refineries and petrochemical plants, some 2-way valves can be designated as normally closed (NC) or normally open (NO) during regular operation. Examples of normally-closed <b>valves</b> are <b>sampling</b> <b>valves,</b> which are only opened while a sample is taken. Other examples of normally-closed valves are emergency shut-down valves, which are kept open when the system is in operation and will automatically shut by taking away the power supply. This happens {{when there is a}} problem with a unit or a section of a fluid system such as a leak in order to isolate the problem from the rest of the system. Examples of normally-open valves are purge-gas supply valves or emergency-relief valves. When there is a problem these valves open (by switching them 'off') causing the unit to be flushed and emptied.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for the continuous analysis of generated vapors of the nerve agents soman and satin and the blistering agent sulfur mustard. By using a gas <b>sampling</b> <b>valve</b> {{and a very}} short (15 cm) column connected to an on-column injector with a 'standard length' column, the system can either be calibrated or used for performing high speed gas analyses. When using a flame ionization detector, the detection limit was ca. 100 ppb (ca. 0. 5 - 1. 0 mg/m 3). This technique is applied in inhalation toxicokinetic studies of nerve agents and mustard gas in the guinea pig...|$|E

The capacitance detector consists of two stainless steel tubes and is located in the loop of a <b>sampling</b> <b>valve.</b> The logarithm of the capacitance signal correlates linearly with the concentrations of water vapour in the 1705 to 2197 Pa range. A sampling frequency of about 55 h- 1 can be achieved. The flow system was applied to the indirect determination of the ethanol concentration in drinks based on the analysis of water vapour content above the liquid sample, without any pre-treatment of the sample. The colour of the drinks has no effect on the measurements...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Risk Stratification has an {{important}} place in cardiac surgery to identify high-risk cases and optimally allocate resources. Hence various risk scoring systems have been tried to predict mortality. The aim {{of the present study}} was to validate the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II) in Indian cardiac surgical patients. Methods: After obtaining ethics committee clearance, data on EuroSCORE II variables were collected for all patients > 18 years undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve surgery and mixed (CABG + valve) procedures between January 2011 and December 2012. Mortality prediction was done using the online calculator from the site www. euroscore. org. The calibration of the EuroSCORE II model was analysed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and discrimination was analysed by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and calculating area under the curve (AUC). The analysis was done in the total <b>sample,</b> CABG, <b>valve</b> surgery and in mixed procedures. Results: The overall observed mortality was 5. 7 % in the total sample, 6. 6 % in CABG, 4. 2 % in valve surgeries and 10. 2 % in mixed procedures whereas the predicted mortality was 2. 9 %, 3. 1 %, 2. 4 %, 5. 1 % in total <b>sample,</b> CABG, <b>valve</b> surgery and mixed procedure, respectively. The significance (P value) of Hosmer–Lemeshow test was 0. 292, 0. 45, 0. 56 and 1 for the total <b>sample,</b> CABG, <b>valve</b> surgery and mixed procedure, respectively, indicating good calibration. The AUC of ROC was 0. 76, 0. 70, 0. 83 and 0. 78 for total <b>sample,</b> CABG, <b>valve</b> surgery and mixed procedure, respectively. Conclusion: Mortality of the sample was under-predicted by EuroSCORE II. Calibration of the EuroSCORE II model was good for total sample as well as for all surgical subcategories. Discrimination was good in the total sample and in the mixed procedure population, acceptable in CABG patients and excellent in valve surgeries...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{analyzing}} the gas phase in polyurethane foam is described. The gas {{content of the}} foam sample is released by grinding in a special sampling equipment made from a metal pipe. The grinding is effected by pressing the cylindrical sample towards a rotating edge {{at the end of}} the pipe. The gas released during grinding is collected in a glass syringe, permitting the total gas volume to be determined. The syringe is connected to two gas <b>sampling</b> <b>valves</b> of a gas chromatograph. In the chromatograph, the gas is analysed on two different columns. For the qualitative analysis of samples with unknown gases and for the identification of impurities, a gas chromatograph—mass spectrometer system is used. Since the sampling equipment, with the sample inserted, is flushed with an inert gas before grinding, the "true" volume of the sample can be determined and the pressure in the cells can be calculated...|$|R
5000|$|The {{pressure}} {{of a sample}} stream can be lowered by a pressure reducing valve, particularly since many analysers are not designed to withstand high pressure. Such pressure reducing or similar valves {{may be used to}} control the flow rate to the online analyser. If the process pressure is insufficient to allow a sample stream to flow by itself to the analyser, a small pump may be used to move it there. The temperature of a hot sample may be lowered by use of an online sample cooler. The sampling and analysis can be done at the command of an operator, periodically (for example, every 15 minutes), or continuously - providing an analysis result vs. time graph on a chart recorder, computer, or other device. For periodic <b>sampling,</b> <b>valves</b> (or other devices) can be switched open to allow a fluid sample stream to flow to the analyser and shut when not sampling.|$|R
40|$|A gas <b>sampling</b> <b>valve</b> of the inertia-operated type was {{designed}} for procuring samples of the gases in the combustion chamber of internal combustion engines at identical points in successive cycles so that {{the analysis of the}} gas samples thus procured may aid {{in the study of the}} process of combustion. The operation of the valve is described. The valve was used to investigate the CO 2 content of gases taken from the quiescent combustion chamber of a high speed compression-ignition engine when operating with two different multiple-orifice fuel injection nozzles. An analysis of the gas samples thus obtained shows that the state of quiescence in the combustion chamber is maintained during the combustion of the fuel...|$|E

The urine sample is injected on to a plug of silver gauze heated to about 450 ~ in a furnace, where the mercury is decomposed to elemental mercury vapour. The vapour is swept from the furnace by a current of air, and after cooling and filtration through cotton wool {{it passes through}} a sensitive and stable mercury vapour detector. For routine determinations, 40 ~tl of urine is injected into the furnace {{by means of a}} pneumatic <b>sampling</b> <b>valve</b> coupled to a timer.

30|$|CO {{chemisorption}} {{measurements were}} carried out on AutoChem 2910 (Micromeritics, USA) instrument. Prior to adsorption measurements, ca. 100  mg {{of the sample was}} reduced in a flow of hydrogen (50  mL/min) at 300  °C for 3  h and flushed out subsequently in a pure helium gas flow for an hour at 300  °C. The sample was subsequently cooled to ambient temperature in the same He stream. CO uptake was determined by injecting pulses of 9.96  % CO balanced helium from a calibrated on-line <b>sampling</b> <b>valve</b> into the helium stream passing over the reduced samples at 300  °C. Ruthenium surface area, percentage dispersion and Ru average particle size were calculated assuming the stoichiometric factor (CO/Ru) as 1. Adsorption was deemed to be complete after three successive runs showed similar peak areas.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how unburned hydrocarbons emerge from SI engines and, in particular, how non-fuel hydrocarbons are formed and oxidized, a new gas sampling technique has been developed. A sampling unit, based {{on a combination of}} techniques used in the Fast Flame Ionization Detector (FFID) and wall-mounted <b>sampling</b> <b>valves,</b> was designed and built to capture a sample of exhaust gas during a specific period of the exhaust process and from a specific location within the exhaust port. The sampling unit consists of a transfer tube with one end at a specifiable location in the port and the other connected to a three-way valve that leads, on one side, to a FFID and, on the other, to a vacuum chamber with a high-speed solenoid valve. Exhaust gas, drawn by the pressure drop into the vacuum chamber, impinges {{on the face of the}} solenoid valve and flows radially outward. Once per cycle during a specified crank angle interval, the valve opens and traps exhaust gas in a storage unit, from which gas chromatography (GC) measurements are made. The solenoid valve's actuation time can be adjusted to allow resolution of a crank angle interval as small as 150 CA. Total HC concentrations measured by the FFID by the sampling unit are in good agreement, while the sampling unit goes one step further than the FFID by providing species concentrations. Spatial resolutio...|$|R
40|$|A {{key element}} of the cardiac cycle {{of the human heart}} is the opening and closing of the four valves. However, the {{material}} properties of the leaflet tissues, which fundamentally contribute to determine the mechanical response of the valves, are still an open field of research. The main contribution of the present study is to provide a complete experimental data set for porcine heart <b>valve</b> <b>samples</b> spanning all <b>valve</b> and leaflet types under tensile loading. The tests show a fair degree of reproducibility and are clearly indicative of a number of fundamental tissue properties, including a progressively stiffening response with increasing elongation. We then propose a simple anisotropic constitutive model, which is fitted to the experimental data set, showing a reasonable interspecimen variability. Furthermore, we present a dynamic finite element analysis of the aortic valve to show the direct usability of the obtained material parameters in computational simulations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{relative}} importance of O 2 and OH as oxidizers of soot during the late cycle in diesel engines, where the soot oxidation is characterized in an optically accessible engine using laser extinction measurements. These are combined with in cylinder gas sampling data from a single cylinder engine fitted with a fast gas <b>sampling</b> <b>valve.</b> Both measurements confirm that the in-cylinder soot oxidation slows down when the inlet concentration of O 2 is reduced. A 38 % decrease in intake O 2 concentration reduces the soot oxidation rate by 83 %, a non-linearity suggesting that O 2 in itself is not the main soot oxidizing species. Chemical kinetics simulations of OH concentrations in the oxidation zone and estimates of the OH soot oxidation rates point towards OH being the dominant oxidizer...|$|E
30|$|Dry {{reforming}} {{was conducted}} over the catalysts in a quartz micro-reactor (internal diameter of 18  mm) under atmospheric pressure. Before dry reforming reactions, the catalysts were reduced in situ at 800  °C/ 1  h in the H 2 /N 2 flow (20 vol % H 2, 150  mL/min). For the fluidised bed operation at fixed temperature of 800  °C, the reduced catalysts (200  mg) were fluidised by introducing the pre-mixed gases of CH 4, CO 2, N 2 (300  mL/min, molar ratio of 1 : 1 : 1) through a porous quartz distributor sintering at the reactor bottom. The reactants and products were analysed online by gas chromatographer (TP 260, Tianpu, China) equipped with 13 × and GDC- 104 columns. An ice-cold trap was set between the reactor exit and the GC <b>sampling</b> <b>valve</b> {{to avoid the}} influence of by-product, water.|$|E
40|$|Soot {{emission}} of diesel engines {{is the result}} of soot formation and of soot oxidation. Experimental investigations showed that most of the soot is oxidized during combustion. Therefore soot oxidation has major influence on the tail pipe emission. In this thesis a simulation model has been developed which uses detailed gas phase reaction kinetics and a heterogeneous surface reaction model. The predicted con-centrations agree very well with the experimental results. Simulation of the surface reaction is done with a semi-global multi-disperse particle model which takes account for the transport processes between gas and particle phase. The effects of gas phase radicals are described with less simplification errors and give insight in the oxidation process. Soot oxidation under diesel engine like conditions could be described in comparison of analytical and experimental (fast <b>sampling</b> <b>valve)</b> time dependent behavior. Even the soot induction time could be considered in contrast to published models...|$|E
40|$|Certification tests {{currently}} {{employed by}} some industrialized nations to certify respirators require that when challenged with air flow {{at a constant}} suction head of 25 mmH 2 O, the leakage into the facepiece from the exhalation valve(s) should not exceed 30 mlmin 1. However, the test alone might not reflect the leakage rate under different levels of vacuum. To study the characteristics of leakage through exhalation valves, a leakage meter was built to measure the leakage rate of four brands of exhalation valves. Seven valves of each brand were tested for leakage rate at pressure drops ranging from 15 to 45 mmH 2 O (or extended to 75 mmH 2 O for some valves). Two types of leaks, i. e. fiber insertion and arch dent on the valve seat, were used to investigate the effect of leak shape on the characteristic leak flow {{as a function of}} pressure drop. A leakage data point represented a mean value of five measurements. The results showed that the leakage rate could increase or decrease with increasing pressure drop inside the respirators, indicating that the current method of conducting leakage tests, at a constant suction head of 25 mmH 2 O, does not guarantee better protection than when the respirators are used at a lower suction head. Moreover, based on the <b>sample</b> <b>valves</b> tested in this study, it was found that valve leakage wasmostly caused by defects in the valve seats. Both fiber-insertion and arch-dent leak...|$|R
40|$|A 60 cm 3 {{temperature-controlled}} {{pressure cell}} was constructed for vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) measurements in methane-dominant mixtures at conditions representative of {{those found in}} cryogenic gas processing plants. The experimental system included a pressure transducer located in the cell's lid, temperature- controlled sampling capillaries, automated microliter <b>sampling</b> <b>valves,</b> and a gas chromatograph (GC) with two columns and multiple detectors for the simultaneous measurements of phase compositions. A gravimetrically prepared mixture of methane + 2 -methylpropane (isobutane) {CH 4 (1) + i-C 4 H 10 (2) } with the overall mole fraction z 2 = (0. 0724 ± 0. 0001) was loaded into the cell, and P,T,x,y data for this mixture were obtained along two isochoric pathways over the temperature range from (150 to 250) K at pressures to 9 MPa. The measured VLE data extend into a temperature range not previously studied for this system and are compared with previous literature data and with the predictions of the Groupe European de Recherche Gaziere (GERG- 2004) multiparameter equation of state (EOS). Where they overlap, the new data {{are consistent with the}} existing VLE data for this binary mixture, within the estimated uncertainties of the new data. At temperatures above 190 K, the relative average absolute deviation (AAD) from the GERG- 2004 EOS is about 6 % for both x 2 and y 2. Including the data measured below 190 K, the relative AAD for x 2 increases to 9 %. Analysis of the new data also indicates a possible inconsistency in overall density predictions for the two-phase region made using the GERG- 2004 EOS...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveBicuspid aortic valve, {{the most}} common {{congenital}} cardiac malformation, is caused by fusion of valve cushions {{at the onset of}} valvulogenesis. Although its exact pathogenesis is still unclear, a genetic basis is appearing more and more likely. Search for a potential candidate gene by reviewing semilunar valve morphogenesis led us to the ubiquitin fusion degradation 1 –like gene (UFD 1 L), which is highly expressed in the cardiac outflow tract during embryogenesis. MethodsAortic valves were collected during surgery from 39 patients with bicuspid aortic valve (mean age 56. 8 ± 18. 1 years) and from 38 patients with tricuspid aortic valve (mean age 61. 7 ± 16. 1 years). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed for detection of microdeletion, quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction to measure gene expression, and Western blotting to analyze the amount of UFD 1 L gene product. ResultsNo microdeletion was found in either group in the critical region of chromosome 22 containing the UFD 1 L gene. UFD 1 L gene expression, however, was significantly reduced in bicuspid aortic <b>valve</b> <b>samples</b> (median 787 -fold) relative to tricuspid aortic <b>valve</b> <b>samples</b> (median 10, 887 -fold, P =. 001). The amount of UFD 1 L gene product was also significantly diminished in bicuspid aortic <b>valve</b> <b>samples</b> (3. 9 ± 2. 6 vs 8. 4 ± 4. 8 optical density units, P <. 05). ConclusionBicuspid aortic valve was associated with downregulation of UFD 1 L gene expression, supporting the hypothesis that bicuspid aortic valve is a genetic disorder, with the UFD 1 L gene as a potential candidate gene...|$|R
