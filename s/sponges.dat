5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than <b>sponges)</b> are {{more closely related to}} particular groups of <b>sponges</b> than {{to the rest of the}} <b>sponges.</b> Such conclusions imply that <b>sponges</b> are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all <b>sponges</b> would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not <b>sponges.</b> A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within <b>sponges</b> was between glass <b>sponges</b> and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to calcareous <b>sponges,</b> those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass <b>sponges</b> are more closely related to each other than either is to calcareous <b>sponges,</b> which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sponges</b> were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: calcareous <b>sponges</b> (Calcarea), glass <b>sponges</b> (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, {{studies have shown}} that the Homoscleromorpha, a group thought to belong to the Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of <b>sponges.</b>|$|E
5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on <b>sponges.</b> It {{is often said}} that <b>sponges</b> produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by <b>sponges</b> and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread <b>sponges</b> by detaching fragments.|$|E

5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting <b>sponges</b> emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with <b>sponges.</b> This is another way in which encrusting <b>sponges</b> are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by <b>sponges</b> than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to hosting photosynthesizing endosymbionts, <b>sponges</b> are noted for their {{wide range of}} collaborations with other organisms. The relatively large encrusting sponge Lissodendoryx colombiensis is most common on rocky surfaces, but has extended its range into seagrass meadows by letting itself be surrounded or overgrown by seagrass <b>sponges,</b> which are distasteful to the local starfish and therefore protect Lissodendoryx against them; in return the seagrass <b>sponges</b> get higher positions away from the sea-floor sediment.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>sponges</b> shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away {{echinoderms}} which would otherwise prey on the <b>sponges.</b> They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as bryozoans or sea squirts from growing {{on or near}} them, making <b>sponges</b> very effective competitors for living space. One of many examples includes ageliferin.|$|E

25|$|Early {{aquaculture}} {{research into}} optimising techniques for sea <b>sponge</b> aquaculture used {{a number of}} farming methods. However, commercial <b>sponge</b> farming was met with severe resistance and interference from <b>sponge</b> fisherman, who believed that their continued income was under threat. The opposition by commercial <b>sponge</b> farmers resulted in a low market penetration and poor consumer adoption of aquacultured <b>sponge</b> products.|$|R

5|$|<b>Sponges</b> {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in temperate waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on <b>sponges</b> are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass <b>sponges</b> {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous <b>sponges</b> are abundant and diverse in shallower non-polar waters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sponges</b> {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous <b>sponges</b> have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living <b>sponges</b> can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sponges</b> {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of <b>sponges</b> may be detached by currents or waves. They use {{the mobility of}} their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach themselves to a suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional <b>sponges</b> {{over the course of}} several days. The same capabilities enable <b>sponges</b> that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E
40|$|Sponge-seaweed {{associations}} in the seaweed genus Ptilophora are poorly understood; therefore, 94 specimens, representing all 17 species of Ptilophora, were examined to detail this phenomenon. All but 2 Ptilophora species {{were shown to}} produce surface proliferations, with 13 species found to have <b>sponge</b> associations. Evidence for facultative <b>sponge</b> epiphytism was found with species-specific interactions being unlikely. Results show that surface proliferations are not induced by <b>sponge</b> epiphytes, as they often occur {{in the absence of}} <b>sponge</b> epiphytes, and vice versa. The significant number of proliferate thalli found with <b>sponge</b> epiphytes suggests that there is a likely relationship between the presence of surface proliferations and <b>sponge</b> infestation. <b>Sponge</b> epiphytes and Ptilophora species appeared structurally related in that the <b>sponge</b> probably exploits a niche habitat provided by the alga, for which surface proliferations might aid the <b>sponge</b> in bonding to the alga...|$|R

More rapid reduction of fever was demonstrated when <b>sponging</b> was combined with the oral antipyretic drug. <b>Sponging</b> with ice water or with alcohol in water were equally effective and significantly superior to <b>sponging</b> with tepid water; however, <b>sponging</b> with tepid water afforded significantly better comfort during the <b>sponging</b> procedure...|$|R
5|$|The {{single-celled}} choanoflagellates {{resemble the}} choanocyte cells of <b>sponges</b> {{which are used}} to drive their water flow systems and capture most of their food. This along with phylogenetic studies of ribosomal molecules {{have been used as}} morphological evidence to suggest <b>sponges</b> are the sister group to the rest of animals. Some studies have shown that <b>sponges</b> do not form a monophyletic group, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a common ancestor. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that comb jellies rather than <b>sponges</b> are the sister group to the rest of animals.|$|E
5|$|A {{very large}} and {{internally}} consistent alignment of 1,719 proteins at the metazoan scale, published in 2017, showed that (i) <b>sponges</b> – represented by Homoscleromorpha, Calcarea, Hexactinellida, and Demospongiae – are monophyletic, (ii) <b>sponges</b> are sister-group to all other multicellular animals, (iii) ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and (iv) placozoans emerge as the third animal lineage, followed by cnidarians sister-group to bilaterians.|$|E

A <b>sponge</b> crab cuts out a fragment from a <b>sponge</b> and trims it to its own shape using its claws. The last two pairs of legs are shorter than other legs and bend upward over the crab's carapace, to hold the <b>sponge</b> in place. The <b>sponge</b> grows along with the crab, providing a consistent shelter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} effect of various {{polymeric}} <b>sponge</b> and solid loadings on the properties of ceramic <b>sponge.</b> The study was based on four different polymeric <b>sponge</b> pore size ppi (pore per inch) with pore sizes ranging from 30 until 100 ppi. The polymeric <b>sponge</b> was impregnated in ceramic slurry with solid loading ranging from 20 to 60 wt. %. Effects of polymeric <b>sponge</b> and solid loading quantity were evaluated based on porosity, density and mechanical properties of resulted ceramic <b>sponge.</b> The ideal temperature for sintering is 1250 °C where the highest density and porosity are 0. 83499 g/m and 69. 965 %.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) have attractive biochemical properties such {{as strong}} cell adhesion and protein absorption, {{which are very}} useful for a cell cultivation scaffold. In this study, we prepared a multiwalled carbon nanotube-coated collagen <b>sponge</b> (MWCNT-coated <b>sponge)</b> to improve the surface properties of the collagen <b>sponge,</b> and its cell culturing properties were examined. The suface of the collagen <b>sponge</b> was homogeneously coated with MWCNTs by dispersion. MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were cultured on and inside the MWCNT-coated <b>sponge.</b> The DNA content on the MWCNT-coated <b>sponge</b> after 1 week of culture {{was significantly higher than}} on an uncoated collagen <b>sponge</b> (p< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference between}} the estimated ALP activity normalized by DNA quantity on the MWCNT-coated <b>sponge</b> and that on the uncoated collagen <b>sponge</b> which is well known as one of the best scaffolds for cell cultivation. In addition, the MWCNT-coated surface shows strong cell adhesion. Therefore, the MWCNT-coated collagen <b>sponge</b> is expected to be a useful 3 D scaffold for cell cultivation...|$|R

5|$|Lacking any {{protective}} shell or {{means of}} escape, <b>sponges</b> {{have evolved to}} synthesize a variety of unusual compounds. One such class is the oxidized fatty acid derivatives called oxylipins. Members of this family {{have been found to}} have anti-cancer, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties.

5|$|<b>Sponges</b> are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making it difficult for them to feed and breathe. The greatest numbers of <b>sponges</b> are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some <b>sponges</b> can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of aposematism in marine ecosystems is controversial. Many marine organisms, particularly those on coral reefs, are brightly coloured or patterned, including <b>sponges,</b> corals, molluscs and fishes, {{with little or}} no connection to chemical or physical defenses. Caribbean reef <b>sponges</b> are brightly coloured, {{and many of them are}} chemically defended, but there is no relationship between the two factors.|$|E
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting <b>sponges</b> both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, <b>sponges</b> on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by <b>sponges</b> were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
