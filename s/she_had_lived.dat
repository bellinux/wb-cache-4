5|$|Knowles {{had been}} working on her second studio album on and off since 2005 {{following}} her return home to Houston, Texas, and her divorce from Daniel Smith, with whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> following the birth of their son Daniel Julez in October 2004. The follow-up to the critical and commercial disappointment of 2003's Solo Star was preceded by Knowles's move from Columbia to Geffen Records in late 2007. Knowles was heavily influenced by Motown girl groups such as The Supremes and The Marvelettes, and by her mother Tina, a one-time member of the 1960s harmony group The Veltones, who used to play music by the likes of Dusty Springfield and Martha Reeves to her. Knowles decided to distance herself from the teen pop and dance-pop-oriented R sound mainly associated with her previous effort, Solo Star.|$|E
5|$|Converts were {{provided}} with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets. The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E
5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group {{made up of}} his family and a pupil. This {{ensemble}} was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E

5|$|Many {{years after}} the event, the Kentish {{antiquarian}} J. Meadows Cooper related that while sitting in a pub {{on the outskirts of}} Margate on Boxing Day 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden horse that entered the building. Another local resident, Mrs. Edward Tomlin, later related that as a child <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> at a house named Updown that was near to Margate, and that she remembered the hooden horse visiting them at Christmas time during the 1850s and up until 1865. Maylam's researches also found recollections of a hooden horse which had appeared in Herne and Swalecliffe but which been discontinued in the 1860s, another that was active from Wingate Farm House in Harbledown during the 1850s, and one that had been active at Evington but which had ceased by the 1860s. He found another based at Lower Hardres which had been active from at least the least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892.|$|E
5|$|One more legend narrated {{is about}} the goddess painted on a thangka in the monastery which is of Palden Lhamo. This female deity is {{compared}} to the Hindu Goddess Kali. Like Kali, Palden Lhamo's thangka is drawn in black colour, with flaming eyes, dressed in skirt made of tiger skin, and a garland of skulls around her neck. A moon disc adorns her hair, {{similar to the one}} seen on Shiva. She is also associated with Goddess Saraswati and Ma Tara. Legend also states that in the past <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Sri Lanka as the consort of a demon king who practiced human sacrifice. As she was not supportive of this practice she fled from the kingdom. As she was running away, the king shot her shot with an arrow, which struck the backside of the mule that she was riding. When she drew out the arrow, it left a gaping hole in the mule's back, and through this gap Palden Lhamo could watch the teachings of Lord Buddha.|$|E

25|$|Maria {{continued}} to give speeches and write through the 1880s. By 1890 she became {{too ill to}} be active and for last 15 years of her life, Maria lived in strict retirement due to ill health. Despite her ill health and Emily's death in 1897 she wrote her Last Words to Girls on Life in School and after School in 1889.

25|$|Upon {{her death}} the cities {{that she had}} dwelt in came to revere and acclaim her as a saint while the Dominican nuns <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> with {{preserved}} her remains at their Peru convent. The cause for her canonization later commenced {{with the beginning of}} the informative process tasked with collecting documentation from 26 September 1961 until the process was closed on 10 July 1962 at which stage her writings received theological approval on 8 July 1965. The officials in charge of the cause sent a large Positio dossier to Rome to the Congregation for Rites for investigation before historians approved the cause on 8 May 1974. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Paul VI on 27 September 1975 and she became titled as a Servant of God as a result. Theologians met to discuss the cause on 24 July 1984 but did not come up with a clear consensus so met again on 20 December 1984 where the group approved the cause. The members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the cause as well on 16 June 1987. Martillo became titled as Venerable on 23 October 1987 after Pope John Paul II acknowledged the fact that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> a model life of heroic virtue.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that she was probably born in Europe {{and moved to the}} United States before reaching her teenage years, as examination of her tooth enamel indicated.

Isotope testing was conducted on her hair, teeth, and bones. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in the U.S. for 5 to 10 years, and most likely had resided in Tennessee or a nearby state. Examination on the unborn girl indicated that the child had gestated while the victim was in the Southeastern part of the country.|$|E
