50|$|The Indian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Lissemys punctata) is a {{freshwater}} {{species of}} turtle found in South Asia. The “flap-shelled” name {{stems from the}} presence of femoral flaps located on the plastron. These flaps of skin cover the limbs when they retract into the shell.

50|$|The Indian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle</b> {{was placed}} in Appendix II of CITES in 1975 {{at the request of}} Bangladesh. However, L. p. punctata was the taxon listed, not L. p. andersoni. Subsequent reviews of the {{literature}} and available data could find no evidence to support this endangered status. Some scientists now classify L. p. punctata and L. p. andersoni as a single subspecies. This subspecies is the most common aquatic turtle in India. Consequently, the Indian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle</b> was removed from the endangered species list in 1983 (48 FR 52740). This action, however, did not affect the turtle's status on Appendix II of CITES.|$|R
