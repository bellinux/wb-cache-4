The Telecoms Package created a new pan-European agency called Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications (BEREC) overseeing telecoms regulation in the Member States. It provided for Member States to set minimum quality of service levels for broadband network transmission. It harmonised European contractual rights for telephone and Internet subscribers. These rights included the ability to switch telephone operators within 24 hours of giving notice, and retaining the phone number. Broadband and phone providers are obligated to limit the contract term to 12 months. Subscribers are to be notified of data privacy breaches.|$|E
50|$|To {{spread and}} share his {{understandings}} {{and appreciation of}} Chinese architecture, and most importantly, to help save its diminishing building technologies, Liang published his first book, Qing Structural Regulations in 1934. The book was {{on the study of}} the methods and rules of Qing architecture with the 1734 Qing Architecture Regulation and several other ancient manuals as the textbook, the carpenters as teachers, and the Forbidden City in Beijing as teaching material. Since its publication, for more than seven decades, this book has become a standard textbook for anyone who wants to understand the essence of ancient Chinese architecture. Liang considered the study of Qing <b>Structural</b> <b>Regulation</b> as a stepping stone to the much more daunting task of studying the Song dynasty Yingzao Fashi (Treatise on Architectural Methods), due to the large number of specialist terms used in that manual differing substantially from the Qing dynasty architectural terminology.|$|E

40|$|Congress {{passed the}} Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in {{reaction}} to the enormous political pressures generated by the wave of corporate financial scandals during 2001 - 2002. The Act 2 ̆ 7 s innovative reforms of corporate governance law were shaped by powerful political constraints on the use of private litigation and tensions over the use of 2 ̆ 2 <b>structural</b> <b>regulation</b> 2 ̆ 2 to alter the internal governance structures and procedures of publicly traded corporations. The conservative political realignment during 1990 s precluded the development or expansion of litigious enforcement mechanisms (i. e., private causes of action) to curb corporate and managerial financial misconduct. Consequently, a number of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2 ̆ 7 s core provisions took the form of <b>structural</b> <b>regulation</b> intended to function as non-litigious, self-executing mechanisms of regulation. Political constraints on the use of private litigation as an enforcement mechanism entailed a more direct intervention of state power within the corporation and blurred the established boundaries between the public and private spheres. However, the legislative reforms did not alter the core processes of corporate managerial power - the nomination and election of directors to the board. When the SEC attempted to do so, it threatened encroachment on the private sphere and the institutional bases of managerial power and autonomy and produced a backlash by business elites against further reforms and against the underlying logic of Sarbanes-Oxley itself...|$|E

40|$|The {{functional}} {{variability in}} leaf angle distribution within the canopy was analysed {{with respect to}} regulation of light interception and photoprotection. Leaf orientation strongly determined the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) during summer: horizontal leaves were highly photoinhibited whereas vertical leaf orientation protected the leaves from severe photoinhibition. The importance of leaf orientation within the canopy was analysed in two Mediterranean macchia species with distinct strategies for drought and photoinhibition avoidance during summer. The semi-deciduous species (Cistus monspeliensis) exhibited strong seasonal but minimal spatial variability in leaf orientation. Reversible <b>structural</b> <b>regulation</b> of light interception by vertical leaf orientation during summer protected the leaves from severe photoinhibition. The evergreen sclerophyll (Quercus coccifera) exhibited high spatial variability in leaf angle distribution throughout the year and was less susceptible to photoinhibition. The importance of both strategies for plant primary production was analysed with a three-dimensional canopy photoinhibition model (CANO-PI). Simulations indicated that high variability in leaf angle orientation in Q. coccifera resulted in whole-plant carbon gain during the summer, which was 94 % of the maximum rate achieved by theoretical homogeneous leaf orientations. The high spatial variability in leaf angle orientation may be an effective compromise between efficient light harvesting and avoidance of excessive radiation in evergreen plants and may optimize annual primary production. Whole plant photosynthesis was strongly reduced by water stress and photoinhibition in C. monspeliensis; however, the simulations indicated that growth-related <b>structural</b> <b>regulation</b> of light interception served as an important protection against photoinhibitory reduction in whole-plant carbon gain...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of concrete cracking upon reinforcement corrosion is complex. Cracks allow fast penetration of chlorides, potentially {{leading to a}} shorter initiation period of reinforcement corrosion. <b>Structural</b> <b>regulations</b> control acceptable crack width values based on the exposure class of the structure.

Research studies on corrosion of reinforcement embedded in cracked concrete have shown that the correlation between cracks and corrosion is rather complex. Studying the condition of pitting in steel reinforcement embedded in cracked concrete from a microscopic approach could lead to insights on the mechanisms of corrosion under this condition. In this research, reinforced concrete specimens were subject to cracking. Subsequently, the specimens were exposed to salt-dry cycles with a chloride solution while continuously monitoring of open circuit potential (OCP), linear polarization resistance (LPR) and electrical resistance of concrete. Visual analysis of corrosion pits of steel bars showed that a correlation between crack width and pit dimensions was foun...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{robustness}} is {{the ability}} of a structure to resist against progressive and/or disproportionate collapse. Although at present the main <b>structural</b> <b>regulations</b> foresee guidance for robustness, often the designers don't consider directly these requirements; however, in some cases the buildings have been designed to withstand earthquakes, following the capacity design criteria. The aim of this work is to assess the efficiency of the seismic detailing to ensure robustness of structures not directly designed against progressive and disproportionate collapse. The assessment is based on the comparison of two distinct design of the same structure: in the first case the seismic action is considered, while in the second one the seismic action is neglected. Both the structures are subjected to a column removal and their response after this exceptional event is evaluated. Three different configurations are tested removing respectively an internal, an edge and a corner column placed at the ground floor level. The obtained results show the improvement achievable, in terms of structural robustness, adopting seismic detailing, highlighting the importance of a seismicoriented design also in the prevention of collapse due to accidental actions...|$|R

It argues that technological change and the regulators {{in a new era}} of deregulation provide the momentum for new firms to enter established markets, with entry occurring at both a primary and a secondary level. Primary entry occurs when firms in closely related industries produce a set of core products that can be easily adapted and expanded to facilitate second-level entry into targeted markets. The Canadian telecommunications industry and the introduction of satellite technology is used as an example of this entry process, concluding that successful and sustainable entry occurs by firms in closely related industries when regulators create attractive entry conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} effort-aversion {{moral hazard}} in banks. When the evaluation and monitoring of loans requires private management effort, monitoring efforts {{are sensitive to}} the intensity of competition in the credit market. Equilibrium loan rates incorporate an oligopoly premium and a provision for bad loans. While competition reduces the oligopoly premium it also reduces monitoring incentives. Therefore, in line with recent evidence from Switzerland, loan provisions increase under deregulation, leaving the overall effect on firms' cost of finance ambiguous. Capital adequacy regulation tends to increase effort-aversion moral hazard. Furthermore it is shown that capital standards may amplify business cycles and, counter-productively, increase systemic risk. The model suggests a certain degree of complementarity between prudential and <b>structural</b> <b>regulation</b> for the banking industry. ...|$|E
40|$|Corporate {{mergers and}} the {{consolidation}} of ownership in the American communications arena have long been sources of concern. US regulatory and antitrust policy traditionally attempted to secure a “diversity of voices ” structurally, largely through rules regarding ownership. Although the meaning of diversity was always problematic and under-theorized, the Federal Communications Commission long set ceilings on the numbers of broadcast outlets any single person or corporation could own and enacted cross-ownership rules such as a prohibition against a corporation owning a newspaper and broadcast outlets in the same market. These rules, and the FCC’s authority to make them, were upheld, occasionally even compelled, by the federal appellate courts. In the last 20 years, however, legal trends, in conjunction with political developments, have undermined the diversity rationales behind ownership rules and associated <b>structural</b> <b>regulations</b> of mass media. Paradoxically, even as media corporations are becoming larger and presumably more powerful, ownership regulations are being rescinded or struck down. This paper explains this history. It concludes with a suggestion that the First Amendment metaphor of marketplace of ideas is misplaced and how our thinking about media ownership and diversity might {{be better served by}} the metaphor of a mixed media system...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent review}} of ship <b>structural</b> <b>regulations</b> (Ship Structures Committee Project 1444) {{was aimed at}} {{clarifying}} best practice in regulations. The review focused on the hull girder and bottom structure. The majority of rules reviewed are formulated in terms of elastic stresses. It was expected that the review {{would be able to}} identify implicit as well as explicit factors of safety in either the load or strength formulations or both. However, no such factors of safety against yielding were found. While this was initially surprising, it leads to an interesting and useful insight into the question of why ships are able to operate safely. The best explanation is that ships, especially new ships, rely on small levels of plastic deformation to create a significant strength reserve, easily capable of withstanding not only the design loads, but overload conditions as well. Ductility is thus a crucially important material property for keeping ships safe. The complexity of plastic response raises the question of how best to reflect this issue in rules. This is especially important when considering the safety of aging ships. The issues of coating design, corrosion and fatigue deserve to be reexamined with a view to the effects of the plastic behavior during ageing...|$|R

Only the shortages of steel following the Second World War gave great impetus to the development of reinforced concrete, which can be easily shaped and enabled a radical change in possible structural forms through its tensile as well as compressive strength. This paper focuses on the roof’s shell of the ancient general market of Verona (Italy) built in 1929. It represents one of the early concrete shell roof designed by Italian engineers. In the building, the membrane roof covers an area of about 490 square meters and it is composed by a thin shell of 0. 08 meter ribbed by 16 RC beams.
