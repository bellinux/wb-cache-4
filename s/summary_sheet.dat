Teams may also use the overview to explain items or processes that might appear to be discrepancies within the report.""The core of the report is the series of costing sheets. This section must contain the one-page <b>summary</b> <b>sheet</b> broken up into the individual subsystems." [...] The Cost Documentation [...] "includes copies of receipts, invoices, price tags, catalog pages, online prices, or other documentation, tosubstantiate {{the costs of the}} parts and materials of any item costing more than $30. Cost documentation must be at fullretail US prices. The use of foreign receipts, purchases from discount sites such as Craigslist, EBay or junk yards are notallowed. Starting in 2016, transponders are no longer part of the cost report and therefore no documentation for them is needed either. The report is expected to be comprehensive, well documented, truthful and accurate."At the race, the ten teams with lowest cost in their cost report are then audited by an official. The official will go in depth to review the cost documents and compare them to the actual vehicle. Missing items or math errors will be added to the cost document and a penalty may be issued.|$|E

30|$|The {{application}} of these rules to the same object may lead to conflicting situations. Preliminary work on the classification of conflicts are reported in [4], where several types of conflicts have been defined (see also [5],[6]). Benferhat et al. [7] presents an approach based on possibilistic logic to deal with conflicts in prioritized security policies. However, there is another type of conflict which is not managed yet, namely, the conflict between obligations with deadlines. This kind of conflict could happen {{in the case of}} overlapping deadlines. For example: (i) The doctor is obliged to fill in the <b>summary</b> <b>sheet</b> within 1 h after the patient leaves. (ii) The surgeon must be vigilant in the operating room. If the doctor is a surgeon and he is in the operating room during a patient’s leaving, and if the duration of the surgery ends 2 h after the patient’s leaving, the surgeon cannot fill in the <b>summary</b> <b>sheet</b> of the patient because the surgery could end after the deadline associated with filling the <b>summary</b> <b>sheet.</b> Thus, there may be situations where it is impossible to meet certain obligation requirements of the security policy before their deadlines.|$|E

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{provides}} screenshots {{of the financial}} models of the five mixed-species agroforestry (MSA) models selected and described in Working Paper 8, together with notes to explain the structure and interpretation of these models. The Microsoft Excel workbook for each MSA system consists {{of a set of}} spreadsheets, including a first or <b>summary</b> <b>sheet</b> and a sheet for each individual species module. For each MSA system, the <b>summary</b> <b>sheet</b> contains the key parameter values of the system, and these are referenced by the spreadsheets for individual species. Conversely, the <b>summary</b> <b>sheet</b> for each system references the cash flow sequences for each individual species module to compile a summary of financial performance for the overall agroforestry system. Each species module is for a standard area unit of 1 ha, and all use a discount rate of 8 %. Estimates of annual capital outlays, operating costs and revenue generated are presented for each individual species, to derive the annual net cash flows. Annual labour requirements are also estimated. The currency units are those for the country to which the MSA is best suited (Fiji dollars or Vanuatu vatu). In the <b>summary</b> <b>sheet,</b> the overall net present value (NPV) is computed for each species mixture. Sensitivity analysis, breakeven analysis and scenario analysis (where optimistic or pessimistic values for all parameters are considered simultaneously) are demonstrated. Notably, these have not been performed for individual tree and crop species, the financial analyses being designed to evaluate overall agroforestry systems, not individual components of them. Because the overall rotation length varies between MSA systems, the financial performance of all systems is compared on the basis of site value or land expectation value (LEV) (the sum of NPVs for a perpetual rotation). It is found that given the parameter values and other assumptions of the analyses, all the selected species mixtures would generate positive returns. NPV estimates per hectare for the five MSA systems in local currencies (Fiji dollars and Vanuatu Vatu) and Australian dollars are summarised in the following table. MSA species mixtures 2, 4 and 5 have very similar LEVs, considerably lower than those for mixtures 1 (dominated by mango) and 3 (dominated by sandalwood) ...|$|E
