40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study on the}} {{microbiological}} stability of canned tuna produced by Italian companies and similar canned products manufactured in countries outside Europe are reported herein. The study involved 38 samples of canned tuna of various brands, of which 14 were produced by companies outside Europe and 24 by Italian companies. Qualitative and quantitative microbiological tests were conducted for the following parameters: bacterial colony counts at 30 °C, total coliforms, total Enterobacteriaceae, <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>anaerobes,</b> Salmonella spp., Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, yeasts and molds. Bacterial loads and mold contamination were respectivelyin found in 8 / 14 (57 %) samples from outside EU and 7 / 24 (29 %) Italian samples. The bacterial flora was represented by Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus lentus, Streptococcus mitis, Enterococcus faecalis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides), Gram-negative bacteria (Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Acinetobacter iwoffii, Rhizobium radiobacter), spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus vallismortis), while the fungal species was represented by Penicillium spp., Rhizopus spp., Rhodotorula spp. and Alternaria spp. Excluding anomalies in the thermal treatment process of products and any contamination after treatment, the contaminations encountered in both cases were most likely due to insufficient production quality standards {{and the quality of the}} raw material used. These results may require a redefinition of the concept of commercial stability as hitherto stated...|$|E
40|$|To satisfy {{its water}} needs {{increasingly}} growing, Morocco {{has an important}} infrastructure of dams. However, demographic and economic expansion of Morocco {{could lead to a}} deterioration of the water quality of these artificial lakes. The Moulouya watershed is among the most important watersheds in Morocco, it contains to the present five major dams, among them the Hassan II dam, which became operational in 2005. This dam {{is one of the largest}} Moroccan reservoirs with a maximum storage capacity of 400 million cubic meters. However, increased human activities upstream of the dam associated with the phenomenon of erosion could lead to pollution of this water mass. The aim of our study was to assess the water quality of the reservoir through the search of bacterial indicators of fecal contamination, via a monthly followed, during the study period from September 2011 until August 2012. Detection of fecal coliforms (CF) and fecal streptococci (SF) in the waters of the dam was a presumption of its contamination by the feces. With the exception of bottom waters that were loaded with spores of <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>anaerobes</b> (ASR), the waters of the other stations in the water column did not contain these spores. However, water levels in total coliforms (CT), CF and SF were qualified water quality of the dam as good to excellent, this according to the Moroccan standards of quality of surface waters...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} to fill knowledge gaps on {{the occurrence of}} pathogens in different streams of wastewater, e. g. greywater and domestic wastewater. The aims were also to measure the removal of pathogens in different treatment processes, conventional and innovative, and correlate the removal to that of common microbial process indicators, such as faecal coliforms, enterococci, Cl. perfringens spores and bacteriophages. One study also assessed {{the correlation between the}} removal of microorganisms and some commonly measured physico-chemical process indicators. The results can be applied in microbial risk assessments (MRAs) of urban wastewater systems. Indicators and parasitic (oo) cysts were enumerated with standard methods and viruses with rtPCR. High levels of Giardia cysts and enteroviruses were found in untreated wastewater (103. 2 and 104. 2 L- 1 respectively) indicating high incidences in the society. Noroviruses were also often found in high numbers (103. 3 L- 1) during winter, but less frequent and in lower numbers (102. 3 L- 1) {{during the rest of the}} year. This temporal variation correlated to the clinical laboratory reporting of noroviruses. A temporal variation was also shown for Giardia with significantly lower cyst counts in untreated wastewater during spring. Cryptosporidium oocysts were not as numerous in untreated wastewater (5 L- 1) reflecting a lower incidence in the society than for the other pathogens during the time of the study. Since temporal variation had a larger impact than spatial, site-specific measurements may not be necessary to perform screening level MRAs of wastewater discharge and reuse. Good data can be found in the literature and corrected for by recovery of the detection method, flow and incidence in the society. Removal of microorganisms in wastewater treatments varied from 0 to > 5. 8 log due to process combination and organism in question. Treatment in integrated hydroponics removed microorganism more efficiently than did secondary conventional treatment, though having longer hydraulic retention time. Tertiary treatment and treatment in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) showed better removal potential than treatment in upflow anaerobic sludge blankets (UASB) in a pilot plant. Human virus genomes were less removed and Giardia cysts more removed than all of the studied indicators. Enumeration with PCR, however, may underestimate infectious virion removal. Spores of <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>anaerobes</b> and somatic coliphages were significantly less removed than E. coli and enterococci in all the studied processes. Bacterial indicator and spore removals correlated to enterovirus genome removal (p< 0. 05), but the predictive values were low (R< 0. 4). Removals between microbial indicators and NH 4 -N, Kjeldal-N, COD and TOC correlated stronger (10 - 18 <p< 0. 02; 0. 43 <R< 0. 90). To manage the risk with reuse and discharge of wastewater, treatment performance targets have been calculated as a step in a hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) approach. These targets varied from 0 to 10. 4 log removal due to water (grey or wastewater), organism (rotavirus, Campylobacter or parasitic (oo) cysts) and exposure (drinking water, surface water, aerosols, irrigation of crops or public parks). Faecal contamination in greywater was measured by coprostanol and was shown to be 980 times lower than in wastewater, corresponding to 2. 9 log removal in treatment. Somatic coliphages were suggested to function as an index of virus removal in wastewater treatment processes as well as to be included in the monitoring of bathing water. The guideline level was suggested to be 300 PFU 100 mL- 1 based on MRA of enteroviruses. This level in a water sample would equal a probability of infection of 0. 3 % (95 th percentile 4 %). The risk is overestimated if animal sources dominate the faecal pollution. Development in methods to track sources of faecal pollution showed that if somatic coliphages are enumerated together with phages infecting Bacteroides strain GA 17, discriminating human from animal faecal pollution is possible based on the ratio between the phagesQC 2010101...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} abomasal fructo-oligosaccharides supplementation on sheep faecal {{microbiota}} {{was investigated in}} a balanced, two Latin square, cross-over design experiment. Ten fistulated sheep were managed in five consecutive periods, with each of five treatments (an 'acidified saline' control or one of four prebiotic candidates chosen to represent different types of oligosaccharides: Arabinogalactan, Fibruline, Raftilose, or Yacon) administered to two sheep in each period. Seven grams of fructo-oligosaccharides were used daily for each animal. In each period, fresh faecal samples were collected before, during and after 'supplementation' {{for the analysis of}} bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, Escherichia coli, <b>sulphite-reducing</b> clostridia, total <b>anaerobes,</b> pH and dry matter. The treatments with Fibruline, Raftilose and Yacon increased the sheep faecal bifidobacteria after 9 days of daily dosing. Compared with the control, the Raftilose treatment caused the greatest increase by 2. 128 log 10 CFU/g of faeces (P< 0. 01), followed by the Yacon and Fibruline treatments, by 0. 990 (P< 0. 05) and 0. 925 log 10 CFU/g of faeces (P= 0. 05), respectively. Both Raftilose and Yacon treatments increased the number of lactobacilli by 1. 286 (P< 0. 05) and 1. 138 log 10 CFU/g of faeces (P< 0. 05) after 9 days of daily dosing. All tested fructo-oligosaccharides had no effect on sulphite-reducing clostridia and E. coli. There were no changes in sheep faecal pH or dry matter between the treatments. These data provide the first evidence that the bifidogenic effects of fructo-oligosaccharides, previously shown to be gained in the large intestine of monogastric animals, are also efficacious in the ruminant...|$|R
40|$|As only little {{detailed}} microbiological {{data about}} only few farms with automatic milking systems were {{available at the}} time of the study, a complete compilation of farms using AMV (Automatische Melkverfahren, Automatic milking procedures), the assessment of the working surroundings and the implementation of microbiological and chemical-physical investigations were planned and carried out. In the course of the 18 -months-project it was confirmed that an AMV is always very demanding on the farmer concerning his farm’s management. The big advantage of these systems is the flexibility of the working hours. The results of the milk study and the swabs samples reveal strong differences in part between farms with a system of the same manufacturer indicating the importance of the factor management among other factors. But only if the total concept of milking technique and -hygiene, the animal‘s house construction and -hygiene, animal’s health and feeding are harmonized, the striven saving of working hours can be reached. The microbiological results of the examination often show a worse status of hygiene concerning AMV than concerning conventional systems. The scope of the study comprised 108 samples from 99 farms with a total of 110 milking systems. The investigation comprised 15 parameters. Only in two cases (pseudomonads and yeasts) the values of the automatic systems are lower than those of conventional systems (including one exception: sulphitereducing anaerobes). For all other microbiological criteria in the milk of automatic systems higher values can be found. Examinated parameters are total viable count, lactic acid bacteria, lactobacilli, coagulase positive staphylococci, enterococci, enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, E. coli and molds. Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes could be detected each once. In both cases, an automated system was affected. When viewing the physical-chemical examination results (cell count, fat, protein, lactose, freezing point, dry matter) the benefits are related to conventional milking systems. Thus, these systems show higher fat, protein and lactose - values and lower cell numbers than the automatic systems. Both a detectable freezing point depression and the lower dry matter content of milk from automated systems compared to conventional processing leads to the conclusion that the water content in the milk from farms applying automatic milking systems is higher. Overall, the automated systems are able to meet the relevant requirements of milk regulation at present time and would also meet the values defined in Reg. (EG) 853 / 2004. In addition, a large range of data arises when comparing different brands of milking systems. However, even {{at the time of the}} investigation it was possible to get milk of the best quality with all brands of the tested automatic milking systems. Meanwhile the AMVs have been established in daily farm work and are on a high technical level. The evaluation of the 381 swab samples, in which the same spectrum of germs was investigated as in the milk tank samples, exhibits different trends. Regarding the study of the liner heads a trended very homogeneous picture is received. Except for the parameter yeast and Bacillus cereus, all values of automatic systems were lower than the ones of conventional milking systems. Shafts of the teatcup liner show, based on the total bacterial count, a similar trend. The same applies for staphylococci and Bacillus cereus. With respect to the other criteria, the majority of the results of the automatic milking exceed those of the conventional systems (lactic acid bacteria, pseudomonads, enterococci, coliforms, E. coli, molds and <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>anaerobes).</b> In the conventional systems, the strongest bacterial load was detected on the rinsing heads. Regarding the environment-associated coliforms indicating dirt (especially the faecal germ E. coli), the trend is reversed. In this aspect, significantly higher values could be detected in the automated systems. The results of the investigations of the special udder/teat cleaning systems indicate a lack of clean condition. The requirement for a successful management of these systems is hygiene and cleanliness on the farm, because an automatic milking system is not able to bring the cleaning intensity into line with the individual grade of the udder’s dirtiness and it is not able to control the success of cleaning. That’s why a low output bacterial count is desirable. Stable and animal hygiene are important starting points to reduce the bacterial load on the slabs and teats. A drying of teats after cleaning would have a positive impact on hygiene. Importance should be attached to cleaning and disinfection of the milk carrying components as hygienic vulnerabilities exist in both the automatic and conventional systems. The weak point of all systems - the timely identification and following separation of nonmarketable milk before it reaches the bulk tank - will be continued to work on. On the basis of their computer programmes, automatic milking procedures are capable of comparing current milking with relevant previous ones, so information about differences can be obtained. However, these systems lack precision so often incorrect positive or negative results are created. The first lead to economical losses, the last are decreasing milk quality. The automatic milking procedures must be able to recognize mastitis perfectly and eliminate non-marketable milk before reaching the bulk tank. The usage and development of biosensor technology promises improvements. The problem with the depressed freezing point requires future measures to reduce the residual water content in the milk-carrying equipment...|$|E
