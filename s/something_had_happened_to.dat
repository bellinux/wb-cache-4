25|$|Due to the foggy {{conditions}} and limited visibility at the airport, it took controllers nearly {{two minutes to}} determine that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> North Central Flight 575. Once they did, they alerted the Chicago Fire Department, which arrived at the scene about a minute later, three minutes after the crash. Employing 11 crash and fire vehicles and two ambulances, the fire department extinguished the fire in about 16 minutes at around 6:19p.m. CST.|$|E
25|$|The two escort {{ships were}} unaware of what was {{happening}} to General Belgrano, as they were out of touch with her in the gloom and had not seen the distress rockets or lamp signals. Adding to the confusion, the crew of Bouchard felt an impact that was possibly the third torpedo striking {{at the end of its}} run (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward and began dropping depth charges. By the time the ships realised that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> General Belgrano, it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts.|$|E
2500|$|... "Frank {{was talking}} to Sarah on the telephone. They were arguing. He {{went out into the}} garden and let his shotgun off into the air. She was frightened that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him and called the {{emergency}} services. He did it to try to make her scared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} find out. I'm greatly worried. Something tells me that Ralph is not safe--that <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{fear that}} <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him," [...] she answered; [...] "he {{should have been}} back by now: he promised to return within the fortnight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was my father, Pumpkin; I am sure of it. He is missing, and <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him. Perhaps he {{fell and}} hurt himself. Come on." ...|$|R
2500|$|The mount {{was covered}} by the cloud for six days, and on the seventh day Moses went into {{the midst of the}} cloud and was [...] "in the mount forty days and forty nights." [...] And Moses said, [...] "the [...] {{delivered}} unto me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the [...] spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly." [...] Before the full forty days expired, the children of Israel collectively decided that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Moses, and compelled Aaron to fashion a golden calf, and he [...] "built an altar before it" [...] and the people [...] "worshipped" [...] the calf.|$|E
2500|$|As Rivers {{notes in}} Instinct and the Unconscious, one manifestation of {{his lack of}} visual memory was his {{inability}} to visualise {{any part of the}} upper floor of the house he lived in until he was five. This visual blank is made even more significant by the fact that Rivers was able to describe the lower floors of that particular house with far more accuracy than {{he had been able to}} with any house since and, although images of later houses were faded and incomplete, no memory since had been as inaccessible as that of the upper floor of his early home. [...] With the evidence that he was presented with, Rivers was led to the conclusion that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him on the upper floor of that house, the memory of which was entirely suppressed because it [...] "interfered with [...] comfort and happiness". Indeed, not only was that specific memory rendered inaccessible but his sensory memory in general appears to have been severely handicapped from that moment.|$|E
60|$|Dr Macphail's {{first thought}} was that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Miss Thompson.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him," [...] {{returned}} Randolph Rover. [...] "I do {{not like}} this oppressive silence. Have your pistol ready for use. We may need our weapons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he {{adds that}} he sent father a {{telegram}} and so far no answer has come back," [...] went on Dick, seriously. [...] "He thinks <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> dad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi, there! Mrs. Moss! <b>Something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Miss Celia, and I'm {{going to}} find her. Thorny is asleep; tell him easy, and I'll come {{back as soon as}} I can!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{would think}} <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> prevent you lettin' me know, but I'd never think ill of you," [...] replied Tommy.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it? What's the matter?" [...] asked Toby, in alarm, {{thinking}} at once of Abner, and fearing that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is that all?' said Arthur, laughing; 'I thought <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> you. Come, on {{with your}} bonnet. Fancy! John will {{actually}} walk with us to St. Cross!' ...|$|E
50|$|In 1985, police {{officers}} tell Patrick that <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> {{his brother and}} his family. A blood-covered young Jane is coaxed out by an officer. Lavender Blue plays in the background.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; a {{young woman}} started from our country to see Dinah, Friday was a fortnight. I came to fetch her back. I'm afraid <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her. I can't stop. Good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must get}} home now," [...] said he {{in a rather}} faint voice. [...] "Mrs. Peter will be sure that <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me and will be worried almost to death." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sam's {{face was}} pale with {{apprehension}} that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Peter; but, he said, [...] "How dat be, Massa Tom, with Sam {{in the next}} room all the time?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} for some time raised on her elbow, but then as if <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her {{vitality}} she sank down till her head rested again on the sofa cushion.|$|E
6000|$|Mike {{resented the}} tone, but followed. Evidently <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> upset Bob seriously. As {{they went out}} on the gravel, {{somebody}} congratulated Bob again, and again Bob hardly seemed to appreciate it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon {{they are}} going to be Sam's twins after all," [...] said Henry. [...] "That is, unless <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Sam. If he's dead--but no, I can't think that, can you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Duchess," [...] she said, [...] "I am so sorry, but I {{am afraid}} that <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Dicky. If you do not mind, I am going to ask Sir Charles to take me home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> annoy you, sir, {{since we}} parted {{company in the}} Park?" [...] said Pedgift Junior. [...] "Excuse the question; I only ask it in case I can be of any use." ...|$|R
60|$|Dan {{never had}} been gone so long before, and Davy was afraid <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him. For a few minutes he was in great trouble; then he cheered up, and took courage.|$|E
60|$|Kirk nodded. The {{criticism}} was just. It erred, if at all, {{on the side}} of mildness. Certainly <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him since he perpetrated those daubs. He had developed. He saw things with new eyes.|$|E
60|$|Kit did not answer, {{but went}} out, and Askew {{sat by the}} fire with a {{thoughtful}} look. <b>Something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the lad, and Peter wondered what it was. He felt vaguely disturbed, but could see no light.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not remain}} away later than to-morrow noon," [...] said James Morris, {{when they were}} ready to leave. [...] "If you are not back by that time I shall fear that <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> you also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mistake me," [...] said Wade. [...] "You {{are alive}} and in this room of Boyce's. But <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> your eyes. You cannot see; you can feel and hear, but not see. Do you follow me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We thought <b>something</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] {{said the}} cook. [...] "Kate {{has been in}} a fine way about it. Five minutes after you lost me she found me, and we've been hunting 'igh and low ever since." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{think he}} understood, though I could explain nothing, but that I {{had had a}} fear <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him, for from that time forward he dropped all reserve with me, and talked openly of our {{approaching}} parting.|$|E
60|$|All {{those things}} were over now--perhaps that was it! <b>Something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> {{the world and the}} old light had been turned out. He himself was changed, and Sid was changed, terribly changed, and Ann no doubt was changed.|$|E
60|$|Mr. O'Malley, who {{had been}} standing, {{instantly}} sat down, as if appalled by the suddenness of the event. Every one in the court who had seen McKeon's face as he entered, felt aware that <b>something</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Feemy.|$|E
50|$|Everything {{has gone}} fairly {{well for the}} doctor since the {{arrangement}} began. Now, however, <b>something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Blessington. He <b>has</b> become excitable and agitated, this after {{he said that he}} had read about a burglary somewhere in the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a soul in sight," [...] he mused. [...] "It must {{be about}} midnight. Can <b>something</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> father? He {{said he felt}} rather strange in his head {{when he went to}} bed. If only Jack Rasco would come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something is the matter," [...] persisted Eustace Hignett, [...] "I {{can tell}} it by your manner. <b>Something</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> disturb and upset you. I know you so well that I can pierce the mask. What is it? Tell me." ...|$|R
