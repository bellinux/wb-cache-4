Quantifying {{the financial}} effect from IS <b>security</b> <b>investments</b> is difficult to derive. This study investigated the relationship between e-banking <b>investments</b> in IS <b>security</b> and their market value impacts. Using an event study approach, the author captured e-banking firm specific data and isolated the IS security effect through the measured change in market values. The author hypothesized that announcements of IS <b>security</b> <b>investments</b> would result in statistically significant changes in market values. The author also hypothesized two sub-segments of the selected <b>security</b> <b>investment</b> data, technology and people, would support statistically significant changes in the market values of e-banking service providers. The hypotheses were tested by measuring stock market reactions to the IS security announcements selected from an eight-year period (2003 - 2010). Study findings indicated statistically significant market reactions for e-banking firms making IS <b>security</b> <b>investment</b> announcements and suggested that investors rewarded IS <b>security</b> technology <b>investments</b> more highly than e-banking firms making IS <b>security</b> people-focused <b>investment</b> announcements. The author concluded that because investors understand that mandatory regulatory compliance represents an e-banking firm 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to creating a secure computing environment, e-banking information systems are perceived as secure therefore, disclosing IS <b>security</b> <b>investments</b> results in weak changes to market values. Ultimately effective management of IS security requires acceptance of the idea that it is not technically feasible or financially viable to implement protections for all identified IS security risks therefore IS <b>security</b> <b>investments</b> must be effectively measured and risk levels consciously selected in order to implement the right technical and operational protections to support a firm 2 ̆ 7 s selected risk posture.

40|$|Building on {{organizational}} learning theory, we seek {{to identify}} the performance effects of <b>security</b> <b>investments</b> that arise from previous failures or external regulatory pressure.

Using a Cox proportional hazard model, we demonstrate that proactive <b>security</b> <b>investments</b> are associated with lower security failure rates than reactive investments. Further, {{the results show that}} external pressure improves the security performance of healthcare organizations. However, external pressure decreases the positive effect of proactive <b>investments</b> on <b>security</b> performance. This implies that proactive investments, voluntarily made, have the greatest impact on security performance. Our findings suggest that security managers and policy makers should pay attention to the strategic and regulatory factors influencing <b>security</b> <b>investment</b> decisions.
