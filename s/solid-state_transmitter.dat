50|$|Another {{change from}} {{existing}} satellites is using <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{rather than the}} traveling wave tubes used in most high-power military SHF/EHF applications.

Studios {{were set up}} in Mornington House, {{in the nearby town}} of Trim. The station cost £6 million to set up. Just over 47 million people were in the station's broadcast area.|$|R
50|$|Founded by a {{group of}} radar {{engineers}} in 1971, EEC made its public debut in 1974, when production of cavity magnetron and klystron commercial S and C-Band weather radars began. Also in 1974, EEC was selected by the US National Weather Service to deliver 160 WSR-74 radar systems to replace the older models across the country. Following this, EEC expanded its operations, becoming a commonly consulted private radar company for media radars. Today, EEC is the only commercial weather radar vendor in the US to offer a complete line of magnetron, klystron and <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> weather radar systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} founded on June 22, 1994 as W24BW, and first signed on the air on March 1, 1996. It was founded by Greater Louisville Communications, Inc. (owned by local {{businessmen}} Jerome Hutchinson, Sr. and Jerome Hutchinson, Jr.). From the late 1990s until 2003, the station carried music video programming from MuchUSA (now Fuse TV), the U.S. counterpart of the Canadian music video network MuchMusic. In 2003, the station switched its affiliation to America One, and began airing community and regional programming as well as sporting events. Channel 24's first chief engineer, Virgil Baldon, Jr.,(1995-1997) {{had the foresight to}} install a forward-compatible Acrodyne analog-to-digital convertible <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> when W24BW began operations, over ten years ahead of the 2009 digital television transition.|$|E

50|$|The longwave {{transmitter}} of the Nador facility, {{which works}} on 171 kHz, had originally a transmission power of 2000 kilowatts. After 2009 the original equipment {{had been replaced}} by a new set of Thomson Broadcast S7HP <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitters</b> with an output of 1600 kW. This modernization project incorporated a refurbishment of the three guyed masts, each 380 metres tall, thus the tallest structures in Africa after the demolition of the OMEGA Navigation System in Paynesville, Liberia in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{approximately}} 1930 it {{is common}} to use water cooling for tubes of powerful transmitters. As these devices uses high operation voltages ( [...] around 10 kV), the use of deionized water is required {{and it has to be}} carefully controlled.Modern <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitters</b> can be built so, that even high power transmitters do not require water cooling. Water cooling is however also sometimes used for thyristors of HVDC valves, for which also the use of deionized water is required.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} said that {{transmitters}} with vacuum tubes are better able to survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters do. While it was commonly believed that at RF power levels above approximately 20 kilowatts, vacuum tubes were more efficient than solid-state circuits, this is no longer the case, especially in medium wave (AM broadcast) service where <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitters</b> at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency. FM broadcast <b>transmitters</b> with <b>solid-state</b> power amplifiers up to approximately 15kW also show better overall power efficiency than tube-based power amplifiers.|$|R
40|$|A <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> at S-band {{frequencies}} {{will allow}} many low-power antenna array elements fed {{directly by the}} solid-state amplifier modules to combine power for transmission to earth in space.

30|$|Pulse {{compression}} {{is useful}} for weather radar to increase the average transmitted power by transmitting a longer pulse but without reducing the range resolution of the radar. In general, peak power of <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> or millimeter-wave klystron is not sufficient. Pulse compression is required to achieve the desired system sensitivity. Different coding schemes include linear frequency modulation (LFM), nonlinear FM. Frequency-modulated signals are characterized by their time bandwidth (TB) product which represents the ability to multiple signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).|$|E
40|$|The {{engineering}} {{development of}} a <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> amplifier operating in the 20 -GHz frequency range is described. This effort involved a multitude of disciplines including IMPATT device development, circulator design, multiple-diode circuit design, and amplifier integration and test. The objective {{was to develop a}} transmitter amplifier demonstrating the feasibility of providing an efficient, reliable, lightweight <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> to be flown on a 30 to 20 GHz communication demonstration satellite. The work was done under contract from NASA/Lewis Research Center for a period of three years. The result was the {{development of a}} GaAs IMPACT diode amplifier capable of an 11 -W CW output power and a 2 -dB bandwidth of 300 MHz. GaAs IMPATT diodes incorporating diamond heatsink and double-Read doping profile capable of 5. 3 -W CW oscillator output power and 15. 5 % efficiency were developed. Up to 19 % efficiency was also observed for an output power level of 4. 4 W. High performance circulators with a 0. 2 dB inserting loss and bandwidth of 5 GHz have also been developed. These represent a significant advance in both device and power combiner circuit technologies in K-band frequencies...|$|E
50|$|As a {{broadband}} antenna, the T2FD will normally {{display a}} reasonably low {{standing wave ratio}} (SWR) across its entire frequency range. However, at some frequencies the loading element may be moderately reactive, so {{the use of an}} antenna tuner may be needed when using modern <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitters</b> at anything approaching their rated power output. Also, “low SWR” does not mean high antenna efficiency. This antenna is not recommended for those wanting to make serious weak signal contacts. A dipole cut for the lowest used frequency, fed with ladder line, and matched with an antenna tuner would perform better than the T2FD over the HF region of frequencies.|$|R

40|$|Requirements {{exist for}} high-power, low-noise Ka-band active {{interceptor}} seeker transmitters. This technology demonstration program has {{the goal of}} demonstrating a Ka-band <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> with 1000 watts peak output power, 10 to 30 % duty cycle, 0. 05 to 50 microseconds pulse-width, 250 cu. in. of volume, and 12. 5 lb in weight. These goals represent a factor of four improvement in the power density (W/cm 2) compared to the current state-of-the-art long-pulse <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> design. To achieve these program goals, several approaches are being explored to double individual device performance and double the power-combining density of the circuits. The more successful approaches will be selected for incorporation into the final transmitter design. In the active solid-state device area, two approaches under investigation are (1) development of Indium Phosphide (InP) -based IMPATT diodes and (2) reduction of the junction to heatsink thermal resistance by using p-side carbon doping of GaAs devices. In the power-combining area, three approaches under investigation are (1) double the power density of the standard resonant module from four to eight devices by incorporating a push-pull biasing architecture or a TE„, ^ mode resonant cavity, (2) power-combining two chips per diode package, (3) power-combining several chips on waveguide-coupled planar microwave substrates...|$|E

40|$|FOREWORD Although {{solid-state}} receiver {{technology has}} been used for many years, much of the Navy's use of <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> {{technology has been}} limited to communication equipment or other uses requiring relatively low power, low frequency, or both. The uses have expanded {{to the point that it}} has now become necessary to address some of the issues and trade offs involved in the design of transmit/receive modules so that active phased-array characteristics can be fully understood. The analytical work performed here investigates the general relationship among the system-noise figure, third-order intercept, and dynamic range of active antenna array receivers. That relationship can be used to analyze the performance of, and understand the requirements for, active phased-array radar receivers. This report analyzes the dynamic range and third-order intercept requirements of phased-array receivers and the effect on noise figure of adding receiver attenuation to implement weighting (taper) of the array elements. However, additional analysis is needed to develop a reliable and accurate design tool...|$|E
40|$|This {{program is}} the result of the {{continuing}} demand and future requirement for a high data rate 60 -GHz communications link. A reliable <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> which delivers the necessary power over a wide bandwidth using the present IMPATT diode technology required the development of combining techniques. The development of a 60 -GHz IMPATT power combiner amplifier is detailed. The results form a basis from which future wideband, high-power IMPATT amplifiers may be developed. As a result, several state-of-the-art advancements in millimeter-wave components technology were achieved. Specific achievements for the amplifier integration were: development of a nonresonant divider/combiner circuit; reproducible multiple junction circulator assemblies; and reliable high power 60 -GHz IMPATT diodes. The various design approaches and tradeoffs which lead to the final amplifier configuration are discussed. A detailed circuit design is presented for the various amplifier components, and the conical line combiner, radial line combiner, and circulator development are discussed.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 24 - 27, 1983 / Sheraton-Harbor Island Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaTransmitters {{currently}} being {{used throughout the}} Satellite Space Ground Link System (SGLS) network are TWTA types installed in the late 1960 ’s. These systems are approaching the limit of their life expectancy and are contracting high maintenance and operating costs. The major disadvantages of these devices are the long lead time for procurement or repair, limited life time, and single point catastrophic failure. A definite need now exists to examine alternative approaches to implement a more reliable and low life-cycle cost system to replace TWTs. Currently, solid-state power transistors and low loss power combining technology have reached a stage where S-band CW transmitters of several kilowatt power are possible.

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the CB radio service, transmitters and receivers used vacuum tubes; <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitters</b> were not widely available until 1965, after the introduction of RF-power transistors. [...] Walkie-talkie hand-held units became affordable with the use of transistors. Early receivers did not cover all the channels of the service; channels were controlled by plug-in quartz crystals, with one of several operating frequencies selected by a panel control in more expensive units. Superheterodyne receivers (using one or two conversion stages) were the norm in good-quality equipment, although low-cost toy-type units used super-regenerative receivers. With the earliest sets two quartz crystals were needed for transmitting and receiving on each channel, which was costly. By the mid-1960s [...] "mixer" [...] circuits made frequency-synthesized radios possible, which reduced cost and allowed full coverage of all 23 channels with a smaller number of crystals (typically 14). The next improvement came during the mid-1970s; crystal synthesis was replaced by PLL technology using ICs, enabling 40-channel sets with only one crystal (10.240 MHz). Almost all were AM-only, although there were a few single sideband sets.|$|R

40|$|Through a Space Act Agreement, the NASA Lewis Research Center {{has helped}} develop the base silicon carbide (SiC) {{epitaxial}} growth technology for Westinghouse's efforts to bring silicon carbide products to the marketplace. SiC is a high-temperature, high-voltage semiconductor that can deliver greater {{than three times the}} power of conventional silicon devices. The technology was initially disclosed in the 1994 R&T report. NASA Lewis High Temperature Integrated Electronics and Sensors (HTIES) team is developing SiC as a material for advanced semiconductor electronic device applications because SiC-based electronics and sensors can operate in hostile environments where conventional silicon-based electronics cannot function. SiC transmitters hold great promise for television stations because they can convert broadcasts from analog to digital signals. A modular solid-state design provides broadcasters with an option to gradually add modules, increasing the power of their transmitters as they expand their high-definition television (HDTV) coverage. Using these high-power transistors will significantly reduce the space needed for high-power transmitters at television stations and will offer a solid-state solution, reducing long-term maintenance costs. Thus, transmitter manufacturers will be able to abandon their reliance on tube-based technology for high-power transmitters and will be able to build smaller, high-power, <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitters...</b>|$|R

40|$|A new partial {{reflection}} (PR) radar {{is being developed}} for operation at the proposed Equatorial Observatory. The system is being designed to make maximum use of recent advances in solid-state technology {{in order to minimize}} the power requirements. In particular, it is planned to use a <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitter</b> in place of the tube transmitters previously used in PR systems. Solid-state transmitters have the advantages that they do not need high voltage supplies, they do not require cathode heaters with a corresponding saving in power consumption and parts are readily available and inexpensive. It should be possible to achieve 15 kW peak powers with recently announced fast switching transistors. Since high mean powers are desirable for obtaining good signal-to-noise ratios, it is also planned to phase code the transmitted pulses and decode after coherent integration. All decoding and signal processing will be carried out in dedicated microprocessors before the signals are passed to a microcomputer for on-line analysis. Recent tests have shown that an Olivetti M 24 micro (an IBM compatible) running an 8 -MHz clock with a 8087 coprocessor can analyze data at least as fast as the minicomputers presently being used with the Adelaide PR rad ar and at a significantly lower cost.

Although its main purpose is to provide active, Ku/Kaband, dualpolarized measurements of precipitation, the design presents an opportunity to study its operation in an active/passive mode. The opportunity arises from use of <b>solid-state</b> <b>transmitters</b> employing a multifrequency waveform and receiving system. Typically, a sequence of three pulses separated in frequency is transmitted to achieve its radar sensitivity and minimum range. However, one of the three pulses can be disabled with a tolerable decrease in sensitivity and its receive channel can be repurposed to support passive measurements. This work focuses on progress in the characterization of the Ku-band H polarized passive channel operating simultaneously with two active as a step towards the provision of brightness temperatures along with the other radar derived products. The methodology developed will be applied to the V polarized channel and Kaband subsystem in the near future.
