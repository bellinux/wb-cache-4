In general, the EMI survey revealed tolerable interference levels on board ship. Radiometer measurements indicate antenna-noise temperatures less than 70 K at elevation angles of 5 deg and greater at 1559 MHz at the output terminals of the 1. 2 -m diameter parabolic-dish antenna for the L-band <b>shipboard</b> <b>terminal.</b> Other EMI measurements include field intensity from 3 -cm and 10 -cm wavelength pulse radars, and conducted-emission tests of primary power lines to both onboard radars...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the MARAD maritime experiments (conducted in the L-band fan beam mode) using the ATS- 6 satellite are detailed. They include the following: (1) to evaluate the economic benefits of fleet operators {{through the use of}} satellite communications, (2) to evaluate performance criteria for <b>shipboard</b> <b>terminal</b> equipment needed to establish various grades of fleet operations services using commercial satellite systems, (3) {{to determine the effects of}} signal propagation, ship radio frequency noise, and ship antenna pointing on the maritime communications and navigation channel, and (4) to evaluate various modems for the transmission and reception of voice, data and position location signals via satellite systems...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandExtensive antenna-noise {{temperature}} measurements at 1. 6 GHz (L-Band) were made using a 1. 2 m (4 ft. diameter) parabolic dish antenna {{mounted on the}} Flying Bridge of a modern 15, 690 -ton, commercial-container ship owned by the United States Lines. Both in-harbor and at-sea radiometer measurements were made that indicated a steady background, antenna-noise temperature value slightly less than 70 degrees kelvin (K) at elevation angles of 5 Â°, and greater, at 1. 6 GHz. A comparison of theoretical and measured values indicate excellent agreement within about 5 K for at-sea data. These measurements should be especially helpful to RF equipment designers of maritime, L-Band <b>shipboard</b> <b>terminals</b> for operation with the two, geostationary, maritime satellites, Marisat-A and -B...|$|R
40|$|This {{test plan}} {{is to provide a}} {{procedure}} for the measurement of on-board radio frequency interference resulting from the operation of on-board radars (S-Band and X-Band). Field intensity measurements in the range of 1 to 10 GHz will be made using calibrated test instrumentation to determine possible adverse effects to the operation of the future installation of a Maritime L-Band <b>Shipboard</b> Satellite Communications <b>Terminal,</b> for use with the ATS-F and MARISAT Communications Satellites. A measurement will be made of power line conducted interference to determine the degree of power line isolation that may be required. There is also consideration of interference to the radars by the proposed L-Band terminals and observations will be made of the radar displays while L-Band transmitter operation is simulated. These tests will be made aboard the American Alliance container ship, United States Lines...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} an onboard EMI survey of an L-band <b>shipboard</b> <b>terminal</b> for operation with two geostationary maritime satellites. Significant EMC results include: (1) antenna noise temperature measurements indicate a maximum of 70 K steady background component at 1. 6 GHz at sea for elevation angles of 5 degrees and higher; (2) field intensity measurements from 1 - 10 GHz show that a L-band terminal can operate simultaneously with onboard S-band and X-band navigation radar; (3) radar transmitter case emissions, below deck, in-band from 1535 - 1660 MHz, at 1 m distance from the cabinet, are equivalent, or greater than above-deck emissions in the same frequency range; and (4) conducted-emission tests of a ship's power lines to both radars show both narrow band and broad band emissions are 15 dB to 50 dB higher than equivalent U. S. commercial power lines from 150 kHz to 32 MHz...|$|E
40|$|Geostationary {{maritime}} satellites, {{one over}} the Pacific and {{one over the}} Atlantic Ocean, are planned to make available high-speed communications and navigation (position determination) services to ships at sea. A shipboard satellite terminal, operating within the authorized maritime L-band, 1636. 5 to 1645. 0 MHz, will allow ships to pass voice, teletype, facsimile, and data messages to shore communication facilities {{with a high degree}} of reliability. The shore-to-ship link will also operate in the maritime L-band from 1535. 0 to 1543. 5 MHz. A significant number or maritime/commercial ships are expected to be equipped with an L-band satellite terminal by the year 1980, and so consequently, there is an interest in determining electromagnetic compatibility between the proposed L-band <b>shipboard</b> <b>terminal</b> and existing, on-board, shipboard communications/electronics and electrical systems, as well as determining the influence of shore-based interference sources. The shipboard electromagnetic interference survey described was conducted on-board the United States Line's American Leader class (15, 690 tons) commercial container ship, the "American Alliance" from June 16 to 20, 1974. Details of the test plan and measurements are given...|$|E
