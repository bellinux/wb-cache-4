5|$|The {{flight of}} the Alpine chough is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high {{manoeuvrability}} is accomplished by fanning the tail, folding its wings, and soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less <b>square-ended</b> tail.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species of bird. Although the jackdaw and Alpine chough share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the Alpine chough has a short yellow bill. Even in flight, the two choughs can be distinguished by Alpine's less rectangular wings, and longer, less <b>square-ended</b> tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland from {{the sixth century}} led {{to the construction of}} the first churches. These may originally have been wooden, like that excavated at Whithorn, but most of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry-built churches, beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east. Early chapels tended to have <b>square-ended</b> converging walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings.|$|E
5|$|The southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue {{in what is now}} modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs— the Chinese {{would have been able to}} brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the junk design (jun 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first seaworthy sailing ship. The typical junk has a <b>square-ended</b> bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.|$|E
25|$|The plan of {{the cathedral}} is a {{conventional}} English cathedral plan, cruciform in shape, with a tower over the crossing of the nave and transepts and twin towers at the West Front (in this case, the south). The chancel is <b>square-ended,</b> like the chancels of Lincoln, York and several other English cathedrals. There are three processional doors in the south with additional entrances conveniently placed in the transept facades so that they lead from Hyde Park and from the presbytery buildings and school adjacent the cathedral.|$|E
500|$|The {{flight is}} a {{characteristic}} [...] "flap-flap-glide", with the glide creating an undulating pattern. This species {{is similar in}} size to the Levant sparrowhawk, but larger than the shikra (the calls are however different); the male is only slightly larger than the merlin. Because of the overlap in sizes, the female can {{be confused with the}} similarly-sized male northern goshawk, but lacks the bulk of that species. Eurasian sparrowhawks are smaller, more slender and have shorter wings, a <b>square-ended</b> tail and fly with faster wingbeats. A confusion species in China is the besra, although A. n. melaschistos is considerably larger.|$|E
500|$|The Han-era Chinese sailed in {{a variety}} of ships differing from those of {{previous}} eras, such as the tower ship. The junk design was developed and realized during Han. Junk ships featured a <b>square-ended</b> bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western vessels. Moreover, Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern, in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport, [...] allowing them to sail on the high seas.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} masonry {{building was}} the church, which was constructed on shallow foundations of sandstone rubble and pebbles on boulder clay. The walls {{were built in}} local red sandstone with ashlar faces and a rubble and mortar core. The ground plan of the original church was cruciform, and consisted of a nave without aisles, a choir at the crossing with a tower above it, a <b>square-ended</b> chancel, and north and south transepts, each with an eastern chapel. The total length of the church was [...] and the total length across the transepts was , giving a ratio of 2:1. The walls of the church were [...] wide at the base, and the crossing tower was supported on four piers.|$|E
500|$|Early chapels {{tended to}} have <b>square-ended</b> {{converging}} walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings. Monasteries also differed significantly from those on the continent, and were often an isolated collection of wooden huts surrounded by a wall. At Eileach an Naoimh in the Inner Hebrides there are huts, a chapel, refectory, guest house, barns and other buildings. Most of these were made of timber and wattle construction and probably thatched with heather and turves. They were later rebuilt in stone, with underground cells and circular [...] "beehive" [...] huts like those used in Ireland. Similar sites have been excavated on Bute, Orkney and Shetland. From the eighth century more sophisticated buildings emerged.|$|E
500|$|Junk (ship): The Chinese junk, {{derived from}} the Portuguese term junco (which in turn was adapted from the Javanese djong meaning [...] "ship"), was a ship design unique to China, {{although}} many other ship types in China (such as the towered lou chuan) preceded it. Its origins {{could be seen in}} the latter half of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), when ship designs began to have <b>square-ended</b> bows and sterns with flat bottom hulls. Unlike the earliest shipbuilding traditions of the Western world and South Asia, the junk had a (flat or slightly rounded) carvel-shaped hull which lacked a keel and sternpost (necessitating block and tackle or socket-and-jaw attachment of the Chinese rudder). Since there is no keel in the design, solid transverse bulkheads take the place of structural ribs. There are many theories about the evolution of the junk. One suggests that it developed from the double canoe, another claims that the bamboo raft used by Taiwanese aboriginals was the source of the junk. Records by Western travelers in China during the Song Dynasty mention that junks could support 130 sailors. The size of junks grew during the Ming Dynasty. By the 14th century, junks could carry 2,000 tons. Archaeological evidence of the large size of the junk has been proven by a sunken junk discovered in 1973 near the coast of Southeastern China.|$|E
500|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow {{is about}} [...] long and weighs [...] The genders look similar {{and are not}} sexually dimorphic. Overall it is pale grey with a black tail and wings. The head, mantle, scapulars, back, rump, and uppertail coverts are all a pale grey. The {{feathers}} on the forehead, upper ear-coverts, and throat fade into white. The bright azure skin around the bushcrow's eye is featherless and can be inflated, narrowing the blackish-brown eye into a slit. The feathers behind the eye are capable of moving to reveal an oblong pink patch of skin. The bird's black beak decurves into a sharply pointed tip and is relatively small for a corvid. This beak is [...] long. The feathers on the bird's chin are fine and can form a small tuft when erected. The bushcrow's breast and flanks are pale grey, fading into white on the rear flanks, belly, and undertail. On the wings, the lesser and median upper-wing coverts are grey, {{while the rest of}} the wing is a slightly glossy blue-black. Its blue-black tail is relatively long and <b>square-ended.</b> Its legs are black. When the plumage becomes worn, the upperparts appear to have a brownish tinge. The juvenile Stresemann's bushcrow is slightly duller than the adult, and the feathers of the body and upperwings are fringed with creamy-fawn. The facial skin, bill, and legs are also a dull grey.|$|E
2500|$|A padded [...] {{circular}} bourrelet (or rondel) evolved, which {{sat around}} the head, whilst the cornette became much longer, and gradually more scarf-like in shape, until by the 1430s it was usually straight at the sides and <b>square-ended.</b> Especially in Italy, the cornette was sometimes dispensed with, leaving just an un-flared tubular patte fixed to the bourrelet all round and hanging down {{to one side of}} the head. Reed (see refs) calls these sack hats.|$|E
2500|$|Like the {{unrelated}} swifts and nightjars, which hunt in {{a similar}} way, they have short bills, but strong jaws and a wide gape. Their body length ranges from about [...] and their weight from about [...] The wings are long, pointed, and have nine primary feathers. The tail has 12 feathers and may be deeply forked, somewhat indented, or <b>square-ended.</b> [...] A long tail increases maneuverability, and may also function as a sexual adornment, since the tail is frequently longer in males. [...] In barn swallows {{the tail of the}} male is 18% longer than those of the female, and females will select mates on the basis of tail length.|$|E
2500|$|St John the Baptist's Church is {{a typical}} example of the simple two-cell (nave and chancel) layout found at many pre-Norman Conquest churches in Sussex. [...] The plan {{consists}} of a <b>square-ended</b> chancel, a much taller nave, a porch on the north side, a vestry {{on the south side}} and a west-end belfry of timber and shingles. [...] The [...] "tall, thin walls" [...] of the nave give the church a [...] "heartfelt piety". [...] The church is built of flint with some sandstone dressings and quoins, covered with cement in places. [...] The roof is laid with a mixture of red tiles and Horsham Stone slabs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{layout of}} Anglo-Saxon churches {{was a tall}} nave without aisles linked to a smaller, <b>square-ended</b> (not apsidal) chancel by a chancel arch. [...] St John the Baptist's Church follows this form; and the nave and chancel arch, along with parts of {{the north and south}} chancel walls, survive from the 11th century. [...] On {{the north side of the}} nave, fragmentary remains of a 12th-century porticus (a low side chapel, similar to a transept) can be seen: on the inside, there is a blocked round-headed opening, while on the outside a roofline is visible. [...] A similar porticus of the 13th century existed on the south side; its remnants can still be seen.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} types of semaphore; stop and distant. The stop signal {{consists}} of a red, <b>square-ended</b> arm, with a vertical white stripe typically 9-12inches (230–300mm) from the end, and advises the driver whether the line immediately ahead is clear or not. A stop signal must not be passed in the horizontal [...] "on" [...] (danger) position, except where specially authorised by the signalman's instruction. By night, it shows a red light when [...] "on" [...] and a green light when [...] "off" [...] (clear). [...] The green light is usually produced {{through the use of}} a blue spectacle lens, which produces green when lit from behind by the yellowish flame from a paraffin lamp.|$|E
2500|$|In 1180-4, {{in place}} of the old, <b>square-ended,</b> eastern chapel, the present Trinity Chapel was constructed, a broad {{extension}} with an ambulatory, designed to house the shrine of St Thomas Becket. A further chapel, circular in plan, was added beyond that, which housed further relics of Becket, [...] widely believed to have included the top of his skull, struck off {{in the course of his}} assassination. This latter chapel became known as the [...] "Corona" [...] or [...] "Becket's Crown". These new parts east of the choir transepts were raised on a higher crypt than Ernulf's [...] choir, necessitating [...] flights of steps between the two levels. Work on the chapel was completed in 1184, [...] but Becket's remains were not moved from his tomb in the crypt until 1220. Further [...] significant interments [...] in the Trinity Chapel included those of Edward Plantagenet (The [...] "Black Prince") and King Henry IV.|$|E
60|$|I {{had thought}} it was some {{delusion}} of my own, but all could see it now. There was a greenish-yellow phosphorescent light--or I should say a luminous vapour rather than a light--which lay {{over the surface of}} the table. It rolled and wreathed and undulated in dim glimmering folds, turning and swirling like clouds of smoke. I could see the white, <b>square-ended</b> hands of the French medium in this baleful light.|$|E
6000|$|Down {{the middle}} of the chamber ran a long <b>square-ended</b> table of oak, very plain like {{all the rest of the}} room's scant furnishings. At the head of this table was an arm-chair for my mother, of bare wood without any cushion to relieve its hardness, whilst on either side of the board stood a few lesser chairs for those who habitually dined there. These were, besides myself, Fra Gervasio, my tutor; Messer Giorgio, the castellan, a bald-headed old man long since past the {{fighting}} age and who in times of stress would have been as useful for purposes of defending Mondolfo as Lorenza, my mother's elderly woman, who sat below him at the board; he was toothless, bowed, and decrepit, but he was very devout--as he had need to be, seeing that he was half dead already--and this counted with my mother above any other virtue.2 ...|$|E
60|$|We {{reached a}} quay {{just as the}} sun was setting. There in charge of a one-eyed black slave, a little <b>square-ended</b> boat floated at the river's edge, while on the quay itself lay a similar but {{somewhat}} shorter boat, bottom uppermost. Now the hunters whom I had won in the wager, with many glances of compassion, for they were brave men and knew that it was I who had saved their lives, placed the bags of gold {{in the bottom of the}} floating boat, and on the top of these a mattress stuffed with straw. Then the girdle of rose-hued pearls was made fast about my middle, my hands were untied, I was seized by the executioners and laid on my back on the mattress, and my wrists and ankles were fixed by cords to iron rings that were screwed to the thwarts of the boat. After this the other, shorter boat was laid over me in such a manner that it did not touch me, leaving my head, my hands and my feet exposed as the eunuch had said.|$|E
6000|$|Hard {{work and}} excitement? Let the wind baffle and drop {{in a heavy}} tide- way just as you are sailing your little sloop through a narrow draw-bridge. Behold your sails, upon which you are depending, flap with sudden emptiness, and then see the impish wind, with a haul of eight points, fill your jib aback with a gusty puff. Around she goes, and sweeps, not through the open draw, but {{broadside}} on against the solid piles. Hear {{the roar of the}} tide, sucking through the trestle. And hear and see your pretty, fresh-painted boat crash against the piles. Feel her stout little hull give to the impact. See the rail actually pinch in. Hear your canvas tearing, and see the black, <b>square-ended</b> timbers thrusting holes through it. Smash! There goes your topmast stay, and the topmast reels over drunkenly above you. There is a ripping and crunching. If it continues, your starboard shrouds will be torn out. Grab a rope--any rope--and take a turn around a pile. But the free end of the rope is too short. You can't make it fast, and you hold on and wildly yell for your one companion to get a turn with another and longer rope. Hold on! You hold on till you are purple in the face, till it seems your arms are dragging out of their sockets, till the blood bursts from the ends of your fingers. But you hold, and your partner gets the longer rope and makes it fast. You straighten up and look at your hands. They are ruined. You can scarcely relax the crooks of the fingers. The pain is sickening. But there is no time. The skiff, which is always perverse, is pounding against the barnacles on the piles which threaten to scrape its gunwale off. It's drop the peak! Down jib! Then you run lines, and pull and haul and heave, and exchange unpleasant remarks with the bridge-tender who is always willing to meet you more than half way in such repartee. And finally, {{at the end of an}} hour, with aching back, sweat-soaked shirt, and slaughtered hands, you are through and swinging along on the placid, beneficent tide between narrow banks where the cattle stand knee-deep and gaze wonderingly at you. Excitement! Work! Can you beat it in a calm day on the deep sea? ...|$|E
