40|$|Steel {{offshore}} platforms are typically connected to their foundation pilings by injecting cement grout in the annulus between each pile and its sleeve. In {{the last few}} years a good deal of experimental study had contributed to a rational understanding of the design of these grouted connections; however, very few analytical results have accompanied this effort. In the present investigation a mathematical model is developed to simulate the mechanical response of a grouted connection to monotonically increasing axial loads. When <b>shear</b> <b>lugs</b> are included to increase the load capacity of the connection, the local behavior of the grout at the lugs strongly influences the response. A modest experimental program was conducted to study the crushing-type failure of the grout beneath the lugs, and an analytic formulation is proposed which relates the lug load-displacement history to the grout cube strength and volumetric porosity. The predictions of the model are compared with experimental load-deflection curves, and trends resulting from the variation of design parameters are studied. This analysis adequately predicts the measured behavior of grouted connections in many respects, and identifies areas in which further study should be concentrated...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Al O {{additions}} to type 316 {{austenitic stainless steel}} cold spray coatings was studied. Adding Al O to the feedstock powder increased the overall deposition efficiency, though the Al O itself deposited less efficiently than the stainless steel. Shear testing of the coatings using a <b>shear</b> <b>lug</b> test revealed a change in fracture from cohesive to adhesive with increasing alumina addition. The corrosion behaviour, assessed using anodic polarisation tests of the coatings, showed a shift towards the polarisation behaviour of bulk stainless steel with Al O additions. All of these changes in coating behaviour with Al O additions suggest an improved degree of metallurgical bonding, likely due to increased plasticity in the stainless steel particles. With the largest Al O addition the hardness of the layer increased by 30 %, but the corresponding wear rate in ball-on-disc testing reduced {{by a factor of}} ten. This suggests a change in wear mode from partially adhesive to abrasive...|$|R
5000|$|The {{armies of}} Brazil and Sweden were issued the Model 94. The similar Model 1895 {{was sold to}} Mexico, Chile, Uruguay, China, Persia, and the South African states of Transvaal and the Orange Free State (Boers). A safety feature offered by the Model 1895 was a low {{shoulder}} {{at the rear of}} the receiver, just behind the base of the bolt handle, which would contain the bolt in the unlikely event that the front locking <b>lugs</b> <b>sheared</b> off due to excessive pressure. South African Mausers were highly effective against the British during the Second Boer War; these proved deadly at long ranges, prompting the British to design their own Mauser-inspired high-velocity cartridge and rifle. These rare Mauser carbines and rifles—especially the Model 1895—can be easily identified by the letters [...] "OVS" [...] (Oranje-Vrijstaat for [...] "Orange Free State") either marked on the weapons' receiver ring and the stock directly below, or otherwise carved into the right side of the buttstock. The British Pattern 1914 Enfield with a Mauser-style lug might have replaced the Lee-Enfield, but the exigencies of World War I prevented this from happening. The Lee-Enfield continued to see service until it was replaced by a semi-automatic weapon after World War II. The Germans had faced the U.S. M1917 rifle during World War I, which was the Pattern 14 rifle adapted to fire the U.S[...]30-06 cartridge of the American M1903 Springfield rifle.|$|R
40|$|High-modulus (HM) ribbed-surface {{glass fiber}} {{reinforced}} polymer (GFRP) bars {{have recently been}} used in concrete bridge decks to avoid corrosion of steel reinforcement resulting from the use of de-icing salts in winter times in North America. Recently, prefabricated full-depth deck panels (FDDPs), made of normal strength concrete or high performance concrete and reinforced with GFRP bars, are used in Canada to acceleration bridge construction. The FDDPs are connected through panel-to-panel and panel-to-girder connections. These connections are filled with joint-filled cementitious materials as ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). This paper presents the experimental program to investigate the bond strength of the GFRP bars embedded into unconfined UHPFRC using pull-out testing, leading to the proper GFRP bar development length required to determine the width of the closure strip between connected slabs. The longitudinal GFRP/UHPFRC interface is influenced by (i) the development length-to-nominal diameter of the bar ratio, (ii) the concrete cover-to-bar diameter ratio and (iii) the development length-to-embedment depth ratio due to lugs or headed-end and (iv) concrete compressive strength. GFRP bars embedded into UHPFRC would rely less on the friction and adhesion of the interface, and more on the bearing of the lugs against the concrete. These bearing forces act at an angle to the axis of the bar, causing radial outward forces. Pullout failure of the GFRP/UHPFRC interface leads to <b>shearing</b> of the <b>lugs</b> and bar slippage from the headed-end. Adequate bond strength between the GFRP/UHPFRC interfaces is necessary for design of jointed PDDFs. Therefore, accurate predictions of development length and bond strength of straight or headed-end bars without passing through the high localized stresses due to flexural are essential for safe design...|$|R
