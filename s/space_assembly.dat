40|$|Application of {{wire wrap}} spacers in SCWR can reduce {{pressure}} drop and obtain better mixing capability. As a consequence, the required coolant pumping power is decreased and the coolant temperature profile inside the fuel bundle is flattened which will obviously decrease the peak cladding temperature. The distributed resistance model for wire wrap {{was developed and}} implemented in ATHAS subchannel analysis code. The HPLWR wire wrapped assembly was analyzed. The results show that: (1) the assembly with wire wrap can obtain a more uniform coolant temperature profile than the grid <b>spaced</b> <b>assembly,</b> which {{will result in a}} lower peak cladding temperature; (2) the pressure drop in a wire wrapped assembly is less than that in a grid <b>spaced</b> <b>assembly,</b> which can reduce the operating power of pump effectively; (3) the wire wrap pitch has significant effect on the flow in the assembly. Smaller Hwire/Drod will result in stronger cross flow a more uniform coolant temperature profile, and also a higher pressure drop...|$|R

This variant involves the joint minimisation of the number and the area of the stations, given a fixed cycle time limit. The good behaviour of our proposal is demonstrated by means of performance indicators in four problem instances and a real one from a Nissan factory. ...|$|E

40|$|Developing {{a robust}} {{capability}} for <b>Space</b> <b>Assembly</b> of Large Spacecraft Structural System Architectures (SALSSA) {{has the potential}} to drastically increase the capabilities and performance of future space missions and spacecraft while significantly reducing their cost. Currently, NASA architecture studies and space science decadal surveys identify new missions that would benefit from SALSSA capabilities, and the technologies that support SALSSA are interspersed throughout the fourteen NASA Technology Roadmaps. However, a major impediment to the strategic development of cross-cutting SALSSA technologies is the lack of an integrated and comprehensive compilation of the necessary information. This paper summarizes the results of a small study that used an integrated approach to formulate a SALSSA roadmap and associated plan for developing key SALSSA technologies...|$|E
