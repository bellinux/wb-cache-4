5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR. However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E
5|$|Mayfly nymphs {{may serve}} as hosts for parasites such as {{nematodes}} and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs' behaviour in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> become {{more likely to be}} predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E

5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux {{was known}} as a {{mathematician}} and maker of mathematical instruments such as compasses and hourglasses. He became acquainted with many prominent men of the day, including the writer Richard Hakluyt and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright. He also knew the explorers Thomas Cavendish, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh and John Davis. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to Elizabeth I. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.|$|E
5|$|Voting {{during the}} three shows {{consisted}} of 50 percent public televoting and 50 percent from a jury deliberation. The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on vocal capacity, the stage performance, the song's composition and originality, and the overall impression of the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related {{in any way to}} any of the competing acts in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member were released shortly after the grand final.|$|E

25|$|The main {{decision}} for a fielding captain is {{to strike a}} balance between setting an attacking field and a defensive field. An attacking field is one in which fielders are positioned in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are likely to take catches, and thus likely to get the batsman out. Such a field generally involves having many fielders close to the batsman, especially multiple slips (in what is termed a cordon) and a gully: common positions for catching mishit shots.|$|E
