40|$|Metastasis is {{the major}} {{cause of death in}} cancer patients. Since many cancers show organ-preference of metastasis, elucidation of the {{underlying}} mechanisms of metastasis will benefit diagnosis or treatment of metastatic diseases. Adhesion mechanisms are thought to be involved in organ-preference of metastasis, because metastatic cells show organ preference in adhering to organ-derived microvascular endothelial cells. The adhesion molecules in this process remain largely unidentified. I have examined a series of murine RAW 117 large-cell lymphoma cells variants selected in vivo for liver-colonizing properties (H 103 ̆e 3 ̆eL 173 ̆eP). The highly liver-metastatic H 10 cells were found to differentially express much higher levels of integrin αvβ 3 than L 17 or P cells. H 10 cells also adhered at higher rates to vitronectin and fibronectin than to fibrinogen, fibrin, laminin and type I collagen, and adhered at significantly higher rates to (GRGDS) 4 than to monomeric RGD-peptides. In contrast, P and L 17 cells did not adhere well to the above substrates. H 10 cells also spread well on vitronectin and migrated toward vitronectin concentration gradients. Pretreament of H 10 cells with anti-β 3 monoclonal antibodies resulted in significant decreases in adhesion of H 10 cells to vitronectin and immobilized (GRGDS) 4, and reduced the formation of experimental liver metastases in syngeneic Balb/c mice. ^ Adhesion of RAW 117 cells under hydrodynamic shear stresses was also studied because tumor cell adhesion occurs under fluid shear stresses in target organ microvessels. Similar to their properties found with <b>static</b> <b>adhesion</b> assays, H 10 cells stabilized their hydrodynamic adhesion to vitronectin, fibronectin and (GRGDS) 4 much more quickly than P or L 17 cells. Unlike their <b>static</b> <b>adhesion</b> properties, RAW 117 cells showed differential adhesion stabilization to liver-sinusoidal endothelial cell-derived extracellular matrix (H 103 ̆e 3 ̆eL 173 ̆eP). Although not supporting <b>static</b> <b>adhesion</b> of RAW 117 cells, monomeric RGD-peptides mediated adhesion stabilization of H 10 cells but not L 17 or P cells. Integrin αvβ 3 was found to be involved in stabilizing H 10 cell adhesion to vitronectin, (GRGDS) 4, monomeric RGD-peptide R 1, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell-derived extracellular matrix. ^ This study is the first to provide evidence that integrin αvβ 3 is differentially expressed in liver-metastatic lymphoma cells and involved in differential adhesion of these cells. The results indicate that strong <b>static</b> <b>adhesion</b> and especially the unique hydrodynamic adhesion of RAW 117 cells to the RGD-containing substrates correlate with liver-metastatic potentials.

40|$|Background Atherothrombosis {{underlies}} acute coronary syndromes, including {{unstable angina}} and acute myocardial infarction. Within the unstable plaque, monocytes express collagenolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including MMP- 13 which degrades fibrous collagen. Following rupture, vessel wall components including degraded collagen {{are exposed to}} circulating platelets. Platelet receptors then mediate the recruitment and activation of platelets to form a thrombus, blocking blood flow and resulting in myocardial infarction and sudden death. Objectives Here we aim to provide information {{on the effects of}} collagen degradation on platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. Methods Using increasing concentrations of MMP- 13, we induced progressive degradation of fibrous and monomeric collagen I, visualised by electrophoresis, and then investigated the capacity of the resulting fragments to support <b>static</b> platelet <b>adhesion</b> and thrombus formation in whole flowing blood. RESULTS: Both integrin and Glycoprotein VI-dependent interactions with fibrous collagen underpin high levels of platelet adhesion under both conditions, with little obvious effect of MMP- 13 treatment. <b>Static</b> platelet <b>adhesion</b> to monomeric collagen was strongly α 2 β 1 -dependent regardless of degradation status. Under flow conditions, partially degraded monomeric collagen supported increased thrombus deposition at 10 μg/ml MMP- 13; falling close to background when collagen degradation was complete (100 μg/ml MMP- 13).

40|$|Background: Despite {{the use of}} anti-platelet agents such as {{acetylsalicylic acid}} (ASA) and {{clopidogrel}} in coronary heart disease, some patients continue to suffer from atherothrombosis. This has stimulated development of platelet function assays to monitor treatment effects. However, {{it is still not}} recommended to change treatment based on results from platelet function assays. This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of a <b>static</b> platelet <b>adhesion</b> assay to detect platelet inhibiting effects of ASA and clopidogrel. The adhesion assay measures several aspects of platelet adhesion simultaneously, which increases the probability of finding conditions sensitive for anti-platelet treatment. Methods: With a randomised cross-over design we evaluated the anti-platelet effects of ASA combined with clopidogrel as well as monotherapy with either drug alone in 29 patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. Also, 29 matched healthy controls were included to evaluate intra-individual variability over time. Platelet function was measured by flow cytometry, serum thromboxane B- 2 (TXB 2) -levels and by <b>static</b> platelet <b>adhesion</b> to different protein surfaces. The results were subjected to Principal Component Analysis followed by ANOVA, t-tests and linear regression analysis. Results: The majority of platelet adhesion measures were reproducible in controls over time denoting that the assay can monitor platelet activity. Adenosine 5 -diphosphate (ADP) -induced platelet adhesion decreased significantly upon treatment with clopidogrel compared to ASA. Flow cytometric measurements showed the same pattern (r(2) = 0. 49). In opposite, TXB 2 -levels decreased with ASA compared to clopidogrel. Serum TXB 2 and ADP-induced platelet activation could both be regarded as direct measures of the pharmacodynamic effects of ASA and clopidogrel respectively. Indirect pharmacodynamic measures such as adhesion to albumin induced by various soluble activators as well as SFLLRN-induced activation measured by flow cytometry were lower for clopidogrel compared to ASA. Furthermore, adhesion to collagen was lower for ASA and clopidogrel combined compared with either drug alone. Conclusion: The indirect pharmacodynamic measures of the effects of ASA and clopidogrel might be used together with ADP-induced activation and serum TXB 2 for evaluation of anti-platelet treatment. This should be further evaluated in future clinical studies where screening opportunities with the adhesion assay will be optimised towards increased sensitivity to anti-platelet treatment.

This study investigated fundamental adhesive mechanisms occurring in an in-vitro assay developed for the measurement of <b>static</b> <b>adhesion</b> of human platelets in plasma.

Involvement of adhesive receptors was investigated by the use of various antibodies as well as therapeutic drugs (abciximab, eptifibatide and tirofiban). Inhibitors of adenosine 5 -diphosphate receptors (cangrelor, MRS 2179) and of thromboxane A(2) signalling (BM- 531) were used to estimate the role of autocrine activation. Adhesion to collagen was found to be mainly mediated by alpha(2) beta(1) and to some extent by alpha(IIb) beta(3) Adhesion to fibrinogen was mediated by alpha IIb beta 3. In addition, adenosine 5 -diphosphate-induced adhesion to albumin was dependent on alpha(IIb) beta(3). Furthermore, experiments with cangrelor and BM- 531 showed that the majority of the adhesive interactions tested were dependent on adenosine 5 -diphosphate or thromboxane A(2). We conclude that the mechanisms of adhesion measured by the static platelet adhesion assay are in accordance with the current knowledge regarding platelet activation and adhesion.

SAB inhibited binding of an antibody against alpha 2 beta 1 to platelets as studied by f tow cytometry, and inhibited the interaction of soluble alpha 2 beta 1 to immobilized collagen in a solid phase binding assay. These combined results indicate that SAB inhibits platelet adhesion to immobilized collagen by interfering with the collagen receptor alpha 2 beta 1. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this research program {{was to determine the}} effects of surface cleaning and deliberate gaseous contamination on the adhesion behavior of selected candidate materials for use in the NERVA nuclear rocket engine program. Using a torsion balance technique, the relationship between the normal compressive load applied to crossed rod samples and the resultant contact resistance was used to ascertain the extent of adhesion under each set of experimental conditions. In addition to an evaluation of the <b>static</b> <b>adhesion</b> behavior of selected materials combinations, the experimental apparatus was modified to permit a similar investigation relating to the effects of specific tangential displacements of the sample wires, i. e., their sliding friction behavior. During the course of this subcontract, the materials combinations 440 C vs. 440 C. pyrographite vs ZTA graphite, Nbc (graphite) vs. Nbc (graphite), and Electrolize Inconel 718 vs. Au electroplated 302 S/S were evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} further {{investigation}} of the hypothesis that a significant fraction of apparent interfacial shear strength (IFSS) in fibre-reinforced composites {{can be attributed to}} a combination of residual radial compressive stress and static friction at the fibre-polymer interface. The temperature dependence of the interfacial properties of a glass fibre-epoxy system has been quantified using the laboratory developed TMAmicrobond technique. The temperature dependence of apparent IFSS of glass fibre - epoxy in the range 20 °C up to 150 °C showed a significant inverse dependence on testing temperature with a major step change in the glass transition region of the epoxy matrix. It is shown that the magnitude of the residual radial compressive stress at the interface due to thermal and cure shrinkage is of the same order of magnitude as the measured IFSS. It is concluded that it possible to suggest that residual stress combined with <b>static</b> <b>adhesion</b> could be the major contributor to the apparent interfacial adhesion in glass fibre – epoxy systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{processes}} relating glycobiology and cancer will have increased interest in coming years. To contribute to this trend {{the outcome of this}} work will be useful for investigations in glycobiology, using experimental methods exhibiting controlled carbohydrate composition, organization, and orientation, drawn from materials science and physics and {{that can be used in}} bioengineering and other technical areas in biology. In this work, the focus has been on physical studies of some members of the family of glycosaminoglycans and their role in cancer metastasis. The project studies the <b>static</b> <b>adhesion</b> of cancer cells to substrates functionalized with cell surface glycocalyx molecules and, in particular, in the interaction of heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfates with the cells. Surface characterization techniques are used to analyze the structure of the polymeric brushes deposited on the substrates. The hypothesis that the adhesion of whole cancer cells to glysocaminoglycan substrates is a function of polysaccharide charge per dimer and chain length was proposed and tested. Part of the work has been dedicated to study the changes in the adhesion of tumor cells inthe presence of heparanase, an enzyme expressed in the tumor cell surface. The essential achievements of the project have been: a) Design of a new a method for the deposition and patterning of glycans to glass or silicon surfaces functionalized with a silane agent, exposing an amino terminated monolayer as functional substrate. b) Development of a new method for the calculation of the density of the deposited molecules. c) Physical characterization of the surfaces using a combination of surface science techniques, including ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. These surfaces should be useful for developing additional experiments that may be helpful in understanding the adhesive properties of the cells. d) Comparative analysis of the behavior of cancer cells to the f unctionalized surfaces, specifically the {{study of the}} <b>static</b> <b>adhesion</b> of the cells, in the presence or absence of the surface protein heparanase or its inhibitors. e) Confirmation of the hypothesis that attachment of whole cancer cells, in vitro, depends linearly on the charge per dimer of polysaccharide...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophil leucocytes {{circulate}} in plasma, {{which contains}} broad-spectrum antiproteases such as alpha- 2 -macroglobulin and alpha- 1 -antitrypsin, {{and move into}} environments in which antiproteases are present. Plasma antiproteases significantly reduce the adhesiveness of leucocytes in both <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>adhesion</b> assays, although their action {{does not seem to}} depend upon their anti-protease capacity. Contrary to expectation, leucocyte movement over surfaces and through both rigid and deformable three-dimensional matrices (micropore filters and collagen gels) is unaffected by antiproteases. This renders the idea that forward movement depends upon the proteolytic cleavage of redundant adhesion sites less probable. Various non-physiological antiproteases (chloromethyl ketones, soya bean trypsin inhibitor, and e-aminocaproic acid are also ineffective in reducing locomotion, although they do cause minor changes in adhesiveness...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is {{a chronic}} {{myeloproliferative}} disorder characterized by elevated platelet counts and {{increased risk of}} thrombosis. Ex vivo data suggest increased platelet reactivity {{in agreement with the}} increased thrombosis risk, while in vitro tests often detect decreased platelet activity. The present study aimed to investigate adhesion of ET-platelets in vitro, which is an aspect of platelet function that has been addressed in only a few studies on ET patients. Material and Methods: The study included 30 ET patients and 14 healthy controls. Platelet adhesion was measured with a <b>static</b> platelet <b>adhesion</b> assay. Results: The main finding was that ET-platelets were more readily activated by adhesion-inducing stimuli in vitro than control platelets. This was particularly evident in elderly patients and when using multiple stimuli, such as surfaces of collagen or fibrinogen combined with addition of adenosine 5 ’-diphosphate or ristocetin. Such multiple stimuli resulted in adhesion above the control mean + 2 standard deviations for approximately 50 % of the patients. Conclusion: The results are in accordance with the concept of increased platelet activity in ET, but opposite to most other in vitro studies. We suggest that the conditions in the adhesion assay might mimic the in vivo situation regarding the presence of chronic platelet activation...|$|R
40|$|The tetraspanin {{family member}} CD 151 forms {{complexes}} with integrins and regulates cell adhesion and migration. While CD 151 is highly expressed in megakaryocytes {{and to a}} lesser extent in platelets, its physiologic role in platelets is unclear. In this study, we investigate the physical and functional importance of CD 151 in murine platelets. Immunoprecipitation/ Western blot studies reveal a constitutive physical association of CD 151 with integrin aIIbß 3 complex under strong detergent conditions. Using CD 151 -deficient mice, we show that the platelets have impaired "outside-in" integrin aIIbß 3 signaling with defective platelet aggregation responses to protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR- 4) agonist peptide, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP); impaired platelet spreading on fibrinogen; and delayed kinetics of clot retraction in vitro. This functional integrin aIIbß 3 defect could not be attributed to altered expression of integrin aIIbß 3. CD 151 -/- platelets displayed normal platelet alpha granule secretion, dense granule secretion, and <b>static</b> platelet <b>adhesion.</b> In addition, CD 151 -/- platelets displayed normal "inside-out" integrin aIIbß 3 signaling properties as demonstrated by normal agonist-induced binding of soluble fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -fibrinogen, JON/A antibody binding, and increases in cytosolic-free calcium and inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate (IP 3) levels. This study provides the first direct evidence that CD 151 is essential for normal platelet function and that disruption of CD 151 induced a moderate outside-in integrin aIIbß 3 signaling defect...|$|R
