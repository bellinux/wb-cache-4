In this work, supports are considered as elastic springs. The purpose is to carry out layout optimization of supports by means of topology optimization method. The technique of pseudo-density variables that transforms a discrete-variable problem into a continuous one is used in order {{that the problem is}} easily formulated and solved numerically. In this formulation, a power law as used in the so-called SIMP model is employed to approximate the relation between the element stiffness matrix and density variable. Such a relation makes it possible to establish the computing scheme for sensitivity analysis of natural frequency. Problems of <b>support</b> <b>layout</b> design that corresponds to optimization of boundary conditions are solved to maximize the natural frequency of structures. Numerical results show that reasonable distributions of supports can be generated effectively.

Surface computing is very promising for these application domains but not fully explored yet. In this paper we contribute two tools which <b>support</b> <b>layout</b> tasks on interactive displays: interactive grids and multi-touch alignment guides. Both tools allow the precise positioning of graphical objects in a flexible and fluent way by multi-touch input.

In this paper, we present Chorus 3 D, a geometric constraint library for 3 D graphical applications. It enables programmers to use geometric constraints for various purposes such as geometric layout, constrained dragging, and inverse kinematics. Its novel feature is to handle scene graphs by processing coordinate transformations in geometric constraint satisfaction.

40|$|There is a {{huge amount}} of legacy COBOL-code still being used today, e. g. at bank {{computer}} systems. Manual maintenance of this code is too expensive. Therefore, it is desirable to automate all kinds of routine modications. An important requirement in such modications is the preservation of comments and the original layout of the program. CobolX is an environment for implementing transformations on COBOL programs. The environment is built using the Transformation Tools (XT) package, which provides tools for parsing (SDF/SGLR), transformation (Stratego) and pretty printing (GPP). Since COBOL is a complex language, it is necessary to generate all kinds of tools from the syntax denition, since hand coding would not be feasible. The XT package provides grammar tools for generating signatures and pretty-print tables from syntax denitions. These tools were adapted to <b>support</b> <b>layout</b> preservation. As a rst case study, the picture scaling transformation has been implemented. Picture scaling involves propagating information about the aected variables and then scaling picture declarations and constants. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present {{the design and}} {{prototype}} implementation of a Digital Music Stand that focuses on fluid music layout management and free-form digital ink annotation. An analysis of user constraints and available technology lead us to select a 21. 5 ” multi-touch monitor as the preferred input and display device. This comfortably displays two A 4 pages of music {{side by side with}} space for a control panel. The analysis also identified single handed input as a viable choice for musicians. Finger input was chosen to avoid the need for any additional input equipment. To <b>support</b> <b>layout</b> reflow and zooming we develop a vector based music representation, based around the bar structure. This representation supports animation of transitions, {{in such a way as}} to give responsive dynamic interaction with multi-touch gesture input. In developing the prototype, particular attention was paid to the problem of drawing small, intricate annotation accurately located on the music using a fingertip. The zoomable nature of the music structure was leveraged to accomplish this, and an evaluation carried out to establish the best level of magnification. The thesis demonstrates, in the context of music, that annotation and layout management (typically treated as two distinct tasks) can be integrated into a single task yielding fluid and natural interaction...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a method to {{identify}} the barriers to and opportunities in the development of large-scale offshore wind energy in the Netherlands, taking into account the uncertainties of the future and consequences of decisions, from technological, economical, social, political and environmental perspectives. The research question is stated as: can an agent-based model be used to develop realistic implementation paths towards 6000 MW installed offshore wind power in the Dutch EEZ that show the consequences for the stakeholders? The focus topics for the model are the permit procedures, financial <b>support,</b> <b>layout</b> and timing of an offshore grid, the availability of resources, and innovation, especially of wind turbines. The results show that the agent-based model can indeed simulate different implementation paths that can be used for policy and decision support as a communication tool to show different possible futures and the limiting factors for the implementation in these futures. The methodology given in this study provides a step plan to develop such an agent-based model in analysis, design, implementation and validation phases. The main disadvantages of using agent-based modelling are: the extensive (detailed) data gathering, a long development time dependent on the implementation process and available standards, the required 'mass' and development time before simulations can be made that can be validated, and the limitations in modelling complex actor behaviour. The main advantages of using agent-based modelling are: the model can combine technological and socio-institutional aspects, the model can combine qualitative and quantitative data, the agent-based `as-is' modelling makes design easier, the model is easily extendable and a computer model is transparent.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of a platform installation consisting of naphtha feed lines from centrifugal pumps to an oven has been increased by 25 % in combination with rerouting of the piping layout upstream of the oven and inside the convection zone. The operating company observed considerable increase of the vibration levels of the naphtha feed lines since the restart of the plant. The vibrations have resulted in breakage of the supports in vertical pipe sections on two out of four 6 -inch naphtha feed lines. TNO has received the assignment to perform a root cause analysis of the vibration problems and provide remedies to reduce the vibrations to acceptable levels. The analyses includes on site pulsation and vibration measurements followed by a pulsation and mechanical response analysis and finally a check on pulsations and vibrations after the modification. A number of possible root causes are presented and analyzed in this paper. It is most likely that the low frequency vibrations are caused by slug flow in the naphtha feed piping or two-phase flow developed into the convection zone of the oven. A simulation of the naphtha system from the pumps up to the convection zone in the oven shows pressure pulsations up to 4 % peak-to-peak of the line pressure, which causes pulsation-induced vibration forces up to 450 Newton peak-to-peak. Several modifications have been investigated to reduce pulsation levels and forces: • Omitting the sources of two-phase flow in piping to the convection zone of the oven • Install a pulsation damper at the inlet of the oven • Install orifice plates {{in combination with the}} pulsation damper • Improve the stiffness of the pipe supporting structure The paper shows that residual vibration levels are acceptable after modification of the piping <b>support</b> <b>layout</b> and that the installation can be operated over the entire operating envelope without problems. © Evert van Bokhorst, TNO Science and Industry, 2010...|$|E
40|$|Among {{many issues}} {{involved}} {{within the field}} of manufacturing systems, the design of facilities layout is an ongoing and interesting research field, where new solutions and approaches are sought to determine the appropriate location and physical organisation of the resources in manufacturing systems. Issues such as space, material handling, machine placement and orientation, utilities location, and environmental factors are important features that may be considered when establishing the requirements of a facility layout design. The facility layout design can be thought of in terms of interconnecting work centres that can be represented by a set of interrelated vertices in a graph. Directed graphs can be used to characterise each product operation sequence, which combined into a single directed graph, be used to represent appropriately a layout design. Doing this together with the material handling system requirements, will allow better facilities planning and may improve process sequences that should be reflected in better designs. The Strong Component Based Methodology proposed here, obtains a graphical structure from the integration of various products and using their operation sequences to produce a relationship diagram. The attributes of the resultant structure are used to create this diagram. The objective is to obtain layouts that minimise material handling, that is, {{as close as possible to}} that which can be obtained with dedicated facilities for each product family but without the capital costs involved in the case of the latter. Encouraging results have been obtained by considering strong components, a feature of directed graphs, because less computational resources than in the case of many previous methods, which use Quadratic Assignment Problem approaches, are required to formulate and produce a relationship diagram. Moreover, this approach produces faster designs than other graph theoretic approaches because it avoids using planar and dual graphs. These characteristics allow the Strong Components approach to address more complex situations and obtain comparable or better solutions than previous approaches. The proposed Strong Component approach is a robust and versatile tool to <b>support</b> <b>layout</b> designs. It is a robust methodology because it provides efficient relationship diagrams even in cases when the resultant structure has relatively few strong component relationships. It is a versatile approach, because it can address various situations and can use different criteria to create layouts. Thus, the proposed approach offers effective-economical relationship diagrams to produce the same set of products as when producing them in dedicated facilities...|$|E
