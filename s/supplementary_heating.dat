Both types of chilled beam systems are less effective at heating than cooling, and <b>supplementary</b> <b>heating</b> systems are often needed. Chilled beam systems cannot be used alone in buildings where the ceilings are higher than 2.7 m, because the air will not properly circulate. A forced-air circulation system must be employed in such cases.

[...] (In some cases, drier outside air can be mixed with the wetter inside air to reduced interior humidity levels while maintaining system performance.) Chilled beam {{systems are not}} recommended for areas with high humidity (such as theaters, gymnasiums, or cafeterias). Because they are less effective at cooling, passive chilled beam systems are generally ill-suited for semi-tropical and tropical climates. Hospitals generally cannot use chilled beam systems because of restrictions on using recirculated air. Chilled beam systems are also known to cause noticeable air circulation which can make some people uncomfortable. (Passive air deflection devices can help disrupt these air patterns, alleviating the problem.)

40|$|International audienceWe {{constructed}} {{a new model}} to study the sensitivity of permafrost carbon stocks to future climate warming. The one-dimensional model solves an equation for diffusion of heat penetrating from the overlying atmosphere and takes into account additional in situ heat production by active soil microorganisms. Decomposition of frozen soil organic matter and produced CO 2 and methane fluxes result from an interplay of soil heat conduction and phase transitions, respiration, methanogenesis and methanotrophy processes. Respiration and methanotrophy consume soil oxygen and thus can only develop in an aerated top-soil column. In contrast, methanogenesis is not limited by oxygen and can be sustained within the deep soil, releasing sufficient heat to further thaw in depth the frozen carbon-rich soil organic matter. Heat production that accompanies decomposition and methanotrophy can be an essential process providing positive feedback to atmospheric warming through self-sustaining transformation of initially frozen soil carbon into CO 2 and CH 4. This <b>supplementary</b> <b>heat</b> becomes crucial, however, only under certain climate conditions. Oxygen limitation to soil respiration slows down the process, so that the mean flux of carbon released during the phase of intense decomposition is more than two times less than without oxygen limitation. Taking into account methanogenesis increases the mean carbon flux by 20 %. Part II of this study deals with mobilization of frozen carbon stock in transient climate change scenarios with more elaborated methane module, which {{makes it possible to}} consider more general cases with various site configurations.

40|$|Winter road {{maintenance}} is costly {{but it is}} inevitable since {{it is necessary to}} keep roads accessible and safe during winter. Current winter {{road maintenance}} methods use annually 600 000 tons of salt, in the Nordic countries. The salt ends up in the environment along the roads and results in environmental challenges. This thesis proposes an alternative, winter road maintenance concept for critical parts of the road infrastructure. The proposed concept consists of a hydronic pavement (HP), utilised as solar collector, which is connected to a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES). The combination of an HP and a BTES (called renewable HP) means that the solar radiation will be harvested in the summer time and the stored energy will be used for winter road maintenance at critical parts of a road infrastructure. In existing hydronic pavements district heating or other high temperature energy sources are currently used, however, high temperature energy sources limit the implementation of HP systems. Research on using low temperature energy sources can result in a reduction of primary energy need and makes implementation of HP systems more feasible. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of implementing hydronic pavements using renewable energy, in the Scandinavian countries. This thesis studies how a BTES can be connected to a hydronic pavement, focusing on the design of the BTES. The studies are based on extensive literature reviews and numerical simulations considering the interaction between the hydronic pavement and the BTES. The studied systems have all been direct connected systems without <b>supplementary</b> <b>heating</b> such as boilers or heat pumps. The results revealed that BTES is a suitable thermal storage technology to be used in combination with renewable HP. The renewable HP systems are mostly suitable for areas with mild winters.
