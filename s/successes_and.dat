40|$|The paper {{questions}} common assumptions in {{the dominant}} representational framings of information systems <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure and proposes a performative perspective that conceives IS <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure as relational effects performed by sociomaterial practices of IS project actor-networks of developers, managers, technologies, project documents, methodologies, and other actors. Drawing from a controversial case of a highly innovative information system in an insurance company-considered a <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure at the same time- the paper reveals the inherent indeterminacy of IS <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure and describes the mechanisms by which <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure become performed and thus determined by sociomaterial practices. This is explained by exposing ontological politics in the reconfiguration and decomposition of the IS project actor-network {{and the emergence of}} different agencies of assessment that performed both different IS realities and competing IS assessments. The analysis shows that the IS project and the implemented system as objects of assessment are not given and fixed, but are performed by the agencies of assessment together with the assessment outcomes of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure. The paper demonstrates that by reframing IS <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure, the performative perspective provides some novel and surprising insights that have a potential to change conversations on IS assessments in both the IS literature and IS practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Knowledge <b>and</b> {{understanding}} of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure factors, {{as well as}} how to measure them and the interactions between these factors have great importance for project management effectiveness. Project <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure is a question of perception and the criteria could vary from project to project A project that has been perceived to be a failure by one stakeholder may be perceived as a success by another. Therefore a study was conducted in India among the industries that are into inhouse software development, to investigate the influence of the non-technical components of the software development process, on <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure of software development. This study reveals that practitioners consider the level of customer/user involvement, software process management, and estimation & schedule to contribute most to project <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure and from the organizational perspective the level of customer/user involvement, project manager/staff and software process management contribute most to project <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to determine the}} relationship of resilience and perceived stress with life satisfaction in the students of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure. The research sample consisted of 120 who were selected from among the students of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure through the random sampling method.

The results showed that resilience and perceived positive stress are positively related to life satisfaction in the students of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure (P< 0. 01). Also, perceived negative stress is negatively related to life satisfaction in the students of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Regarding {{self-conscious}} emotions, {{studies have}} shown that different forms of perfectionism show different relationships with pride, shame, and embarrassment depending on <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure.

Therefore, we conducted a study investigating how self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism predicted pride <b>and</b> embarrassment after <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure comparing 363 British and 352 Japanese students. Students {{were asked to respond to}} a set of scenarios where they imagined achieving either perfect (success) or flawed results (failure). In both British and Japanese students, self-oriented perfectionism positively predicted pride after <b>success</b> <b>and</b> embarrassment after failure whereas socially prescribed perfectionism predicted embarrassment after <b>success</b> <b>and</b> failure. Moreover, in Japanese students, socially prescribed perfectionism positively predicted pride after <b>success</b> <b>and</b> self-oriented perfectionism negatively predicted pride after failure. The findings have implications for our understanding of perfectionism indicating that the perfectionism–pride relationship not only varies between perfectionism dimensions, but may also show cultural variations...|$|R
