50|$|A {{stop block}} {{is a simple}} {{reusable}} jig used in metalworking and woodworking to locate a common edge of a workpiece so that multiple workpieces can get the same operation performed quickly.

50|$|Benching is the {{leveling}} and tensioning of the saw. When a <b>saw</b> <b>band</b> is {{run on a}} mill it {{is stretched}} with thousands of pounds of force, and during operation the cutting edge heats up. These forces and temperatures cause the saw to deform. Benching deforms an un-mounted saw {{in a way that}} counteracts the operating stresses, and allows the saw to pull flat and cut straight when in use. It takes months to learn benching.|$|E
50|$|Band Filing {{takes place}} on a machine similar to a belt sander, used like a band <b>saw.</b> <b>Band</b> files are {{sectioned}} {{so that they can}} be made from stiff material, as they need to be to effectively remove material yet still work in a constant feed. A band filing operation can be used to remove small amounts of material with good accuracy. The cutting teeth of the file are arranged closely on the file and are used as part of a finishing process.|$|E
50|$|Gumming {{involves}} grinding the gullets of the {{saw teeth}} {{to a particular}} shape. The saw filer uses a semi or fully automatic grinding machine for this. Saw bands operate under high stress and heat and {{in the presence of}} wood chips. Carbon migrates into the steel from the wood. Gumming prevents case hardening and fatigue cracking of the <b>saw</b> <b>band</b> gullets. Resaw Bandsaws (teeth on one side only) may be left or right-handed, depending on which way the teeth are pointing and which way the plank falls from the log when cutting. Double cut saws (teeth on both sides) are always gummed right hand teeth first.|$|E

50|$|Rip {{cuts are}} {{commonly}} {{made with a}} table saw, but other types of power saws can also be used, including a radial arm <b>saw,</b> <b>band</b> saw, and hand held circular saw. In sawmills the head saw is the first rip-saw a log goes through, which is sometimes a gang-saw, and then the cants may be resawn using other saws and then edged in a edger and sometimes cut to length by a crosscut saw. Also, smaller portable sawmills and chainsaw mills use rip-cuts to produce lumber. Each time {{a piece of wood}} is rip cut it takes time and the kerf material turns into sawdust and loses value so the number and width of each rip cut influence the economics of the operation: This gives band saws an advantage over circular saws and chainsaws.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1990s the band {{continued}} to perform around 150 nights a year both on tour and at Reilly's, but {{was plagued by}} a series of tragedies behind the scenes, and their political stance on affairs in the North of Ireland resulted in UK record companies being unwilling to support or promote the band, restricting a potentially lucrative market. At the 1996 St. Patrick's Day gig a 22-year-old off-duty police officer, Christopher Gargan, used his department issue 9mm pistol to commit suicide, injuring two women including June Anderson, Kirwan's wife. In 1997 one of the band's sound engineers, Johnny Byrne (immortalised in the band's single [...] "Johnny Byrne's Jig"), died from injuries suffered after falling from his apartment window in New York City not long after recording an album of children's songs with Kirwan. The late 90's also <b>saw</b> <b>band</b> member Thomas Hamlin's apartment burn down, Kevin Jenkins retire after a car crash whilst on tour and John Murphy, a close friend of the band, die after falling into a coma after a motorcycle accident. These events are reflected upon in [...] "Those Saints", a song on the Trouble in the Land album, released in 2000. 2000 also saw the release of the band's first compilation album to mark their tenth anniversary, Ten Bloody Years, and the departure of Byrne who amicably left the band to concentrate on his solo project, Seanchai and the Unity Squad.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{presence}} of surface acoustic wave (<b>SAW)</b> <b>band</b> gap on acoustic superlattice (ASL) in a single-crystal lithium niobate structure. The band gap behavior is determined by calculating the <b>SAW</b> <b>band</b> structure and also by simulating the transmission of an acoustic wave through a finite length section of ASL using finite element analysis. The calculated band gap appears at a frequency twice the value expected from purely acoustic Bragg scattering. We have identified the band gap as originating from a polariton-based mechanism due to the coupling between the electromagnetic wave and the surface vibrations. We have examined {{the influence of the}} band gap on SAW generation with the ASL and have shown that the calculated frequency resonance of the SAW lies {{in the vicinity of the}} upper stop-band edges. This results in the localization of the SAW in the ASL. Experimental confirmation is achieved through direct measurement of the SAW displacement by laser vibrometry on an actual ASL SAW transducer. The localization of generated SAW to the ASL transducer is observed confirming the prediction of the existence of a band gap...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} the band gaps of micro-machined air/silicon phononic structures both theo-retically and experimentally. Based {{on the plane}} wave ex-pansion method, dispersion relations of the surface and bulk modes with square lattices in air/silicon two-dimen-sional phononic structures are calculated and discussed. Band gap widths due to the filling fraction and temperature variation are also analyzed. On the experimental side, gen-eration and reception of high frequency surface acoustic wave in this band structure are realized {{by a pair of}} inter-digital transducers (IDT) with frequency around 200 MHz. Details of the fabricating process of the phononic structure and the high frequency surface wave generating and receiv-ing IDTs are given. The results demonstrate clearly the ex-istence of <b>SAW</b> <b>band</b> gap in the micro-machined phononic structure and this study may serve as a basis for studying the band gap of SAW in micro-machined phononic struc-ture with the dimension in the order of micrometer and find applications in the RF SAW devices...|$|E
