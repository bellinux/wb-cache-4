5|$|A Warning to the Curious, The <b>Signalman</b> and Miller's Whistle and I'll Come to You were {{released}} as individual VHS cassettes and Region 2 DVDs by the British Film Institute in 2002 and 2003. A {{number of the}} adaptations were made available in Region 4 format in Australia in 2011 and The <b>Signalman</b> is included as an extra on the Region 1 American DVD release of the 1995 BBC production of Hard Times. For Christmas 2011, the BFI featured the complete 1970s films in their Mediatheque centres.|$|E

5|$|Hood sank with 1418 men aboard. Only three survived: Ordinary <b>Signalman</b> Ted Briggs, Able Seaman Robert Tilburn, and Midshipman William John Dundas. The {{three were}} rescued {{about two hours}} after the sinking by the {{destroyer}} , which spotted substantial debris but no bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{signal box}} was staffed by four people: two <b>signalmen,</b> a signal box-lad and a regulator. In the later {{days it was}} just the <b>signalmen</b> and the box-lad.|$|R
25|$|This {{disastrous}} collision {{was thus}} due to want of discipline {{on the part}} of the <b>signalmen,</b> first by changing duty at an unauthorised hour, which caused Tinsley to be occupied in writing up the Train Register Book, and so diverted his attention from his proper work, secondly by Meakin handing over the duty in a very lax manner; and, thirdly by both <b>signalmen</b> neglecting to carry out various rules specially framed for preventing accidents due to forgetfulness {{on the part of}} <b>signalmen.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 25 April 1949, {{locomotive}} No. 46230 Duchess of Buccleuch was hauling {{a passenger}} train that overran a signal and was derailed at Douglas Park Signal Box, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. The <b>signalman</b> was {{suspected of having}} deliberately moved points under the train.|$|E
5|$|The only Coast Guardsman to {{be awarded}} the Medal of Honor (Navy, posthumous) was <b>Signalman</b> First Class Douglas Munro on May 27, 1943, for {{evacuating}} 500 Marines under fire on September 27, 1942 during the Battle of Guadalcanal. Munro was a Canadian-born, naturalized U.S. citizen.|$|E
5|$|A red-painted {{house for}} the <b>signalman</b> was put up close to the station. Tryvandsbanen also {{developed}} plans for building a station house with a waiting shed, but these never materialised. The name of the red-painted house was changed from Nordpolen ("The North Pole") to Norden ("The North") and it was modernised after {{the removal of the}} tracks. The station was included on the Nordmarka maps published in 1913 and 1938.|$|E

5|$|Garcia was {{pitching}} in semipro baseball when Cleveland Indians scout Willis Butler noticed him in Tulare, California. In 1942, Butler signed {{him as an}} amateur free agent to the organization's Class D farm team, the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League. Garcia earned a 10–10 win–loss record with Appleton. He spent {{the next three years}} as a <b>signalman</b> in the United States Army during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Holland Arms' {{functionality}} {{as a staff}} {{station was}} only useful for the Red Wharf Bay branch, but a <b>signalman</b> was still required for all Amlwch services. In about 1925, LMS introduced a switching-out system that could turn the Gaerwen-Holland Arms and Holland Arms-Llangefni sections into one long section. This was of particular advantage in early mornings and evenings, when the only services were on the Amlwch line.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January 1958, a {{passenger}} train {{collided with a}} light engine which was standing foul {{of the line and}} was derailed. The light engine ended up on its side. Thirteen people were injured. A <b>signalman</b> was blamed for the accident as he failed to ensure that the line was clear for the passenger train.|$|E

5000|$|During the Battle of Totopotomoy Creek (the house stands 0.4 {{miles away}} from Totopotomoy Creek [...] ) on May 30, 1864, the house {{suffered}} severe damage from artillery fire. Union <b>signalmen</b> climbed atop the house to convey messages to their troops. Confederate cannoneers tried to shoot them down, striking the building 51 times, but the <b>signalmen</b> survived. The scars of the damage remain today, but the Sheltons, who had evacuated before the battle, continued to reside in the house.|$|R
5|$|The sixth film, The <b>Signalman,</b> is an {{adaptation}} of a story by Charles Dickens published in his magazine All the Year Round in 1866. In its original context {{it was one of}} eight stories set around the fictional Mugby Junction and its branch lines. It was inspired by the Staplehurst rail crash of June 1865, which Dickens himself survived, having attended to dying fellow passengers. He subsequently suffered panic disorders and flashbacks as a result.|$|E
5|$|As KG 53 retreated out to sea, the German bombers dumped their bombs. Around 32 German bombs fell on {{the town}} of Shoeburyness. Two houses were {{destroyed}} and 20 damaged. One bomb landed on an Anderson Air Raid Shelter, killing {{a man and his}} wife. Another landed on the railway signal box, killing the <b>signalman.</b> Several bombs fell on a War Department gunnery range, causing no damage. Some 200 German bombs {{fell on the}} mud flats and sandbanks off Shoeburyness. Many were delayed-action bombs, and went off at irregular intervals.|$|E
5|$|From {{his newly}} {{established}} command post, {{in the trenches}} on the eastern bank of the canal near the bridge, Howard learned that the river bridge had also been taken. Captain Neilson of the engineers reported that although the bridges had been prepared for demolition, the explosives had not been attached. Howard ordered his <b>signalman</b> to transmit the code words 'Ham' and 'Jam' then brought Fox's platoon across the canal bridge, positioning them at the Bénouville to Le Port crossroads as the company's forward platoon.|$|E
50|$|False-feeding was {{apparently}} common knowledge between <b>signalmen</b> in the 10 similar signal {{boxes in the}} area, and the frames were subsequently boxed in.|$|R

5|$|Grissom {{was born}} in Mitchell, Indiana, on April 3, 1926, the second child of Dennis David Grissom and Cecile King Grissom. His father was a <b>signalman</b> for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and his mother a homemaker. His older sister died shortly before his birth, and he was {{followed}} by three younger siblings, Wilma, Norman and Lowell. As a child he attended the local Church of Christ, where he remained a lifelong member. He joined the Boy Scouts' Troop 46 earning the rank of Star Scout.|$|E
5|$|To {{take another}} example, in his {{screenplay}} for The <b>Signalman</b> Andrew Davies adds {{scenes of the}} traveller's nightmare-plagued nights at an inn, and reinforces the ambiguity of the traveller-narrator by restructuring the ending and matching his facial features {{with those of the}} spectre. The film also makes use of visual and aural devices. For example, the appearance of the spectre is stressed by the vibrations of a bell in the signalbox and a recurring red motif connects the signalman's memories of a train crash with the danger light attended by a ghostly figure.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{played for}} Gala Cricket Club in 1896 and 1897, as an all-rounder {{who opened the}} batting and bowled medium paced seamers. He took 92 wickets in his first season, and {{discovered}} that bowling an occasional slow ball brought him some success. He decided to change his bowling style to spin, and spent the winter of 1896–97 practising on the family farm while also working again on the railway, this time as a <b>signalman.</b> Over several months, Rhodes used his practice sessions to develop control of spin and different types of delivery. Consequently, {{in his second season}} at Galashiels, now bowling slow left-arm, he took fewer wickets but at a better average. At the end of the 1897 season, encouraged by a Scottish member of the MCC, he resigned from Gala to look for work in England.|$|E
2500|$|As train speeds increased, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} difficult for enginemen to see hand signals given by the policemen, so the railways provided various types of fixed signals to do the job, operated by the policemen, or <b>signalmen</b> as they soon became known (it is due to this that British railway slang still names <b>signalmen</b> as [...] "Bobbies"). Many types were devised, but the most successful was the semaphore, introduced in 1841 and soon becoming widespread, although some other types did linger on until the 1890s.|$|R
40|$|The Brotherhood of Railroad <b>Signalmen</b> is {{a little-known}} {{technical}} and political organization that gained power {{during the opening}} {{decades of the twentieth}} century through the increasingly complex nature of members' work, the vision of its leaders, and their abilities to gather support from other unions and the federal government. This thesis is organized around three themes: first, how the growing complexity of signal systems continually challenged <b>signalmen</b> to broaden signalmen's skills, which, in turn, gave them an advantage in asking for recognition as a skilled craft union; second, how the skills that <b>signalmen</b> employed brought them into conflict with other unions over signal department jobs; and third, how, despite having only between 10, 000 and 19, 000 members, the organization's leaders learned to negotiate using reason, evidence, and logic to demonstrate the union's importance in the industry as the custodians of public safety and rail traffic efficiency...|$|R

5|$|By this time, Oka's {{troops had}} moved into {{position}} to completely cut off the Marines on Hill 84 from the coast. Therefore, Monssen—coordinated by Puller—began to blast a path between the ridge and the beach. After about 30 minutes of firing by the destroyer, the way was clear for the Marines to escape to the beach. Despite taking some casualties from their own artillery fire, most of the Marines {{made it to the}} beach near Point Cruz by 16:30. Oka's troops put heavy fire on the Marines at the beach in effort to keep them from successfully evacuating, and the U.S. Coast Guard crews manning the U.S. landing craft responded with their own heavy fire to cover the Marines' withdrawal. Under fire, the Marines boarded the landing craft and successfully returned to the Lunga perimeter, ending the action. U.S. Coast Guard <b>Signalman</b> First Class Douglas Albert Munro—Officer-in-Charge of the group of Higgins boats—was killed while providing covering fire from his landing craft for the Marines as they evacuated the beach and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration.|$|E
5|$|During the Philippine–American War, Yorktown {{stood in}} to Baler Bay, {{on the west}} coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish {{garrison}} that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth and out of sight of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted <b>signalman,</b> made it back to the ship.|$|E
5|$|After Watkin's {{retirement}} from management, {{relations between the}} MR and GCR deteriorated rapidly over shared use of Baker Street station and the congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, {{took control of the}} Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks {{on the grounds that it}} was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting a friend in Wendover; the MR <b>signalman</b> allowed a slow goods train to run in front of the royal train, causing the King to arrive late back in London. The MR management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their engine shed at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for the shed had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel set of tracks was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside the MR to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow—including Chalfont Road station—with the MR.|$|E
50|$|At {{junctions}} or points, one of or both mains {{signals are}} usually controlled either remotely (by a Train Controller or <b>Signalmen)</b> or switched in {{at a local}} panel.|$|R
