40|$|Gain-switching is a {{technique}} to generate short-width optical pulses. Its main advantage {{is that it does}} not require any change in the circuitry of the laser diode used or employ an external optical modulator. The modulating signal generator used by previous studies of gain-switching is an RF <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>source</b> or a comb generator. Previous work on gain-switching using comb generators as input source have selected only a single value of temporal period. For the first time, we study of the dependence of the optical pulsewidth and peak power of gain-switched pulses as a function of the temporal period using a comb generator. We find a baseline optical pulse width at large temporal periods, and that this width decreases by approximately 3...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{model for the}} study of surface wave speed measurements in simulated ocean bottom sediments has been constructed using a high-porosity kaolinite-water mixture in a rectangular tank in the laboratory. The propagation of surface waves, assumed to be Rayleigh waves, was studied over the 75 Hz to 300 Hz frequency range using a gated <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>source</b> and several geophone receivers. Shear wave speeds in the sediment are determined to be 23 m/sec. These measurements are qualitatively compared with measurements made by previous investigators in similar sediments using a torsionally oscillating rod viscoelastometer whose resonant characteristics are sensitive to loading by the sediment in which it is imbedded. Good correlation of results is found with the shear wave speeds calculated from the viscoelastometer data which are in the range of 20 to 30 m/sec. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The Allis-Chalmers {{betatron}} is a high-energy induc­tion {{electron accelerator}} commercially made for taking industrial X-ray photographs. In this application, the electrons emitted from a hot filament are accelerated dur­ing the first quarter-cycle of an alternating magnetic field, which is excited by a 180 cps <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>source.</b> During the acceleration, the electrons are constrained to a stable orbit of constant radius {{by having the}} field of special shape. When the electrons have reached the desired energy, the orbit is expanded and the electrons strike a thin, heavy-element target. The rapid decelera­tion causes the electrons to lose their energy principally {{in the form of}} gamma rays (X-rays). The energy spectrum of these rays is continuous and ranges up to the kinetic energy of the electrons when they strike the target. In nuclear physics work, the maximum energy of the X-ray spectrum must be accurately known and continuously variable. This means that the orbit must be expanded at the time in the cycle when the electrons have the required energy. This present work is concerned with the electronic circuitry which has been developed to cause the orbit to expand when the instantaneous electron energy reaches some adjustable preset value...|$|E

50|$|Where power {{inverter}} devices substitute for standard line power, a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> output is desirable because many electrical products are engineered to work best with a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> AC power <b>source.</b> The standard electric utility provides a <b>sine</b> <b>wave,</b> typically with minor imperfections but sometimes with significant distortion. <b>Sine</b> <b>wave</b> inverters {{with more than}} three steps in the wave output are more complex and have significantly higher cost than a modified <b>sine</b> <b>wave,</b> with only three steps, or square wave (one step) types of the same power handling. Switch-mode power supply (SMPS) devices, such as personal computers or DVD players, function on quality modified <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> power. AC motors directly operated on non-sinusoidal power may produce extra heat, may have different speed-torque characteristics, or may produce more audible noise than when running on sinusoidal power.|$|R
40|$|In {{the world}} of DC railway trains nowadays, asynchronous-{{traction}} machine with traction controllers, i. e. an inverter with variable output frequency, is implemented. This controller changes the incoming DC voltage into an AC voltage of a variable frequency and RMS amplitude. The disadvantages of switching inverters, compared to a pure <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> <b>source,</b> are the harmonics they inject in both the output as in the input of the inverters connection. At the incoming power line, {{it is necessary to}} damp these harmonics, in order to avoid resonance issues or issues regarding other systems, for instance, train detection. For this purpose of harmonic and transient filtering, generated within as well as outside the train, an LC filter is utilised. However, this LC-filter has also influence on stability. Due to the resulting impedance to current variation in the inductance of the LC-filter, the power flow dynamics towards the train are decreased. When applying a certain amount of power, the voltage over the capacitance can become unstable very quickly. In this thesis, a graphical user interface simulation model is made to simulate these stability phenomena in Simulink in order to find the optimum size of the LC-filter in a train on the Dutch DC railway. The simulations are achieved with a model representing a generalised train. The model is simple to modify, and consists of the important parts for determining the stability of the system. Different simulations have been carried out, in order to examine the effect certain parameter variations have on the stability. Two systems have been considered, a constant power controlled system and a system where the motors had no controlling regime. An important factor is the value of the capacitance and inductance. A larger filter inductor results in an unstable system. Likewise, implementing a higher value capacitance will cause the system to be more stable. Simulations have shown that a motor controller with a simple constant power control regime is unstable with normal values for the inductance and capacitance. However a damping branch can solve this problem up to an extent. A system without any controlling regime has proven to be more stable with smaller capacitance. By utilising the model presented in this thesis, the stability of the system, consisting purely of a controlled constant power load or as a non-controlled load, can be investigated, and the impact of the LC-filter can be determined.

However, synthesis techniques are often too computationally complex for use in many scenarios.

The manipulations consist of modifying existing models to achieve a more or less complex implementation while still retaining the perceptual characteristics of the sound. The models implemented consist of <b>sine</b> <b>waves,</b> noise <b>sources</b> and filters that reproduce the desired sound, which could then be enhanced or reduced to provide dynamic LOAD.

An interval counter is employed to make a preliminary measurement between successive upcrossings of the beat note square wave for providing an approximate time interval therebetween as a reference. The beat note square wave and the picket fence are then provided to the interval counter to provide an output consisting of the time difference between the upcrossing of each beat note square wave cycle and the next picket fence pulse such that the counter is ready for each upcrossing and dead time is avoided.

In particular it was desired to compare {{the performance of a}} new-technology flash ADC (analog-to-digital converter) against that of an older-technology diode detector in series with a VFC (voltage-to-frequency converter). The outputs of two state-of-the-art detectors were recorded as a constant 1. 414 -GHz signal was input and the physical temperatures of the detectors were varied over a range of 10 C. As a further experiment, each detector was tested with a noise diode source and with a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> synthesizer <b>source.</b> Thermal coefficients were computed in terms of W/C and in terms of ppt/C at nominal operating temperatures reasonable for the individual devices. Finally, thermal coefficients were calculated in K/C to indicate the change in brightness temperature seen by a theoretical sea surface salinity radiometer employing each detector. The K/C for the flash ADC was determined to be about 2. 8 times that of the diode/VFC. Different reactions of the ADC to a noise input and a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> input indicated that ADC tests for radiometric purposes, such as this one, should be performed using a noise input...|$|R
