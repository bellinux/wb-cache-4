5|$|The {{blunt and}} short claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the <b>sclerotic</b> rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the {{presence}} of <b>sclerotic</b> rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of hearing also appears to be strong. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear, and the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's. This indicates that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. If used as a noisemaker, the crest could also have provided recognizable differences for different species or sexes, because the differing layouts of the nasal passages corresponding to the different crest shapes would have produced intrinsically different sounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} {{theory is that}} the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal, and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of <b>sclerotic</b> rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The {{senses of}} Psittacosaurus can be {{inferred}} from the endocast. Large olfactory bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The <b>sclerotic</b> rings in reptiles directly show {{the size of the}} eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they {{are similar to those of}} Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved <b>sclerotic</b> rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} the dodo {{differed}} much {{from those of}} other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The upper bill was nearly {{twice as long as}} the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated {{along the length of the}} beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the frontal bone formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The <b>sclerotic</b> rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.|$|E
25|$|Eaton {{published}} a paper defending Marsh's research on Pteranodon against Williston. Some of Eaton's criticisms have since come under fire. For instance, Everhart {{has noted that}} Eaton's criticism of Williston for reporting a <b>sclerotic</b> ring in Pteranodon rather than Nyctosaurus ignored the fact that Eaton had found <b>sclerotic</b> rings in both genera.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Wendell Williston {{found that}} the {{supposed}} dermal scutes reported in mosasaurs by Marsh were actually <b>sclerotic</b> ring bones.|$|E
25|$|Angiomas and {{numerous}} abnormal, small, dilated telangiectatic vessels with thickened, <b>sclerotic</b> and calcified walls {{have been found}} in those brain areas which also show calcifications.|$|E
25|$|Nocturnal {{birds have}} eyes {{optimised}} for visual sensitivity, with large corneas {{relative to the}} eye’s length, whereas diurnal birds have longer eyes relative to the corneal diameter to give greater visual acuity. Information about the activities of extinct species can be deduced from measurements of the <b>sclerotic</b> ring and orbit depth. For the latter measurement to be made, the fossil must have retained its three-dimensional shape, so activity pattern cannot be determined with confidence from flattened specimens like Archaeopteryx, which has a complete <b>sclerotic</b> ring but no orbit depth measurement.|$|E
25|$|In every {{surgical}} and non-surgical procedure, {{the risk}} of medical complications exists before, during, and after a procedure, and, given the sensitive biological nature of breast tissues (adipocyte, glandular), {{this is especially true}} in the case of fat graft breast augmentation. Despite its relative technical simplicity, the injection (grafting) technique for breast augmentation is accompanied by post-procedure complicationsfat necrosis, calcification, and <b>sclerotic</b> noduleswhich directly influence the technical efficacy of the procedure, and of achieving a successful outcome. The Chinese study Breast Augmentation by Autologous Fat-injection Grafting: Management and Clinical analysis of Complications (2009), reported that the incidence of medical complications is reduced with strict control of the injection-rate (cm3/min) of the breast-filler volume being administered, and by diffusing the fat-grafts in layers to allow their even distribution within the breast tissue matrix. The complications occurred to the 17-patient group were identified and located with 3-D volumetric and MRI visualizations of the breast tissues and of any <b>sclerotic</b> lesions and abnormal tissue masses (malignant neoplasm). According to the characteristics of the defect or abnormality, the <b>sclerotic</b> lesion was excised and liquefied fat was aspirated; the excised samples indicated biological changes in the intramammary fat graftsfat necrosis, calcification, hyalinization, and fibroplasia.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} the type of cataract, though considerable overlap occurs. People with nuclear <b>sclerotic</b> or brunescent cataracts often notice a reduction of vision. Those with posterior subcapsular cataracts usually complain of glare as their major symptom.|$|E
25|$|Cigarette smoking {{has been}} shown to double the rate of nuclear <b>sclerotic</b> {{cataracts}} and triple the rate of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Evidence is conflicting over the effect of alcohol. Some surveys have shown a link, but others which followed people over longer terms have not.|$|E
25|$|Marsh {{reported}} that {{by this time}} the Yale Peabody Museum curated over 600 Pteranodon specimens. He also published more information about the skull of the Pteranodon type specimen and illustrated it. Marsh suspected that Pteranodon lacked a <b>sclerotic</b> ring, since one was absent in even well-preserved specimens.|$|E
25|$|The black fungus {{also takes}} on diverse morphologies in vivo. Infected tissues contain {{mixtures}} of ovoid yeast-like cells, short septate hyphae {{that may be}} branched or unbranched, toruloid hyphae, as well as isotopically enlarged <b>sclerotic</b> (muriform-like) cells that resemble those found in chromoblastomycosis. The muriform-like cells isolated from E. dermatitidis infections have thinner walls than those found in chromoblastomycosis, and cells are divided along a single plane.|$|E
25|$|Wiliston {{published}} what paleontologist Michael Everhart {{called the}} first complete description of Pteranodon this year. Notable observations in this publication include {{the discovery of}} a <b>sclerotic</b> ring in this taxon. Williston also found a coprolite containing tiny, indeterminate bone fragments preserved in one Pteranodons pelvic area. Williston also argued that previous estimate's of Pteranodons wingspan were exaggerated and that the maximum wingspan of the genus was just short of 20 feet.|$|E
25|$|The skull {{consists}} of five major bones: the frontal (top of head), parietal (back of head), premaxillary and nasal (top beak), and the mandible (bottom beak). The skull {{of a normal}} bird usually weighs about 1% of the bird's total body weight. The eye occupies {{a considerable amount of}} the skull and is surrounded by a <b>sclerotic</b> eye-ring, a ring of tiny bones. This characteristic is also seen in reptiles.|$|E
25|$|The skull {{structure}} of Platecarpus is unique among mosasaurs. This genus {{is characterized by}} a short skull, and has fewer teeth than any other mosasaur (around 10 teeth in each dentary). LACM 128319 preserves matter within the <b>sclerotic</b> ring that may possibly be the retina of the eye. Small structures in the retina, each around 2µm long and observed by scanning electron microspectroscopy, may represent retinal melanosomes preserved in their original positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{eye of a}} bird {{most closely}} resembles that of the reptiles. Unlike the {{mammalian}} eye, it is not spherical, and the flatter shape enables more of its visual field to be in focus. A circle of bony plates, the <b>sclerotic</b> ring, surrounds the eye and holds it rigid, but an improvement over the reptilian eye, also found in mammals, is that the lens is pushed further forward, increasing {{the size of the}} image on the retina.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors such}} as UVB {{exposure}} and smoking can be addressed. Although no means of preventing cataracts has been scientifically proven, wearing sunglasses that counteract ultraviolet light may slow their development. While adequate intake of antioxidants (such as vitamins A, C, and E) has been thought {{to protect against the}} risk of cataracts, clinical trials have shown no benefit from supplements; though evidence is mixed, but weakly positive, for a potential protective effect of the nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin. Statin use is somewhat associated with a lower risk of nuclear <b>sclerotic</b> cataracts.|$|E
25|$|Philodendrons {{have both}} aerial and {{subterranean}} roots. The aerial roots occur in many {{shapes and sizes}} and originate {{from most of the}} plant's nodes or occasionally from an internode. The size and number of aerial roots per node depends on the presence of a suitable substrate for the roots to attach themselves. Aerial roots serve two primary purposes. They allow the philodendron to attach itself to a tree or other plant, and they allow it to collect water and nutrients. As such, the roots are divided morphologically into these two categories. Aerial roots used for attaching to trees tend to be shorter, more numerous, and sometimes have a layer of root hairs attached; those used for collecting water and nutrients tend to be thicker and longer. These feeder roots tend to attach flush with the substrate to which the philodendron is attached, and make their way directly downwards in search of soil. In general, feeder roots tend to show both positive hydrotropic and negative heliotropic behaviors. Characteristic of roots in philodendrons is the presence of a <b>sclerotic</b> hypodermis, which are cylindrical tubes inside the epidermis that can be one to five cells long. The cells that line the <b>sclerotic</b> hypodermis are elongated and tend to be hardened. Underneath the epidermis is a unique layer of cells in a pattern of long cells followed by short cells.|$|E
25|$|Several more {{specialized}} lifestyles {{have been suggested}} for some therocephalians. Many small forms, like ictidosuchids, have been interpreted as aquatic animals. Evidence for aquatic lifestyles includes <b>sclerotic</b> rings that may have stabilized the eye {{under the pressure of}} water and strongly developed cranial joints, which may have supported the skull when consuming large fish and aquatic invertebrates. One therocephalian, Nothogomphodon, had large saber-like canine teeth and may have fed on large animals, including other therocephalians. Other therocephalians such as bauriids and nanictidopids have wide teeth with many ridges similar to those of mammals, and may have been herbivores.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral {{blood flow}} remains {{unchanged}} {{over a wide}} range of arterial pressures (mean arterial pressure of 50–150 mmHg) through a process termed autoregulation of blood flow. Signs and symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy may include severe headache, nausea and vomiting (often of a projectile nature), focal neurologic signs, and alterations in mental status. Untreated, hypertensive encephalopathy may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, and death within hours. For example, signs of retinopathy that reflect the exudative stage, such as retinal hemorrhage or microaneurysm, may be seen in eyes that do not have features of the <b>sclerotic</b> stage, The exudative signs are nonspecific, since they are seen in diabetes and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|The cause(s) of {{dry socket}} are not {{completely}} understood. Normally, following extraction of a tooth, blood is extravasated into the socket, and a blood clot (thrombus) forms. This blood clot is replaced with granulation tissue which consists of proliferating fibroblasts and endothelial cells derived from remnants of the periodontal membrane, surrounding alveolar bone and gingival mucosa. In time this in turn is replaced by coarse, fibrillar bone and finally by mature, woven bone. The clot may fail to form because of poor blood supply (e.g., secondary to local factors such as smoking, anatomical site, bone density and conditions which cause <b>sclerotic</b> bone to form). The clot may be lost because of excessive mouth rinsing, or disintegrate prematurely due to fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is the degeneration of the clot and {{may be caused by}} the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and formation of kinins. Factors which promote fibrinolysis include local trauma, estrogens, and pyrogens from bacteria.|$|E
500|$|Most {{specimens}} of Tarbosaurus represent adult or subadult individuals; juveniles remain very rare. Nevertheless, the 2006 {{discovery of a}} juvenile skeleton including a complete, [...] long skull provides information on the life history of this dinosaur. This individual probably was aged 2 to 3 years {{at the time of}} death. Compared with adult skulls, the juvenile skull was weakly constructed and the teeth were thin, indicating different food preferences in juveniles and adults that reduced competition between different age groups. Examination of the <b>sclerotic</b> rings in this juvenile Tarbosaurus suggests they may also have been crepuscular or nocturnal hunters. Whether the adult Tarbosaurus were also nocturnal is currently unknown due to lack of fossil evidence.|$|E
500|$|The Ichthyosaurus {{models are}} based on Triassic or Jurassic fossils from Europe. Though the three ichthyosaurs are partly in water, they are implausibly shown basking on land like seals. Owen {{supposed}} they resembled crocodiles or plesiosaurs. Better fossil evidence shows that they {{have more in common}} with sharks, having a dorsal fin and fish-like tail, whereas in Hawkins's models the tail is a flat protuberance from a straight backbone. A further discrepancy is that the models' eyes have exposed bony <b>sclerotic</b> plates, Owen conjecturing that with such large eyes they had [...] "great powers of vision, especially in the dusk". They became one of the three mascots of Crystal Palace Park, along with the Iguanodon and Megalosaurus (although ichthyosaurs are not dinosaurs). The models more closely resemble more basic ichthyosaurs such as Cymbospondylus.|$|E
500|$|The {{skull of}} a fully grown Edmontosaurus could be over a metre long. One skull of E. annectens (formerly Anatotitan) {{measures}} [...] long. The skull was roughly triangular in profile, with no bony cranial crest. Viewed from above, {{the front and}} rear of the skull were expanded, with the broad front forming a duck-bill or spoon-bill shape. The beak was toothless, and both the upper and lower beaks were extended by keratinous material. Substantial remains of the keratinous upper beak are known from the [...] "mummy" [...] kept at the Senckenberg Museum. In this specimen, the preserved nonbony part of the beak extended for at least [...] beyond the bone, projecting down vertically. The nasal openings of Edmontosaurus were elongate and housed in deep depressions surrounded by distinct bony rims above, behind, and below. In at least one case (the Senckenberg specimen), rarely preserved <b>sclerotic</b> rings were preserved in the eye sockets. Another rarely seen bone, the stapes (the reptilian ear bone), has also been seen in a specimen of Edmontosaurus.|$|E
500|$|The {{extent to}} which New Age spokespeople mix {{religion}} and politics varies. New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as [...] "fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete". The New Ager Mark Satin for instance spoke of [...] "New Age politics" [...] as a politically radical [...] "third force" [...] that was [...] "neither left nor right". He believed that {{in contrast to the}} conventional political focus on the [...] "institutional and economic symptoms" [...] of society's problems, his [...] "New Age politics" [...] would focus on [...] "psychocultural roots" [...] of these issues. Ferguson regarded New Age politics as [...] "a kind of Radical Centre", one which was [...] "not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road". Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become <b>sclerotic</b> because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the [...] "Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm". [...] In Capra's view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological [...] "systems view" [...] of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues. Corinne McLaughlin argued that politics need not connote endless power struggles, that a new [...] "spiritual politics" [...] could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.|$|E
500|$|The {{only known}} skull, {{belonging}} to the largest specimen, measures [...] from the premaxilla at the front {{to the back of}} the occipital condyle. The widest part of the skull behind the eyes is only [...] wide in comparison. The skull was similar to those of other ornithomimosaurs in being low and narrow, but differed in that the snout was more elongated. The skull bone walls were rather thin, about [...] It had a rounded, flattened beak, which would have been covered by keratin in life. The nostrils were turned upwards, and the nasal bone was a narrow strap that extended up above the eye sockets. The outer diameter of the <b>sclerotic</b> rings in the eyes was small, , compared to the size of the skull. The lower temporal fenestrae, openings behind the eyes, were partially closed off by the jugal bones, similar to Gallimimus. The jaws were toothless and down-turned, and the lower jaw was very massive and deep compared to the slender and low upper jaw. The relative size of the lower jaw was closer to that of tyrannosaurids than to other ornithomimosaurs. The snout was spatulate (flared outwards to the sides) and [...] wide, which is wider than the skull roof. This shape is similar to the snout of duck-billed hadrosaurids.|$|E

2500|$|Temnodontosaurus {{have the}} largest eyes of any ichthyosaur, and of any animal {{measured}}. The largest eyes measured were from the species T. platyodon. Despite the enormous size of their eyes, species of Temnodontosaurus had blind spots directly above their head due to the angle at which their eyes were pointed. [...] The eyes of Temnodontosaurus had <b>sclerotic</b> rings. According to Ryosuke Motani, the <b>sclerotic</b> rings of T. platyodon are at least 25 cm in diameter. It is assumed that Temnodontosaurus had high visual capacity. McGowan hypothesized that Ichthyosaurs have a <b>sclerotic</b> ring to give the eye rigidity. According to McGowan Ichthyosaurs, and so Temnodontosaurus, used vision as their main sense {{and it would have}} been unlikely that they could do echolocation to sense out prey.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{frequent}} injections and recurring phlebitis, scar tissue can build {{up along the}} vein. [...] The peripheral veins of intravenous drug addicts, and of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, become <b>sclerotic</b> and difficult to access over time, sometimes forming a hard, painful “venous cord”.|$|E
2500|$|Coelophysis bauri {{had a long}} narrow head (approximately [...] ), with large, {{forward-facing}} {{eyes that}} afforded it stereoscopic vision {{and as a result}} excellent depth perception. Rinehart et al. (2004) described the complete <b>sclerotic</b> ring found for a juvenile C. bauri (specimen NMMNH P-4200), and compared it to data on the <b>sclerotic</b> rings of reptiles and birds and concluded that this Coelophysis was a diurnal, visually oriented predator." [...] The study found that its vision was superior to most lizards' vision, and ranked with that of modern birds of prey. [...] The eyes appear to be the closest to those of eagles and hawks, with a high power of accommodation. [...] The data also suggested poor night vision which would mean this dinosaur had a round rather than a split pupil.|$|E
