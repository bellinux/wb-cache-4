25|$|On 27 August 1993, {{a former}} Wairarapa Connection car turned NIMT <b>servery</b> car {{was brought in}} to replace the <b>servery</b> car damaged in the Rolleston {{accident}} two days earlier (see below), along with three refurbished Auckland excursion cars and their 37.5kW FM van, and the first of the two Bay Express panorama cars was also allocated to the train as the initial attempt to re-equip it with panorama cars.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{a project}} was begun to {{renovate}} the kitchens, <b>servery,</b> dining hall and some other areas of college. The project included the installation of under floor heating and a new timber floor in the dining hall, new kitchen equipment, a new <b>servery</b> area, additional dining and meeting places, and disabled access to the dining hall. During the project, the Old Quad housed a temporary dining hall and kitchen, while the New Quad was used to store building materials.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the second}} six cars, the first AL also joined the Picton and Greymouth runs in 1982-83. In 1991 one car was {{thoroughly}} overhauled and refurbished with 50 Addington-built seats arranged in bays of four, alcove-style (like the {{cars on the}} re-introduced Southerner of 1988, but they had sheepskin wool seat covers) for the reinstated and revitalised Palmerston North Capital Connection long-distance commuter train. In 1992, one car was rebuilt into a 32-seat <b>servery</b> car, similar to the Southerner <b>servery</b> cars, including alcove seating but with seats of a much more recent design. The other three cars remained on the Wairarapa services.|$|E
50|$|Kennet Prison holds Category C {{adult males}} from the {{surrounding}} area. Accommodation at the prison is divided between seven units, predominantly containing double occupancy cells with integral sanitation, showers on all landings, purpose built <b>serveries,</b> and association facilities. There is also an additional segregation unit.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{range of}} coffee shops, restaurants, shops and {{businesses}} <b>serveries</b> in Emek Refaim. Mainstream commonly found food shops include Aroma, BurgersBar, Rebar, McDonald's while there are restaurants such as Rosa. The International Cultural and Community Center (ICCC) is located on Emek Refaim.|$|R
50|$|In 1937 the Main Building {{was linked}} to the {{dormitory}} block constructed in 1900, by three-storeyed extensions to the South Wing. The extension was principally a service block, providing two new locker rooms, new bathroom and lavatory accommodation and on the ground floor, <b>serveries</b> and an extension to the kitchen.|$|R
25|$|In December 1991 another modular van was {{refitted}} with a generator, and a Wairarapa Connection {{car with}} 32 seats to a newer design arranged alcove-style and a <b>servery</b> {{to facilitate the}} introduction of a third trainset for maintenance requirements, the third set thus becoming a spare.|$|E
25|$|Realising this {{increased}} public attention, {{and with the}} success of air-conditioned panorama carriage trains on the North Island Main Trunk, between August 1994 and April 1995, eight cars (one a former Southerner then InterCity spare buffet car, one a former Endeavour later Southerner <b>servery</b> car, two from the Northerner, two from the Southerner and two from Auckland suburban services) were extensively overhauled and refitted with panorama windows like the earlier TranzAlpine, TranzCoastal (later Coastal Pacific), pressure-ventilated Bay Express and air conditioned Northerner/Overlander Express trains and seating 50 (day cars) and 26 (<b>servery</b> cars), alcove-style, in new seats like those installed in refitted Wairarapa Connection and North Island Main Trunk carriages. A Mitsubishi built modular van was refitted with a 90kW generator in the central module as opposed to the handbrake end modules on NIMT vans, to facilitate converting one end module into a public open viewing area.|$|E
25|$|The Officers' Mess {{was moved}} in 1960 to the Senior Staff Mess {{at which point}} 'Bill & Alfie's' became a {{recreational}} space for Senior Cadets. There were renovations to Fort LaSalle dormitory and Yeo Hall between 1993–1995 to accommodate {{the closure of the}} other two colleges. In 1997, there were additions to the Dining Room, and an extension for the kitchen and <b>servery</b> above which is the Cadet Mess at Yeo Hall.|$|E
50|$|Sibylla is a {{chain of}} fast food {{restaurants}} available throughout Sweden and Finland, where they mostly hold the concession for service station food <b>serveries.</b> 1932 saw the first Sibyl sausage served. Since then, menus with french fries, hamburgers, meatballs, chicken and kebabs {{as well as the}} hot dogs have been developed.|$|R
5000|$|Risley is a {{category}} C prison for adult males. The prison holds vulnerable prisoners (mainly sex offenders) {{who are not}} mixed but kept separate from other prisoners. Accommodation at the prison comprises single occupancy cell units with integral sanitation, showers, <b>serveries,</b> PIN phones and association facilities. In-cell mains power and in-cell TVs installed throughout the prison.|$|R
50|$|The Railway Refreshment Room is an {{impressive}} and generously proportioned space containing timber <b>serveries</b> at both ends, and round timber tables and timber chairs. The walls are decorated with large black and white photographs of local beauty spots, and the tables are set with monogrammed silverware and crockery. The interior is finely detailed with pressed metal ceilings with elaborate ceiling roses, cast iron columns with floriated capitals, and decorative pressed metal cornices and beam encasings. The adjacent Tea Room (1915 - now used as offices) also has a high pressed metal ceiling.|$|R
25|$|Today, {{the first}} {{exclusive}} NIMT rear view car and its matching full-length day car are withdrawn, {{and as of}} 17 April 2009, were still stored at Hutt Railway Workshops, along with {{the second of the}} original two TranzAlpine / TranzCoastal <b>servery</b> observation cars, as the Overlander continues with its other six cars and the three Bay Express cars. From time to time over the last few years, the Corporate Business cars (formerly the first and third of three original Northerner dining cars) have also been used.|$|E
25|$|Monday, 2 December 1991 saw the Silver Fern railcars {{replaced}} on {{the daylight}} NIMT {{run by the}} Northerner stock, InterCity having learned from the benefits a carriage train provided over the three 96-seat railcars. To facilitate this, a third modular van fitted with 11kW generator for power-luggage use and a Wairarapa Connection car turned 32-seat <b>servery</b> car were made available to form a third trainset. Also, the servery/observation/rear view Bay Express car and the observation/rear view TranzAlpine Connoisseurs car were added to provide extra viewing opportunities. The daylight services were named the Overlander Expresses.|$|E
25|$|With the {{deterioration}} of the yellow Northerner stock, cars to replace these had to be found by sourcing {{from the rest of the}} NZR 56-foot carriage fleet. The change in service was marked, with a refurbished modular Mitsubishi FM van turned power-luggage van with handbrake end-mounted 11kW petrol generator, and three carriages, one from the Endeavour Express and later Southerner Express converted into a <b>servery</b> car seating 31 in reupholstered Addington Workshops-produced seats, in bays of four with two pairs of seats each facing into a table, arranged alcove-style, with windows over double the size of the old ones, enabling better views of the alpine scenery, reupholstered seats and carpet, and a buffet counter service, to replace refreshment stops at railway station cafeterias at Springfield and Otira. The original intention had been to replace each pair of windows with one larger window, but the final solution was to cut out the side of the cars and to insert a steel ladder frame to which sheets of strengthened glass were glued. The effect, of a continuous sheet of glass the length of the carriage, was spectacular and undoubtedly was a major factor in the success of the new service. The other two cars were red Picton - Greymouth cars that were refitted and repainted to the same standard but retained their smaller windows and seated 50, same seating arrangement and type as the <b>servery</b> car.|$|E
50|$|The mess {{is located}} behind {{only a few}} steps from course barracks. It has two <b>serveries</b> with only one open most days and a senior and officer eating area. The barracks for course as well as the class rooms, {{computer}} lab and offices all share one building. Half of the build is two top and bottom H hallways with rooms on the outer of the four halls. Rooms consist of eight bunks and three bunks and lockers. Each wing (A, B, C, D) has their own common room which consists of a TV and some sofa chairs, a microwave and table with chairs. They also have a kit cleaning room.|$|R
5000|$|Cliffside was {{equipped}} with all modern conveniences including built-in furniture, dining nooks and <b>serverys,</b> electric refrigerators, electric hot water, water softening and incinerator and laundry chutes. The design of the building maximised privacy, views, light and the flow of air. Each of the eight flats had their own private entrance and floors were sound-proofed. The slope of the site was used to advantage so that {{no more than one}} and a half flights of stairs had to be scaled to gain access to any one of them. Plumbing connections were housed in a special duct with access from outside the building so that maintenance and repairs could take place without bothering the tenants. A caretaker's quarters was part of the original design, as was the provision of lock-up garages. The building was designed in the popular interwar style of English Revival or Tudor Revival with elements such as eaves and bay windows having a half-timbered appearance. As the promotional literature stated, Cliffside was [...] "the newest, the best and the most attractive offering in Brisbane".|$|R
40|$|From the social-ecological nexus perspective, {{environmental}} inequality {{is embedded}} in its root of social problem arising from income inequality. “The urgent global challenges of sustainability and equity must be addressed together” (IPCC 2011). This paper intends to explore the link between house income inequality and environmental vulnerability in Rural of China. In the process of rural to urban dominated economy transformation, social structures are changing, and ecosystems are facing stress. Given China's dynamic economic and environmental situation, we aim to provide an assessment in the inequality of energy use and environmental effects in two different systems of urban and rural region in China. The paper deals with three questions: 1. how has household expenditure linked with the energy use directly and indirectly; 2. how has China challenged by inequalities between rural and urban household on the residential energy consumption; 3. how high is the emission estimated in the rural residential energy use? The analysis results indicate obviously that almost half rural family still use no-commercial energy and thus coal is the main commercial energy sources; the per capital CO 2 emissions of rural region {{is much higher than}} urban region, which is driven by low energy efficiency and less advanced public infrastructure. It address the equity issues that policy should focus on energy affordability and promoting a transition away from biomass to other modern energy sources in rural China. In the paper, the input-output table is employed for accounting the indirect residential energy use and emissions, which is associated with the eight sectors of household expenditure. The data sources are from various household <b>serveries</b> and energy statistics in the period of 1990 to 2016...|$|R
25|$|The {{dining hall}} {{refurbishment}} {{was completed by}} September 2010, whilst the remaining work was completed around Easter 2012. The new catering facilities were unveiled during a ceremony on 14 March 2012. During the ceremony, college members gathered in a restored 15th century building {{in the heart of}} college, originally the college kitchens and most recently used as the <b>servery.</b> This room, {{to be known as the}} Mediaeval Kitchen, will be used as a new dining space in addition to the main dining hall, which will remain the usual location for student meals. The temporary kitchen and builder's yard were removed and the Quads restored to their normal state during the Easter 2012 vacation.|$|E
25|$|The service ran at a {{loss and}} had been {{supported}} by government subsidies until these were abolished for all long-distance passenger trains in 1989. New Zealand Rail changed the seating configuration by replacing the very generous seat pitch three abreast configuration with a more standard four abreast, with reduced (but still generous compared to bus) seat pitch. The full service buffet car was replaced with a buffet <b>servery.</b> Both measures reduced costs significantly, but the service was challenged by {{the increasing number of}} low-cost shuttle bus services, particularly between Christchurch and Dunedin, which were significantly cheaper than the train. Nonetheless, the Southerner still operated seven days a week, one service each way.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 15 November 1999 a new train entered service, made up {{of seven}} (later eight) British Rail Mark 2 cars and the second former Southerner modular 11kW power and baggage van, with 90kW {{generator}} and larger luggage space made up from the middle and expanded non-handbrake end compartments. The new cars are about three metres longer than the older cars and more spacious inside, with more headroom, full air-conditioning, 60 seats per car (28 in the <b>servery</b> car), and twin power sockets {{at the foot of}} each pair of seats. Seating arrangement is both alcove and airline-style, using their British Rail InterCity 72 seats. Since October 2016, fire suppressed DFB class locomotives have been assigned to the service.|$|E
25|$|On Wednesday, 25 August 1993, the {{southbound}} Southerner, {{consisting of}} a DF class locomotive, passenger car with luggage space at one end, <b>servery</b> car, day car and the second of three TranzAlpine and Coastal Pacific power-baggage vans, was hit at Rolleston by a concrete mixing truck. The bowl of the truck bounced off all three passenger cars, and ripped two wide open. Three people were killed, {{one of whom was}} Louise Cairns, daughter of former New Zealand cricketer Lance Cairns and sister of then-representative Chris Cairns. Chris Cairns has since become a campaigner for safety around the rail corridor and level-crossings through the Chris Cairns Foundation, which later became known as TrackSAFE Foundation New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|The rear is also {{accessed}} {{through a}} door at ground level which leads into a large room with concrete floor and brick walls. This leads into a large modern bar opening onto an outdoor area through several large steel roller doors. This area has an auxiliary bar and <b>servery</b> and looks onto Stockman's Rest. It is floored with brick pavers and shaded by a roof of corrugated steel supported on steel trusses. This is lined with a modern timber-look sheeting. The perimeter of this area has sections of heavy post and rails, {{some of which are}} decorated with cattle brands. A gateway also formed of heavy posts frame steps leading from the corner of the area down to the street.|$|E
500|$|The <b>servery</b> {{and kitchen}} appear as [...] "Castle Anthrax", where Sir Galahad the Chaste (Michael Palin) is chased by seductive girls.|$|E
500|$|Professor Roger Cashmore, a {{particle}} physicist, became Brasenose's first scientist Principal in 2003. He was replaced in 2011 by Alan Bowman, former Camden Professor of Ancient History. Kitchen and <b>servery</b> areas were rebuilt in 2010–12, {{along with other}} changes to dining and some living rooms, {{in a series of}} building work known as [...] "Project Q".|$|E
500|$|Until 1952, {{the church}} had a ring of fivebells hung for change ringing; and at this time, a sixth bell was added and one bell was recast, {{replacing}} a 1727 bell by Henry Penn of Peterborough. The oldest bell as of 2010, is the [...] number fourbell of 1796 by Joseph Eayre; the newest are of 1951 by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. This set of sixbells are rung from a first-floor ringing chamber above the recently constructed <b>servery</b> and toilets.|$|E
500|$|The keep, or donjon, survives largely intact {{from the}} 13th century, and forms the {{south-west}} {{part of the}} present castle. Described by architectural historian W. D. Simpson as a [...] "cluster keep", it comprises a large round tower to the south, a smaller round tower to the west, with the two joined by a square tower. The masonry is of squared ashlar, or dressed stone blocks. Internally, the original use of the rooms is difficult to interpret, although the round towers may have served as private suites for Lord Dirleton and his Lady. The large tower contains a six-sided chamber at ground level, possibly a kitchen, with a seven-sided main chamber above. This room has a pointed vaulted ceiling, window seats in the large windows around the south wall, and a carved fireplace at the north. To the east is a postern, or side door, and beyond is a well. Adjacent to the well is a floor hatch, which would have allowed food to be transferred directly from the kitchen to a <b>servery</b> above. A room in the square tower to the west, possibly the lord's bedroom, has holes in the ceiling to allow smoke from braziers to escape. The more ruined west round tower probably contained another hall, with chambers above and storage below. In the 17th century, {{the top of the}} main round tower was lowered and remodelled to form a gun platform.|$|E
500|$|The east range itself {{runs the}} length of {{the east side of the}} castle, and {{originally}} comprised a large hall, with a square tower house at the north-east corner. Although only the basement survives, this once formed one of the finest noble residences of its time in Scotland, and would have been similar to the contemporary buildings at Doune Castle. The basement is a single tunnel vault, with low walls subdividing the area into stores. Two large ovens and a well lie at the south end, while at the east is the 13th-century postern, blocked when the wall was thickened to support the new buildings above, and re-used as a fireplace. At the north end of the basement is a vaulted prison for freemen, and below this, a rock-cut pit, [...] square, to house prisoners of the peasant classes. Above the prison, but still within the basement, is a vaulted chapel with various ceremonial recesses, such as a sacristy and a piscina, or water basin. A private chamber for the priest is next door. The hall above is [...] by , and once had a high timber roof, and a minstrel's gallery at the south end. An ornately carved stone buffet, or cupboard, is located on this wall, which formed part of the <b>servery</b> next to the kitchen. At the north-east corner of the castle, a tower house provided accommodation for the Lord's family and guests. Again, only the lowest floor remains, above the chapel. This probably formed a private chamber for the Lord, and was connected to the adjacent hall.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, {{two more}} Picton [...] - Greymouth cars were {{refitted}} {{similar to the}} <b>servery</b> and observation car, so the two small-window cars could be slotted into the Southerner consists. These new [...] "big window" [...] cars each sat 51, same seating arrangement and type as the <b>servery</b> car. In the early 1990s, the first generation TranzAlpine panorama cars had a new pressure ventilation system installed, similar to the Bay Express and the rear view/observation car introduced to this train in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was decided}} to {{introduce}} the railcar to a daytime service between Auckland and Wellington. [...] This service, which started on Monday 23 September 1968, was highly successful and prompted the conversion of two further cars to 82 seats each to accommodate larger <b>servery</b> areas and, later, {{the purchase of the}} Silver Fern diesel-electric railcars for this service.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 Hillside Engineering won the {{contract}} from the Greater Wellington Regional Council to rebuild 18 former British Rail Mark 2D/F 20-metre carriages to replace the fleet. They are classified SW for cars with passenger saloon only, SWS with <b>servery</b> and SWG with luggage compartment and generator for power supply. The S stands for [...] "Scenic Series" [...] and [...] "W" [...] for [...] "Wairarapa", to distinguish them from their Capital Connection counterparts, classified S.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{three more}} red Picton/Greymouth cars and an Endeavour car were {{refurbished}} for the Southerner, entering service Monday, 4 July 1988, joining the two cars already fitted as such. The Endeavour car and one Picton/Greymouth car were fitted out as <b>servery</b> cars, each seating 31 in bays of four, alcove-style. The other two cars seated 50 alcove-style. The seats were reupholstered and new carpet {{laid down in}} all four cars. Two Mitsubishi FM vans were equipped with 11kW generators on their handbrake ends and became power-baggage vans for the [...] "new" [...] trains. Its reintroduction also saw the ceasation of parcels traffic on the trains.|$|E
2500|$|From December 1991 to December 1994, nine ex {{second class}} {{passenger}} coaches built between 1937 and 1945 (one the former TranzAlpine rear-view observation car, one a Southerner car, two from Auckland excursion, three from Auckland suburban and two from Wairarapa commuter services) were extensively refurbished {{similar to the}} successful [...] "big window" [...] panorama cars used on the TranzAlpine, Coastal Pacific and pressure-ventilated Bay Express cars and made into three 3-car/1-van sets for [...] "new" [...] Overlander/Northerner services, each including a coach with a <b>servery</b> bar where hot food, snacks and beverages can be bought during the trip, a rear view observation car and a 49-seat day car. All nine cars were fully air-conditioned.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, {{after the}} {{successful}} re-introduction and rebranding of the Capital Connection service, a similar refurbishment and rebranding programme was initiated for the 16 Wairarapa carriages and, though only 12 were actually overhauled. This programme lasted four years, until 1997. Six A cars {{and three of}} four ALs were thoroughly overhauled and refurbished with a new-style seats, {{the same as those}} in the third NIMT <b>servery</b> car and the new air-conditioned [...] "big window" [...] trainsets being assembled at that time. These vehicles were fitted with cloth on the interior walls to reduce noise and were fully carpeted. A cars seated 59, as one toilet from each car was removed to increase seating capacity, while ALs seated 46. The other two A cars and the remaining AL were overhauled but retained their Scarrett seats, reupholstered with cloth material.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, after {{less than}} four years in service, the car was {{replaced}} by a former Endeavour and Blue Fern carriage, with InterCity having taken the car and its operation back from Globetrotter. This new car was totally rebuilt and fitted with a new pressure ventilation system, a storage area for both hot and cold foods and beverages, big windows and a new end observation lounge area, complete with rear-view window and associated lounge, exactly like the rear-view and <b>servery</b> car of the Bay Express. Like its predecessor, this car had a hostess dedicated solely to it. Unlike the first Connoisseur, this Connoisseurs car bore the standard InterCity livery of dark blue with 220mm thick stripe and 100mm red band inside. Thirty nine [...] "Addington" [...] seats were installed and arranged in bays of four across tables, alcove-style. The seats were reupholstered, included more plush sheepskin wool coverings and were modified to increase comfort. The car was dedicated solely to the TranzAlpine and, although probably the most improved upon of all The Connoisseur services, the product in this third form was even shorter-lived.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, at the {{suggestion}} of Hamilton City Council, an 88-seater was refurbished for a new fast service between Hamilton and Auckland aimed at business customers, and it started on Monday, 8 April 1968. [...] It was fitted with carpet and re-upholstered fabric-covered seats, and was painted in a new two-tone blue colour scheme that prompted the nickname Blue Streak. The seating was reduced to 84 to accommodate a <b>servery</b> area from which light meals and assorted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks could be purchased. This was notable as {{the first time that a}} regularly scheduled passenger train service in New Zealand had reinstated on board catering since dining cars had been withdrawn across the network as a World War 1 economy measure. This initial service was unsuccessful, with patronage well below the levels needed to be profitable. The service might have been successful if run the other way round from Hamilton to Auckland in the morning but in 1968 the Wellington-Auckland Limited and Express were still timetabled to cater for the early morning commuter market from Hamilton and Huntly or in the other direction from Palmerston North and Levin and those leaving Auckland or Wellington in the evening for the Waikato or Manawatu or Horewhenua, while the NZR long term desire to maintain the New Plymouth- Auckland twinset service was much more because it brought people into Auckland in the morning, leaving Taurmaranu at 6.30 am and Hamilton at 9.30am and returned in the afternoon rather than for its night social and paper service through the King Country which Government cabinets saw as essential. Therefore, the Hamilton commuter market was served by many other services at lower second class fare cost in 1968 and the Blue Streak experiment was simply in the wrong direction at the wrong time.|$|E
