5|$|The Buenos Aires Underground has had {{among the}} longest serving and most varied rolling <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> the world, {{in part due}} to the network having been {{originally}} built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines.

However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines. Line B also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand rolling <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> 1995.|$|E
