5000|$|A {{historical}} {{example of}} Solar access is Ancient Lights, a doctrine based on English law {{that refers to}} a negative easement that prevents the owner or occupier of an adjoining structure from building or placing on his own land anything that {{has the effect of}} obstructing the light of the dominant tenement. In common law, a person's window on his property receiving flow of light that passed through it for so long a time as to constitute immemorial usage in law, the flow of light became an “ancient light” that the law protected from disturbance. The Prescription Act 1832 created a <b>statutory</b> <b>prescription</b> for light. It provided that: ...|$|E
5000|$|A court-martial {{has always}} been an ad hoc {{tribunal}} created and appointed by the order of a commanding officer, as the convening authority. The tribunal is established with the express purpose of considering a set of charges that the commander has referred to the court. The convening Authority considers the <b>statutory</b> <b>prescription</b> offered by the United States Congress, those [...] "best qualified," [...] in selecting the [...] "panel" [...] or jury for the court-martial. In turn, the members of the court-martial, who are generally under the command of the convening authority, take an oath to [...] "faithfully and impartially try, according to the evidence, their conscience, and the laws applicable to trial by court-martial, the case of the accused." [...] By their oath, the panel members expressly agree to leave behind any influence from the commander who appointed them. In cases where the accused is an enlisted member, the accused may request that enlisted service members be appointed to the panel.|$|E
50|$|According to English and Welsh procedure, {{the jury}} has no power to {{determine}} the punishment to be awarded for an offense. The sentence, with certain exceptions in capital cases, is within the sole discretion of the judge, subject to the <b>statutory</b> <b>prescriptions</b> as to the kind and maximum of punishment. It is common practice for juries to add to their verdict, guilty or not guilty, a rider recommending the accused to mercy on the ground of grave provocation received, or other circumstances which in their view should mitigate the penalty.|$|R
40|$|Keller {{discusses}} the 2 ̆ 2 {{duty of disclosure}} 2 ̆ 2 provision of the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA). The development of disclosure requirements through decisional law rather than through <b>statutory</b> <b>prescriptions</b> highlights the important question of when corporate law should be codified legislatively and when it {{should be left to}} case-by-case judicial development. The American Bar Association 2 ̆ 7 s Committee on Corporate Laws (2 ̆ 2 the Committee 2 ̆ 2) confronted this question when considering disclosure requirements as part of its continuing evaluation of the MBCA...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} {{addressed by}} the Supreme Court of Appeal in Thunder Cats Investment 92 (Pty) Ltd v Nkonjane Economic Prospecting & Investments (Pty) Ltd 2014 5 SA 1 (SCA) (hereafter the "Thunder Cats") provides much-needed guidance on the deadlock principle {{as well as the}} breadth and scope of the "just and equitable ground for winding up in terms of s 81 (1) (d) (iii) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008. The facts, the issues and the contextual authority of Thunder Cats also bring to fore the lacuna in the just and equitable winding up provisions of the current Companies Act which lacuna has so far received no judicial or academic consideration. This Note contends the fact that the just and equitable winding up provisions do not countenance any deviation from the <b>statutory</b> <b>prescriptions</b> once the factual grounds for just and equitable winding up have been established is not in consonance with the spirit, purport and objects of Companies Act, and, in particular those of Chapter Six of the Act which have introduced the innovative business rescue scheme into South African corporate law landscape. The facts, the issues and the contextual authority of Thunder Cats will be reviewed at length in the ensuing discussion...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. (Education Management) The {{problem of}} the exercisinq of {{authority}} by the headmaster, is twofold in nature. Firstly, many headmasters {{seem to be in}} doubt as to the limits of their authority. Secondly, {{the way in which the}} headmaster exercises his authority, has an effect on the motivation and work satisfaction of the staff and the pupils. Formal line authority is delegated to the headmaster in order to carry out the responsibilities concerning his post. This authority includes executive and legislative functions. The legislative function is related to the competence of the headmaster to create internal order in the school by the formulation and implementation of a school policy and rules. School policy and rules must be compatible with the government policy regarding educational affairs and must satisfy the requirements of law enforcement and legal practice. Headmasters' uncertainty about the extent and limitations of their formal authority is the result of the magnitude of <b>statutory</b> stipulations and <b>prescriptions</b> contained in official educational policy. Many headmasters also lack knowledge of law enforcement and legal practice. The dynamic nature of an authority relationship brought about by delegation, can also lead to the headmasters' uncertainty about the limits of their authority. Informal authority can be invested in the headmaster by the staff and the pupils, on account of their respect for and confidence in the headmaster. Two types of informal authority are identified: authority of competence and personal authority. It is of vital importance for the headmaster to achieve a high standard of informal authority, as the effective application of his formal authority is dependent on the quality of his informal authority...|$|R
40|$|Background According to {{international}} study results, physical therapists are afflicted with work-related musculoskeletal, psychosocial and dermal disorders {{as well as}} infections. The few existing studies in German-speaking regions focus mainly on dermal and psychosocial exposures and resulting complaints. An overview of all relevant work-related exposures and complaints of physical therapists is currently lacking. We sought to identify work-related exposures based on the subjective experiences and beliefs of physiotherapeutic representatives, {{in order to identify}} relevant work-related complaints and diseases. Likewise we aimed to compare the international evidence with the actual situation of physical therapists in Germany. Methods Two complementary qualitative approaches were used: 1) a focus group discussion with representatives of professional physiotherapy associations as well as health and safety stakeholders and 2) qualitative semi-structured telephone interviews incorporating currently employed physical therapists. The group discussion was conducted applying a moderation technique, and interviews were analyzed using the content analysis approach by Mayring. Results The focus group discussion with five participants and the 40 semi-structured interviews with physical therapists identified comparable results. The main exposures of physiotherapeutic work were considered to be musculoskeletal (e. g., awkward body postures during treatment, patient transfers, passive mobilization), psychosocial (e. g., <b>statutory</b> audit of <b>prescriptions</b> and the associated conflicts with doctors and health insurance providers) and partly dermal and infectious (e. g., wet work and risk of infection) factors. Diseases of the spine, wrist or finger joints, burnout syndrome and infections were mentioned as possible consequences. Conclusions The subjective data generated by both groups (focus group discussion and interviews) were comparable and consistent with the current state of research. The results provide new insight regarding work-related exposures and diseases of physical therapists working in Germany. These findings aided the design of a German-wide representative survey of practicing physical therapists...|$|R
40|$|Text in AfrikaansThe study investigates {{legal and}} {{administrative}} {{aspects of the}} interaction between public sector and private enterprise effected by state procurement of goods and services. South African government contracts are, despite their elaborate regulation by <b>statutory</b> and administrative <b>prescription,</b> regarded as {{the subject matter of the}} private law of contract. In this regard, they may be distinguished from the contrats administratif of the French and related legal systems and resemble their British and, more closely, federal American counterparts. Important aspects of government procurement, notably the contractual capacity of organs of the state, those administrative procedures which precede the conclusion of agreements with contractors, and the right reserved to the state to rescind, in the public interest, a contract duly entered into, are nevertheless to be determined by the principles of administrative law. The budgeting, audit and parliamentary control of procurement expenditure, along with the invitation of suppliers' bids and the award of contracts, are the principal administrative aspects of the study and are analysed in Chapters III and IV. The pricing of government contracts in South Africa is, with scant exception, determined by competitive tender. Restrictive trade practices and bid preferences awarded by procuring agencies in the pursuit of socio-economic policies were found, in Chapter V, to impede the operation of free market forces. The law of contract features most prominently in the performance of contracts and is examined in Chapter VI. The discussion, depicting the essential provisions of six standard form contracts commonly employed by government for stores and works, is fairly concise. References to British and American procurement law and practice, a consistent feature of the study, are, however, extensive. In South Africa, the settlement of procurement disputes is generally entrusted to the ordillary courts. Chapter VII deals with a number of special remedies accorded to the state, procedural prerequisites for the institution of civil actions against the state, and alternatives to litigation, especially arbitration and administrative appeal. The final chapters survey the efficacy of procurement as an instrument of socio-economic policy, and advance a few recommendations regarding the proper law and more efficient administration of government procurement.
