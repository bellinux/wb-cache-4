40|$|The {{response}} of <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> with varying water content to alterations in oxygen tension has been studied. Cells that were severely dehydrated while sickled retained the characteristic sickled morphology even after prolonged reoxygenation. When the cell water content was increased {{by reduction of}} the suspending medium osmolality, the cells unsickled. Cells that were dehydrated before deoxygenation were unable to assume the spiculated morphology typical of sicked cells. This was true both for high mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) discoid <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> and for irreversibly <b>sickled</b> <b>cells.</b> When such cells were resuspended in hypotonic medium before deoxygenation, they sickled with the characteristic morphology of <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> with normal MCHC. The morphological behavior of Ca-loaded <b>sickled</b> <b>cells</b> as well as irreversibly <b>sickled</b> <b>cells</b> showed a major influence of increased hemoglobin concentration and extremely high internal viscosity.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> and xerocytic red cells become depleted of cations in vivo has not been identified previously. Both types of cells exhibit elevated permeabilities to sodium and potassium, {{in the case of}} <b>sickle</b> <b>cells,</b> when deoxygenated. The ouabain-insensitive fluxes of sodium and potassium were equivalent, however, in both cell types under these conditions. When incubated 18 hours in vitro, <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> lost cations but only when deoxygenated. This cation depletion was blocked by ouabain, removal of external potassium, or pretreatment with 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonate, which blocks the increase in cation permeability induced by deoxygenation. The loss of cation exhibited by oxygenated xerocytes similarly incubated was also blocked by ouabain. These data support the hypothesis that the elevated "passive" cation fluxes of xerocytes and deoxygenated <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> are not directly responsible for cation depletion of these cells; rather, these pathologic leaks interact with the sodium pump to produce a net loss of cellular cation...|$|R

40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} deformabilities of {{erythrocytes}} are important determinants of microcirculatory blood flow. To {{determine the influence}} of increased cellular hemoglobin concentration on these properties, we quantitated static and dynamic deformabilities of isolated subpopulations of oxygenated normal and sickle erythrocytes with defined cell densities using micromechanical manipulations of individual cells. The rheological properties measured to characterize static deformability were membrane extensional rigidity and bending rigidity. To characterize dynamic deformability of the cells, we measured the time constants for rapid elastic recovery from extensional and bending deformations. The extensional rigidity of <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> increased with increasing cell hemoglobin concentration while that of normal cells was independent of the state of <b>cell</b> hydration. Moreover, <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> were found to exhibit inelastic behavior at much lower cell hemoglobin concentrations than normal cells. In contrast, the dynamic rigidity of both normal and <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> was increased to the same extent at elevated hemoglobin concentrations. Moreover, this increase in dynamic rigidity with increasing cellular dehydration was much more pronounced than that seen for static rigidity. Both the increased static and dynamic rigidities of the dehydrated <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> could be greatly improved by hydrating the cells. This suggests that increased bulk hemoglobin concentration, which is perhaps inordinately increased adjacent to the membrane, {{plays a major role in}} regulating the rigidity of <b>sickle</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, irreversible membrane changes also appear to accompany cell dehydration in vivo, resulting in increased membrane shear rigidity and plastic flow. We expect that the marked increases in rigidity of dehydrated <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> observed here may have a major influence on the dynamics of their circulation in the microvasculature...|$|R

5|$|The {{impact of}} <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. <b>Sickle</b> <b>cell</b> trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus {{has no effect on}} photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. Inhaling the gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, and even death. Different people and populations may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. Carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> disease and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E
40|$|The precise {{mechanism}} by which sickle erythrocytes (RBC) are removed from the circulation is controversial, although {{it is possible that}} enhanced recognition of these cells by circulating mononuclear phagocytes could contribute to this process.

Our results show that both irreversibly <b>sickled</b> <b>cells</b> (ISC) and deoxygenated reversibly <b>sickled</b> <b>cells</b> (RSC) had a higher avidity for adherence to monocytes than did oxygenated sickle and normal RBC.
