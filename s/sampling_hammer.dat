40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} hammer peening on the fatigue {{resistance}} of high strength welded joints in high strength structural steel S 690 has been investigated. Cyclic four points bending tests {{have been performed}} on butt weld samples, manually and automatically hammered. Microstructural and mechanical modifications induced by both methods and their subsequent influences in fatigue life have been studied using several characterization techniques. It {{was found that the}} roughness of manually <b>hammered</b> <b>samples</b> is different than that of automatically <b>hammered</b> <b>samples</b> for which a lack of correct treatment in some regions of the weld cordon has been observed. A comparison of residual stress measurements using X-ray diffraction shows also differences between both methods. On the other hand, hardness profile of the strain hardened region is very similar for both types of samples. The ultra-fine grain microstructure of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) induced by the hammer peening process has been studied by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy and Electron Back Scattered Technique (EBSD). The strain-hardened depth determined by Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM), microhardness and residual stress are compared...|$|R
40|$|The field {{investigation}} {{phase of}} the project was essentially completed when grout placed into auger holes at the Lodestar Energy mine site during Summer 1997 was sampled. Mining had proceeded to a point where the strata overlying the coal was completely removed, thus exposing the grout-filled auger holes. All of the auger holes contained either grout from these experiments or shale that in-filled the non-grouted holes during the process of clearing the top surface of the coal. Eleven grouted holes were <b>sampled,</b> utilizing <b>hammers</b> and chisels, for physical (strength) testing, as well as chemical, mineralogical, and microscopical analysis. Upon arrival at the laboratory, moisture contents, densities, and void ratios were obtained before disturbing the samples, and after strength testing. Representative samples of each grout were then cut into flat-sided prisms, with a height:width ratio {approx} 2, to be used for testing of unconfined compressive strength. In summary, all of the grouts had very good mechanical strength, ranging from 1000 psi to 2250 psi. The lowest compressive strength was recorded on a bed ash-based grout...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact damage and absorbed energy of apple using an impact test with single pendulum. The peak force, contact time and impulse were obtained from the force-time curve during impact. The damage volume of apple was measured and the absorbed energy was calculated by relationship of energy equilibrium. The effect of damage volume and absorbed energy were investigated under different impact momentum and hammer detector with different curvature radius. The experimental results indicated that the density and moisture contain of apple samples was 0. 85 g/cm^ 3 and 84. 5 % respectively. The flat hammer detector had shorter contact time and higher peak force during impact under different momentum. The damage volume for apple samples increased as impact momentum increased. The hammer detector smaller curvature radius would be caused more large absorbed energy per unit damage volume after impact apple <b>samples.</b> The <b>hammer</b> detector with curvature radius of 32 mm had longer contact time, the larger damage volume and the smaller absorbed energy per unit damage volume under the impact momentum of 569. 2 and 757. 4 kg-mm/s. The reason might be the curvature radius of 32 mm of hammer detector was closed to the average radius of apple samples. 本研究目的是使用一單擺錘型碰擊試驗機對蘋果進行碰擊試驗，碰擊時，由力量－時間波形圖得到的最大撞擊力F(下标 p) 、撞擊接觸時間t(下标 c) 及衝量值I，碰擊後，量測蘋果的損傷體積，利用能量平衡關係計算得到蘋果碰擊損傷的吸收能量，探討不同的碰擊動量及不同曲率半徑的衝錘探頭下對蘋果碰擊後的果肉損傷體積及吸收能量的影響。由實驗分析結果顯示；蘋果在密度 0. 85 g/立方公分，含水率 84. 5 %下，以平板衝錘探頭碰擊蘋果時有較小的碰擊接觸時間t(下标 c) 及較大的最大碰擊力F(下标 p) ；蘋果的損傷體積隨著碰擊動量增加而增大，曲率半徑較小的衝錘探頭在碰擊蘋果後會造成較大的單位損傷體積之吸收能量；在碰擊動量 569. 2 及 757. 4 kgmm/s下，曲率半徑 32 mm的衝錘探頭有較長的碰擊接觸時間t(下标 c) 、較大的損傷體積及較小的單位損傷體積之吸收能量，此結果應是衝錘探頭的曲率半徑與蘋果樣本的平均半徑接近之緣故...|$|R
40|$|Machine Hammer Peening (MHP) is a {{new method}} for {{finishing}} of surfaces. With this method the workpiece surface is hammered with a spherical carbide tool. The main objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate whether the MHP method could be used as a plausible substitute for manual polishing in pressing die manufacturing. To do this, <b>sample</b> surfaces were <b>hammered</b> and evaluated. Changes to the surfaces were assessed using surface roughness measurements, hardness measurements and optical images. First of all, the workpiece surface was smoothened. Secondly, the surface hardness was increased significantly. Thirdly, the nodules on the workpiece surface were effected. They appeared to be smaller and not as visible. It is probable that they had been plastically deformed and that some of the graphite in the nodules was replaced by material from the surrounding steel matrix. By replacing the graphite in the larger nodule cavities by surrounding steel material, a die surface is created which would be less prone to galling. In addition, with MHP, the amount of polishing needed to manufacture a die surface can be reduced because of the smoothening effect...|$|R
50|$|The hammer {{measures}} the rebound of a spring-loaded mass impacting against {{the surface of}} the <b>sample.</b> The test <b>hammer</b> will hit the concrete at a defined energy. Its rebound is dependent on the hardness of the concrete and is measured by the test equipment. By reference to the conversion chart, the rebound value can be used to determine the compressive strength. When conducting the test the hammer should be held at right angles to the surface which in turn should be flat and smooth. The rebound reading will be affected by the orientation of the hammer, when used in a vertical position (on the underside of a suspended slab for example) gravity will increase the rebound distance of the mass and vice versa for a test conducted on a floor slab. The Schmidt hammer is an arbitrary scale ranging from 10 to 100. Schmidt hammers are available from their original manufacturers in several different energy ranges. These include: (i) Type L-0.735 Nm impact energy, (ii) Type N-2.207 Nm impact energy; and (iii) Type M-29.43 Nm impact energy.|$|R
40|$|The {{hammer mill}} {{introduced}} to Uganda 60 {{years ago is}} still the main equipment used in milling most of the cereals such as maize and sorghum. Hammer mills are very important in Uganda and neighboring countries as a time-and cost-effective means of milling grains. These are mostly manufactured by in-country artisans and often of low efficiency. Some concerns with locally fabricated hammer mills include: long milling time, contamination of flour with steel filings due to the low quality of the steel alloy used to produce the hammers and excessive wear and tear, as well as low time and energy efficiency. The goal {{of the study was}} to improve the performance of the locally fabricated hammer mills in Uganda. The protocol generated for testing the performance of hammer mills was integrated with the local commonly practiced testing methods used by fabricators. This improved protocol was then applied to test performance of a commonly used hammer mill. This was in turn assumed to improve the operations of the millers and result into consistent and safe products. First, the test protocol can be used by small scale fabricators given their constraints of available equipment and resources. The protocol evaluated the performance of locally fabricated hammer mills in Uganda by measuring the final particle size, power/energy consumption and milling rate. Subsequently, an informal survey was conducted in Mpigi, Mukono, and Wakiso districts in Uganda. The challenges and opportunities of local fabrication of agro-processing machinery in Uganda were studied with a review of secondary data sources and policies. The survey was complemented with key informants’ interviews, on-spot inspection and assessment, and photographic documentation. During the survey, <b>samples</b> of <b>hammers</b> were collected and a rate of wear and hardness study was also carried out. Iron fillings concentration of ~ 6. 48 ppm was observed. Performance evaluation of a locally fabricated hammer mill was also done. Best operating settings with maximum energy efficiency and most uniform particle size were determined and found at hammer thickness of 5 mm, hammer tip speed of 83. 57 m s- 1 and screen hole diameter of 2. 16 mm. ...|$|R
30|$|Cores {{removed from}} each deck {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} lightweight or normalweight coarse aggregate. Petrographic examination confirmed that the coarse aggregates for lightweight concrete mixtures were entirely lightweight aggregate (not partially blended with normalweight coarse aggregate). Petrographic examination also revealed that the lightweight aggregate utilized {{in each of the}} bridge decks was an expanded shale obtained from a local source. Typically, information on the mixture proportions, cement composition, placement conditions, and fresh and hardened concrete test results used on the bridge decks was not available. Therefore, analysis to evaluate the effect of different mixture parameters (such as water content, cement content, admixtures, and mixture components) could not be performed. However, the paired approach to this study allowed direct comparison of decks with similar environmental exposure, traffic, and age. Additionally, it can be assumed that the concrete comprising both types of decks met the requirements of the state highway agency’s standards and specifications for concrete used in bridge decks, as applicable at the time of construction. For bridge decks, this is typically designated as Class AA concrete, with a minimum 28 -day f′c of 31  MPa (4500 psi) with a maximum w/cm of 0.426 (angular aggregate) and a cement content ranging from 379 to 424  kg/m 3 (639 to 715 pcy). It is very important to note that adequate durability performance incorporates far more characteristics than resistance to cracking, and durability assessment should include resistance to weathering, chemical attack, abrasion, and other service conditions. Therefore, in addition to visual surveys to quantify extent of cracking, additional field and laboratory testing to evaluate durability performance was performed. Field tests included air permeability, surface resistivity, and rebound <b>hammer.</b> <b>Sampling</b> of drilled powders were obtained and tested to determine chloride content. Drilled cores were removed and returned to the laboratory for testing for compressive strength, sorptivity, and rapid chloride ion permeability. Additionally, petrographic examination was performed on cores from each deck to evaluate the characteristics of cracking. For additional information on laboratory testing portions of this research program, the reader is referred to Cavalline et al. (2013). Other results will be published in separate publications.|$|R
40|$|Site {{characterization}} is {{an important}} task in Geotechnical Engineering. In situ tests based on standard penetration test (SPT), cone penetration test (CPT) and shear wave velocity survey are popular among geotechnical engineers. Site characterization using any of these properties based on finite number of in-situ test data is an imperative task in probabilistic site characterization. These methods {{have been used to}} design future soil sampling programs for the site and to specify the soil stratification. It is never possible to know the geotechnical properties at every location beneath an actual site because, in order to do so, one would need to sample and/or test the entire subsurface profile. Therefore, the main objective of site characterization models is to predict the subsurface soil properties with minimum in-situ test data. The prediction of soil property is a difficult task due to the uncertainities. Spatial variability, measurement ‘noise’, measurement and model bias, and statistical error due to limited measurements are the sources of uncertainities. Liquefaction in soil is one of the other major problems in geotechnical earthquake engineering. It is defined as the transformation of a granular material from a solid to a liquefied state as a consequence of increased pore-water pressure and reduced effective stress. The generation of excess pore pressure under undrained loading conditions is a hallmark of all liquefaction phenomena. This phenomena was {{brought to the attention of}} engineers more so after Niigata(1964) and Alaska(1964) earthquakes. Liquefaction will cause building settlement or tipping, sand boils, ground cracks, landslides, dam instability, highway embankment failures, or other hazards. Such damages are generally of great concern to public safety and are of economic significance. Site-spefific evaluation of liquefaction susceptibility of sandy and silty soils is a first step in liquefaction hazard assessment. Many methods (intelligent models and simple methods as suggested by Seed and Idriss, 1971) have been suggested to evaluate liquefaction susceptibility based on the large data from the sites where soil has been liquefied / not liquefied. The rapid advance in information processing systems in recent decades directed engineering research towards the development of intelligent models that can model natural phenomena automatically. In intelligent model, a process of training is used to build up a model of the particular system, from which it is hoped to deduce responses of the system for situations that have yet to be observed. Intelligent models learn the input output relationship from the data itself. The quantity and quality of the data govern the performance of intelligent model. The objective of this study is to develop intelligent models [geostatistic, artificial neural network(ANN) and support vector machine(SVM) ] to estimate corrected standard penetration test (SPT) value, Nc, in the three dimensional (3 D) subsurface of Bangalore. The database consists of 766 boreholes spread over a 220 sq km area, with several SPT N values (uncorrected blow counts) in each of them. There are total 3015 N values in the 3 D subsurface of Bangalore. To get the corrected blow counts, Nc, various corrections such as for overburden stress, size of borehole, type of <b>sampler,</b> <b>hammer</b> energy and length of connecting rod have been applied on the raw N values. Using a large database of Nc values in the 3 D subsurface of Bangalore, three geostatistical models (simple kriging, ordinary kriging and disjunctive kriging) have been developed. Simple and ordinary kriging produces linear estimator whereas, disjunctive kriging produces nonlinear estimator. The knowledge of the semivariogram of the Nc data is used in the kriging theory to estimate the values at points in the subsurface of Bangalore where field measurements are not available. The capability of disjunctive kriging to be a nonlinear estimator and an estimator of the conditional probability is explored. A cross validation (Q 1 and Q 2) analysis is also done for the developed simple, ordinary and disjunctive kriging model. The result indicates that the performance of the disjunctive kriging model is better than simple as well as ordinary kriging model. This study also describes two ANN modelling techniques applied to predict Nc data at any point in the 3 D subsurface of Bangalore. The first technique uses four layered feed-forward backpropagation (BP) model to approximate the function, Nc=f(x, y, z) where x, y, z are the coordinates of the 3 D subsurface of Bangalore. The second technique uses generalized regression neural network (GRNN) that is trained with suitable spread(s) to approximate the function, Nc=f(x, y, z). In this BP model, the transfer function used in first and second hidden layer is tansig and logsig respectively. The logsig transfer function is used in the output layer. The maximum epoch has been set to 30000. A Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm has been used for BP model. The performance of the models obtained using both techniques is assessed in terms of prediction accuracy. BP ANN model outperforms GRNN model and all kriging models. SVM model, which is firmly based on the theory of statistical learning theory, uses regression technique by introducing -insensitive loss function has been also adopted to predict Nc data at any point in 3 D subsurface of Bangalore. The SVM implements the structural risk minimization principle (SRMP), which has been shown to be superior to the more traditional empirical risk minimization principle (ERMP) employed by many of the other modelling techniques. The present study also highlights the capability of SVM over the developed geostatistic models (simple kriging, ordinary kriging and disjunctive kriging) and ANN models. Further in this thesis, Liquefaction susceptibility is evaluated from SPT, CPT and Vs data using BP-ANN and SVM. Intelligent models (based on ANN and SVM) are developed for prediction of liquefaction susceptibility using SPT data from the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake, Taiwan. Two models (MODEL I and MODEL II) are developed. The SPT data from the work of Hwang and Yang (2001) has been used for this purpose. In MODEL I, cyclic stress ratio (CSR) and corrected SPT values (N 1) 60 have been used for prediction of liquefaction susceptibility. In MODEL II, only peak ground acceleration (PGA) and (N 1) 60 have been used for prediction of liquefaction susceptibility. Further, the generalization capability of the MODEL II has been examined using different case histories available globally (global SPT data) from the work of Goh (1994). This study also examines the capabilities of ANN and SVM to predict the liquefaction susceptibility of soils from CPT data obtained from the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake, Taiwan. For determination of liquefaction susceptibility, both ANN and SVM use the classification technique. The CPT data has been taken from the work of Ku et al. (2004). In MODEL I, cone tip resistance (qc) and CSR values have been used for prediction of liquefaction susceptibility (using both ANN and SVM). In MODEL II, only PGA and qc have been used for prediction of liquefaction susceptibility. Further, developed MODEL II has been also applied to different case histories available globally (global CPT data) from the work of Goh (1996). Intelligent models (ANN and SVM) have been also adopted for liquefaction susceptibility prediction based on shear wave velocity (Vs). The Vs data has been collected from the work of Andrus and Stokoe (1997). The same procedures (as in SPT and CPT) have been applied for Vs also. SVM outperforms ANN model for all three models based on SPT, CPT and Vs data. CPT method gives better result than SPT and Vs for both ANN and SVM models. For CPT and SPT, two input parameters {PGA and qc or (N 1) 60 } are sufficient input parameters to determine the liquefaction susceptibility using SVM model. In this study, an attempt has also been made to evaluate geotechnical site characterization by carrying out in situ tests using different in situ techniques such as CPT, SPT and multi channel analysis of surface wave (MASW) techniques. For this purpose a typical site was selected wherein a man made homogeneous embankment and as well natural ground has been met. For this typical site, in situ tests (SPT, CPT and MASW) have been carried out in different ground conditions and the obtained test results are compared. Three CPT continuous test profiles, fifty-four SPT tests and nine MASW test profiles with depth have been carried out for the selected site covering both homogeneous embankment and natural ground. Relationships have been developed between Vs, (N 1) 60 and qc values for this specific site. From the limited test results, it was found that there is a good correlation between qc and Vs. Liquefaction susceptibility is evaluated using the in situ test data from (N 1) 60, qc and Vs using ANN and SVM models. It has been shown to compare well with “Idriss and Boulanger, 2004 ” approach based on SPT test data. SVM model has been also adopted to determine over consolidation ratio (OCR) based on piezocone data. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to investigate the relative importance of each of the input parameters. SVM model outperforms all the available methods for OCR prediction...|$|R
40|$|The Paleozoic {{carbonate}} {{deposits in}} southeastern Minnesota, consisting of several formations ranging from limestone to dolomite, constitute an important mineral resource of the state. They are quarried quite extensively for aggregate, aglime, and dimension stone, but new uses being developed for carbonate rocks often require greater adherence to specifications for chemical composition than is now required. Because no {{comprehensive study of}} chemical compositions of the several formations was available and because this information must be provided to potential producers and consumers for expansion of the industry, this evaluation by the Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI) was approved for funding by the Minerals Coordinating Committee (MCC) through the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The duration {{of the project was}} from October 1, 1987, to June 30, 1989, and the amount of funding was $ 168, 300. Because no sample materials from previous studies were available for additional chemical analyses, most samples for this evaluation were taken by channel sampling, diamond drilling, or sampling split core from two drill holes that are stored by the DNR. The Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS) provided county maps with possible sampling sites keyed to references and provided consultation and background information on the various carbonate formations and their general characteristics. Channel sampling sites were selected to provide reasonable geographic distributions of the formations and maximum stratigraphic sections of fresh rock. Sample sites were briefly described and continuous <b>samples</b> taken with <b>hammer</b> and chisel over the sections. Channel samples were taken at 45 locations over 1423 vertical feet to provide 196 assay intervals. Diamond drill core sampling was undertaken to provide samples of formations at locations not well exposed for channel sampling and where high vertical faces were not otherwise accessible. The 17 holes at 15 locations totaled 1724 vertical feet and provided 300 assay sample intervals. The MGS supervised drilling, collected and logged core, and provided detailed stratigraphic descriptions. The core was split and one half is stored by the DNR in Hibbing. All samples were crushed, pulverized, and analyzed at the Coleraine Research Laboratory (CRL). Chemical analyses were run on 615 samples representing 3774 feet, and differential thermal analyses (OTA) were run on 307 samples representing 2236 vertical feet. Most samples assayed for this evaluation are classed as dolomites with an encouraging number containing more than 90. 0 % CaC 03 + MgC 03 over intervals of more than 20 feet. Most of these locations would require selective mining practices and/or beneficiation to produce moderate or high purity carbonates. Formations of the Devonian System were sampled only in Mower County where both the Cedar Valley and the Spillville Formations trended to higher purity from west to east. A high purity unit of the Stewartville Formation, approximately 50 feet thick, is present in Olmsted and Fillmore Counties. Many Prosser Formation sections are impure dolomites to dolomitic limestones, although several 15 - to 45 -foot thick moderately pure units do occur. The only true limestones (less than 10 % of the carbonates as dolomite) noted in the Prosser Formation were sampled in Fillmore County. Most Platteville sections sampled are classed as impure dolomites· to dolomitic limestones often with relatively high sulfur contents. Only in Fillmore County was the entire Platteville section classed as limestone, and it was also impure. Most Shakopee Formation samples were impure dolomites, but one 30 -foot section in northwestern Scott County was exceptionally pure with 95. 4 % CaC 03 + MgC 03 • The Oneota Dolomite {{is one of the most}} prominent and extensively quarried formations in the project area. In the West from Mankato northward, it is classed as impure dolomite with very few thin units that are not impure. However, in the eastern counties, the Oneota includes many 20 - to 80 -foot sections that are moderately and even highly pure. Additional evaluations of Minnesota carbonate rocks should include benefication testing to develop methods of producing carbonates to meet consumer specifications for new applications. Selective mining, Munsell color determinations, and relationships between calcining characteristics and differential thermal analyses should be further investigated.
