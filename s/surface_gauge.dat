50|$|In the toolroom, the {{distinction}} between a height gauge and a <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> is that a height gauge has a measuring head (whether vernier, fine rack and pinion with dial, or linear encoder with digital display), whereas a <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> has only a scriber point.

40|$|Stress relief {{techniques}} for measuring stresses {{have only been}} recently applied to concrete structures. The release of stresses due to either hole-drilling or slot-cutting are normally measured by <b>surface</b> strain <b>gauging.</b> A new technique is proposed in which an instrumented cylindrical inclusion is inserted inside a small hole in concrete to measure the stress relief due to overcoring. This thesis describes an experimental development of the proposed technique for in-situ stress measurement in concrete structures. The analysis, design and fabrication of the instrumented inclusion is described and a programme of calibration experiments is also described. Two types of instrumented inclusions of biaxial and triaxial configurations were used for bi-dimensional and tri-dimensional stress measurement respectively. Field trials using the inclusion technique were performed with limited success on three reinforced concrete bridges. Results of the field testing showed that the technique provides {{an extension of the}} existing stress relief methods for stress measurement by <b>surface</b> <b>gauging.</b> The potential use of the inclusion technique for in-situ stress measurement in existing structures is recognised but further refinement of the method and analysis is also recommended...|$|R

The large number of broadly similar Tube trains built for the UERL during 1922-1934 were called (and are commonly still referred to as) ''''Standard Stock'''' (officially re-christend Pre-1938 tube stock upon rehabilitation), although there were many detail differences. They replaced the UERL's original ''''Gate Stock'''' (itself known as 'Standard Stock' before the introduction of the then-new Pre-1938 tube stock), introduced for the opening of the Bakerloo, Piccadilly and Hampstead (Northern) lines and the replacement of the C&SLR's loco+carriage sets, the Watford Joint Stock of the Bakerloo, the GN&CR's <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> stock, and the CLR's ''''Tunnel Stock'''' and ''''Ealing Stock'''' (which in turn comprised DMs of 1903 and 1915 vintage constructed to replace locos hauling trailers of 1900 vintage).|$|E
5000|$|In other cases, {{the goal}} is {{producing}} the best instantaneous satellite estimate, which is the High Resolution Precipitation Product approach. In either case, of course, the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable. One key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even {{a small amount of}} <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates. The difficulties in using gauge data are that 1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission, assembly, processing and quality control. Thus, precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates. As a result, while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the [...] "true" [...] precipitation, they are generally not suited for real- or near-real-time applications.|$|E

Satisfactory comparisons with adaptive-p thin-shell finite element results were obtained in general and differences are explained in terms of the known experimental variables and finite element approximations.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for {{the estimation of}} rainfall rate, capitalizing on a radar-based raindrop size distribution (RSD) parameter retrieval and neural network (NN) inversion techniques, is validated using an extensive and quality-controlled archive. The RSD retrieval algorithm utilizes polarimetric variables measured by the polarimetric prototype of the Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler (WSR- 88 D) in Norman, Oklahoma (KOUN), through an ad hoc regularized neural network method. Evaluation of rainfall estimation from the NN-based method is accomplished using a large radar data and <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> observation dataset collected in central Oklahoma during the multiyear Joint Polarization Experiment (JPOLE) field campaign. Point estimates of hourly rainfall accumulations and instantaneous rainfall rates from NN-based and parametric polarimetric rainfall relations are compared with dense <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> observations. Rainfall accumulations from RSD retrieval-based methods are shown {{to be sensitive to}} the choice of a raindrop fall speed model. To minimize the impact of this choice, a new ‘‘direct’’ neural network approach is tested. Proposed NN-based approaches exhibit bias and root-mean-square error characteristics comparable with those obtained from parametric relations, specifically optimized for the JPOLE dataset, indicating an appealing generalization capability with respect to the climatological context. All tested polarimetric relations are shown to be sensitive to hail contamination as inferred from the results of automatic polarimetric echo classification and available storm reports...|$|E

For this material, we have shown at high shock stresses, a two component wave was formed consisting of a fast moving ramped portion and a slower moving shock wave. Changing the thickness of test specimen for a given shock stress resulted in a change in the magnitude and duration of the ramped portion of the wave front. As the shock stress imparted to the target was reduced, or the thickness of the target was increased, the steep shock wave in the rear <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> was no longer apparent. Instead a relatively slow rising wave was measured. Consequently, to establish a Hugoniot at lower shock stress levels, relatively thin specimens of target material are required...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a finite-size {{analysis}} of the four dimensional abelian <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> model. This model is defined assigning abelian variables to the plaquettes of an hypercubical lattice, and is dual to the four dimensional Ising model. This last model is known to present a second order phase transition with mean field critical exponents. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations on several lattice sizes and high statistics. The analysis of the partition function zeroes and the specific heat scaling behaviour allowed us to estimate the critical coupling β_c as well as the critical exponents ν and α. Our results are consistent with the second order critical exponents ν = 1 / 2 and α = 0. The β_c value is in perfect agreement with duality predictions from the 4 -d Ising model. Nevertheless, the energy histograms show a seemingly non-vanishing double peak structure. The interface tension analysis suggests that this may be a finite size effect. Comment: 16 p...|$|E

40|$|The {{synoptic}} and large‐scale {{atmospheric conditions}} for heavy rainfall events in Northwestern Italy are diagnosed through the joint analysis of surface precipitation gauges and reanalysis atmospheric fields. Quantiles of local <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> precipitation observations {{are used to}} estimate the much larger‐scale composite maps (conditional mean fields) of vertically integrated moisture flux, low‐level winds, sea‐level pressure, and 500 hPa height across the Atlantic and European domains. Remarkably, coarse‐resolution reanalysis data show distinct synoptic conditions for heavy precipitation in localized regions that are below {{the resolution of the}} reanalysis. In this paper the key attributes of the new approach that is based on the joint analysis of gridded reanalysis and station data are presented. Applications of the methodology are used to establish supporting evidence for hydrometeorological processes that lead to extreme precipitation across Northwest Italy. The results confirm the role of large-scale flow features that interact with regional topography in producing localized extreme precipitation. Whereas previous studies were based on a few case studies (modeled or observational), in this study the approach to producing a large ensemble of cases and composite statistics are introduced...|$|E
40|$|Tests and {{analysis}} of a new miniature plug-type heat flux gauge configuration are described. This gauge can simultaneously measure heat flux on two opposed active surfaces when heat flux levels are {{equal to or greater}} than about 0. 2 MW/m(sup 2). The performance of this dual active <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> was investigated over a wide transient and steady heat flux and temperature range. The tests were performed by radiatively heating the front surface with an argon arc lamp while the back surface was convection cooled with air. Accuracy is about + 20 percent. The gauge is responsive to fast heat flux transients and is designed to withstand the high temperature (1300 K), high pressure (15 MPa), erosive and corrosive environments in modern engines. This gauge can be used to measure heat flux on the surfaces of internally cooled apparatus such as turbine blades and combustors used in jet propulsion systems and on the surfaces of hypersonic vehicles. Heat flux measurement accuracy is not compromised when design considerations call for various size gauges to be fabricated into alloys of various shapes and properties. Significant gauge temperature reductions (120 K), which can lead to potential gauge durability improvement, were obtained when the gauges were air-cooled by forced convection...|$|E
40|$|Concern about {{anthropogenic}} {{climate change}} has heightened the need for accurate information about spatial and temporal variations in precipitation at the Earth’s surface. Large-scale precipitation estimates {{can be derived from}} either <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements or by satellite remote sensing, both of which have shortcomings. Gauge measurements provide information about trends and variability of monthly precipitation throughout the entire twentieth century, but {{because of the lack of}} data from most ocean regions, this information is representative of only about 25 – 30 % of the Earth’s surface. In contrast, satellite (especially multi-platform) measurements provide spatially complete coverage at monthly to subdaily resolution, but do not extend back beyond 1974. Merged gauge–satellite datasets maximize (and minimize) the relative benefits (and shortcomings) of each source type. While these merged products only extend back to 1979, their importance will grow as we move into the new century. Precipitation gauge data indicate that global land precipitation (excluding Antarctica) has increased by about 9 mm over the twentieth century (a trend of 0. 89 mm/decade), which is relatively small compared with interannual and multi-decadal variability. Within this century-long trend, global precipitation exhibits considerable variability on decadal time-scales, with departures of up to 40 mm from the century mean of about 950 mm. Regionally, precipitation has increased over most land areas, with the exception of tropical North Africa, and parts of souther...|$|E

40|$|The Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) is a {{joint mission}} between the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). It builds upon the {{heritage}} of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) with an advanced core spacecraft augmented by a constellation satellite and other satellites of opportunity (i. e, other international satellite systems with precipitation-sensing instrument payloads). With changes to satellite missions and sensor capabilities, {{it is unlikely that}} the GPM constellation configuration will be known until close to deployment, and will change during the lifetime of GPM. It is instructive to note how the retention or loss of a particular satellite platform and/or sensor type will affect the performance of the GPM precipitation products and other applications that utilize GPM products. In this study, we use the existing (2008) constellation of various active radar and passive microwave-based platforms to examine the impact of several proxy GPM satellite constellation configurations. The emphasis is on how high resolution precipitation products (HRPP) are affected by such factors as sensor type (conical or across-track scanning) and nodal crossing time, using a collection of GPM proxy datasets gathered over the continental United States. The validation is presented two ways. The first is by traditional validation using an existing <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> network analysis (Chen et. al, 2008). The second is more indirect, through examination of how the soil moisture state of the Noah land surface model (LSM) is impacted when the LSM is forced with the various precipitation datasets, each corresponding to a different proxy GPM constellation configuration...|$|E
40|$|An updated 15 -yr Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) {{composite}} climatology (TCC) {{is presented}} and evaluated. This climatology {{is based on}} a combination of individual rainfall estimates made with data from the primaryTRMMinstruments: theTRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and the precipitation radar (PR). This combination climatology of passive microwave retrievals, radar-based retrievals, and an algorithm using both instruments simultaneously provides a consensus TRMM-based estimate of mean precipitation. The dispersion of the three estimates, as indicated by the standard deviation sigma among the estimates, is presented as a measure of confidence in the final estimate and as an estimate of the uncertainty thereof. The procedures utilized by the compositing technique, including adjustments and quality-control measures, are described. The results give a mean value of the TCC of 4. 3 mm day(exp - 1) for the deep tropical ocean beltbetween 10 deg N and 10 deg S, with lower values outside that band. In general, the TCC values confirm ocean estimates from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) analysis, which is based on passive microwave results adjusted for sampling by infrared-based estimates. The pattern of uncertainty estimates shown by sigma is seen to be useful to indicate variations in confidence. Examples include differences between the eastern and western portions of the Pacific Ocean and high values in coastal and mountainous areas. Comparison of the TCC values (and the input products) to gauge analyses over land indicates the value of the radar-based estimates (small biases) and the limitations of the passive microwave algorithm (relatively large biases). Comparison with <b>surface</b> <b>gauge</b> information from western Pacific Ocean atolls shows a negative bias (~ 16 %) for all the TRMM products, although the representativeness of the atoll gauges of open-ocean rainfall is still in question...|$|E
40|$|The Source Physics Experiment (SPE-N) was {{designed}} to provide a carefully controlled seismic and strong motion data set from buried explosions at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). The first experiment in a series (SPE 1) was conducted in May of this year. It consisted of a 100 kg high explosive stemmed for coupling at 180 feet below the surface. In preparation for this experiment, predictive hydrodynamic calculations were performed, strong ground motion free-field and <b>surface</b> <b>gauges</b> were fielded, and a dense network of seismometers and some complimentary infrasound sensors were deployed. The data return for a majority of these sensors was excellent. This paper reports on a finite element analysis of the observable effects of an explosion in realistic earth material with particular focus on predicted and observed strong ground motion patterns. The model correctly incorporates the near-field cavity dynamics, energy deposition partitioned into internal (heat and plastic strain) and kinetic (e. g., radiated seismic) energy, giving more confidence in predicted free-field displacement/velocities and measured attenuation of the free-field peak velocity with distance. The degree of source asymmetry is studied with predictions of the hydrodynamic calculations for close-in free-field particle velocities. We present progress in improving our near-source modeling and predictive capabilities. A number of material test are presented on the granodiorite for both intact and weathered/damaged rock samples.
