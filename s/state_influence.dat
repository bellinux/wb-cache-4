2500|$|The {{prospect}} of greater <b>state</b> <b>influence</b> {{in matters of}} race worried numerous advocates of civil equality, including Supreme Court Justice John Harlan, who wrote in his dissent of the Plessy decision, [...] "we shall enter upon an era of constitutional law, when the rights of freedom and American citizenship cannot receive from the nation that efficient protection which heretofore was unhesitatingly accorded to slavery {{and the rights of}} the master." [...] Harlan's concerns about the encroachment on the 14th Amendment would prove well-founded; states proceeded to institute segregation-based laws that became known as the Jim Crow system. In addition, from 1890 to 1908, Southern states passed new or amended constitutions including provisions that effectively disfranchised blacks and thousands of poor whites.|$|E

50|$|In paying professors {{better and}} {{improving}} their training, {{the quality of}} teaching in the Volksschules was improved. The newly founded gymnasia offered a humanist education to ready pupils for university studies. In parallel Realschules were set up to train men in manual trades.

50|$|That women's {{interests}} and gender interests are different categories is the discovery for which Maxine Molyneux is most frequently cited. Her focus is women's movements, and her central {{question is how}} they and the <b>state</b> <b>influence</b> each other. Interests and law are the categories under which she examines the changeable and shapeable relationship of the gender order and the state. She wants {{to bring back the}} state and the political subject into the thinking on modernisation, democratisation and development.|$|E
50|$|The VEG {{was founded}} in 1882 and was {{influenced}} by Methodism and the Revival Movement. It objected to liberal theology and <b>state</b> <b>influence</b> on the church, but rejected Reformed confessionalism. In 1993 ten congregations left the Free Evangelical Congregations, and returned to independency. It has a Faculty in Utrecht. The denomination began to collaborate with the Netherlands Reformed Congregations and the Dutch Reformed Church. The church had 37 congregations and 7,000 members in 2007.

5000|$|In 1877, the City of St. Louis {{separated}} from the county, creating an independent city. The city in August 1876 narrowly approved the separation while county residents overwhelmingly opposed the separation. City residents had argued {{they wanted to be}} [...] "rid of county taxes and <b>state</b> <b>influence</b> over county government." [...] At the time the city had 350,000 residents while the rural county had 30,000. The rural county also had only 150 miles of gravel roads. Although the results were challenged in the courts, the two jurisdictions were formally separated in March 1877.|$|E

5000|$|While the new {{constitutional}} amendments prevented governors from seeking a second consecutive term, Clement {{was allowed to}} run for a full four-year term in 1954. He was challenged in the primary by former Governor Browning, who accused Clement and his father of [...] "peddling" [...] <b>state</b> <b>influence.</b> [...] Several of Clement's close associates, among them his secretary of state, Eddie Friar, and comptroller, Jean Bodfish, turned against him. Browning was unable to match Clement's oratorical skills and fundraising capabilities, however, and lost the nomination, 481,808 votes to 195,156. [...] Clement easily defeated fringe candidate John R. Neal and other token opposition in the general election.|$|E
5000|$|Fridell {{argues that}} {{scholars}} call the period 1868-1945 the [...] "State Shinto period" [...] because, [...] "during these decades, Shinto elements came under {{a great deal}} of overt <b>state</b> <b>influence</b> and control as the Japanese government systematically utilized shrine worship as a major force for mobilizing imperial loyalties on behalf of modern nation-building." [...] However, the government had already been treating shrines as an extension of government before Meiji; see for example the Tenpō Reforms. Moreover, according to the scholar Jason Ānanda Josephson, It is inaccurate to describe shrines as constituting a [...] "state religion" [...] or a [...] "theocracy" [...] during this period since they had neither organization, nor doctrine, and were uninterested in conversion.|$|E
50|$|In 2015 and 2017, Garcia {{published}} articles in Science describing the first atomic-level visualizations of Notch signaling complexes. Garcia's group used directed evolution to strengthen low-affinity {{interactions between the}} receptor Notch1 and ligands Delta-like 4 (DLL4) and Jagged1 (Jag1) {{as a means of}} stabilizing the complexes for co-crystallization. Notch1-DLL4 and Notch1-Jag1 structures were determined by x-ray crystallography and revealed long, narrow binding interfaces assisted by multiple O-linked fucose and glucose modifications on Notch1. O-linked glycans are rarely observed at protein-protein interfaces, and their presence at the Notch-ligand interface explained how changes in glycosylation <b>state</b> <b>influence</b> Notch signaling activity. Garcia's 2017 publication also established that Notch-ligand interactions form catch bonds, and that Delta-like and Jagged ligands have different mechanical force thresholds for Notch receptor activation.|$|E

5000|$|The winning Allies of World War II {{determined}} that German radio after World War II would not broadcast the same propaganda as the pre-war Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft ("Reich Broadcasting Company"). A federal structure, the renunciation of <b>state</b> <b>influence</b> and {{the avoidance of}} economic dependence were {{to be the key}} of the radio and TV institutions under public law ( [...] , public radio and television organisations). The legal form of the new entity was Anstalt des öffentlichen Rechts ("Institution under Public Law"), a nongovernment and nonprofit organisation with its own administration under the control of two commissions, the Rundfunkrat (Broadcasting Council, responsible for the programmed content) and the Verwaltungsrat (Administration Council, responsible for management and infrastructure), in which different stakeholders from German public life were represented.|$|E
50|$|In his youth, Röpke {{was first}} {{inspired}} by socialism and afterwards by the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises. Despite this, the post-World War II economic liberation enabling Germany {{to once again}} lead Europe, which Röpke and his allies (Walter Eucken, Franz Böhm, Alfred Müller-Armack and Alexander Rüstow) were the intellectual muscle behind, occurred by implementing policy divergent to that advocated by Ludwig von Mises. Though the two men shared some beliefs in certain areas, Röpke & co. instead formed the school of ordoliberalism and advocated free trade but with more central bank and <b>state</b> <b>influence</b> than what Austrian School economists suggest is required. Unlike many mainstream Austrian School economists, Röpke and the ordoliberalists conceded that the market economy can be more disruptive and inhumane unless intervention is permitted a role to play.|$|E
