Eichelberger did, however, receive the Japanese Imperial Order of Meiji, Order of the Sacred Treasure and Order of the Rising Sun. Siberia gave Eichelberger a chance to observe the Japanese Army at first hand, and he was impressed by what he <b>saw</b> <b>of</b> their training and discipline.

5|$|The {{following}} season, Loxton's {{record was}} less spectacular despite playing {{in all but}} one of Victoria’s matches. He hit 77 and 35 not out in the opening match of the summer against the Indian tourists, and was rewarded with selection in an Australian XI to play the visitors ahead of the Tests. In what was effectively a Test trial, the uncapped all-rounder failed to impress with the bat, making a duck and six. He bowled extensively, sending down 47 overs and taking a total of 4/113 as the Australians fell to a defeat. Loxton was passed over for Test selection and returned to domestic competition, scoring 53 and taking a total of 4/56 in the next match against New South Wales, which the Victorians won by nine wickets. He then went into an unproductive sequence, failing to pass 31 and taking only three wickets in his next four matches over a two-month period. His seven wickets in the Sheffield Shield games cost almost 49 runs each. Despite this, the Australian captain Don Bradman had been impressed by what he <b>saw</b> <b>of</b> Loxton at domestic level, and the Victorian all-rounder was chosen for the Fifth and final Test against India. With the series already convincingly won 3–0, Australia decided to rest several players in order to trial up and coming cricketers ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Len Johnson, Loxton and fellow Victorian Ring were thus given their Test debuts.|$|E

The theoretical results include {{the study and}} determination {{of the influence of}} technological and tool factors on the power, energy and qualitative characteristics of the process <b>of</b> <b>sawing</b> <b>of</b> wood particle boards by circular saws; specification of the peculiar dependences of the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>sawing</b> conditions on the geometry <b>of</b> the <b>saw</b> teeth; development <b>of</b> a mathematical model for <b>sawing</b> <b>of</b> wood particle boards by the circular saws. The work substantiates the rational parameters <b>of</b> circular <b>saw</b> teeth and the conditions <b>of</b> <b>sawing</b> <b>of</b> wood particle boards which provide for lower power consumption and for a high quality <b>of</b> the <b>sawn</b> surface. The rational parameters are substantiated for the circular saws and for the conditions <b>of</b> <b>sawing</b> <b>of</b> wood particle boards by the circular <b>saws.</b> The use <b>of</b> the improved circular saws and sawing conditions makes it possible to decrease the extent of chipping of the edges of wood particle boards, to reduce power consumption in sawing and to prolong the durability of toolsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Energy {{plays an}} {{important}} role nearly in all types of machining processes. This paper is concentrated on the variation of the power consumed by the spindle motor during the <b>sawing</b> <b>of</b> granite under a wide range of processing parameters. Specific energy, which is the energy expended in removing a unit volume of material, was then obtained based on the measured power. The influence of processing parameters on power and specific energy were investigated quantitatively. Similar to the findings of a recent work on energy in the <b>sawing</b> <b>of</b> gray granite, a good relation between the consumed power per unit width and the plowed surface area generated per unit time per unit width was also found for the <b>sawing</b> <b>of</b> red granite. The conclusions presented in this paper can serve as a useful guideline for the selection of optimal machining parameters in circular <b>sawing</b> <b>of</b> granites...|$|R

40|$|During sawing, {{under the}} {{influence}} of different forces and saw speeds close to critical, resonance vibrations occur. Seeking to increase the stability <b>of</b> <b>saw,</b> it is important to estimate saw bend form, the vibration amplitude and vibration damping time (coefficient of damping). Having estimated vibration damping time, it is also possible to forecast the change of kerf size in time. The paper presents study results of four 9 XФ circular steel <b>saws</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal <b>sawing,</b> the diameters <b>of</b> which are 400, 500, 800 and 1000 mm, as well as five 9 XФ circular steel <b>saws</b> <b>of</b> transverse <b>sawing,</b> the diameter <b>of</b> which is 400 mm. Amplitude-frequency characteristics, resonance frequencies and saw bend forms (modes) were ascertained. The variation of coefficient of damping within frequency range and its distribution in the points <b>of</b> <b>saw</b> plane were estimated. The variation <b>of</b> <b>saw</b> thickness was estimated within 0. 12 mm – 0. 25 mm, while surface hardness within 7 HRC – 10 HRC range respectively. The coefficient of damping as well as the relationship between saw surface hardness and thickness were evaluated. It was found, that the coefficient of damping is inversely proportional to the variation of surface hardness <b>of</b> <b>saw</b> material. Estimating the ratio between saw thickness and surface hardness, it was found, that the value of coefficient of damping is preconditioned by surface hardness...|$|R
