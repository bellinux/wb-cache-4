One of the possible ways to mitigate seismic risk is predicting an impending earthquake through various kinds of seismic precursors observations. The first seismic precursors project in Taiwan started in 1978. The temporal variation in b-value prior to a forthcoming earthquake has been considered a significant seismic precursor for earthquake prediction. In this review study, we focus on the studies of b-values of earthquakes in Taiwan, including the spatial distribution of b-values, temporal variation in b-values, correlation between the b-value and fractal dimension, and correlation between the b- and p-value of Omori law for aftershocks. Also included is the relation between the spatial distribution of b-values and regional geotectonics.

40|$|Abstract: Being fallen {{the entire}} North Eastern states of India in the Zone –V, the most seismic hazard zone (BIS- 2002) {{and due to}} Geo- climatic condition, {{it is obvious that}} the region is highly prone to {{multiple}} natural disasters. Among these, the earthquake is the most destructive one causing huge loss of life and property. Earthquakes pose a real threat to India with 55 % of its geographical area vulnerable to seismic disturbance. Many earthquakes occurred in the past and recently had shown that major damages to the structures took place in the absence of proper design, construction and quality control. The bye law and BIS Specification were not strictly followed in many structures and suffer damages in the earthquakes. North East India is seismically one of the six most active regions of the World, the other five being Mexico, Taiwan, California, Japan and Turkey. In the recent past there were at least 17 major earthquakes with more than M 7 during the period from 1869 to 1988. Study of the Northeastern Indian’s earthquakes history and findings of <b>seismological</b> <b>researches,</b> the region is now due for a large major earthquake, which is expected in the region between the epicentre of Shillong earthquake, M- 8. 7 of 1897 and Patkai Range & Arunachal Pradesh, M- 7 of 1950 in the near future. Earthquake hazards of North East India cannot be changed, however disaster can be mitigated. The most important steps for mitigation of hazard is the building up of capacity in Civil Engineering and Architectural Professionals for ensuring earthquake resistant constructions. Concerning the existing buildings and structures retrofitting is one of the most important options for mitigation of disaster as most of the destructions/ damages are caused due to the collapse of structure...|$|R

40|$|Both <b>seismological</b> and geodynamic <b>research</b> {{emphasize}} that the Aegean Region, which comprises the Hellenic Arc, the Greek mainland and Western Turkey is the most seismically active region in Western Eurasia. The convergence of the Eurasian and African lithospheric plates forces a westward motion on the Anatolian plate relative to the Eurasian one. Western Anatolia is a valuable laboratory for Earth Science research because of its complex geological structure. Izmir is a large city in Turkey {{with a population of}} about 2. 5 million that is at great risk from big earthquakes. Unfortunately, previous geodynamics studies performed in this region are insufficient or cover large areas instead of specific faults. The Tuzla Fault, which is aligned trending NEÃ¢Â€Â“SW between the town of Menderes and Cape Doganbey, is an important fault in terms of seismic activity and its proximity to the city of Izmir. This study aims to perform a large scale investigation focusing on the Tuzla Fault and its vicinity for better understanding of the region's tectonics. In order to investigate the crustal deformation along the Tuzla Fault and Izmir Bay, a geodetic network has been designed and optimizations were performed. This paper suggests a schedule for a crustal deformation monitoring study which includes research on the tectonics of the region, network design and optimization strategies, theory and practice of processing. The study is also open for extension in terms of monitoring different types of fault characteristics.

50|$|The {{discovery}} of LFEs originates in Japan at the Nankai trough {{and is in}} part due to the nationwide collaboration of <b>seismological</b> <b>research</b> following the Kobe earthquake of 1995. Low frequency earthquakes in Japan were first observed in a subduction setting where the Philippine Sea plate subducts at the Nankai trough near Shikoku. The low-frequency continuous tremor researchers observed was initially interpreted to be a result of dehydration reactions in the subducting plate. The source of these tremors occurred at an average depth of around 30 kilometers, and they were distributed along the strike of the subduction interface over a length of 600 kilometers. Similar to Cascadia, these low frequency tremors occurred with slow slip events that had a recurrence interval of approximately 6 months. The later {{discovery of}} LFEs forming tremor confirmed the widespread existence of LFEs at Japanese subduction zones, and presently LFEs are widely observed to occur as a result of SSEs.|$|E

40|$|In this volume, seven highly {{respected}} seismologists attempt to summarize <b>seismological</b> <b>research</b> in the U. S. {{in the past}} four years. This is indeed a daunting task; the mere compilation and classification of the overwhelming volume of new seismological literature is difficult enough, but to confidently provide an overview of our new knowledge and understanding is almost impossible. Although the study of vibrations in the Earth (that is, seismology) may at first seem to be a scientific field of limited scope, it encompasses a vast range of observations and problems in mathematical physics. Seismologists currently study waves varying in frequencies from 10 ^ 2 Hz to 10 ^(- 4) Hz (20 octaves) and in acceleration amplitudes from 1 g to 10 ^(- 12) g (240 dB). These waves are observed at a wide variety of distances as they travel through a very complex medium, the interior of the Earth. Furthermore the waves are excited by numerous and often complex mechanisms, including earthquakes, man-made explosions, landslides, volcanoes, and atmospheric disturbances. Seismologists study waves from earthquakes that range in energy over 15 orders of magnitude. These waves are studied to reveal the physical properties of the Earth, the kinematics and dynamics of Earth deformation, the characteristics of destructive earthquakes and volcanoes, and the occurrence of man-made explosions. When viewed from this perspective, it is little wonder that any individual seismologist can feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of <b>seismological</b> <b>research</b> {{in the past four}} years. Several thousand seismological papers were published in the past four years; Langston (this issue) alone lists 800 papers pertaining to wave propagation problems.
