25|$|The {{technology}} for Sirius Satellite Radio receivers {{as well as}} some of the uplink equipment, and the studio encoder, originated at Bell Labs in the late 1990s and subsequent years. The studio encoder was a result of Bell Labs efforts in <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexing</b> of perceptual audio coded signals, a cousin of the MP3 standards. The waveform design for the terrestrial and satellite signals, as well as the early prototype receivers, were implemented in a FPGA logic and tested in the field to verify the performance of the receivers. This work was contracted by Sirius to Lucent Technologies, at the time a spinoff of AT Early prototypes were followed by a number of generations of ASIC custom designed chipsets, supplied at first by Agere Systems and later supplied by Agere Systems and their competitor ST microelectronics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>multiplexing</b> {{is a type}} of {{communication}} link sharing, very similar to dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA). In <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexing,</b> a communication channel is divided into an arbitrary number of variable bitrate digital channels or data streams. The link sharing is adapted to the instantaneous traffic demands of the data streams that are transferred over each channel. This is an alternative to creating a fixed sharing of a link, such as in general time division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM). When performed correctly, <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexing</b> can provide a link utilization improvement, called the <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexing</b> gain.|$|E

40|$|Migrating {{users in}} a {{wireless}} multicast network {{may need to}} recover lost data during handoffs before they can merge into the respective multicast groups in the new cell. The multicast groups in packet switched wireless networks typically share resources on a <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexed</b> basis. To minimize impact on other users, we allow part of a multicast group's assigned bandwidth to be shared by the handoff users for transient data recovery using the proposed Weighted Fair Share (WFS) method with optimal weight selection. Handoff users are admitted into the new cell using the proposed Multicast Connection Admission Control (MCAC) scheme. These schemes constitute the Fair and Efficient Wireless Multicast resource management Scheme (FEWMS) presented in this paper. Under FEWMS, the migrating user can quickly recover lost data and merge into the existing multicast group during a handoff. Simulations using self-similar traffic sources show that the proposed method reduces the handoff failure probability of migrating users and increases the overall system throughput compared to existing proposals...|$|R

30|$|Generally, {{there have}} been two QoS models for the Internet {{suggested}} by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), i.e., Integrated Services (IntServ) and Differentiated Services (DiffServ). Research activities mainly focus on distributed scheduling schemes to provision QoS for multi-hop wireless networks. CSDPS + CBQ [26] categorizes traffic flows into classes. Each class is mapped into a physical queue, which is committed {{with a certain amount of}} bandwidth. This algorithm enables fair sharing of bandwidth resources while trying to maintain high throughput. However, it is unable to guarantee delay bound and packet dropping rates. Weighted fair queuing (WFQ) applies different scheduling priorities for <b>statistical</b> flow <b>multiplexing.</b> WFQ is proven to be able to guarantee the end-to-end delay bound when the data flow is leaky bucket constrained in wireline networks [27]. Early-deadline-first (EDF), which is able to separate the delay and throughput guarantee of a flow [28], is a dynamic priority scheduling algorithm that always schedules the packet with the earliest deadline. A coordinated EDF scheduler combined with wireless link scheduling is proposed in [29] to minimize the end-to-end delay in wireless networks.|$|R
50|$|Another form is {{frequency}}-hopping (FH-CDMA), {{where the}} channel frequency is changing very rapidly {{according to a}} sequence that constitutes the spreading code.

All nodes belonging to the same user (to the same virtual private area network or piconet) use the same frequency hopping sequence synchronously, meaning that they send on the same frequency channel, but CDMA/CA or TDMA is used to avoid collisions within the VPAN. Frequency-hopping is used to reduce the cross-talk and collision probability between nodes in different VPANs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the <b>statistical</b> characteristics and <b>multiplexing</b> of Variable-Bit-Rate (VBR) MPEG-coded video streams. Our results are based on 23 minutes of video obtained from the entertainment movie, The Wizard of Oz. The experimental setup which was used to capture, digitize, and compress the video stream is described. Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level), it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly affected by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream. The number of cells per frame is fitted by a lognormal distribution. Simulations are used to study the performance of an ATM multiplexer for MPEG streams. 1 Introduction Video traffic is expected to comprise th [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Multiplexing {{is a way}} of {{accommodating}} many input {{sources of}} a low capacity over a high capacity outgoing channel. <b>Statistical</b> Time Division <b>Multiplexing</b> (STDM) is a technique that allows the number of users to be multiplexed over the channel more than the channel can afford. The STDM normally exploits unused time slots by the non-active users and allocates those slots for the active users. Therefore STDM is appropriate for bursty sources. In this way STDM normally utilizes channel bandwidth better than traditional Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). In this work, the statistical multiplexer is viewed as M/M/ 1 queuing system and the performance is measured by comparing analytical results to simulation results using Matlab. The index used to determine the performance of the statistical multiplexer is the number of packets both in the system and the queue. Comparison of analytical results was also done between M/M/ 1 and M/M/ 2 and also between M/M/ 1 and M/D/ 1 queue systems. At high utilizations, M/M/ 2 performs better than M/M/ 1.
