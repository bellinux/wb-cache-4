5|$|Basil cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} basil. They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or <b>sweet</b> <b>basil.</b> Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} algae {{has been}} used to increase lipid production or growth rates. Current research in genetic engineering includes either the introduction or removal of enzymes. In 2007 Oswald et al. introduced a monoterpene synthase from <b>sweet</b> <b>basil</b> into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a strain of yeast. This particular monoterpene synthase causes the de novo synthesis of large amounts of geraniol, while also secreting it into the medium. Geraniol is a primary component in rose oil, palmarosa oil, and citronella oil as well as essential oils, making it a viable source of triacylglycerides for biodiesel production.|$|E

40|$|Long-term manned space {{flights to}} Mars require the {{development}} of an advanced life support (ALS) ecosystem including efficient food crop production, processing and recycling waste products thereof. Using edible white rot fungi (EWRF) to achieve effective biomass transformation in ALS requires optimal and rapid biodegradative activity on lignocellulosic wastes. We investigated the mycelial growth of Lentinula edodes and Pleurotus ostreatus on processed residues of various crops under various cropping patterns. In single cropping, mycelial growth and fruiting in all strains were significantly repressed on <b>sweet</b> potato and <b>basil.</b> However, growth of the strains was improved when <b>sweet</b> potato and <b>basil</b> residues were paired with rice or wheat straw. Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus) strains were better than shiitake (L. edodes) strains under single, paired, and mixed cropping patterns. Mixed cropping further eliminated the inherent inhibitory effect of <b>sweet</b> potato, <b>basil,</b> or lettuce on fungal growth. Co-cropping fungal species had a synergistic effect on rate of fungal growth, substrate colonization, and fruiting. Use of efficient cropping methods may enhance fungal growth, fruiting, biodegradation of crop residues, and efficiency of biomass recycling...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of Ocimum basilicum, {{as well as}} several related species or species hybrids also called basil. The type used in Italian food is typically called <b>sweet</b> <b>basil</b> (or Genovese basil), as opposed to Thai basil (O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora), lemon basil (O. × citriodorum), and holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum), which are used in Asia. While most common varieties of basil are treated as annuals, some are perennial in warm, tropical climates, including holy basil and a cultivar known as [...] "African blue basil".|$|E
2500|$|The various basils {{have such}} {{different}} scents because the herb {{has a number}} of different essential oils that come together in different proportions for various breeds. The strong clove scent of <b>sweet</b> <b>basil</b> is derived from eugenol, the same chemical as actual cloves. The citrus scent of lemon basil and lime basil reflects their higher portion of citral, which causes this effect in several plants including lemon mint, and of limonene, which gives actual lemon peel its scent. African blue basil has a strong camphor smell because it contains camphor and camphene in higher proportions. Licorice basil contains anethole, the same chemical that makes anise smell like licorice, and in fact is sometimes called [...] "anise basil." ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{sulphide}} (H 2 S) gas {{has been}} found to delay the appearance of many characteristics associated with senescence of horticultural produce but little attention has been given to its physiological role or its interaction with ethylene. This study used the green leafy vegetable, pak choy (Brassica rapa subsp. Chinensis) as the principal test commodity and examined the interaction of fumigation with hydrogen sulphide and storage at 10 °C in the presence of controlled levels of ethylene on endogenous ethylene production and a range of factors associated with postharvest deterioration. It was found that hydrogen sulphide inhibited ethylene production, chlorophyll loss, respiration, weight loss, various antioxidant factors and ion leakage. Hydrogen sulphide also inhibited chlorophyll loss and respiration of other green leafy vegetables/herbs, <b>sweet</b> Italian <b>basil</b> (Ocimum basilicum) and green curly kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica). The results suggest that the mode of action of hydrogen sulphide in delaying senescence could be by inhibiting both the production of ethylene and the action of ethylene. The substantial reduction in the rate of loss of chlorophyll following short-term treatment with hydrogen sulphide may have potential commercial benefit for extension in market life of green leafy vegetables...|$|R
60|$|The boat swiftly {{ascended the}} current, and {{presently}} the steeper shores {{were left behind}} and the banks fell away in long upward sloping fields, with farm-houses and with stacks of harvest dimly visible in the generous expanses. By and by they passed a fisherman drawing his nets, and bending from his boat, there near Albany, N. Y., in the picturesque immortal attitudes of Raphael's Galilean fisherman; and now a flush mounted the pale face of the east, and through the dewy coolness of the dawn there came, more to the sight than any other sense, a vague menace of heat. But as yet the air was deliciously fresh and <b>sweet,</b> and <b>Basil</b> bathed his weariness in it, thinking with a certain luxurious compassion of the scalded man, {{and how he was}} to fare that day. This poor wretch seemed of another order of beings, as the calamitous always seem to the happy, and Basil's pity was quite an abstraction; which, again, amused and shocked him, and he asked his heart of bliss to consider of sorrow a little more earnestly as the lot of all men, and not merely of an alien creature here and there. He dutifully tried to imagine another issue to the disaster of the night, and to realize himself suddenly bereft of her who so filled his life. He bade his soul remember that, in the security of sleep, Death had passed them both so close that his presence might well have chilled their dreams, as the iceberg that grazes the ship in the night freezes all the air about it. But it was quite idle: where love was, life only was; and sense and spirit alike put aside the burden that he would have laid upon them; his revery reflected with delicious caprice the looks, the tones, the movements that he loved, and bore him far away from the sad images that he had invited to mirror themselves in it.|$|R

In his turn, the old man was delighted to find in the clergyman a fellow-enthusiast in the forbidden ways of science; and as the student was no less charmed to discover in the 'yarb doctor' a scholar who could sympathise with him and understand his yearnings after the invisible, late as was the hour, the pair adjourned to Abraham's cottage. The visitor did not emerge until the labourers were going to their toil, the time having been spent in conversation upon the powers exercised by the planets upon plants and men, the old man growing eloquent as to the wonderful virtue of the Bay Tree, which, he said, could resist all the evil Saturn could do to the human body, and in the neighbourhood of which neither wizard nor devil, thunder or lightning, could hurt man; of Moonwort, with the leaves of which locks might be opened, and the shoes be removed from horses' feet; of Celandine, with which, if a young swallow loseth an eye, the parent birds will renew it; of Hound's Tongue, a leaf of which laid under the foot will save the bearer from the attacks of dogs; of Bugloss, the leaf of which maketh man poison-proof; of <b>Sweet</b> <b>Basil,</b> from which (quoting Miraldus) venomous beasts spring--the man who smelleth it having a scorpion bred in his brain; and of a score of other herbs under the dominion of the Moon and Cancer, and of the cures wrought by them through antipathy to Saturn.|$|E

Crude and filtered extracts of the plants were prepared by using water and tested on the pathogenic bacteria by agar diffusion method. All the spices and condiments showed varying antibacterial effects. Garlic was most effective; its extracts inhibited the growth of all the tested microbes with zones of inhibition ranging from 2 to 10 mm. Onion’s extracts killed Kl. pneumoniae, Strep. faecalis and E. coli. The onion’s crude extract bacteriostatically prevented Coryne. diphtheriae and Ps. aeruginosa from growing. It was observed that all the tested organisms except Kl. pneumoniae and Strep. faecalis did not grow in the presence of ginger. Also, filtered extract of the ginger did not inhibit the growth of the E. coli. Basil did not stop the growth of the organisms except Strep. faecalis. Extracts of sweet and hot peppers appeared inhibitory although crude extract of the former plant did not prevent the growth of Kl. pneumoniae. Boiled sweet pepper extract did not stop Coryne. diphtheriae from growing.

40|$|Basil {{is a very}} {{important}} medicinal plant and culinary spice, and is marketed fresh, dried or frozen. In crop nutrition, nitrogen is essential for plant growth and as a macro-element, is part of the proteins’ structure and participates in the metabolic processes involved in the synthesis and energy transfer. It has been shown that a balance between ammonium and nitrate favors plant growth and that the degree of benefit varies among crops. This study was conducted to evaluate the growth of two varieties of basil in function of four nutrient solutions containing different NH 4 + /NO 3 - ratios. Results showed that different variety response differently to nutrient solution. Although the highest yield in both varieties (sweet and purple) was obtained when fed by nutrient solution without ammonium but their response on quality indices were different due to nitrate ammonium ratio in nutrient solutions. The highest total phenol content of <b>sweet</b> and purple <b>basil</b> was 92 and 100 mg gallic acid equivalent per gram of dry weight respectively, while the highest antioxidant capacity was obtained in purple variety grown in nutrient solution 2  (NH 4 + : 1 /NO 3 : 4) and the lowest value were related to sweet variety with the same nutrient solution. Moderate content of total nitrogen can be suitable for sweet variety while for purple variety nutrient solution with low amount of ammonium can be more suitable...|$|R
