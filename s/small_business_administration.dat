5|$|Mississippi Governor William Allain sent 500 {{members of}} the National Guard to partner with 200 law {{enforcement}} officers along Mississippi's coast in minimizing crime, and nighttime curfews were established in several cities. On September 4, President Reagan declared Mississippi's coastal counties a Major Disaster area. The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated {{that as many as}} 3,000 homes in the state were uninhabitable, their occupants forced to find temporary living arrangements. The <b>Small</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Administration</b> approved special loans up to $500,000 for owners of damaged businesses. Mississippi Power Company's system was the hardest-hit, and restoration of service was slow; 50,000 of 80,000 customers were still without electricity by September 5.|$|E
5|$|Power {{companies}} from several states sent workers {{to help restore}} service to the hardest-hit areas of the Gulf Coast. Most of Alabama Power's affected customers had power within 24 hours of the storm, though restoration of service to Dauphin Island took significantly longer. Power was fully restored to Central Louisiana Electric customers by September 4. Alabama's two coastal counties were declared federal disaster areas on September 7. Special loan assistance was made available by the <b>Small</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Administration</b> and the Farmers Home Administration, the latter of which sought to help commercial growers who lost their crops to the storm.|$|E
5|$|While {{none of the}} {{affected}} counties or cities {{declared a state of}} emergency following the event, the <b>Small</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Administration</b> did approve a request by the Office of Emergency Services for a disaster declaration in late September. This formality paved the way for low interest loans for commercial or residential properties that suffered damage, but only about 50 claims were expected. Local authorities had trained for disasters on a regular basis, and the response to the light damage was considered smooth, though some officials sought room for improvement. Discussions followed the event, with local governments focusing on telecommunication problems, emergency power systems, and seismic safety.|$|E

5|$|While passing about 80km (50mi) of Saipan, Joan {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} 157km/h (98mph), {{strong enough to}} destroy 37homes and damage the roofs of several other houses.

The passage of Joan left the entire island of Saipan without power, although electrical crews quickly worked to restore the outages. During the storm's passage, about 900people stayed in shelters, after the government opened six schools for residents. In nearby Anatahan, Joan left heavy damage to boats, machinery, and public buildings. The typhoon damaged various crops, and monetary damage was estimated at $200,000 (1997USD).

Widespread areas were without power for days, and in some areas {{for up to a}} week, until crews could repair downed lines. Spoiled food due to lack of refrigeration resulted in about $1million in losses. Power crews from elsewhere in the United States arrived to assist in the restoration. Workers quickly removed trees from highways. Damaged factories in Rhode Island prevented employees from working for three weeks after the storm. The steeple of the Old North Church in Boston was rebuilt in 1955, after residents throughout the country provided $150,000 in donations. Governor of Maine Burton M.
