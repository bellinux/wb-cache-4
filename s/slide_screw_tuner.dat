A 20 % sample of Part A and B entitled Medicare beneficiaries 65  years or older was used to generate a cohort of patients who sustained intertrochanteric femur fractures between 1999 and 2001.

All remaining fractures healed uneventfully without any reported instances of infection, pseudoarthrosis, or implant failures.

30|$|The {{treatment}} of proximal femoral fractures using fixed angled implants was succeeded by <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> devices which produced {{an improvement in}} union rates and fewer fixation and implant failures [12, 15]. A meta-analysis of 14 studies with 3, 069 patients showed {{an increased risk of}} cut-out (13 % vs. 4 %), non-union (2 vs. 0.5 %), implant breakage (14 vs. 0.7 %) and re-operation (10 vs. 4 %) for fixed nail plates in comparison with the sliding implants [8]. In addition patients treated with fixed nail plates had a higher mortality rate and survivors more likely to have residual hip pain and impaired mobility. For the past 3 decades the use of <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> implants for the fixation of proximal femoral fractures has been almost universal. Two main designs are popular; an extramedullary device (e.g., the Dynamic Hip Screw, DHS) and an intramedullary device (the Gamma nail and equivalent cephalo-medullary constructs). Both types achieve fixation in the femoral head with one or two <b>sliding</b> <b>screws.</b> Extensive clinical investigation has failed to show that either type of device is superior although there is the suggestion that intramedullary devices may be biomechanically more stable [2, 3, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{modeling}} of the contact conditions associated with cylindrical, prismatic, and screw joints in flexible multi-body systems. In the classical formulation these joints are developed for rigid bodies, and kinematic constraints are enforced between the kinematic variables of the two bodies. These constraints express the conditions for relative translation and rotation of the two bodies along and about a body fixed axis, and imply the relative sliding and rotation of the two bodies which remain in constant contact with each other. However, these kinematic constraints no longer imply relative sliding with contact {{when one of the}} bodies is flexible. To remedy this situation, a sliding joint and a <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> joint are proposed that involves kinematic constraints at the instantaneous point of contact between the sliding bodies. For <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> joints, additional constraints are added on the relative rotation of the contacting bodies. Various numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the dramatically different behavior of cylindrical, prismatic, or screw joints and of the proposed <b>sliding</b> and <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> joints in the presence of elastic bodies, and the usefulness of these constraint elements in the modeling of complex mechanical systems. © 2000 The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the outcome of}} treatment for minimally displaced femoral neck fractures using multiple threaded pins versus <b>sliding</b> compression <b>screws</b> for internal fixation. METHODS: The medical records of 62 consecutive elderly patients with minimally displaced intra-capsular femoral neck fractures who underwent internal fixation of the fracture (37 with multiple threaded pins, and 25 with <b>sliding</b> compression <b>screws)</b> were reviewed. Clinical and radiological assessment of fracture healing at follow-up visits were noted. RESULTS: In the 55 patients seen for follow-up at 3 months, 21. 9 % (n= 7) of those treated by pinning demonstrated non-union of the fracture, and 0 % of fractures treated with <b>sliding</b> compression <b>screws</b> (p= 0. 02). 46 patients were seen for follow-up at one year, with 10 % (n= 2) of those treated with <b>sliding</b> compression <b>screws</b> found to have osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The 2 fractures in the group treated by pinning demonstrating non-union at 3 months failed to unite by one year (p= 0. 11). 34 patients were seen for follow-up for at least 2 years, with no additional complications noted. CONCLUSION: Using <b>sliding</b> compression <b>screws</b> to treat minimally displaced femoral neck fractures can achieve a higher union rate than using pinning. The reason may be the better stability in the osteoporotic bone. However, osteonecrosis of the femoral head may occur with use of <b>sliding</b> compression <b>screws</b> because of greater intramedullary vascular damage {{as a result of}} wider reaming...|$|R

30|$|The {{incidence}} of hip fractures continues to rise. This {{study is the}} first evaluation of a new intramedullary implant, the Veronail, that provides double axis fixation into the femoral head and allows the surgeon to choose whether to use sliding or fixed locked proximal screw fixation for trochanteric femoral fractures. The fractures were classified according to the AO classification, and function was assessed with the Modified Harris Hip Score. 111 patients with trochanteric fractures were evaluated in eight Italian hospitals. The stable 31.A 1 fractures were treated with <b>sliding</b> proximal <b>screws,</b> the subtrochanteric 31.A 3 fractures with converging proximal screws, and the unstable 31.A 2 fractures were treated with both types of proximal fixation. The unstable fractures treated with locked converging screws had the same function at one year as those treated with <b>sliding</b> <b>screws.</b> This study suggests a possible new method of treating unstable trochanteric femoral fractures. This may be the solution to prevent excessive collapse of the fracture with the resultant poor function and persisting pain noted in the literature.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the accuracy of}} lag screw placement between extracapsular femoral fractures fixed with <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> plate systems and those fixed with cephalocondylic nails. It involved 75 retrospective radiographs of fractures fixed with either a cephalocondylic nail (32) or a <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> plate system (43). Postoperative anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the hip were scanned using a digital X-ray scanner and measured using computer software. Measurements were conducted by two independent observers, and the radiographs were calibrated to correct for magnification. Accuracy of lag screw placement was determined by “tip apex distance,” described by Baumgaertner et al., and by the ratio method described by Parker. The mean tip apex distance was 24. 0  mm in <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> plate systems and 21. 1  mm in cephalocondylic nails. This {{was found to be}} statistically significant. Lag screw placement through cephalocondylic nails is more accurate and therefore has less chance of cut-out compared with <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> plate systems.

Methods For this international, multicentre, allocation concealed randomised controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 50 years or older with a low-energy hip fracture requiring fracture fixation from 81 clinical centres in eight countries. Patients were assigned by minimisation with a centralised computer system to receive a single large-diameter screw with a side-plate (<b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw)</b> or the present standard of care, multiple small-diameter cancellous screws. Surgeons and patients were not blinded but the data analyst, while doing the analyses, remained blinded to treatment groups.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Intertrochanteric {{fractures}} (ITF) are {{of intense}} interest globally. These fractures {{are most frequently}} operated type having the highest postoperative fatality rates and hence have become a serious health resource issue. AIM: The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the risk factors and their effect on the outcome of intertrochanteric fractures treated by <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> fixation. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a retrospective and prospective observational study of all the intertrochanteric fractures treated by <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> fixation at our institute between January 2013 to August 2015. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 78 intertrochanteric fractures have met the inclusion criteria proposed for the study. Preoperative and intraoperative risk factors were assessed for all the cases and treated by <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw.</b> The Radiological outcome was assessed after a minimum follow-up of 3 months for all the cases. RESULTS: When comparing all the preoperative and intraoperative variables independently with the outcome, P value was found to be statistically significant only in displacement, reverse obliquity, inadequate lateral wall thickness, and reduction. We devised a scoring system to assess the risk outcome in the treatment of trochanteric fractures based on local fracture factors. Least score of zero and a maximum score of eight was seen in the study participants.

30|$|In this {{prospective}} multi-centre study, {{the authors}} investigated {{the ease of}} use, post-operative results and complication rate of a new intramedullary device, the Veronail Trochanteric System, for pertrochanteric fractures of the proximal femur.

This design allows the surgeon to select, depending {{on the degree of}} stability present once the fracture is reduced, the configuration of screws to use. It was hypothesized that the full range of pertrochanteric fractures could be treated satisfactorily with an intramedullary device that offers either a double-axis sliding or locked converging pattern of screws into the femoral neck.|$|R

40|$|Background: Both {{intramedullary}} {{nails and}} <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screws</b> are used with good {{results in the}} treatment of intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The aim of our study was to assess whether use of the TRIGEN INTERTAN nail, as compared with a <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw,</b> resulted in less postoperative pain, improved functional mobility, and reduced surgical complication rates for patients with an intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture. Methods: In a prospective, randomized multicenter study, 684 elderly patients were treated with the INTERTAN nail or with a <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> with or without a trochanteric stabilizing plate. The patients were assessed during their hospital stay and at three and twelve months postoperatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score was recorded at all time points, and functional mobility was assessed with use of the timed Up & Go test. The Harris hip score (HHS) was used to assess hip function more specifically. Quality of life was measured with the EuroQol- 5 D (EQ- 5 D). Radiographic findings as well as intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. Results: Patients treated with an INTERTAN nail had slightly less pain at the time of early postoperative mobilization (VAS score, 48 versus 52; p = 0. 042), although this did not influence the length of the hospital stay and there was no difference at three or twelve months. Regardless of the fracture and implant type, functional mobility, hip function, patient satisfaction, and quality-of-life assessments were comparable between the groups at three and twelve months. The numbers of patients with surgical complications were similar for the two groups (twenty-nine in the sliding-hip-screw group and thirty-two in the INTERTAN group, p = 0. 67).

50|$|Dynamic hip <b>screw</b> (DHS) or <b>Sliding</b> <b>Screw</b> Fixation {{is a type}} of {{orthopaedic}} implant designed for fixation of certain types of hip fractures which allows controlled dynamic sliding of the femoral head component along the construct. One common use is internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur, which are common in older osteoporotic patients. There are 3 components of a dynamic hip screw, including a lag screw (inserted into the neck of the femur), a sideplate and four cortical screws (fixated into the proximal femoral shaft). The idea behind the dynamic compression is that the femoral head component is allowed to move along one plane; since bone responds to dynamic stresses, the native femur may undergo primary healing: cells join along boundaries, resulting in a robust joint requiring no remodeling.|$|R

Methods: An institutional review board-approved, prospective, randomized, single-blinded study was conducted at a level-I trauma center between July 2004 and September 2007. All patients who met the study criteria and provided informed consent were randomized to treatment with a <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> or percutaneous compression plate.

30|$|The {{treatment}} of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly osteopenic patients, {{especially those who}} cannot follow limited weight bearing instructions, is controversial. Recent publications indicate concern with excessive sliding of telescoping nail or <b>sliding</b> <b>screw</b> devices when used in these unstable intertrochanteric fractures. In our experience {{with the use of}} intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) in these fracture patterns, we have observed excessive sliding and collapse of the fracture in some patients. We modified the keyed centering sleeve by threading its internal distal third and substituted the compression screw with a custom bolt to obtain restricted sliding or rigid fixation depending on the gap between the lag screw and custom bolt. We used this modified system in static configuration to treat five patients who had an unstable intertrochanteric fracture of the femur. The length of the involved limb measured at the time of consolidation showed no shortening. In view of these results, intertrochanteric hip fractures that are unstable in patients with poor bone-stock can be fixed using the modified IMHS in a static or controlled sliding configuration.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The <b>Sliding</b> Hip <b>Screw</b> (SHS) is {{commonly}} used to treat trochanteric hip fractures. Fixation failure is a devastating complication requiring complex revision surgery. One mode of fixation failure is lag screw cut-out which is greatest in unstable fracture patterns and when the tip-apex distance of the lag screw is > 25 mm. The X-Bolt Dynamic Hip Plating System (X-Bolt Orthopaedics, Dublin, Ireland) is a new device which aims to reduce this risk of cut-out. However, some surgeons have reported difficulty minimising the tip-apex distance with subsequent concerns that this may lead to {{an increased risk of}} cut-out. Patients and Methods: We measured the tip-apex distance from the intra-operative radiographs of 93 unstable trochanteric hip fractures enrolled in a randomised controlled trial (Warwick Hip Trauma Evaluation, WHiTE One trial). Participants were treated with either the <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> or the X-Bolt dynamic hip plating system. We also recorded the incidence of cut-out in both groups, at a median follow-up time of 17 months. Results:There was a significantly increased tip-apex distance {{with the use of the}} X-Bolt (mean difference 3. 7 mm (95...|$|R
40|$|While {{the rate}} of failure {{following}} hip fracture surgery for extracapsular hip fractures in the elderly is low, an incidence of implant cutout from the femoral head remains regardless of whether fixation is by <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> or intramedullary nail. In general, a well-executed osteosynthesis is the best assurance of a good outcome with few complications, and typically a less than ideal placement of the implant in the femoral head {{is the reason for}} cut-out and failure of the operation. It is clear that there is no difference in the incidence of complications or functional outcome between a <b>sliding</b> hip <b>screw</b> and an intramedullary nail for pertrochanteric fractures (AO/OTA 31 -A 1 and A 2), while the implant of choice in the elderly for the true intertrochanteric fracture (AO/OTA 31 -A 3; reverse intertrochanteric) is a nail. However, what is less clear is whether there are newer ideas and/or implant designs that represent true advances in the treatment of extracapsular fractures in the elderly. The following review focuses on just this issue...|$|R
