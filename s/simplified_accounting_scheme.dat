40|$|We here {{present and}} {{evaluate}} an autonomous <b>accounting</b> <b>scheme</b> that provides accurate results {{even when the}} parties (consumer and provider) do not trust each other. Our <b>accounting</b> <b>scheme</b> relies on the observed relative performance among the parties. It is totally autonomous {{in the sense that}} it uses only local information, i. e. there is no exchange of information between the parties. This allows for the deployment of the autonomous accounting without requiring any sort of identification infrastructure, such as certificate authorities. The no need of trust or sophisticated infrastructure make our <b>accounting</b> <b>scheme</b> a perfect fit for peer-to-peer grids, which aim to scale much further than traditional grids by allowing free unidentified entry into the grid. Our results show that the proposed scheme performs very close to a perfect <b>accounting</b> <b>scheme</b> whose implementation is infeasible in most systems, including those we target. Although our autonomous <b>accounting</b> <b>scheme</b> was developed to work with OurGrid, it can also be useful for other systems. The basic requirement to use our <b>accounting</b> <b>scheme</b> is that resource consumers must also be resource providers...|$|R

Within peer-to-peer the proposed <b>accounting</b> <b>scheme</b> {{can be used to}} cope with the shortage of information. Therewith, it constitutes the basis for coordination and control mechanisms as well as pricing for commercial scenarios in completely decentralized systems...|$|R

40|$|Now in {{its second}} decade, Japan’s {{consumption}} tax remains unpopular and controversial at home while hailed internationally for its functional structure. (1) The tax is fundamentally a value-added tax levied on the domestic sale or lease of goods or services. Exports are tax-free while imports are taxed when they enter the country. Although the tax base has narrowed since its adoption, through {{the expansion of the}} exemptions, it remains a broad-based tax, levied at a single rate of 5 %. Small businesses are exempt from the tax. Those businesses that pay and collect the tax may use a <b>simplified</b> <b>accounting</b> structure to calculate input credits and thereby arrive at the amount of tax to be paid. The single low rate and the <b>simplified</b> <b>accounting</b> structure are features designed to promote equity and efficiency.

40|$|Abstract: Accountability {{is one of}} {{the keys}} to success for {{emerging}} P 2 P systems. In the absence of appropriate accounting and charging mechanisms, P 2 P applications may suffer from free-riders which benefit from other peers without contributing themselves. This paper describes a new Accounting and Charging system for P 2 P applications which separates generic accounting and charging functionality from individual underlying accounting mechanisms. The presented approach enables the design and implementation of different <b>accounting</b> <b>schemes,</b> independently from core accounting functionality. The approach has been implemented and successfully used with several <b>accounting</b> <b>schemes</b> in different P 2 P applications. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the recent Swedish reform and available options on major issues within this reform framework. In June 1994, Sweden’s Parliament passed legislation replacing the old defined benefit {{system with a}} combination of a pay-as-you-go notional defined contribution (NDC) and a DC privately managed financial <b>account</b> <b>scheme,</b> based on a total contribution rate of 18. 5 percent on earnings. The financial <b>account</b> <b>scheme</b> is run using a state-clearing house as a broker, and will have a state monopoly supplier of annuities. During the accumulation period, participants can choose among all registered funds, about 500 when they make their first choice in the autumn of 2000. Accounts were created in 1999, and two annual statements have been sent out since then. If the NDC and financial <b>account</b> <b>schemes</b> together do not reach a minimum level by age 65, and the individual chooses to retire at this age, benefits from these systems will be supplemented up to the guarantee level, determined by Parliament and financed with a state budget transfer. This reflects the fact that the PAYG NDC and financial <b>account</b> <b>schemes</b> are designed to function autonomously from social policy. Life expectancy is factored into the NDC annuity, and together with the financial account system, this innovation helps to shift the risk of an aging society onto workers while they are still active. There is no maximum retirement age, and the system offers a broad range of options for labor-force exit for older workers. Full, partial or no earnings from work can be combined freely with full or partial annuities from {{one or both of the}} public schemes from the minimum pension age of 61...|$|R
40|$|The {{role and}} meaning of {{accounting}} for energy, including feedstock energy, is reviewed in connection to Einstein's special theory of relativity. It is argued {{that there is only}} one unambiguous interpretation of the term energy-content: The one that corresponds to mc 2. The implications for life cycle inventories is that all discussions concerning upper heating value, lower heating value, feedstock energy, etc. are pointless as long as the motivation for choosing one or the other is not specified in relation to the safeguard subjects defined for a particular analysis (LCA or energy analysis). The subjective aspects of energy <b>accounting</b> <b>schemes,</b> even though based on mere thermodynamics, are highlighted. In inventory analysis, it is recommended that energy carriers should be accounted separately and in mass terms. For illustrative purposes, energy statistics and energy assessment are discussed in view of the safeguard subjects underlying the accounting procedures. Based on a set of theses, one possible energy <b>accounting</b> <b>scheme</b> as an indicator of the 'consumption of non-renewable energy resources' within the impact assessment of LCA is sketched. It is emphasised that energy <b>accounting</b> <b>schemes</b> do not reflect environmental impacts caused by the energy sources, and the characteristics of the indicator 'consumption of non- renewable energy resources' introduced here are highlighted...|$|R

The enhanced scheme was formulated using the web service approach that allowed cross platform interoperability. The results of the simulation showed that as the number of users increased, the processing time gradually reduced for the enhanced scheme which made its processing delay to be reduced.
