40|$|Query by humming is {{the problem}} of {{retrieving}} musical performances from hummed or sung melodies. This task is complicated by a wealth of factors, including noisiness of input signals from a person humming or <b>singing,</b> variations <b>in</b> tempo between recordings of pieces and queries, and accompaniment noise in the pieces we are seeking to match. Previous studies have most often focused on the problems of retrieving melodies represented symbolically (as in MIDI format), <b>in</b> <b>monophonic</b> (single voice or instrument) audio recordings, or retrieving audio recordings from correct MIDI or other symbolic input melodies. We take a step toward developing a framework for query by humming in which polyphonic audio recordings can be retrieved by a user singing into a microphone. ...|$|R

5000|$|Cultural and {{intellectual}} life flourished in Paris during the 12th century with the University of the Sorbonne having become a reputed institution that attracted many students, {{not all of}} them French. The construction of Notre Dame Cathedral on the Île de la Cité took place between 1163 and 1238 and this period coincides with the various phases of development of the Paris style of Organum. The Cathedral of Notre Dame and the University of Paris served as the center of musical composition and as a transmitter of musical theory in the 12th and 13th centuries. The presence of Léonin and Pérotin at the Notre Dame School made Paris the center of the musical world in the 12th century. Magister Cantus of the Notre Dame, Léonin compiled the 'Magnus Liber Organi de Gradali et Antiphonario'. Léonin wrote organa dupla based on existing chants like the Alleluia and the Gradual of the Mass and Responsory and Benedicamus Domino of Vespers for the major liturgical ceremonies in the yearly cycle. In hindsight, this turned out as a major event, as this was the first large-scale project attributable to a single composer. Not only is it a compilation for practical use during Mass and Office compassing the ecclesiastic year, the first of its kind; it also introduces the use of the rhythmic modes as a creative principle. Thus, when in a discussion of organum of the Paris School the word [...] "modal" [...] or [...] "mode" [...] is used, it refers to the rhythmic modes and specifically not to the musical modes that rule over melody. In Léonin's organa de gradali et antiphonario two forms of organum technique are evident, organum purum and [...] "discantus". [...] "Benedicamus Domino" [...] {{is a perfect example of}} the principles used. [...] "Benedicamus" [...] is usually mixed syllabic—neumatic in that it has mostly one note and maybe two per syllable of text, which is set in florid organum over a sustained tenor. [...] "Domino" [...] is in its Gregorian form set in melismatic style with three or more notes to a syllable and here both tenor and duplum proceed in discantus set in the six rhythmic modes, to be finalized with a florid cadence over a sustained tenor. Thus in larger texts, depending on how the words were set to music, syllabic parts (no ligatures and is therefore non-modal) end up as organum purum: the tenor sustains each single note of the chant over which the organal voice drapes a new florid line, written mostly in ligatures and compound neumes. Starting from a consonant, mostly the octave, sometimes lead in by 7-8 over 1, the duplum line explores the harmonious interplay with the tenor, building up to a change of harmony at the end of a melisma where another syllable is produced at a different pitch. Where the Gregorian chant is no longer syllabic but uses ligatures and melismas, both voices proceed in a rhythmic mode. This section of discantus is concluded, on the last syllable of a word or phrase, by a copula, in which the tenor sustains either the penultimate or the last tone and the duplum switches back to a florid cadence, to conclude on a consonance. Thus in organum duplum of Léonin these compositional idioms alternate throughout the complete polyphonic setting, which is concluded <b>in</b> <b>monophonic</b> chant for the last phrase. Thus, recapitulating, three different styles in the organaliter section are alternated and linked according to the text, leaving the last part of the text to be <b>sung</b> choraliter <b>in</b> <b>monophonic</b> chant. The verse of the chant is worked out according to the same principles.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I discuss {{an ethnic}} group, with a {{religious}} origin and highly religious lifestyle, whose music cannot be considered “traditional polyphony ” by any measure. Hutterites <b>sing</b> their hymns <b>in</b> invariably <b>monophonic</b> style; {{they have only}} begun to <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> choral fashion in the last forty years, and this repertoire is fairly standard Western art music in four-part SATB (soprano-alto-tenor-bass) format. Despite this, Hutterite ethics and ideals predispose them strongly to practices of cooperation and teamwork. In this respect, to borrow from Izaly Zemtsovsky (2002), they possess the social values and habitus required to become homines polyphonici, explaining their widespread and quick adoption of choral singing; in Joseph Jordania’s terms (2011), this group’s longtime “social polyphony ” in all matters (including music) helps {{to make sense of}} their now-polyphonic musical practice...|$|R
50|$|The tune of {{the song}} survived <b>in</b> <b>monophonic</b> and <b>in</b> {{polyphonic}} sources, but {{the text of the}} secular song is only known through textual sources. Tandernaken was an international hit in the period between about 1430 and the 1540s as settings, preserved in Dutch, Italian, German and English sources, are listed by Franco-Flemish (or Dutch), German and English composers such as Jacob Obrecht, Antoine Brumel, King Henry VIII, Alexander Agricola, Paul Hofhaimer, Petrus Alamire, Ludwig Senfl and Erasmus Lapicida.|$|R
50|$|Especially {{when they}} mix the ecclesiastical chant with the organum mode, they like {{not only to}} abandon the first mode plainchant <b>in</b> <b>monophonic</b> realization?, but the {{confusion}} of both and ars organi includes another of the diatonic with the other genera, because they associate the enharmonic diesis and the chromatic trihemitonium with the diatonic genus. They replace the semitonium by the tonus and vice versa, in doing so they differ from the other nations, as far as chant is concerned.|$|R

50|$|In {{the range}} of forms of {{compositions}} found in the later two manuscripts that contain the Notre Dame-repertory (F and W2) one class of distinction can be made: that which is (strictly) modal and that which is not. Organum duplum in its organum purum sections of syllabic setting, the cum littera sections in two-part conductus, copulae <b>in</b> general and <b>monophonic</b> conductus would be {{that part of the}} repertory which is not strictly modal. <b>In</b> <b>monophonic</b> song, be it chant or a conductus simplex by Perotin, {{there is no need to}} vary from the classical standards for declamation that were a rooted tradition at the time, going back to St. Augustine's De Musica. It has been firmly established by extensive research in chant traditions (Gregorian Semiology) that there is a fluency and varyancy in the rhythm of declamatory speech that should also govern chant performance. These principles extend to the not strictly modal sections or compositions, as a contrasting quality with musica mensurabilis.|$|R

50|$|During the {{following}} centuries the Chant tradition {{was still at}} the heart of Church music, where it changed and acquired various accretions. Even the polyphonic music that arose from the venerable old chants in the Organa by Léonin and Pérotin in Paris (1160-1240) ended <b>in</b> <b>monophonic</b> chant and <b>in</b> later traditions new composition styles were practised in juxtaposition (or co-habitation) with monophonic chant. This practice continued into the lifetime of François Couperin, whose Organ Masses were meant to be performed with alternating homophonic Chant. Although it had mostly fallen into disuse after the Baroque period, Chant experienced a revival in the 19th century in the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Anglican Communion.|$|R
