We mainly propose two novel contributions:an effective <b>sampling</b> <b>structure</b> based on Pixel To Patch (PTP) to mimic the retinal sampling pattern; and a novel LocalNeighboring Intensity Relationship Pattern (LNIRP) descriptorto extract texture feature by exploring neighboring gray-scaleproperties. The LNIRP descriptor is extended by using the PTPsampling structure which aims to capture not only micro-patternsbut also macro-patterns, while reducing feature dimensionalityand improving computational efficiency. The proposed descriptorhas advantages of robustness to image rotation, computationalsimplicity, no texton dictionary learning step and training-free.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the scaling behavior of sample statistics of pore-scale Lagrangian velocities {{in two different}} rock samples, Bentheimer sandstone and Estaillades limestone. The samples are imaged using x-ray computer tomography with micron-scale resolution. The scaling analysis relies {{on the study of}} the way qth-order <b>sample</b> <b>structure</b> functions (statistical moments of order q of absolute increments) of Lagrangian velocities depend on separation distances, or lags, traveled along the mean flow direction. In the sandstone block, <b>sample</b> <b>structure</b> functions of all orders exhibit a power-law scaling within a clearly identifiable intermediate range of lags. <b>Sample</b> <b>structure</b> functions associated with the limestone block display two diverse power-law regimes, which we infer to be related to two overlapping spatially correlated structures. In both rocks and for all orders q, we observe linear relationships between logarithmic structure functions of successive orders at all lags (a phenomenon that is typically known as extended power scaling, or extended self-similarity). The scaling behavior of Lagrangian velocities is compared with the one exhibited by porosity and specific surface area, which constitute two key pore-scale geometric observables. The statistical scaling of the local velocity field reflects the behavior of these geometric observables, with the occurrence of power-law-scaling regimes within the same range of lags for <b>sample</b> <b>structure</b> functions of Lagrangian velocity, porosity, and specific surface area...|$|R

While we present experimental results for FCC and BCC lattices, since these are commonly used 3 D lattices, the design formulations we present are valid for other 3 D lattices with 48 -hedral symmetry as well. The <b>sampling</b> <b>structure</b> conversion of a signal sampled on FCC (or BCC) lattice to the CC lattice is a 3 D interpolation problem, with the upsampling operation defined using the FCC (or BCC) lattice. In the design formulation for 3 D eigenfilters, we impose the Mth band constraint, the so-called zero direct component (DC) leakage constraint, and the 48 -hedral symmetry of the 3 D filter impulse response. The Mth band constraint ensures that the original input samples are preserved at the output and the zero DC leakage results in {{the suppression of the}} zero (DC) frequency in the aliases due to the upsampling operation, thus improving the quality of the interpolated output.

40|$|Interfacial {{delamination}} {{is a key}} reliability {{challenge in}} composites and micro-electronic systems due to (high density) integration of dissimilar materials. Predictive finite element models require the input of interface properties, often determined with an interface delamination growth experiment with (nearly) constant process zone, relying on the assumption of no permanent deformation in the <b>sample</b> <b>structure</b> layers. However, much evidence in the literature exists that plasticity often does occur in the <b>sample</b> <b>structure</b> during delamination experiments, which should be adequately dealt with to obtain the real interface fracture toughness that is independent of {{the thickness of the}} two sample arms. This paper presents a practical approach for the separation of interfacial toughness and structural plasticity in a delamination growth experiment on a double-cantilever beam specimen involving only small-scale plasticity at the interface. The procedure does not require knowledge of the constitutive behavior of the adherent layers. It only deals with the separation of structural plasticity in the adherents, whereas smallscale plasticity in connection with ductile interface fracture is lumped into the interface fracture toughness. The proposed approach was numerically verified for one set of parameters. Experimental assessment of the approach on industrially-relevant copper lead frame–molding compound epoxy interface structures showed a correction of the interface fracture toughness of more than a factor of two, demonstrating the potentially significant errors induced by plastic deformation of the <b>sample</b> <b>structure</b> during delamination experiments...|$|R
