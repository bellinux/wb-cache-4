40|$|Resistive {{random access}} {{memories}} (RRAM) require high density, {{low power consumption}} and high reliability. <b>Systematic</b> <b>statistic</b> electrical, material and theoretical studies were demonstrated in this work to point out and clarify a key impact of carbon residues on the resistive switching (RS), particularly the endurance, of the integrated HfO 2 -based 4 kbit RRAM array. The mechanism of the carbon atoms interacting with oxygen vacancies and serving also as filament was understood in nanoscale by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Under an oxygen-deficient environment, carbon atoms tend to fill in oxygen vacancy (VO··) sites and could form conductive filaments which require higher energy to be broken compared to the original VO·· filaments. By controlling the residual carbon concentration lower than 4 %, highly reliable HfO 2 -based integrated 4 kbit RRAM array was achieved, which is of great interest for future nonvolatile memories...|$|E
30|$|We {{emphasize}} the importance of undisturbed particle images for a reliable PIV evaluation that is based on cross-correlation peak determination. For optical distortions that deteriorate the point-spread function of the system, the cross-correlation peak is broadened and deformed which leads to large <b>systematic</b> and <b>statistic</b> uncertainties in the velocity measurement.|$|R
40|$|Within the mSUGRA model, the {{observability}} of {{the decay}} of the next to lightest neutralino ˜χ 0 2 into leptons and the lightest neutralino ˜χ 0 1 has been studied using a full simulation of the CMS detector. The final state signature consists of two opposite sign leptons, several hard jets and missing transverse energy. The expected precision of the measurement of the dilepton mass edge is reported for 1 fb − 1 of data, including <b>systematic</b> and <b>statistic</b> uncertainties, comparing two benchmark points with different signatures. ...|$|R
40|$|A light point {{projected}} on an object’s surface forms an image on a sensor when the emitted light {{returns from the}} object. The resulting signal on the sensor forms a peak of intensity. If this peak is correctly evaluated then {{it is possible to}} calculate the distance between the focused object and the light source. This thesis develops and compares peak detection algorithms for fast laser range finders. These algorithms, based on the ranging principle of triangulation, provide an accurate and robust estimation of the distance between the light and the focused object. In addition, <b>systematic</b> and <b>statistic</b> errors of the used scanner system are described and solutions to reduce these errors proposed...|$|R
30|$|Here {{we present}} {{for the first time}} a <b>systematic</b> and <b>statistic</b> {{observational}} study of the density response to the magnetic field fluctuation in the foreshock plasma. The study is performed in the spirit of testing for the quasi-static balance against in situ plasma and magnetic field data in near-Earth space. The foreshock plasma is a turbulent plasma upstream of the Earth (or planetary) bow shock. The foreshock plasma is connected to the bow shock by the magnetic field lines such that the shock-reflected ions stream backward against the solar wind flow and excite low frequency waves through the right-hand resonant ion beam instability or component/component instability (Gary 1991, 1993). Even though the driving mechanism of the waves is a kinetic process (beam instability associated with an unstable distribution function in the particle velocity space), the excited waves have sufficiently low frequencies in the frame of the thermal or core component of the plasma, lower than the ion gyro-frequency.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the paper a {{generalized}} theoretical approach towards beam coupling impedances and stretched-wire measurements is introduced. Applied to a circular symmetric setup, this approach allows to estimate the systematic measurement error due to the presence of the wire. Further, the interaction of the beam or the TEM wave, respectively, with dispersive material such as ferrite is discussed. The dependence of the obtained impedances on the relativistic velocity β is investigated and found as material property dependent. The conversion formulas for the TEM scattering parameters from measurements to impedances are compared with each other and the analytical impedance solution. In the second part of the paper the measurements are compared to numerical simulations of wakefields and scattering parameters. In practice, the measurements have been performed for the circularly symmetric example setup. The optimization of the measurement process is discussed. The paper concludes with a summary of <b>systematic</b> and <b>statistic</b> error sources for impedance bench measurements and their diminishment strategy...|$|R
40|$|We {{study how}} the {{significance}} of top quark induced charge asymmetries at the LHC may be enhanced exploiting the tt̅ total transverse momentum to enrich the fraction of quark fusion events in the sample. We combine this variable with previous variables related to the boost and the invariant mass of the tt̅ pair to find an optimum cut which maximizes {{the significance of}} the asymmetry when <b>systematic</b> and <b>statistic</b> errors are taken into account. We find that including the tt̅ transverse momentum in the analysis of the expected 2012 LHC data provides a considerable enhancement in {{the significance of the}} asymmetry. Comment: Matches the Physical Review D accepted version. Includes the recent CMS results on the LHC ttbar induced asymmetry in which they use the ttbar transverse momentum for the first time. The results are adapted to their selection efficiency and resolution in ttbar transverse momentum of 20 GeV, which increases still more the enhancement in the significance. 18 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of a thick disk in the edge-on, low surface brightness (LSB), late-type spiral ESO 342 -G 017, based on ultra-deep images in the V and R bands obtained with the VLT Test Camera during Science Verification on UT 1. All steps in the reduction procedure are fully described, which, together with an extensive analysis of <b>systematic</b> and <b>statistic</b> uncertainties, has resulted in surface brightness photometry that is reliable for {{the detection of}} faint extended structure to a level of V = 27. 5 and R = 28. 5 mag/sq arcsec. The faint light apparent in these deep images is well-modeled by a thick exponential disk with an intrinsic scale height about 2. 5 times that of the thin disk, and a comparable or somewhat larger scale length. Deprojection including the effects of inclination and convolution with the PSF allow us to estimate that the thick disk contributes 20 - 40 % of the total (old) stellar disk luminosity of ESO 342 -G 017. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of a thick disk in an LSB galaxy, which are generally thought to be rather unevolved compared to higher surface brightness galaxies...|$|R
40|$|In spring 2010, the LHC has {{delivered}} its first proton-proton collisions at a {{centre of mass}} of 7 TeV. The validation of the detector performance started with the measurement of some Standard Model well known processes. This paper presents the measurement of the W and Z cross section in electron and muon final states, which constitute the first sample of isolated high transverse momentum leptons. Clean signals have been extracted and the cross sections have been measured with 17 nb- 1 for the W channel and about 220 nb- 1 for the Z channel. All results agree with the theoretical predictions (computed at the Next to Next Leading Order) within the uncertainties equally shared between <b>statistic,</b> <b>systematic</b> and luminosity errors {{at the level of}} 10 - 15 %...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} high <b>statistic</b> <b>systematic</b> {{study of the}} overlap {{correlation}} function well below the critical temperature in the three dimensional Gaussian spin glass. The off-equilibrium correlation function has been studied confirming the power law behavior for the dynamical correlation length. In particular we have computed the dynamical critical exponent z {{in a wide range}} of temperatures, 0. 35 < T < 0. 9, obtaining a dependence z(T) = 6. 2 /T in a very good agreement with recent experiments. Moreover, we report a study of the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for very low temperatures T= 0. 5 and T= 0. 35. All our numerical results avoid a droplet model interpretation even when T is as low as T= 0. 35. Comment: LaTeX, 14 pages and 5 figures.

40|$|We derive simple {{analytic}} expressions for {{the flux}} and spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs) predicted in models where the CRs are protons produced by extra-Galactic sources. For a power-law scaling of the CR production rate with redshift and energy, d˙n/dε ∝ ε −α (1 + z) m, our results are accurate at high energy, ε> 10 18. 7 eV, to better than 15 %, providing {{a simple and}} straightforward method for inferring d˙n/dε(ε) from the observed flux at ε. We show that current measurements of the UHECR spectrum, including the latest Auger data, imply ε 2 d˙n/dε(z = 0) = (0. 45 ± 0. 15) (α − 1) × 10 44 erg Mpc − 3 yr − 1 at ε> 10 19. 5 eV with α roughly confined to 2 � α < 2. 7. The uncertainty {{is dominated by the}} <b>systematic</b> and <b>statistic</b> errors in the experimental determination of individual CR event energy, (∆ε/ε) sys ∼ (∆ε/ε) stat ∼ 20 %. At lower energy, d˙n/dε is uncertain due to the unknown Galactic contribution. Simple models in which α ≃ 2 and the transition from Galactic to extra-Galactic sources takes place at the "ankle", ε ∼ 10 19 eV, are consistent with the data. Models in which the transition occurs at lower energies require a high degree of fine tuning and a steep spectrum, α ≃ 2. 7, which is disfavored by the data. We point out that in the absence of accurate composition measurements, the (all particle) energy spectrum alone cannot be used to infer the detailed spectral shapes of the Galactic and extra-Galactic contributions.
