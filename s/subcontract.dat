40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} to discuss {{profitability}} conditions of a <b>subcontracting</b> constraint for subcontractor companies. The <b>subcontracting</b> imposes unavailability periods {{of the production}} unit in order to periodically perform <b>subcontracting</b> tasks (ST). We study the <b>subcontracting</b> constraint under a joint maintenance and production approach of a production system composed of one machine M subject to random failures. This machine supplies a constant demand d via a buffer stock S. At each interval T, the machine is subject to preventive maintenance action. The corrective and preventive maintenance actions have random durations. We analytically show conditions under which <b>subcontracting</b> is profitable, based on a given strategies of maintenance, production control and assignment to <b>subcontracting.</b> In this paper, we study the profitability of two cases of <b>subcontracting</b> constraint: occasional and long-term relationship. In the first case, we integrate the ST in the subcontractor plan without changing the decision variables values (maintenance interval and buffer stock size). The second case imposes a new optimisation of decision variables.

The loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for The Coca-Cola Company for decades to come. Legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to <b>subcontract</b> to other companies, effectively becoming parent bottlers.

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>subcontracting</b> in a patent expert organisation. The {{objective is to}} describe and analyse the current situation of <b>subcontracting</b> in the case organisation and give action proposals based on the theoretical literature and empirical findings. The study concentrates on two important <b>subcontracting</b> questions: What tasks should be done internally {{and what should be}} <b>subcontracted,</b> and how should the <b>subcontracting</b> be implemented? The study is a qualitative case study and the data was collected primarily by focused interviews. The case organisation is a patent group, {{which is part of the}} Finnish-based telecommunications company Nokia's Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) function. The basis of the <b>subcontracting</b> considerations is the make-or-buy question: what should companies make internally and what should they acquire from their suppliers. The theoretical part of this study concentrates on this discussion. The resource-based view (RBV) bases the decision on the company's internal resources. A resource-based idea of "core competence" divides companies' activities into important core activities, which should be made internally, and supportive activities, which should be outsourced. Above the make-or-buy discussion, the theoretical literature offers concepts to help in this consideration: how the <b>subcontracting</b> relationship can be determined and the <b>subcontracting</b> implemented. The empirical part of this study concentrates first of all on describing the current situation of <b>subcontracting</b> in the case organisation. The nature of the work and <b>subcontracting</b> as part of the work are described. Secondly, the empirical part describes the five success factors of <b>subcontracting</b> which were found from the research data. These factors are knowing and trusting the subcontractor, quality of the subcontractor, definition of tasks, effective use of internal experts' time and cooperative way of working. Deeper relationships with subcontractors were seen to bring more value for the company. To achieve these relationships, the case organisation should focus its group of subcontractors and start developing deeper cooperation. As well, the experiences of using different subcontractors should be collected regularly to help in deciding which subcontractors to start the development with.
