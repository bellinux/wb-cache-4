It has a handle and <b>sprung</b> <b>trigger</b> at the top and is pivoted at the bottom so as to pass between two notched sector plates. The reversing rod, which connects to the valve gear, is attached to this lever, either above or below the pivot, in such a position as to give good leverage. A square pin is arranged so as to engage with the notches in the plates and hold the lever in the desired position when the trigger is released.|$|R

Early melt onset in <b>spring,</b> <b>triggered</b> by above-normal near-surface air temperatures, contributed to accelerated snowpack metamorphism and premature bare ice exposure, rapidly reducing the surface albedo. Warm conditions persisted through summer, with the positive albedo feedback mechanism being a major contributor to large negative surface mass balance anomalies. Summer snowfall was below average.

5000|$|The {{landslide}} in Thistle, Utah, (1983) caused over $200 {{million in}} damages and property loss. Heavy snowfall, combined with a warm, wet <b>spring</b> <b>triggered</b> the landslide which eventually reached speeds of up to 3.5 feet per hour. The slide was over 200 feet thick, 1000 feet wide, and over one mile long. The slide eventually stopped when it collided with a large sandstone cliff {{at the base of}} the mountain. The amount of material moved in the slide was enough to create a 200 foot tall dam which blocked off the Spanish Fork river, and created a large lake where the town of Thistle used to be. It also inhibited railroad traffic and covered two major highways (US6 and US89). The lake eventually drained off leaving the remnants of the town behind, which can still be seen in the canyons.|$|R

40|$|The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is {{characterized}} by two main states: El Nino events defined by positive sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and La Nina events marked by cooler surface temperatures in the same region. ENSO is broadly {{considered to be an}} oscillatory instability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical Pacific(1 - 6) that shows a tight interaction with the seasonal cycle. El Nino events typically peak in the boreal winter, but the mechanism governing this phase synchronization(7) is unclear. Here we show, using observational data and climate model experiments, that the nonlinear atmospheric response to combined seasonal and inter-annual sea surface temperature changes gives rise to a near-annual combination climate mode with periods of 10 and 15 months. Specifically, we find that the associated southward shift of westerly wind anomalies during boreal winter and <b>spring</b> <b>triggers</b> the termination(8) of large El Nino events. We conclude that combination mode dynamics and related shifts in western tropical Pacific rainfall patterns occur most prominently during strong El Nino events...|$|R
50|$|Several index {{suggest that}} climate change could {{potentially}} have an important impact in the snow buntings populations. The Arctic oscillation index (AO) is a regional climate indexthat helps to predict ecological processes. In the Arctic, when the AO index is in a positive phase there are higher winter temperatures and precipitations, there are earlier and warmer springs and in the summer it is cloudy, humid and there are lower temperatures. Usually the AO index tends to oscillate from a positive to a negative phase, but during the last past 40 years, the AO index has remained inthe positive phase. Studies have shown that warmer <b>springs</b> <b>trigger</b> an early breeding behavior in the snow buntings that mismatches the peak of their food sources, leading to a lower success rate of the hatchlings. Even more, the higher temperatures will bring to the Arctic other species that will compete with the snow bunting, it is also thought that higher temperatures might allow a better survival of second broods in the snow bunting species.|$|R
5000|$|The P22 is {{equipped}} with a magazine disconnect that prevents the trigger from operating on the sear mechanism unless a magazine is actually inserted and locked into the weapon. [...] The magazine disconnect on a P22 works by using a strong spring to apply downward force against the trigger bar, such force being sufficient to overcome the action of the relatively weaker <b>trigger</b> <b>spring</b> which interacts with upward force on the same bar. When a magazine is not locked into the weapon, the downward force of the stronger magazine disconnect <b>spring</b> causes the <b>trigger</b> bar to pass beneath the internal lockwork of the weapon when the trigger is pressed. Once a magazine is fully inserted, however, an actuator surface {{on the front of the}} magazine pushes against the magazine safety. This overcomes the magazine safety's strong spring, and thereby serves to allow the <b>trigger</b> bar to <b>spring</b> upward under the force of the less powerful <b>trigger</b> <b>spring.</b> When this occurs, the trigger bar is in a position where it engages the lockwork when the trigger is actuated.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of abnormally wet spring {{seasons in the}} Intermountain West has linked to a phenomenon of upper atmospheric zonal wind alternation known as the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). Strong westerlies associated with this pattern during October-January often result in abnormally wet conditions in the following spring over the Intermountain West. A time series of the QBO was constructed for zonal averages of the 30 mb zonal winds near the equator. Using this time series, the QBO was split into different phases according to the wind direction: westerly (positive), easterly (negative), and transitions. Composites of winter and spring precipitation anomalies based on different QBO phasing were then constructed. The results show that during the October-January season prior to most extreme spring precipitation events, the QBO was oriented in a positive and maximum phase. Drier springs tended {{to occur in the}} minimum phases of the QBO in the preceding fall. The dynamic processes leading the QBO to affect rainfall in the Intermountain West will be discussed. These findings are crucial for the Intermountain West because extreme wet <b>springs</b> <b>triggered</b> by the QBO could lead to flood events, such as the spring 1983 and 2011 floods, and also impact the amount of water available from spring runoff. Based on the apparent positive QBO phase during the 2013 - 14 winter, the spring of 2014 will likely be a wet one...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{seasonal}} and vertical variations of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in fast ice at Cape Evans, McMurdo Sound (Antarctica) during the spring-summer transition in 2011 and winter-spring transition in 2012. We compare the variations of DMS,P observed to the seasonal {{evolution of the}} ice algal biomass and of the physical properties of the ice cover, with emphasis on the ice texture and brine dynamics. Isolated DMS and DMSP maxima were found during both seasonal episodes in interior ice and corresponded to the occurrence of platelet crystals in the ice texture. We show that platelet crystals formation corresponded in time and depth to the incorporation of dinoflagellates (strong DMSP producers) in the ice cover. We also show that platelet crystals could modify the environmental stresses on algal cells and perturb the vertical redistribution of DMS,P concentrations. We show that during the winter-spring transition in 2012, the DMS,P profiles were strongly influenced by the development and decline of a diatom-dominated bloom in the bottom ice, with DMSP variations remarkably following chl a variations. During the spring-summer transition in 2011, the increase in brine volume fraction (influencing ice permeability) on warming was shown to trigger (1) an important release of DMS to the under-ice water through brine convection and (2) a vertical redistribution of DMSP across the ice.
