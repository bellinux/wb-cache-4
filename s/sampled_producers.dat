40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to map sweet potato value chain linkages between actors, processes and activities in Tanzania. The study is cross sectional in design. The study was conducted in Shinyanga rural and Mwanza urban districts. The study used individual interviews, focused group discussions; review of relevant practical documents and discussions with key informants. A total of 150 actors in the value chain participated. Data collected was summarized using Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS) and content analysis. Analysis of data shows that “ Michembe” and “Matobolwa” were two main local made value added products derived from sweet potatoes preferred by producers. In general sweet potatoes production is marked with low production and productivity. Low productivity is a result of poor agronomic practices and low level of production technology application among others. Three main marketing channels exist in the study area: Producers selling directly to consumer; producers to retailers to consumer; and producers to hawkers/village vendors to consumer. Moreover data revealed that (50. 7 %) of <b>sampled</b> <b>producers</b> set prices after hearing from their fellow farmers. About (44 %) of the <b>sampled</b> <b>producers</b> sell their produce direct to the market. The sub sector in general faces a number of structural and technological problems that need immediate attention to revamp agricultural sector development...|$|E
30|$|Honey {{producers}} in the case study area are involved in three different types of marketing coordination arrangements, including spot market transactions (81  % of <b>sampled</b> <b>producers),</b> contract arrangements (12.5  %) and marketing cooperative arrangements (6.5  %). Some contract producers also sell honey through spot market arrangements. Cooperatives usually restrict member farmers {{not to participate in}} other types of transactions. Side selling by members usually involves disciplinary actions such as cancellation of membership. Those who are expelled from membership are devoid of access to modern hives on creditwhich are provided through cooperatives.|$|E

ABSTRACT: This study estimated the level of technical efficiency of environmentally controlled (EC) shed broiler farmers in Punjab, Pakistan. Multistage random sampling technique was used for selection of 60 EC broiler producers. Data was collected from <b>sampled</b> <b>producers</b> during the months of January-February, 2014. The analysis of data was done applying stochastic frontier Cobb-Douglas production function. Maximum likelihood estimation technique was utilized for estimation. Results showed that the mean technical efficiency of sampled farmers was 0. 999 ranging from 0. 934 to 1. 00. This implies that, on average, EC shed broiler producers were operating at full technical efficiency level. Based upon these findings {{it is suggested that}} government should motivate open shed broiler producers to switch over to EC shed broiler production and also motivate investors to invest in EC shed broiler farming. This will result in higher production of poultry meat and the problem of insufficiency of protein and other nutrients can be easily eradicated. This will also provide employment opportunities to the labor force of the country...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the complex fracture network that controls water movement in a developed area within Spraberry Trend in West Texas and to better manage the on‐going waterflood performance, a field scale inter‐well tracer test was implemented. This test presents the largest inter‐well tracer test in naturally fractured reservoir reported in the industry and includes the injection of 13 different tracers and sampling of 110 producers in an area covering 6533 acres. This inter‐well tracer test generated a total of 598 tracer responses from 52 out of the 110 <b>sampled</b> <b>producers.</b> Tracer responses showed a wide range of velocities from 14 ft/day to ultra‐high velocities exceeding 10, 000 ft/day with same‐day tracer breakthrough. Re‐injection of produced water has caused the tracers to be re‐injected and added an additional challenge to diagnose and distinguish tracer responses affected by water recycling. This paper investigated analytical, numerical, and inversion modeling approaches in order to categorize, history match, and connect tracer responses with water‐cut responses with the objective to construct multiple fracture realizations based entirely on water‐cut and tracers ’ profiles. In addition, the research highlighted best practices in the design of inter‐well tracer tests in naturally fractured reservoirs through lessons learned from this test. Results indicated that tracer responses could be categorized based on statistical analysis of tracer recoveries with each category showing distinguishing behavior in tracers ’ movement and breakthrough time. In addition, it showed that tracer and water‐cu...|$|E
40|$|The study {{determined}} the socioeconomic characteristics of kinnow producers using descriptive statistics, Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve. The results indicate {{majority of the}} farmers are in their midlife. 100 % of the surveyed farmers are in farming as primary occupation with 93 % as full time farmers. The lands used by producers are 100 percent irrigated. About 97 percent of the farmers interviewed inherited their farm lands whiles only 3 percent bought their lands. Majority of the farmers (76 percent) have medium lands i. e. land ranging from 4. 1 hectares to 10 hectares whereas the number of large farmers is 11 {{percent of the sample}} farmers. Land Gini coefficient value of 0. 22 indicates less land inequality among <b>sampled</b> <b>producers.</b> The value of the Cramer’s V indicate that, there is 29. 6 % strength of relationship between land size and age of farmers whereas the Phi shows 41. 9 % of the relationship between age and land size of kinnow producers. The Gini coefficient which is used to identify the equality of income distribution among the farmers indicates, a less than 50 % income inequality exists among farmers. The Gini value is 0. 17 or 1. 7 % income inequality exists among farmers The results indicate the strength of the relationship between income and land size is 29. 6 %. The results furthermore indicate only a farmer did not have formal school education whereas 99 % had formal education ranging from primary to postgraduation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the complex fracture network that controls water movement in Sherrod Area of Spraberry Field in West Texas and to better manage the on-going waterflood performance, a field scale inter-well tracer test was implemented. This test presents the largest inter-well tracer test in naturally fractured reservoirs reported in the industry and includes the injection of 13 different tracers and sampling of 110 producers in an area covering 6533 acres. Sherrod tracer test generated a total of 598 tracer responses from 51 out of the 110 <b>sampled</b> <b>producers.</b> Tracer responses showed a wide range of velocities from 14 ft/day to ultra-high velocities exceeding 10, 000 ft/day with same-day tracer breakthrough. Re-injection of produced water has caused the tracers to be re-injected and added an additional challenge to diagnose and distinguish tracer responses affected by water recycling. Historical performance of the field showed simultaneous water breakthrough {{of a large number of}} wells covering entire Sherrod area. This research investigate analytical, numerical, and inversion modeling approaches in order to categorize, history match, and connect tracer responses with water-cut responses with the objective to construct multiple fracture realizations based entirely on water-cut and tracers? profiles. In addition, the research highlight best practices in the design of inter-well tracer tests in naturally fractured reservoirs through lessons learned from Sherrod Area. The large number of tracer responses from Sherrod case presents a case of naturally fractured reservoir characterization entirely based on dynamic data. Results indicates that tracer responses could be categorized based on statistical analysis of tracer recoveries of all pairs of injectors and producers with each category showing distinguishing behavior in tracers? movement and breakthrough time. In addition, it showed that tracer and water-cut responses in the field are dominantly controlled by the fracture system revealing minimum information about the matrix system. Numerical simulation studies showed limitation in dual porosity formulation/solvers to model tracer velocities exceeding 2200 ft/day. Inversion modeling using Gradzone Analysis showed that east and north-west of Sherrod have significantly lower pore volume compared to south-west...|$|E
