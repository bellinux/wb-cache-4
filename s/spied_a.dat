5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1794, France was in turmoil {{following}} {{the failure of the}} harvest, which threatened the country with starvation. In order to secure food supplies, France turned to its American colonies and the United States, which assembled a large grain convoy in Hampton Roads. To ensure the security of this convoy, the French Navy dispatched most of its Atlantic Fleet to sea during May 1794, operating in a series of large squadrons, independent cruisers and one major fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse. On 5 May, two French ships operating independently, the 36-gun frigate Atalante under Captain Charles Linois and the corvette Levrette, <b>spied</b> <b>a</b> British convoy sailing south-west, three days out from Cork, and closed to investigate.|$|E
25|$|Peterel {{went on to}} {{take part}} in {{operations}} against the French forces in Egypt. On 13 August 1800, Peterel was sailing towards Alexandria when she <b>spied</b> <b>a</b> Turkish 80-gun ship of the line totally dismasted and aground near Aboukir Bay, with three Turkish frigates standing offshore, out of range of any French guns on shore. Some of the Turkish crew of the ship of the line had reached the frigates, but the captain and most of the crew had surrendered to the French. Austen sent in a pinnace and ten men who set fire to the Turkish ship to forestall any further French attempts to plunder it, especially of its guns and ammunition. Commander Charles Inglis officially replaced Austen in June 1800, but apparently did not actually take command until some months later.|$|E
25|$|Inside the lobby, Sweeny, District Engineer Farley and his firemen, Cain, and {{the other}} police {{officers}} eventually cleared the dress circle stairs {{to work their way}} up to the doors, where there was the connecting doorway to the family gallery stairway. They tried going up to the family gallery but were stopped by thick smoke. They heard no traffic on the stairway, heard no human sounds. They called up but received no response. Farley ordered one last inspection of the dress circle, but saw no activity. Nor was there any signs of life in the parquet and orchestra, below, now burning fiercely. To Farley the building seemed evacuated, barring, perhaps, a few stragglers. Not wanting to subject himself or others to any further risk, he ordered his men to quit the building. Within minutes, cracks appeared on the exterior theatre walls facing Johnson street, where, within, the heart of the blaze raged. At 11:45pm, less than a half hour after J. W. Thorpe had <b>spied</b> <b>a</b> flame no larger than his hand, the Johnson Street end of the building collapsed and an intense rush of air was drawn in, feeding the flames. Anyone who could speak of events transpiring within the building had already left.|$|E

2500|$|After leaving Savannah Harbor and {{lingering}} at Tybee Lighthouse {{for several}} hours, Savannah commenced her historic voyage at 5 a.m. on Monday May 24, under both steam and sail bound for Liverpool, England. At around 8 a.m. the same day, the paddlewheels were stowed {{for the first}} time and the ship proceeded under sail. Several days later, on May 29, the schooner Contract <b>spied</b> <b>a</b> vessel [...] "with volumes of smoke issuing", and assuming it was a ship on fire, pursued it for several hours but was unable to catch up. Contracts skipper eventually concluded the smoking vessel must be a steamboat crossing for Europe, exciting his admiration as [...] "a proud monument of Yankee skill and enterprise".|$|E
2500|$|In 1600, {{with the}} Army of Flanders now {{temporarily}} in disarray, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt <b>spied</b> <b>a</b> strategic opportunity to deal the Archduke Albert. Prince Maurice advanced in {{direction of the}} port of Dunkirk that had grown into a hotbed of privateers (the [...] "Dunkirkers") that did much damage to Dutch and English shipping, and {{with the support of}} a large amphibious operation from Flushing, started his advance to the coast. The Spaniards, with the Army of Flanders ready, strengthened their positions along the coast, leading to the Battle of Nieuwpoort. [...] Although the Dutch army led by Maurice of Nassau had driven a Spanish army from the field, a rare feat in the 16th century, the casualties on both sides were practically equal, and the battle achieved nothing. The Dutch lines of communication had already been stretched to the limit, and Maurice was forced to withdraw as well. Moreover, the great port of Dunkirk, which had been the principal objective of Maurice's campaign, lay out of reach and in Spanish hands.|$|E
2500|$|Mallory {{participated in}} the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition, {{organised}} and financed by the Mount Everest Committee, that explored routes up to the North Col of Mount Everest. The expedition produced the first accurate maps of the region around the mountain, as Mallory, his climbing partner Guy Bullock and E. O. Wheeler of the Survey of India explored in depth several approaches to its peak. Under Mallory's leadership, and {{with the assistance of}} around a dozen Sherpas, the group climbed several lower peaks near Everest. His party were almost certainly the first Westerners to view the Western Cwm {{at the foot of the}} Lhotse face, as well as charting the course of the Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of the North Face. After circling the mountain from the south side, his party finally discovered the East Rongbuk Glacier—the highway to the summit now used by nearly all climbers on the Tibetan side of the mountain. By climbing up to the saddle of the North Ridge (the [...] North Col), they <b>spied</b> <b>a</b> route to the summit via the North-East Ridge over the obstacle of the Second Step.|$|E

2500|$|... "Mok-qua Bennette was {{his real}} name. On {{the way to}} Beaver Bay in 1870 he <b>spied</b> <b>a</b> bear (named Mok-qua) sunning itself under a large spruce. Because of weather {{conditions}} - three feet of snow - {{it was impossible for}} the bear to move fast. The bear looked like good meat to the Indian who, unfortunately, didn't have a gun with him. He took a ten foot stick and attached a butcher knife to it thinking he would stab the bear to death. All he could do was tickle the bear. Seeing his method didn't work he cut a piece from a birch sapling with his tomahawk and tried to kill the bear by clubbing him to death. After the first blow he fell back while drawing away and got tangled in the limbs of the fallen tree. Mok-qua attacked the Indian, clawing his shoulder and arms. He did not bite him. The bear left the Indian who was unconscious. The Indian regained consciousness at night and when he did he was very sick and almost frozen. He somehow dragged himself to the farm of Jacob Hangarner who, after warming and feeding him, brough him to Beaver Bay. The Indian suffered more from exposure than from the attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice O'Connor, {{presenting}} the (4-5) dissenting opinion, {{stated that the}} historical evidence was not uniform in rejecting Atwater's proposed rule and reasoned that the Fourth Amendment required a balancing of interests {{in the case of}} an arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor. [...] The court dissent in Atwater precluded the sole use of probable cause in Whren v. United States, , where the Court had held that, on balance, it was reasonable to allow the police to make a traffic stop whenever they <b>spied</b> <b>a</b> violation of the traffic laws, although a traffic stop was a seizure. But, because of the length of the typical traffic stop and the fact that most drivers are free to go after it is done, such a seizure was commensurate with the magnitude of the violation and sufficient to ensure that the offender would appear later in court if necessary. [...] The dissent elucidated, “probable cause” and “extraordinary” circumstances as delineated in Terry v. Ohio, Whren v. United States, etc., have also proved less than problematic. [...] Strong argument to the contrary also remains as to the merit of the majority opinion that “personal § 1983 liability for the misapplication of a constitutional standard…would guarantee increased litigation.” In Atwater, the dissent further argued that Atwater could not have been characterized as a possible flight risk by the arresting officer, since she was known to him and was an established member of the community and that respondents failed to substantiate any demonstrable merit for the arrest decision. They further noted that arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor was not reasonable because sending someone to jail for up to 48 hours (the time necessary to get him or her before a magistrate to be released) was too great an intrusion upon the personal liberty interests of anyone who had committed a relatively minor offense as would only merit such a fine as punishment.|$|E

40|$|<b>Spy</b> 1 <b>A</b> is a cyclin-like protein {{required}} for progression through the G(1) /S {{phase of the}} cell cycle. Elevated <b>Spy</b> 1 <b>A</b> protein levels have been implicated in tumorigenesis and are attributed to overriding the DNA damage response and enhancing cell proliferation. Understanding how <b>Spy</b> 1 <b>A</b> is produced and degraded is essential in resolving how it contributes to normal and abnormal growth processes. Herein, we demonstrate that <b>Spy</b> 1 <b>A</b> is degraded in a cell cycle-dependent manner during mitosis via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have resolved the E 3 ligase and essential phosphorylation sites mediating <b>Spy</b> 1 <b>A</b> degradation. Furthermore, we have determined that non-degradable forms of <b>Spy</b> 1 <b>A</b> do not trigger cell cycle arrest but, rather, contribute to uncontrolled cell growth. Further investigation into the regulation of <b>Spy</b> 1 <b>A</b> may reveal novel strategies for understanding the etiology and progression of specific growth disorders...|$|R
