25|$|Originally {{there was}} a small {{turntable}} behind the engine shed but it became too small and inconvenient and was replaced by a 45ft turntable north of the station near High Mill <b>signal</b> <b>cabin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Between 1934 and 1945, a <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> {{was located}} at Tunnel Junction, {{on the eastern}} end of the tunnel, for {{managing}} the transition from the tunnel's single line to the dual lines of the system.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{programme}} included resignalling {{the lines}} between Belfast, Greenisland and Mossley Junction with automatic colourlight signals. A new <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> was built at Greenisland to control train movements over the triangle formed by the Loop Line, Larne Line and the Back Line.|$|E

2500|$|The {{biggest change}} {{came with the}} {{introduction}} of block-signalling in 1876. [...] <b>Signal</b> <b>cabins</b> (the NER name) were erected at Mill Lane, Hungate, Bridge Street, High Mill and Newbridge. [...] Later as the branches to Scarborough and Helmsley were opened, small <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> on the branches were opened to control the single to double track junctions, these were Eastgate and Goslip Bridge. [...] Of these seven cabins only Newbridge survives today.|$|R
50|$|Many of its <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> were {{situated}} {{on the corner of}} a footbridge. Examples include Wicklow, Rathdrum, Arklow and Gorey. At present these cabins remain in situ.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} {{signal box}} at County School was demolished after passenger closure, but the locking room footings survived and were restored {{to allow for}} the delivery of the original <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> from Halesworth to be relocated to the site from Halesworth Middle School, where it had been displayed since 1986.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{walls to}} window sill height support the precast {{concrete}} planking above. The passenger station building, <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> and utilities block are all constructed using a precast concrete system consisting of reinforced concrete planks slotted horizontally into a concrete frame, supported on concrete walls. Their timber framed roofs are clad in ribbed metal sheeting.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, manning {{problems}} {{meant that}} it had not been possible to evacuate rolling stock to other locations as planned and several trains were caught in the air raid. Twenty coaches were destroyed along with more than 250 wagons representing heavy losses of 10% and 15% of total stock respectively. Despite the surrounding destruction, however, the locomotive sheds and the <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> remained undamaged.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{control centre}} has largely {{replaced}} widespread <b>signal</b> <b>cabins.</b> These centres, usually located near main railway stations, control the track network using electrical or electronic systems.|$|R
50|$|Whiteman Village Junction Station {{houses the}} former station {{buildings}} from Claisebrook Station (Platform 1/Ticket Office), Subiaco Station (Platform 2/3, Party Room), and <b>Signal</b> <b>cabins</b> from Subiaco and Fremantle (Both are currently not operational). Down at Mussel Pool: The station building is from Nungarin (And was transported to BBR in 1989 with {{assistance from the}} Australian Army's 22nd Construction Squadron. There are also two <b>signal</b> <b>Cabins,</b> Collie (No longer operational, now located at parker siding), and Cottesloe, which is fully operational located at {{the northern end of}} the Mussel Pool platform.|$|R
25|$|The new <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> at York Road, Greenisland, Antrim and Mount {{were built}} entirely from brick with flat {{concrete}} roofs. Another exception was Templepatrick cabin which was of all wood construction.|$|R
25|$|The main {{elements}} of Kuranda Station which {{contribute to an}} understanding of the how the complex functioned include the concrete main station building, its platform and garden beds; the concrete male toilet block; the concrete <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> with its associated mechanical signal frame, linkages, semaphore signal towers, points, and points indicators; the goods shed; the trolley shed; the Station Master's residence; and the turntable.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} of the small {{stations}} that were opened along the line during the 1920s. A siding had been provided when the line opened near the level crossing in the village of Cove, and a simple platform with a corrugated iron pagoda shelter was opened for passengers on 9 June 1924. The level crossing keeper had a cottage and small <b>signal</b> <b>cabin,</b> both of which have survived as a house.|$|E
25|$|The <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> {{is a small}} {{rectangular}} single-roomed {{building with}} a timber framed gabled hipped roof. Timber casement windows are continuous on three elevations. On the north-west elevation {{there is only a}} centrally positioned timber panelled door. The building has a suspended timber floor elevated above the platform level. Concrete walls to floor level support the concrete plank walls above. The single internal space has a painted timber ceiling and contains a McKenzie and Holland 37-lever mechanical signal frame. Significant elements of the interlocked signalling system include the signal frame and its mechanism, plus all linkages, points, points indicators and signal towers located around the station yard.|$|E
50|$|As of 31 December 2009, Infrabel oversees 3,578 {{kilometres}} of railway lines, 12,218 switches, 1,913 {{level crossings}} (partly the road-side signalling), 223 railway <b>signalling</b> <b>cabins,</b> 1 traffic control, 4 workshops, 7,163 railway structures and 339 unmanned stops.|$|R
50|$|During June 2017, {{extensive}} resignalling works {{took place}} at Limerick Colbert. These works replaced two life-expired <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> that <b>signalled</b> all routes {{into and out of}} the station. During this time, platforms 3 and 4 were also straightened and lengthened.|$|R
50|$|In late 2012 an Electric Staff {{system was}} re-introduced on the Mussel Pool to Whiteman Village Junction, with staff {{instruments}} {{located in the}} <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> at both stations. At {{the same time a}} wired telephone line was re-introduced between the two stations, using telegraph poles.|$|R
25|$|Londonderry {{became an}} {{important}} naval base supporting the Battle of the Atlantic and a large traffic in personnel and materiel developed. At its peak in April 1943 some 20 500 men travelled to Londonderry. The facilities at Londonderry were inconvenient and rapidly became inadequate {{to cope with the}} buildup in naval activity; in late 1941 the Royal Navy started work on an additional base with extensive jetties at Lisahally about four miles (6km) from Londonderry. The NCC already had a siding at this location and a new <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> and crossing loop were installed. Lisahally base was much used by allied navies during the Battle of the Atlantic {{and at the end of}} the war as a berth for captured German U-boats.|$|E
500|$|A short passing loop {{was built}} at Llangefni station in 1877 for engines to run round, but at only [...] long {{it was not}} of much use for {{allowing}} passenger trains to pass each other. A refuge siding was built for freight trains at Llanerchymedd in 1878, along with an engine shed in Amlwch. In 1882, new station buildings replaced the basic wooden sheds at Holland Arms, Llangwyllog and Rhosgoch, as well as development of the junction at Gaerwen into a full double junction, and a second <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> built there. An extended Amlwch station received a canopy by 1884. The staff and ticket system was supplemented with block working in 1886, and was replaced with the electric staff system in 1894.|$|E
500|$|The station saw {{major works}} at the {{beginning}} of the 1880s. From 24 to 27 January 1880, the line was relaid as [...] standard gauge, and on 15 September 1880 a passing loop was brought into use through the station, east of the original track, with a new platform serving it. The new platform had a large shelter and a small <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> immediately south of the shelter, with a footbridge at the south end linking it to the original platform. Both platforms had [...] "half barrel" [...] canopies added. The new [...] "down" [...] platform served trains towards Bristol, while the original [...] "up" [...] platform now served trains towards Portishead. The double track through the station was extended to Portishead Junction from 1883. The station's name was changed to Rownham in March 1891, but reverted to Clifton Bridge in 1910. In 1899 the station was flooded to a depth of several feet (one metre), as were other parts of Bristol. A new signal box with 27 levers was built at the south end of the western platform, with the original cabin taken out of use from 25 August 1907. The signal box contained three token instruments, connected to the line's other signal boxes at Oakwood, [...] and Portishead, so that the Pill or Oakwood boxes could be switched out. The boxes at Clifton Bridge and Portishead were manned 24 hours a day. By 1889, services had increased to nine trains in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays, and from 1909 this increased to 13 on weekdays and two on Sundays.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> were in {{operation}} at Bowden between 1884 and 1930, one at East Street (at the Woodville end), the second at Gibson Street (at the Adelaide end). The East Street cabin was closed when colour light signalling was introduced on the Port {{line in the}} 1930s.|$|R
25|$|Kuranda Railway Station {{includes}} three early (c.1914) surviving Queensland examples of pre-cast concrete railway station buildings, and {{has one of}} the few mechanically interlocked <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> still commissioned in Queensland. The complex is also a rare surviving resort station, comparable with those at Spring Bluff (Main Range Railway) and Yeppoon railway station.|$|R
50|$|The railway also aims {{to have an}} {{at least}} {{partially}} operational mechanical signalling system, using the preserved King's Bog and Bundoran Junction <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> along with multiple semaphores {{that are on the}} site. Related to this is the Double Track Project, which will allow simultaneous operation on the North and South lines.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> {{included}} a fully interlocking McKenzie and Holland 37-lever mechanical signal frame (still extant). Before railway [...] "safeworking" [...] systems were computerised and centralised in Queensland, mechanical signals were controlled from signal cabins, which {{dealt with the}} traffic on a particular block of railway line. Signal cabins coordinated signals that indicated {{whether or not a}} section of track was clear of other traffic. Early signals were mechanical, while later signals were operated electrically. The most common form of mechanical signal was the semaphore signal. These consisted of a metal framed tower with one or more arms that could be inclined at different angles, with the arm at the horizontal signalling [...] "danger", or do not proceed. Examples of this form of signalling system survive at Kuranda Station. At night, lights were necessary, and kerosene lamps with movable coloured spectacles displayed different colours, including green (proceed), yellow (prepare to find next signal red), and red (stop).|$|E
50|$|The {{section of}} railway yard {{containing}} the <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> and turntable has been {{isolated from the}} railway station {{by the development of}} a large modern shopping centre. The <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> was de-commissioned in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{adjacent}} to the station building, at its south-west end, is a detached <b>signal</b> <b>cabin.</b> This is a small square structure with a skillion roof, clad with metal sheeting, and has aluminium-framed windows. A modern water tank collects rainwater from gutters of the <b>signal</b> <b>cabin.</b> The <b>signal</b> <b>cabin</b> building and the rain water tank are not of cultural heritage significance, but the cabin houses two culturally significant elements: a steel, 15 lever frame, set into timber floorboards, and a timber-framed cabin diagram mounted on the rear wall.|$|E
50|$|A small <b>signalling</b> <b>cabin</b> stands {{near this}} section of tiling, and was used to operate a {{crossover}} immediately to the northeast of the station. This signal box remained operational until 25 April 1964, although {{by this time the}} crossover was little used, having been largely superseded by a new one built at King's Cross eight years previously. However, the disused cabin still stands and can be seen from passing trains.|$|R
25|$|There was {{widespread}} political unrest in Ireland during the 1920s. The railways were prime targets although the NCC {{did not suffer}} as seriously as other lines. On 25 March 1921, wooden buildings at Crossroads, Cargan, Parkmore and Retreat on the Cushendall line were set on fire and completely destroyed. The same night the <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> at Killagan and Dunloy on the main line were destroyed by fire while that at Glarryford suffered minor damage.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, there were two <b>signal</b> <b>cabins</b> at Kilkenny - one at the Adelaide end of the station {{controlling}} access to sidings, the other at the Woodville Park end controlling the level crossing across David Terrace. In 1930, three-aspect colour-light signalling was installed on this section of the Port line in an effort to accommodate the close headways necessary with the heavy traffic of that era.|$|R
