40|$|With the {{enactment}} of the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act 2015, the United Kingdom became the first member of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to enshrine an aid target in law. It is now under a legal duty to spend 0. 7 % of Gross National Income (GNI) on aid every year. This paper has two aims. Firstly, it assesses the implications of enshrining a <b>spending</b> <b>target</b> for development assistance in law. It connects this to recent moves to set targets for specific areas of spending more generally. The UK’s decision to adopt a legal <b>spending</b> <b>target</b> for aid is important because other donors are likely to follow its lead. Secondly, this paper argues that commentators have focused their analyses too narrowly on the legal target (section 1) and that it is in fact the mechanisms for scrutinising development assistance contained in section 5 of the new Act that will be important in future. This is because judicial scrutiny of aid spending is a remote possibility {{as a result of the}} International Development Act 2002, introduced in response to the Pergau Dam case. The paper provides an analysis of the new legislation in the context of the UK’s now detailed legislative framework for international development aid and concludes that this framework is far from satisfactory...|$|E

40|$|Physician {{spending}} {{is complex and}} intrinsically related to national health care spending, government regulations, health care reform, private insurers, physician practice and patient utilization patterns. Consequently, {{since the inception of}} Medicare programs in 1965, several methods have been used to determine the amounts paid to physicians for each covered service. The sustainable growth rate (SGR) was enacted in 1997 to determine physician payment updates under Medicare part B with an intent to reduce Medicare physician payment updates to offset the growth and utilization of physician services that exceeds the gross domestic product growth. This is achieved by setting an overall target amount of spending for physicians ’ services and adjusting payment rates annually to reflect differences between actual spending and the <b>spending</b> <b>target.</b> Since 2002, the SGR has annually recommended reductions in Medicare reimbursements. Payments were cut by 4. 8 % in 2002. Since then, Congress has intervened on 13 separate occasions to prevent additional cuts from being imposed.

Subsequent administrative and legislative actions modified or overrode the SGR system to avert fee declines in 2003, 2004, and 2005. However, projected fee reductions for 2006 to 2012 have raised new concerns about the SGR system.

At the same time, there are concerns about the impact of increased spending on the long-term fiscal sustainability of Medicare. GAO was asked to discuss the SGR system. Specifically, this statement addresses the following: (1) how the SGR system is designed to moderate the growth in spending for physician services, (2) why physician fees are projected to decline under the SGR system, and (3) options for revising or replacing the SGR system and their implications for physician fee updates and Medicare spending.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Medicare's current system of spending targets used to moderate spending growth for physician services and annually update physician fees is problematic. This <b>spending</b> <b>target</b> system [...] called the sustainable growth rate (SGR) system [...] adjusts physician fees based {{on the extent to}} which actual spending aligns with specified targets. In recent years, because spending has exceeded the targets, the system has called for fee cuts.

Under these circumstances, policymakers are seeking reforms that can help moderate spending growth while ensuring that beneficiaries have appropriate access to care.

40|$|In March 2000 in Lisbon, EU {{heads of}} state and {{government}} set the strategic goal {{to become the most}} competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. These goals were confirmed at the Barcelona European Council, which added that investment in European R&D should be increased to 3 % of GDP by 2010. A recent CEPS Working Paper by Laura Bottazzi argues that the weakness of R&D and the slow accumulation of knowledge in the EU is probably a major reason why Europe has failed {{to catch up with the}} US productivity performance during recent decades. Yet the emphasis of the Barcelona Council on the <b>spending</b> <b>target</b> for R&D could be misplaced, as the question is not so much one of increasing the level but rather of enhancing the efficiency of R&D in Europe. Further, actively subsidising investment by venture capitalists may not necessarily deliver the desired results, as a large part of European venture capital finds it way to the American capital market and thus does not necessarily benefit innovation in Europe. Consequently, policy measures aimed at enhancing the efficiency and productivity of R&D in Europe should focus on the level of knowledge of workers and the capacity of entrepreneurs to translate scientific excellence into viable technological innovation. The policy brief adds to the discussion that the relative inefficiency of European R&D is to a considerable extent the result of the segmentation of public research efforts and overlapping of competing research programmes, and thus underutilisation of the available human resources.
