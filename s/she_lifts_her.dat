60|$|The yelling Ghost {{before him}} stands, See! she {{rolls her eyes}} around, Now <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> bony hands, Now her {{footsteps}} shake the ground.|$|E
60|$|She {{has reached}} the second balcony. She sweeps it hurriedly. Her {{companion}} raises {{his eyes to the}} same balcony and laughs as he speaks. She colors a little, but smiles as <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> eyes to the third balcony.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> head instantly; {{her eyes}} flashed through her tears.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> {{head with}} joy, then she shook it mistrustfully.|$|R

6000|$|JOANNA [...] [seizes him by {{the plume}} from behind, and tears his helmet [...] violently down, so that his face is exposed: at [...] the same time <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> sword with the right [...] hand].

6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "That's {{because you}} keep fussing about so. Why don't you be quiet, {{if you want}} to hear?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> voice to its highest pitch, with a pause for {{distinctness}} between the words: [...] "I'm heart- broken for--Ponkwasset. The dryads--of the--birch woods. The nymphs--and the great--god--Pan--in the reeds--by the river. And all--that--sort of--thing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|CLARE {{moves to}} the corner of it. An artist in {{observation}} of [...] his clients, ARNAUD takes in her face--very pale under her wavy, [...] simply-dressed hair; shadowy beneath the eyes; not powdered; her [...] lips not reddened; without a single ornament; takes in her black [...] dress, finely cut, her arms and neck beautifully white, and at [...] her breast three gardenias. And as he nears her, <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> [...] eyes. It is very much the look of something lost, appealing for [...] guidance.|$|E
60|$|She heard him. <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> feebly declining head. She looked. She knew.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> flushed face, {{and once}} looked him {{steadily}} in the eyes.|$|R
60|$|I {{was going}} to wish her many happy returns, when <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> stick.|$|R
6000|$|And now <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> eyes,--dark eyes, of preternatural largeness; {{brilliant}}, too, but {{not with}} the sparkle of the diamond; brilliant as deep clear wells are, in which the mellow moonlight sleeps fathom-deep between black walls of rock; and round them, and round the wide-opened lips, and arching eyebrow, and slightly wrinkled forehead, hangs an air of melancholy thought, vague doubt, almost of startled fear; then that expression passes, and the whole face collapses into a languor of patient sadness, which seems to say,--"I cannot solve the mystery. Let Him solve it as seems good to Him." ...|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN (sadly). I'll {{miss the}} kids so much. Taking {{care of them}} has {{meant so much to}} me since mother died. (With a half-sob she {{suddenly}} throws her arms about his neck and hides her face on his shoulder. He shudders and fights against an impulse to push her away.) But I'll miss you most of all, Fred. (<b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> lips towards his, expecting a kiss. He seems about to kiss her--then averts his face with a shrinking movement, pretending he hasn't seen. Eileen's eyes grow wide with horror. She throws herself back into her chair, staring accusingly at Nicholls. She speaks chokingly.) Fred! Why--why didn't you kiss--what is it? Are you--afraid? (With a moaning sound.) Oooh! ...|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> eyes to his, now deliciously wet. Her brows were delicately uplifted.|$|R

And knowest thou, Egypt, that hadst thou been other than thou art thou hadst not gone back to queen it on the Nile; for of this I am sure, the charges against thee are true in fact. But, being what thou art--and look thou! never did Nature serve a woman better!--I forgive thee all. For the sake of thy grace and beauty I forgive thee that which had not been forgiven to virtue, or to patriotism, or to the dignity of age!

6000|$|A young man, tall, thin, hard, straight, with close-cropped, [...] sandyish {{hair and}} moustache, a face tanned very red, {{and one of}} [...] those small, long, lean heads that only grow in Britain; clad in [...] a thin dark {{overcoat}} thrown open, an opera hat pushed back, a [...] white waistcoat round his lean middle, he comes in from the [...] corridor. He looks round, glances at CLARE, passes her table [...] towards the further room, stops in the doorway, and looks back [...] at her. Her eyes have just been lifted, and are at once cast [...] down again. The young man wavers, catches ARNAUD's eye, jerks [...] his head to summon him, and passes into the further room. [...] ARNAUD takes up the vase that has been superseded, and follows [...] him out. And CLARE sits alone in silence, broken by the murmurs [...] of the languid lord and his partner, behind the screen. She is [...] breathing {{as if she had}} been running hard. <b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> eyes. [...] The tall young man, divested of hat and coat, is standing by her [...] table, holding out his hand with a sort of bashful hardiness.|$|E
60|$|A quick warmth {{ran through}} her chilled limbs, and <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> hands to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> arm {{and showed}} a deep red score down the silken white flesh.|$|R

6000|$|Yet, {{whatever}} The Woman does, her [...] "gown" [...] {{is said to}} [...] "cling" [...] to her. Whether in {{the street}} or in a cabaret or in the drawing-room, it [...] "clings." [...] If by any happy chance she throws a lace wrap about her, then it clings; and if <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> gown--as she is apt to--it shows, not what I should have expected, but a jupon, and even that clings. What a jupon is I don't know. With my gown, I never wear one. These people I have described, The Man and The Woman--The Snoopopaths--are, of course, not husband and wife, or brother and sister, or anything so simple and old-fashioned as that. She is some one else's wife. She is The Wife of the Other Man. Just what there is, for the reader, about other men's wives, I don't understand. I know tons of them that I wouldn't walk round a block for. But the reading public goes wild over them. The old-fashioned heroine was unmarried. That spoiled the whole story. You could see the end from the beginning. But with Another Man's Wife, the way is blocked. Something has got to happen that would seem almost obvious to anyone.|$|E
6000|$|Ellen the while, with {{bursting}} heart, [...] Remained in lordly bower apart, [...] Where played, with many-coloured gleams, [...] Through storied pane {{the rising}} beams. [...] In vain on gilded roof they fall, [...] And lightened up a tapestried wall, [...] And for her use a menial train [...] A rich collation spread in vain. [...] The banquet proud, the chamber gay, [...] Scarce drew one curious glance astray; [...] Or if she looked, 't was but to say, [...] With better omen dawned the day [...] In that lone isle, where waved on high [...] The dun-deer's hide for canopy; [...] Where oft her noble father shared [...] The simple meal her care prepared, [...] While Lufra, crouching by her side, [...] Her station claimed with jealous pride, [...] And Douglas, bent on woodland game, [...] Spoke {{of the chase}} to Malcolm Graeme, [...] Whose answer, oft at random made, [...] The wandering of his thoughts betrayed. [...] Those who such simple joys have known [...] Are taught to prize them when they 're gone. [...] But sudden, see, <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> head; [...] The window seeks with cautious tread. [...] What distant music has the power [...] To win her in this woful hour? [...] 'T was from a turret that o'erhung [...] Her latticed bower, the strain was sung.|$|E
60|$|The girl sits {{steadily}} sewing; {{neither she nor}} her two companions speak. Her {{eyes are}} mostly upon her work; but {{now and then a}} very close observer would notice that she furtively lifts them, and moves them sideways and timidly toward Pierre; and then, still more furtively and timidly toward his lady mother, further off. All the while, her preternatural calmness sometimes seems only made to cover the intensest struggle in her bosom. Her unadorned and modest dress is black; fitting close up to her neck, and clasping it with a plain, velvet border. To a nice perception, that velvet shows elastically; contracting and expanding, as though some choked, violent thing were risen up there within from the teeming region of her heart. But her dark, olive cheek is without a blush, or sign of any disquietude. So far as this girl lies upon the common surface, ineffable composure steeps her. But still, she sideways steals the furtive, timid glance. Anon, as yielding to the irresistible climax of her concealed emotion, whatever that may be, <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> whole marvelous countenance into the radiant candlelight, and for one swift instant, that face of supernaturalness unreservedly meets Pierre's. Now, wonderful loveliness, and a still more wonderful loneliness, have with inexplicable implorings, looked up to him from that henceforth immemorial face. There, too, he seemed to see the fair ground where Anguish had contended with Beauty, and neither being conqueror, both had laid down on the field.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> {{lips and}} Jim seemed {{to kiss her}} more sweetly, with less violence.|$|R
60|$|She {{had finally}} {{smoothed}} his hair, so <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> hands and put back her head.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> {{and placed}} the cup in her hands, and she drank it off eagerly.|$|R
6000|$|To {{me there}} is {{something}} very touching {{in the notion of}} that little pinch of comfort doled out to granny, and gratefully inhaled by her in the darkness. Don't you remember what traditions there used to be of chests of plate, bulses of diamonds, laces of inestimable value, sent out of the country privately by the old Queen, to enrich certain relations in M-ckl-nb-rg Str-l-tz? Not all the treasure went. Non omnis moritur. A poor old palsied thing at midnight is made happy sometimes as <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> shaking old hand to her nose. Gliding noiselessly among the beds where lie the poor creatures huddled in their cheerless dormitory, I fancy an old ghost with a snuff-box that does not creak. [...] "There, Goody, take of my rappee. You will not sneeze, and I shall not say 'God bless you.' But you will think kindly of old Queen Charlotte, won't you? Ah! I had a many troubles, a many troubles. I was a prisoner almost so much as you are. I had to eat boiled mutton every day: entre nous, I abominated it. But I never complained. I swallowed it. I made the best of a hard life. We have all our burdens to bear. But hark! I hear the cock-crow, and snuff the morning air." [...] And with this the royal ghost vanishes up the chimney--if there be a chimney in that dismal harem, where poor old Twoshoes and her companions pass their nights--their dreary nights, their restless nights, their cold long nights, shared in what glum companionship, illumined by what a feeble taper! ...|$|E

60|$|But let me not so hasten {{over this}} part of my friend's journey as to omit all mention of the amphibious Irish houses which stand about on the low lands along the railroad-sides, and which you half expect to see plunge into the tidal mud of the neighborhood, {{with a series of}} hoarse croaks, as the train approaches. Perhaps twenty-four trains pass those houses every twenty-four hours, and it is a wonder that the {{inhabitants}} keep their interest in them, or have leisure to bestow upon any of them. Yet, as you dash along so bravely, you can see that you arrest the occupations of all these villagers as by a kind of enchantment; the children pause and turn their heads toward you from their mud-pies (to the production of which there is literally no limit in that region); the matron rests one parboiled hand on her hip, letting the other still linger listlessly upon the wash-board, while <b>she</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> eyes from the suds to look at you; the boys, who all summer long are forever just going into the water or just coming out of it, cease their buttoning or unbuttoning; the baby, which has been run after and caught and suitably posed, turns its anguished eyes upon you, where also falls the mother's gaze, while her descending palm is arrested in mid air. I forbear to comment upon the surprising populousness of these villages, where, in obedience to all the laws of health, the inhabitants ought to be wasting miserably away, but where they flourish in spite of them. Even Accident here seems to be robbed of half her malevolence; and that baby (who will presently be chastised with terrific uproar) passes an infancy of intrepid enjoyment amidst the local perils, and is no more affected by the engines and the cars than by so many fretful hens with their attendant broods of chickens.|$|E
