Specimens were cut {{out from a}} <b>starting</b> <b>sheet</b> in order to consider samples with specific initial crystallographic textures. Three types of specimens are considered in the study using an angle θ defined with the initial directions LD 0, TD 0 and ND 0 of the <b>starting</b> <b>sheet.</b> The following values of θ are considered: 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °. Plastic deformations up to 20 % are considered. Several experimental techniques are used, namely optical microscopy, SEM and Xray diffraction for texture evolution. The true stress-strain curves are plotted and the shape change of the specimens is analyzed. A macroscopic shearing is observed for one {{the three types of}} initial textures considered, notably θ = 45 °. To complete the study, the Taylor model is applied in order to compare the activation of the mechanisms of the α phase in the different specimens. © 2017 Author(s) ...|$|E

40|$|Fatigue crack {{propagation}} behaviors of ultrafine grained (UFG) Al sheets fabricated by the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process were investigated. The ARB process {{was carried out}} up to 6 cycles (equivalent strain, εeq. = 4. 8). The ARB processed sheet had lamellar boundary structure elongated to rolling direction of the sheet. The mean spacing of the boundaries was 182 nm. The tensile strength of the starting Al sheet increased after the 6 -cycle of the ARB. Fatigue crack growth tests were performed to clarify the crack growth rate and threshold stress intensity factor range for crack growth (ΔKth). The fatigue crack profile in the ARB processed sheet differs from that in the starting Al sheet. The ΔK th of the ARB processed sheet was smaller {{than that of the}} <b>starting</b> <b>sheet.</b> The ΔKth of Al would decreased with decreasing the crack closure phenomena after the 6 -cycle of the ARB.

40|$|Superplastic forming is a near {{net shape}} process used to produce various items with complex geometry. However in many cases, only some {{portions}} of the workpiece undergo superplastic deformation. In these cases, instead of choosing expensive <b>starting</b> <b>sheet</b> material with superplastic properties, a low-cost conventional material can be chosen and a grain refinement process can be performed in the selected regions to enhance superplastic properties locally [1]. This process is known as "selective superplastic forming" [R. S. Mishra, M. W. Mahoney, US Patent 6, 712, 916, 2002]. In some previous works the use of Friction Stir Processing (FSP) was used to obtain locally a microstructure with ultrafine grains in the AZ 31 magnesium alloys [2, 3]. In this study a modeling approach was adopted thanks to a commercial FE code and different simulations were conducted in order to correlate the experimental and numerical results for the model optimization [4, 5]. Free bulge forming tests of friction stir processed AZ 31 sheets, in conjunction with numerical simulations, were {{used to evaluate the}} proposed optimization approach, with the aim to reduce the time and costs in the design of components with complex geometry...|$|E
40|$|Electrodeposition {{of metals}} may {{be divided into}} four categories. In electroplating, {{articles}} are coated {{with a layer of}} metal for the purpose of ornament or protection. The physical form of the deposit is of prime importance since upon it depend such properties as lustre, hardness and ductility. Good adherence of the deposit to the plated article is also a requisite. The process of electroforming is the production or reproduction of articles by electrodeposition. Reproduction of printing plates and phonograph matrices are common examples of electroforming. In electrorefining, the anodes consist principally of the metal to be refined. The purpose is to convert an impure into a pure metal as, for example, with copper. Except for marked roughness which may cause short circuits and thus lower current efficiency the structure and physical properties of deposits are of minor importance. The process of electrowinning employs insoluble anodes in a solution derived by leaching ores. The purpose is to recover a pure metal from a solution which usually contains other metals. As in electrorefining, the physical structure of the deposit is of small importance since the metal in both cases is usually re-cast from a melt before use. Also, since the deposit is stripped from the cathode <b>starting</b> <b>sheet,</b> the adhesion in both cases must be of a limited degree. [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{automatic}} stripping machines requires a uniform and low adherence of electrowon zinc to aluminium <b>starting</b> <b>sheets.</b> Some impurities in the electrolyte severely affect this adherence. The strong effect of F− ions is first reported. Two pretreatments aimed at lowering the adherence are then compared. Brushing the aluminium blanks gives excellent results whereas anodization, even {{for long periods}} of time, is less effective. Influence of these pretreatments on the electrical parameters of zinc deposition has also been examined and economical conclusions are drawn. Differences in the electrocrystallization of zinc on low and high adherence areas are indicated by scanning electron microscopy examination. Mechanisms are proposed to explain the experimental observations. © 1980, All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is a {{combination}} of the term Conceptual Design which implies construction of ideas into concepts, and Design for Robustness which focuses on improving the reliability of a product or a process. The aim for this project was to implement a Robust Design Methodology (RDM) in the concept development process that takes into account the different perspectives at Volvo Aero Corporation which is a company that manufacturers of aircraft components, rockets and gas turbine engines with high technology content. Volvo Aero has a quality management system that is called the Operational Management System (OMS). A great part of this thesis work has been an external and internal literature study. To get information about the concept development process personal interviews were made as well as observations and a questionnaire has been given out to employees at Volvo Aero that have been part of a concept development process. The questionnaire gathered information allowing statistical analysis. It was found that the prescribed way of working did not comply with actual best practice described in OMS, the estimation of risks was not spread throughout the process, the vision of the concept goal was poor, there was no overall methods that were used - except brainstorming, projects used different concept evaluation matrixes, lack of time was a big concern and projects tended to do the job first - document it later. A new process design has been developed as a proposal for implementation in OMS which is clearer, simpler, and easier to over view, includes RDM and related to Volvo Aero’s product development philosophy. A new tool has been developed, the Concept <b>Start</b> <b>Sheet.</b> The tool clarifies the task {{in the early stages of}} the concept development process and is based on Volvo Aeros product development philosophy. The basic aims for the <b>start</b> <b>sheet</b> are: • Balance the project aim • Visualize the task • Implement the Volvo Aero Product Development Philosophy • Clarify the directives from the steering committee • Increase the communication in inside the project team • Increase the communication outside the project team (to steering committee and marketing department). “Robust Design Methodology means systematic effort to achieve insensitivity to noise factors. These efforts are applied from concept generation to the production of a product” (Gremyr 2005). Although the claim made in this report is that efforts can be applied before the concept generation, during the clarification of the task. The expression robust design is a craze that might not last for long, but the work with reducing variations will always be profitable. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|An Al/Stainless Steel/Al {{lamellar}} composite {{was produced}} by roll bonding of the <b>starting</b> <b>sheets</b> at 400 °C. Afterward, the roll bonded sheet was cut in half and the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process at room temperature was applied seven times. As a result, the central steel layer fractured and distributed in the Al matrix among different layers introduced by the repetition of roll bonding process. The tensile {{results showed that the}} roll bonded sheet has much higher strength and strength to weight ratio compared with the initial aluminum sheet {{as a result of the}} presence of continuous steel core. However, poor ductility properties were observed during tensile test, which were ascribed to the increasing deformation resistance and localized thinning of the central stainless steel sheet during the roll bonding process. The ARBed sample exhibited lower strength compared with the roll bonded sheet due to the breakup of stainless steel layer into many small segments. Anyway, an ultrafine grained microstructure with average grain size of 400 nm in the aluminum matrix and 71 % strain-induced martensite in the steel segments were detected by the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique, which were found to be responsible for the enhancement of mechanical properties compared with the initial aluminum sheet...|$|R
