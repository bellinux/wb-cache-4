Its collections were moved to a new location, and, in 1978, merged into the Village Museum. The Kiseleff {{building was}} assigned to the [...] "Lenin-Stalin Museum", which later became the Communist Party Museum. Shortly after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 toppled communism, the Salvation Front Minister of Culture Andrei Pleșu created, on National Museum grounds, a Museum of the Romanian Peasant, which he placed under the direction of painter Horia Bernea. It was officially inaugurated in 1993. Although sometimes described as Tzigara's successor, Bernea, helped by ethnologist Irina Nicolau, merged the <b>scientific</b> <b>function</b> into a conceptual art project, which is described by various commentators as a radical break with the interwar National Museum.|$|E
60|$|The Method {{proper to}} the Science of Society must be, in substance, {{the same as}} in all other sciences; the {{interrogation}} and interpretation of experience, by the twofold process of Induction and Deduction. But its mode of practising these operations has features of peculiarity. In general, Induction furnishes to science the laws of the elementary facts, from which, when known, those of the complex combinations are thought out deductively: specific observation of complex phaenomena yields no general laws, or only empirical ones; its <b>scientific</b> <b>function</b> is to verify the laws obtained by deduction. This mode of philosophizing is not adequate to the exigencies of sociological investigation. In social phaemomena the elementary facts are feelings and actions, and the laws of these are the laws of human nature, social facts being the results of human acts and situations. Since, then, the phaenomena of man in society result from his nature as an individual being, it might be thought that the proper mode of constructing a positive Social Science must be by deducing it from the general laws of human nature, using the facts of history merely for verification. Such, accordingly, has been the conception of social science by many of those who have endeavoured to render it positive, particularly by the school of Bentham. M. Comte considers this as an error. We may, he says, draw from the universal laws of human nature some conclusions (though even these, we think, rather precarious) concerning the very earliest stages of human progress, of which there are either no, or very imperfect, historical records. But as society proceeds in its development, its phaenomena are determined, more and more, not by the simple tendencies of universal human nature, but by the accumulated influence of past generations over the present. The human beings themselves, on the laws of whose nature the facts of history depend, are not abstract or universal but historical human beings, already shaped, and made what they are, by human society. This being the case, no powers of deduction could enable any one, starting from the mere conception of the Being Man, placed in a world such as the earth may have been before the commencement of human agency, to predict and calculate the phaenomena of his development such as they have in fact proved. If the facts of history, empirically considered, had not given rise to any generalizations, a deductive study of history could never have reached higher than more or less plausible conjecture. By good fortune (for the case might easily have been otherwise) the history of our species, looked at as a comprehensive whole, does exhibit a determinate course, a certain order of development: though history alone cannot prove this to be a necessary law, as distinguished from a temporary accident. Here, therefore, begins the office of Biology (or, as we should say, of Psychology) in the social science. The universal laws of human nature are part of the data of sociology, but in using them we must reverse the method of the deductive physical sciences: for while, in these, specific experience commonly serves to verify laws arrived at by deduction, in sociology it is specific experience which suggests the laws, and deduction which verifies them. If a sociological theory, collected from historical evidence, contradicts the established general laws of human nature; if (to use M. Comte's instances) it implies, in the mass of mankind, any very decided natural bent, either in a good or in a bad direction; if it supposes that the reason, in average human beings, predominates over the desires, or the disinterested desires over the personal; we may know that history has been misinterpreted, and that the theory is false. On the other hand, if laws of social phaenomena, empirically generalized from history, can when once suggested be affiliated to the known laws of human nature; if the direction actually taken by the developments and changes of human society, can be seen to be such as the properties of man and of his dwelling-place made antecedently probable, the empirical generalizations are raised into positive laws, and Sociology becomes a science.|$|E

40|$|Like many metaphysical {{doctrines of}} the seventeenth century, the {{concepts}} of absolute space and time served both an important <b>scientific</b> <b>function</b> and also fostered vigorous and productive philosophical exchange. The preeminent instances of these dual roles are, respectively, Newton's Principia and the Clarke-Leibniz Correspondence. Consequently these texts have been the main focus for early modern scholars of space and time. The papers in this symposium, while recognizing the centrality of these texts, aim {{in a number of}} specific ways to broaden and enrich our understanding of 'the absolutes ' in seventeenth century natural philosophy of space and time. First, several of the papers (Dunlop, Gorham, Slowik) investigate anticipations of the Newtonian absolutes in authors known to Newton, especially Gassendi, Barrow, and the Cambridge Platonists, and explore crucial but lesser known Newtonian texts such as the unpublished tract, De Gravitatione. The concern in these papers is not only with the influence on Newton, but also with the intrinsic nature and justification of the particular forms of absolute space and time proposed in the work of these influential authors. A second major theme of the papers (Dunlop, Futch, Gorham) is the epistemic or methodological status of absolute space and time. A major issue for Newton, and for his contemporary and subsequent critics, was the relation between the absolutes and their 'sensible measures ' (bodies and motions). This symposium will show how this epistemic concern was at work in th...|$|E
