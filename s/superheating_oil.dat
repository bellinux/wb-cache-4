30|$|Previous {{works have}} focused on the single factor {{analysis}} of the effects of chemical reactions of <b>superheated</b> steam with <b>oil</b> and rock minerals on the oil well productivity. However, the relationship between the factors and the contributions to productivity is still unknown. In this paper, the contribution of physical heating of superheated steam to well productivity is studied with the numerical method. Results show that: (a) the heat in the area has a very limited increase when the temperature of superheated steam continues to increase. (b) At the starting stage, the oil is heated to a higher temperature and the mobility is increased. The elastic energy becomes the dominant factor controlling the productivity of the oil well in the following stage. (c) The chemical reactions of <b>superheated</b> steam with <b>oil</b> and rock minerals are the dominant factors contributing to the productivity.|$|R
50|$|Daggett {{was also}} home to a unique solar thermal energy plant named Solar One, a pilot project which was {{operational}} from 1982 to 1986. The plant used mirror-like heliostats to aim sunlight at a collecting sphere located on a solar power tower (a type of solar furnace), through which oil flowed. The large quantity of sunlight reflected on the sphere <b>superheated</b> the <b>oil,</b> which was then used to create steam for power generation. The plant was upgraded in 1995 {{as part of the}} Solar Two project. Solar Two substituted molten salt compounds instead of oil as an energy storage medium.|$|R
500|$|In the CCR Process {{proposed}} by American Shale <b>Oil,</b> <b>superheated</b> steam or another {{heat transfer medium}} is circulated {{through a series of}} pipes placed below the oil shale layer to be extracted. [...] The system combines horizontal wells, through which steam is passed, and vertical wells, which provide both vertical heat transfer through refluxing of converted shale oil and a means to collect the produced hydrocarbons. Heat is supplied by combustion of natural gas or propane in the initial phase and by oil shale gas at a later stage.|$|R
50|$|As {{water is}} poured onto the fuel, it quickly sinks {{to the bottom}} of the {{container}} due to the water's higher density, and has little effect on extinguishing the flames on the surface. Under certain conditions, after some time, the water on the bottom rapidly vaporises into steam, causing it to expand more than 1700 times in volume. The rapidly expanding steam (possibly <b>superheated)</b> expels the <b>oil</b> or fuel above upward and out of the tank, resulting in the discharging of burning oil onto a large and uncontrolled area outside of the container. Mathematical modelling of the phenomenon is difficult and complicated, making boilover prediction unreliable.|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} {{that at the}} starting stage (from 50 to 100  days), the gradient of the curve increases with increasing steam quality, while, after 100  days, the gradient of the curve is almost equal to each other. This is because the temperature difference is obvious at the starting stage under different steam state conditions, while the temperature difference becomes small when the heated water and oil are produced. When it is larger than 100  days, the dominant factor controlling the productivity becomes the compressibility of the rock, oil and water. The place initially occupied by heated water and oil are now occupied by cold oil flowing from the faraway places {{that has not been}} heated. Second, the pink curve and the blue dotted line coincide. This is a strong evidence that proves the small contribution of physical heating for productivity of cyclic superheated steam stimulation wells. That is to say, the chemical reactions of <b>superheated</b> steam with <b>oil</b> and rock minerals are the dominant factors contributing to the productivity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{multi-layer}} {{neural network}} (NN) {{was developed to}} analyse experimental boiling data obtained for five engine oils at bulk temperatures ranging from 40 to 150 ◦C and heat fluxes ranging from 30 to 400 kW/m 2. The inputs to the NN were the oil chemical composition (nine elements) along with the wall <b>superheats</b> for different <b>oil</b> bulk temperatures and the NN output was the corresponding heat fluxes. The developed NNmodel predicted boiling curves that are {{in close agreement with}} experimental data (R 2 ≈ 1). The NN was then trained on the experimental data of four of these oils and allowed to predict the boiling behaviour of the fifth. The NN, therefore, demonstrated its ability to predict the boiling characteristics of untested oils, provided their chemical compositions fall within the range of the training data. In addition, for oils with constituents outside the considered range, theNNwas able to predict their boiling characteristics at all bulk temperatures when trained on a sample of experimental measurement. The success of such a technique provides researchers and developers of oils with the thermal performance of oils (based on chemical constituents) without testing or with very limited measurements. This, as a result, has the advantages of saving experimental time and cost of oil testing...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explored the}} effects of fractionation and distribution of R- 407 c in brazed plate evaporators with an emphasis at low mass flux. Experiments were performed in parallel with R- 22. A parametric study was performed with nominal and reduced mass fluxes, with and without distributor and with various orientations of the evaporator. Also, operating conditions were varied to investigate the effect of refrigerant inlet quality and superheat at the exit of the evaporator. This investigation took an evaporator {{as part of a}} system approach rather than evaluating local heat transfer. All experiments show that R- 407 c is a viable replacement for R- 22. Overall heat transfer coefficients for R- 407 c were essentially equal to that of R- 22 when operating at nominal conditions. U-values for R- 407 c at low mass flux were up to 15 % less than R- 22. However, R- 407 c U-values were approximately 10 % greater than R- 22 when operating with a saturated refrigerant outlet condition. Contrary to expectations, only slight fractionation was seen for all test conditions and evaporator configurations. It was concluded that lower inlet quality slightly increases refrigerant composition shift. Also seen in this investigation was greater composition shift at greater mass flux for individual experiments. This condition could be related to significant oil hold-up seen at low mass flux. A distributor was developed in this investigation to allow better distribution when operating with refrigerant flow in the downward direction. While downward flow did not have an effect on refrigerant composition shift in this investigation, this orientation may be useful for other applications where more severe fractionation is seen. Other issues addressed were <b>superheat</b> instability and <b>oil</b> hold-up in the evaporator. Liquid droplets were seen at the exit of the evaporator when operating with low superheat. Also, it was found that up to 35 % of the volume of the evaporator could be filled with oil even when operating at nominal capacity...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. This {{investigation}} {{was launched in}} view of two imminent needs in industry today, viz. development of an alternative fuel to replace rapidly dwindling fossil fuel resources, preferably by biomass conversion, and production of a biofuel as a new energy source by implementing clean technology complying {{with the requirements of}} green chemistry. Seed from the diesel tree (Jatropha curcas L.) and sawdust from pine (Pinus taeda L.) were selected as biomass sources since their properties, like rich oil content or diversity of constituents, met the suitability criteria for eventual conversion to biofuels. Extracts from the two selected biomass sources were derived by three different non–classical methods, viz. supercritical carbon dioxide (sc–CO 2) extraction performed with a laboratory–scale supercritical extractor (LECO TFE 2000), microwave–assisted extraction using a closed–vessel industrial microwave system (MARS 5) to produce superheated water, and ultrasound–supported extraction performed in n–hexane or water sonicated by a FINNSONIC soundwave emitter. The extracted material was compared to that obtained by traditional soxhlet extraction using n–hexane as solvent. One–dimensional and two–dimensional gas chromatography with time–of–flight mass spectrometric detection using a LECO Pegasus 4 D GCxGC–TOFMS and different column configurations were employed to cope with the analysis of derivatised samples of the complex, component–rich botanical extracts derived by the non–classical methods adopted. The oil content of Jatropha seed (at least 55 % m/m) and the solubility of Jatropha oil in sc–CO 2 (nominally 3 x 10 – 3 g per g CO 2 at 313 K and 30 MPa) were determined by utilising the dynamic and static modes of the supercritical extractor, respectively, and extrapolating the resulting yield–time graphs to infinity. These figures proved that Jatropha seed is a favourable feedstock for biofuel production, and that sc–CO 2 is an efficient solvent to extract oil from seed while avoiding harsh solvents and unwanted solvent residues in agreement with green chemistry principles. C 16 –C 18 triglycerides were detected as major constituents of Jatropha oil obtained by soxhlet and sc–CO 2 extraction, whereas free fatty acids dominate in extracts by microwave and ultrasound extractions due to thermal degradation and partial hydrolysis of triglycerides at the extraction conditions concerned. A standard solution of triolein, the most abundant C 18 triglyceride in Jatropha oil, was used as a reference for the identification of mixed C 16 –C 18 triglycerides present in the oil. By comparing the mass spectrum of each oil sample to the mass spectrum of triolein, some of the triglycerides in the oil samples could be identified with a satisfactory match factor (70 % or higher). Among these were triolein (C 18 : 1), tripalmitin (C 16 : 0), trilinolein (C 18 : 2) and tristearin (C 18 : 0). The triglycerides could be converted by means of base–catalysed transesterification to a crude biodiesel containing primarily C 16 –C 18 but also some C 13 –C 15 fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), the principal building blocks of biodiesel. The crude product could be benchmarked against an SABS approved biodiesel according to the SANS 1935 standard in terms of its content of these long–chain esters. sc–CO 2 and superheated water were found to be equally efficient solvents next to acetone used in soxhlet extraction to retrieve material from pine sawdust samples. Extracts were shown to comprise, among others, hydrocarbons, fatty acids, terpenoids, flavonoids and phenolics. These substances were either dissolved or desorbed by the solvent, and a “bulk solubility” of pine extractables in sc–CO 2 could be determined as 7 x 10 – 3 g per g CO 2 at 358 K and 60 MPa in a similar way as for Jatropha <b>oil.</b> <b>Superheated</b> water was the only solvent capable of cleaving the polymeric cellulose and hemicellulose chains held together by lignin in wood into a series of differently structured sugar entities, resulting in a highly complex two–dimensional chromatogram. Quantitative analysis of triglycerides had to be aborted since the low volatility of these high molar mass, high boiling point compounds necessitated modification of the instrument’s inlet, despite using pseudo on–column injection and special high–temperature columns. To the contrary, qualitative analysis of extracts and converted products demonstrated the powerful identification capability of the chromatographic system used and the diversity of substances available for conversion to biofuel. The chromatographic results published in this dissertation on the two selected biomass sources have been acquired by novel combinations of separation mode (one–dimensional or two–dimensional) and column type/configuration not specifically found in the literature. The study as a whole proved that Jatropha oil is a suitable source of biomass for biodiesel production, and that even waste wood shows potential for conversion into liquid fuels. The non–classical extraction methods were found to be capable of retrieving material relevant to biofuel production from these biomass sources. Master...|$|R
