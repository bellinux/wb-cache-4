5|$|Later a {{portrait}} of Moreno was discovered {{that had been done}} from life, by the Peruvian <b>silversmith</b> Juan de Dios Rivera. This portrait was painted between 1808 or 1809, before Moreno's appointment as secretary of the Junta. It is now considered to be the closest representation of Moreno's real appearance. In this portrait, he is depicted with an elongated face, abundant hair, long sideburns, big eyes, and a pointy nose.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan became {{patron saint}} of English goldsmiths and silversmiths because {{he worked as a}} <b>silversmith</b> making church plate. His Feast Day is 19 May, which is why before the Restoration the date year on London Assay Office {{hallmarks}} ran from 19 May one year to 18 May the next, not the calendar year. This was changed at the restoration of Charles II in 1660 so that the hallmarking year began on the King's birthday, 29 May.|$|E
5|$|Originally The Tales of Beedle the Bard {{had only}} been {{produced}} in {{a limited number of}} seven handmade copies, all handwritten and illustrated by the author herself. The books were bound in brown morocco leather, and decorated with hand-chased silver ornaments and mounted semiprecious stones by <b>silversmith</b> and jeweller Hamilton & Inches of Edinburgh. Each of the silver pieces represents one of the five stories in the book. Rowling also asked that each of the seven copies be embellished using a different semiprecious stone.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Towle <b>Silversmiths</b> was {{acquired}} by the holding company Syratech Inc., that also owned Wallace <b>Silversmiths</b> and the International Silver Co. In 2006, Lifetime Brands Inc. purchased Syratech Inc.; thereby acquiring Towle <b>Silversmiths,</b> as well as Wallace <b>Silversmiths</b> and International Silver Co.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} three decades, the {{ownership}} of Wallace <b>Silversmiths</b> would change three more times. Wallace <b>Silversmiths</b> remained {{a subsidiary of the}} Hamilton Watch Company(Hamilton Watch sold Wallace Stainless Division to Vose Associates in 1963 or 1964) until 1983 when the then 150-year-old company was sold to Katy Industries of Elgin, Illinois. In 1986, Syratech Corporation, which also owned Towle <b>Silversmiths,</b> acquired Wallace <b>Silversmiths</b> from Katy Industries. On April 1, 1987, Wallace Silversmiths' corporate headquarters were moved from Connecticut to East Boston, MA.|$|R
50|$|Although Towle <b>Silversmiths</b> was not founded until 1857 (as Towle & Jones) {{and then}} 1873 (as A.F.

5|$|Historical {{records for}} Gardner Carpenter's life are sparse in detail, but the Vital records of Norwich, 1659-1848 Part II provide some information. Gardner Carpenter married Mary Huntington, {{daughter}} of Benjamin Huntington Jr., on October 29, 1791. Carpenter {{was a local}} business man who operated his mercantile business in a shop that was shared with his brother, Joseph Carpenter, the <b>silversmith.</b> The Carpenters' shared shop is historically significant and {{is known as the}} Joseph Carpenter <b>Silversmith</b> Shop. A 1906 paper titled Norwich: early homes and history identified Gardner Carpenter as the builder of the store and noted that Gardner Carpenter {{was one of the first}} traders of Norwich. In 1793, the house which is now known as the Carpenter House was constructed on the property after a previous house on the land was removed. Gardner and Mary Carpenter would have six children together; their first son, George, was born in 1795 and their first and only daughter, Mary Elizabeth, in 1797. Another son, Gardner Carpenter, was born in 1802 and was followed by Henry in 1804, John in 1807 and Charles in 1810. Gardiner Carpenter served as a pay master in the 17th Connecticut Regiment in the American Revolutionary War and he was the postmaster of Norwich from 1799 to 1814, shortly before his death in 1815. His wife, Mary Carpenter, died in 1838. The house was sold to Joseph Huntington after Carpenter's death, who would add a third story around 1816. The house was sold again to Reverend Hiram P. Arms in 1841.|$|E

50|$|During most {{of their}} history, <b>silversmiths</b> used {{charcoal}} or coke fired forges, and lung-powered blow-pipes for soldering and annealing. Modern <b>silversmiths</b> commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources. A newer method is laser beam welding.|$|R

25|$|In Colonial America, {{sterling}} silver {{was used for}} currency and general goods as well. Between 1634 and 1776, some 500 <b>silversmiths</b> created items in the “New World” ranging from simple buckles to ornate Rococo coffee pots. Although <b>silversmiths</b> of this era were typically familiar with all precious metals, they primarily worked in {{sterling silver}}. The colonies lacked an assay office during this time (the first would be established in 1814), so American <b>silversmiths</b> adhered to the standard set by the London Goldsmiths Company: sterling silver consisted of 91.5 - 92.5% by weight silver and 8.5–7.5 wt% copper. Stamping each of their pieces with their personal maker's mark, colonial <b>silversmiths</b> relied upon their own status to guarantee the quality and composition of their products.|$|R
25|$|The Super 14 trophy, {{unveiled}} in New Zealand {{ahead of the}} 2006 season, was made of sterling silver with the competition logo on a globe sitting atop of a four-sided twisted spiral.

50|$|One {{school of}} Hungarian archaeologists {{maintains}} that the tenth century gold- and <b>silversmiths</b> working in Hungary were Khazar. When the Magyars migrated to Pannonia in 896, some Khazar tribes, known as the Khavars, came with them to their new homes. The Khavars were skilled gold and <b>silversmiths.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2008, Maria Teresa Marabini Moevs {{argued in}} an article for Bollettino d'Arte that the Warren Cup is not in fact a Roman product of the early Imperial period, but rather was {{executed}} around 1900 by a gifted <b>silversmith</b> trained in the contemporary Liberty style, perhaps commissioned by the amateur archaeologist and dealer Fausto Benedetti (1874–1931), to meet what he knew to be the taste of his foreign client and friend Edward Perry Warren. Benedetti may have worked {{in collaboration with the}} Castellani brothers of Rome, who were leading goldsmiths in classical styles, and collectors and dealers in antiquities. Moevs, an authority on Roman pottery, claims that the images on the cup derive from fragments of several scenes on Greek and Roman ceramics, including some in the Castellani collection, which were combined and modified to create the scenes on the Warren cup. An appendix to that article by <b>silversmith</b> Claudio Franchi provides corroborating technical evidence.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of schooling, Sequoyah {{displayed}} {{a good deal of}} natural intelligence.

He became a noted <b>silversmith,</b> creating various items from the silver coins that trappers and traders carried. He never signed his pieces, so there are none that can be positively identified as his work.|$|E
