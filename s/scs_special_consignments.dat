The bill established the Department of Divi Neguma Development by amalgamating the Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka, Southern Development Authority of Sri Lanka and the Udarata Development Authority, and created numerous community organisations, banks and banking societies. The Department of Divi Neguma Development would be controlled by the Ministry of Economic Development headed by President Rajapaksa's brother Basil Rajapaksa and would carry out development activities. According to the Constitution of Sri Lanka most development activities are devolved to the provincial councils. The Sri Lankan government introduced the bill in parliament on 10 August 2012. The bill's constitutionality was consequently challenged by four petitioners on three petitions in the Supreme Court. The court (Bandaranayake, Priyasath Dep and Eva Wanasundera) met on 27 and 28 August 2012 to hear the petitions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} fuzzy modelling and {{simulation of}} {{a supply chain}} (SC) in an uncertain environment, {{as the first step}} in developing a decision support system. An SC is viewed as a series of facilities that performs the procurement of raw material, its transformation to intermediate and end-products, and distribution and selling of the end-products to customers. All the facilities in the SC are coupled and interrelated in a way that decisions made at one facility affect the performance of others. SC fuzzy models and a simulator cover operational SC control. The objective is to determine the stock levels and order quantities for each inventory in an SC during a finite rime horizon to obtain an acceptable delivery performance at a reasonable total cost for the whole SC. Two sources of uncertainty inherent in the external environment in which the SC operates were identified and modelled: customer demand and external supply of raw material. They were interpreted and represented by fuzzy sets. In addition to the fuzzy <b>SC</b> models, a <b>special</b> <b>SC</b> simulator was developed. The SC simulator provides a dynamic view of the SC and assesses the impact of decisions recommended by the SC fuzzy models on SC performance. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades Supply Chain Management (SCM) has become a popular topic of {{business}} discussions. SCM presents a business philosophy of improving the long-term performance of individual companies and the supply chain (SC) as a whole and, as a result, attains or sustains a company's competitive position. The practical implementation of SCM has a number of constraints. The basic problems facing SCM are difficulties in adopting a SCM philosophy, the lack of general theory, difficulties of system thinking, and the unique characteristics of agribusiness SCs. Contemporary SCM theory is mainly descriptive and modern SCM research is predominately deductive. Research on SC performance measurement systems (PMSs) has not provided co-ordinated measurement of the bi-directional system flows (material, financial and informational). Available systems do not provide quantifiable measures for the network optimisation decision-making process. In this study an alternative approach to SCM problem resolution was developed. The three SC flows were integrated through the evaluation of their normalised performance measurements (NPMs). The NPM system was developed based on the primary concept that the performance of each SC flow within a SC may be uniformly measured using comparable sets of characteristics. This primary concept was then used as a basis to evaluate higher levels of system performance such as two-party contractual performance and then the performance of the total <b>SC.</b> <b>Special</b> attention was paid to the strategic level of SC analysis and optimisation. The suggested methodology was used to demonstrate how performance improvement of the SC as a whole is interrelated to the performance improvement of individual companies. Case evaluation of the proposed methodology allowed identification of the supply chain wave effect. This effect quantifies how the performance of one chain member affects the performance levels of other system participants. The application of game theory to the methodology indicated that a stable optimum SC strategy might be reached when business performances are balanced along the chain. The case study suggested that chain participants tend to move toward a stable optimum strategy over time. This research may be used as a prescriptive tool for a range of agri-food chain studies. Extended case evaluation is required to test the robustness of the suggested methods...|$|R

Secondly, the inter-cryostat drift space parametrically perturbs the longitudinal motion.

40|$|International audienceProton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) and Superconducting Coils (SC) are {{electrical}} devices which {{give us a}} large number of possibilities in the applied research domains. We know that PEMFCs are used as alternative power supplies that convert hydrogen and oxygen redox reaction into electrical energy. This is a clean power source that produces only water and heat as waste. While the PEMFC can produce an important current density (0. 5 A/cm² to 1 A/cm²) in a dedicated working zone, its voltage is too small and needs to be conditioned by power electronics to make it suitable for use in electrical systems. In addition, the superconducting coils are used to produce strong magnetic fields, with less energy, at cryogenic temperature, e. g. the temperature of liquid Helium. Their main applications are in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) devices or in embedded systems. In order to create these magnetic fields, the <b>SC</b> require <b>special</b> kinds of power supplies capable of providing high current at low voltage.

Superalloy and coating advancements for application in hot sections of gas turbine engines {{have resulted in a}} considerable economic leverage in power plants (Miller and Chambers 1987; Reed 2006). The modern CCGT uses single-crystal (<b>SC)</b> superalloys and <b>special</b> thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) and - in one design - closed-loop steam cooling to reach more than 60 % thermal efficiency. The application of advanced superalloys in the hot sections of modern gas-turbines also enables higher temperature operation. The operating temperatures in the first-stage and second-stage SC blades in modern CCGT lie in the ranges of 1, 300 °C to 1, 500 °C and 1, 000 °C to 1, 100 °C, respectively (see ‘Techniques to improve efficiency of GT engines’ section for details). For example, General Electric (GE) Inc. USA’s H-turbine (Fairfield, CN, USA) uses SC materials in first-stage blades and vanes that operate at a temperature of 1, 430 °C over a long service life. Similarly, first-stage turbine blades of Siemens’ SGT 5 - 8000 H machine (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) are made of specialized high-temperature alloy material to combat long-term effects of high temperatures at constant stress (to resist creep deformation).|$|R
40|$|Schwann cells (<b>SC)</b> have a <b>special</b> {{activity}} in the repair processes after injury {{of the nervous system}} because of the capability of differentiation, migration, proliferation and myelinization of axons. They enhance production of numerous neurotrophic factors, thus creating a permissive environment for axonal regeneration. Experimental studies using SC in neuronal transplants showed that these cells with their basal membrane with adhesion molecules are attractive material for neural prostheses facilitating axon growth. Moreover, SC can produce stable myelin, restoring normal function of the neuron. Transplantations of SC in myelin injury have been used in animal models of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and brain and spinal cord injuries. Because the transplanted SC have no ability to migrate within the normal nervous system, in many experiments SC derived from rat embryos were applied. Such cells migrated through normal nervous tissue and co-operated with host cells, their survival was longer, and myelin was not destroyed in multiple sclerosis. Also, fast recovery of motor {{activity in}} injured axons in rat spinal cord was observed, especially after transplantation of SC derived from skin progenitor cells or progenitor cells which have a phenotype characteristic for SC. Many authors have reported early apoptosis of transplanted SC, so a more complex repair strategy is needed that combines SC transplantation with other methods in order to achieve longer survival and optimal functional recovery following spinal cord injury...|$|R
