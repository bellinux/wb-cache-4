50|$|Early {{experiments}} on associative plasticity {{were carried out}} by W. B. Levy and O. Steward in 1983 and examined the effect of relative timing of pre and postsynaptic action potentials at millisecond level on plasticity. Bruce McNaughton contributed much to this area, too.In studies on neuromuscular synapses carried out by Y. Dan and M. M. Poo in 1992, and on the hippocampus by D. Debanne, B. Gähwiler, and S. Thompson in 1994, showed that asynchronous pairing of postsynaptic and synaptic activity induced long-term synaptic depression. However, STDP was more definitively demonstrated by Henry Markram in his postdoc period till 1993 in Bert Sakmann's lab (SFN and Phys Soc abstracts in 1994-1995) which was only published in 1997. C. Bell and co-workers also found a form of STDP in the cerebellum. Henry Markram used dual patch clamping techniques to repetitively activate pre-synaptic neurons 10 milliseconds before activating the post-synaptic target neurons, and found {{the strength of the}} synapse increased. When the activation order was reversed so that the pre-synaptic neuron was activated 10 milliseconds after its post-synaptic target neuron, the strength of the pre-to-post synaptic connection decreased. Further work, by Guoqiang Bi, Li Zhang, and Huizhong Tao in Mu-Ming Poo's lab in 1998, continued the mapping of the entire time course relating pre- and post-synaptic activity and <b>synaptic</b> <b>change,</b> to show that in their preparation synapses that are activated within 5-20 ms before a postsynaptic spike are strengthened, and those that are activated within a similar time window after the spike are weakened. This phenomenon has been observed in various other preparations, with some variation in the time-window relevant for plasticity. Several reasons for timing-dependent plasticity have been suggested. For example, STDP might provide a substrate for Hebbian learning during development, or, as suggested by Taylor in 1973, the associated Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules might create informationally efficient coding in bundles of related neurons. Works from Y. Dan's lab advanced to study STDP in in vivo systems.|$|E

50|$|Long-term {{plasticity}} in synapses of {{the hippocampus}} can be induced by different patterns of stimulation generating pre- and post-synaptic depolarization. These <b>synaptic</b> <b>changes</b> can clearly lead to modification in circuit function and to behavioral plasticity. Some patterns of synaptic activity produce an extensive increase in synaptic strength, {{also known as}} Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). In the hippocampus, LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 modulates the biophysical properties of AMPA receptors. Moreover, SK2, small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel, changes the shape of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) by coupling with N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDA receptors). The research by Lin MT, et al. was designed to investigate whether SK2 channels participate in <b>synaptic</b> <b>changes</b> when an activity-dependent decrease contributes to LTP.|$|R

This review highlights the synaptic modifications that are induced by in vivo exposure to addictive drugs and describes how these drug-induced <b>synaptic</b> <b>changes</b> {{may contribute to the}} different components of addictive behavior, such as compulsive drug use despite negative consequences and relapse. Initially, exposure to an addictive drug induces <b>synaptic</b> <b>changes</b> in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This drug-induced synaptic potentiation in the VTA subsequently triggers <b>synaptic</b> <b>changes</b> in downstream areas of the mesocorticolimbic system, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with further drug exposure. These glutamatergic synaptic alterations are then thought to mediate many of the behavioral symptoms that characterize addiction. The later stages of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in the NAc and in particular in the PFC play a role in maintaining addiction and drive relapse to drug-taking induced by drug-associated cues. Remodeling of PFC glutamatergic circuits can persist into adulthood, causing a lasting vulnerability to relapse. We will discuss how these neurobiological changes produced by drugs of abuse may provide novel targets for potential treatment strategies for addiction...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that neuronal synchronization in the gamma band (30 – 100 Hz) may {{play an important role}} in mediating cognitive processes. Gamma-band synchronization provides for the optimal temporal relationship between two signals to produce the long-term <b>synaptic</b> <b>changes</b> that have been theorized to underlie memory formation. Although neuronal populations in the hippocampus oscillate in the gamma range, the role of these oscillations in memory formation is still unclear. To address this issue, we recorded neuronal activity in the hippocampus while macaque monkeys performed a visual recognition memory task. During the encoding phase of this task, hippocampal neurons displayed gamma-band synchronization. Additionally, enhanced gamma-band synchronization during encoding predicted greater subsequent recognition memory performance. These changes in synchronization reflect enhanced coordination among hippocampal neurons and may facilitate <b>synaptic</b> <b>changes</b> necessary for successful memory encoding...|$|R

40|$|Precise spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of neuronal action potentials underly e. g. sensory representations {{and control of}} muscle activities. However, {{it is not known}} how the synaptic efficacies in the neuronal networks of the brain adapt such that they can reliably generate spikes at specific points in time. Existing activity-dependent plasticity rules like Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity are agnostic to the goal of learning spike times. On the other hand, the existing formal and supervised learning algorithms perform a temporally precise comparison of projected activity with the target, but there is no known biologically plausible implementation of this comparison. Here, we propose a simple and local unsupervised synaptic plasticity mechanism that is derived from the requirement of a balanced membrane potential. Since the relevant signal for <b>synaptic</b> <b>change</b> is the postsynaptic voltage rather than spike times, we call the plasticity rule Membrane Potential Dependent Plasticity (MPDP). Combining our plasticity mechanism with spike after-hyperpolarization causes a sensitivity of <b>synaptic</b> <b>change</b> to pre- and postsynaptic spike times which can reproduce Hebbian spike timing dependent plasticity for inhibitory synapses as was found in experiments. In addition, the sensitivity of MPDP to the time course of the voltage when generating a spike allows MPDP to distinguish between weak (spurious) and strong (teacher) spikes, which therefore provides a neuronal basis for the comparison of actual and target activity. For spatio-temporal input spike patterns our conceptually simple plasticity rule achieves a surprisingly high storage capacity for spike associations. The sensitivity of the MPDP to the subthreshold membrane potential during training allows robust memory retrieval after learning even in the presence of activity corrupted by noise.

A genetically enforced enlargement of AZ scaffolds (four gene-copies of BRP) impaired memory formation in young animals.
