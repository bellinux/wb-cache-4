40|$|In {{previous}} work an antiserum raised against a synthetic tetradecapeptide whose sequence {{is common to}} the major and heat shock <b>sigma</b> <b>subunits</b> of RNA polymerase was used to identify sigma cross-reacting proteins (SCRPs) in Esche-richia coli (6).

Indeed, amino-terminal se-quencing of the four SCRPs, followed by data base compar-isons (15), led to the almost certain identification of three of these proteins as thioredoxin reductase, ribosomal protein S 2, and the small subunit of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. The genes encoding the first two of these, trxB and rpsB, have already been mapped on the chromosome of E. coli K- 12 (1).

The {{results indicated that}} the levels of sigma 54 and sigma 28 are maintained at 10 and 50 %, respectively, of the level of sigma 70 in both strains growing at both exponential and stationary phases, but in agreement with the previous measurement for strain MC 4100 (M. Jishage and A. Ishihama, J. Bacteriol. 177 : 6832 - 6835, 1995), the level of sigma 38 was undetectable at the exponential growth phase but increased at 30 % of the level of sigma 70 at the stationary phase. Stress-coupled change in the intracellular level was observed for two sigma subunits: (i) the increase in sigma 38 level and the decrease in sigma 28 level upon exposure to heat shock at the exponential phase and (ii) the increase in sigma 38 level under high-osmolality conditions at both the exponential and stationary phases...|$|R

Members of this family metabolize a wide variety of substrates, including ethanol, retinol, other aliphatic alcohols, hydroxysteroids, and lipid peroxidation products. The enzyme encoded by this gene is inefficient in ethanol oxidation, but is the most active as a retinol dehydrogenase; thus it may participate in the synthesis of retinoic acid, a hormone important for cellular differentiation. The expression of this gene makes it much more abundant in the stomach than the liver, thus it differs from the other known gene family members.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> of E. coli RNA polymerase with DNA, either double or single-stranded, and with two inhibitors of RNA synthesis was investigated by using antibodies {{directed against the}} subunit.

When the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> forms part of the holo enzyme, sigma also interacts with poly(dG). poly(dC). Rifampicin and streptolydigin interact with sigma in the holo enzyme and with free and core bound <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit,</b> respectively.

40|$|International audienceTime-resolved laser UV {{irradiation}} {{and controlled}} proteolysis {{have been used}} to study the sequential recognition of the lac UV 5 promoter by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. Local rearrangements in the DNA, the appearance of intimate protein-DNA contacts, and structural changes within the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> together provide specific signatures that define major species populated during this process. At 22 degreesC, a first closed complex is characterised by a transient conformational change in the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> and by a distortion in the - 35 region. Subsequently, direct contacts at - 34 and at positions - 8, - 5 and - 3 on the non-template strand appear prior to DNA strand separation. The contact in the - 35 consensus region involves only the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit.</b> This intermediate possesses different structural parameters from that formed by quenching open complexes from 37 degreesC to 14 degreesC.

40|$|A {{new class}} of Escherichia coli mutants, {{referred}} to as grn, has been isolated by localized mutagenesis. These mutations affect the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (ribonucleoside 5 '-triphosphate:RNA nucleotidyltransferase, EC 2. 7. 7. 6) by abolishing {{the expression of the}} lambda N gene, and they are closely lniked to dnaG in the order dnaG-grn-uxaA. Detailed study of one such mutant, grn 1, yielded the following results: (i) grn 1 is a single mutation and the mutant cell shows cold-sensitivity in growth; (ii) the Grn phenotype of the mutant can easily be suppressed by secondary mutations in the beta subunit gene of RNA polymerase; (iii) purified holoenzyme of RNA polymerase isolated from the mutant showed an altered salt-dependency in vitro, and the mixed reconstitution of the mutant with the wild-type subunits showed that the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> of the grn 1 mutant is altered; (iv) lambda phage mutants (lambda grg), which overcome the grn mutation, can be classified into two groups, the "nin-deletion" and the "N-mutant" groups (both of these are also able to grow on the previously described groN mutant of Georgopoulos and nusAB of Friedman); (iv) the mutant polymerase transcribed 12 S as well as 7 S RNA from lambda DNA {{in the presence of the}} rho factor in vitro. These results indicate that the grn mutation alters the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> of RNA polymerase and that the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> participates in activating the N-mediated antitermination mode of lambda phage transcription...|$|E

30|$|To {{survive in}} the harsh conditions, {{microorganisms}} {{need to be able}} to adapt to a competitive and changing environment. In response to changes in environmental conditions, the physiological status of microorganisms can change due to the actions of transcriptional regulatory systems. Generally, transcription regulation occurs at two different levels. Firstly, regulation can drive the expression of relevant pathway genes in reaction to a specific inducer. Secondly, global regulatory systems can adjust the expression of the pathway gene cluster in response to the general physiological status of the microorganism. The main regulators at this higher level are alternative RNA polymerase <b>sigma</b> <b>subunits</b> (Dı́az and Prieto 2000).|$|R

40|$|The {{promoter}} selectivity of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase {{is determined}} by the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> with promoter recognition activity. The model prokaryote Escherichia coli contains seven species of the <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit,</b> each recognizing a specific set of promoters. The major <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit,</b> sigma- 70 encoded by rpoD, {{plays a major role in}} transcription of growth-related genes. Concomitant with the increase in detection of promoters functioning in vivo under various stressful conditions, the variation is expanding in the consensus sequence of RpoD promoters. In order to identify the canonical sequence of "constitutive promoters" that are recognized by the RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing RpoD sigma in the absence of supporting transcription factors, an in vitro mixed transcription assay was carried out using a whole set of variant promoters, each harboring one base replacement, within the model promoter with the conserved - 35 and - 10 sequences of RpoD promoters. The consensus sequences, TTGACA(- 35) and TATAAT(- 10), were identified to be ideal for the maximum level of open complex formation and the highest rate of promoter opening, respectively. For identification of the full range of constitutive promoters on the E. coli genome, a total of 2, 701 RpoD holoenzyme-binding sites were identified by Genomic SELEX screening, and using the reconfirmed consensus promoter sequence, a total of maximum 669 constitutive promoters were identified, implying that the majority of hitherto identified promoters represents the TF-dependent "inducible promoters". One unique feature of the constitutive promoters is the high level of promoter sequence conservation, about 85 % carrying five-out-of-six agreements with - 35 or - 10 consensus sequence.

The rpoD gene codes for a polypeptide of 653 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 72, 623 Da (sigma 73). The C. crescentus <b>sigma</b> <b>subunit</b> has extensive amino acid sequence homology with the principal sigma factors {{of a number of}} divergent procaryotes. In particular, the segments designated region 2 that are involved in core polymerase binding and promoter recognition were identical among these bacteria {{despite the fact that the}} - 10 region recognized by the C. crescentus sigma 73 differs significantly from that of the other bacteria. Thus, it appears that additional sigma factor regions must be involved in - 10 region recognition. This conclusion was strengthened by a heterologous complementation assay in which C. crescentus sigma 73 was capable of complementing the Escherichia coli rpoD 285 temperature-sensitive mutant. Furthermore, C. crescentus sigma 73 conferred new specificity on the E. coli RNA polymerase, allowing the expression of C. crescentus promoters in E. coli. Thus, the C. crescentus sigma 73 appears to have a broader specificity than does the sigma 70 of the enteric bacteria...|$|E

40|$|The <b>sigma(s)</b> <b>subunit</b> of RNA {{polymerase}} (encoded by the rpoS gene) is {{a master}} regulator in a complex regulatory network that governs the expression of many stationary-phase-induced and osmotically regulated genes in Escherichia coli. rpoS expression is itself osmotically regulated by a mechanism that operates at the posttranscriptional level. Cells growing at high osmolarity already exhibit increased levels of sigma(s) during the exponential phase of growth. Osmotic induction of rpoS can be triggered by addition of NaCl or sucrose and is alleviated by glycine betaine. Stimulation of rpoS translation and {{a change in the}} half-life of sigma(s) from 3 to 50 min both contribute to osmotic induction.
