5|$|The School of Law's inaugural class began {{classes on}} August 16, 2006. Due to a {{shortage}} of construction materials in 2006, caused {{in part by the}} need in the gulf coast due to Hurricane Katrina, construction on the building was delayed, resulting in classes being held on Drexel University's Main Campus and within the Jenkins Law Library and the auditorium of the National Constitution Center. The first class was expected to be composed of 120 students; ultimately, the inaugural class consisted of 183 <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incoming median GPA of 3.4 and a median LSAT score of 156. The newest admitted class, the class of 2014, consists of 147 <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incoming GPA of 3.38 and a median LSAT score of 159. On May 1, 2008, the Drexel University College of Law was renamed the Earle Mack School of Law in honor of Earle I. Mack, a Drexel University alumnus, after a donation of $15 million dollars.|$|E

40|$|In 1995 - 96, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{hearing loss}} {{constituted}} 0. 20 % {{of all students}} who were enrolled on programmes of study in {{higher education in the}} UK and 0. 22 % of students normally resident in the UK. Their representation varied with age, but within each ageband the representation of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing loss was markedly lower than the prevalence of hearing loss in the general population. This trend was compounded among students in ethnic minorities. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing loss tended to have been admitted with lower qualifications than <b>students</b> <b>with</b> no reported disability, but those with passes at GCE Advanced Level had similar points scores. The representation of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing loss varied inversely with their level of study, it was greater in part-time students than in full-time students, and it varied markedly across different disciplines. In first-degree programmes, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing loss were equally represented in the first and subsequent years of study; at other levels, {{they were more likely to}} choose programmes that were of only a year's duration. The representation of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing loss was lower among those who obtained qualifications than among those who did not, and <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing loss obtained slightly poorer first degrees than <b>students</b> <b>with</b> no reported disability; however, both of these results were due to differences in background variables. A hearing loss per se appears to have no effect on academic attainment...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} contemporary {{issue in}} special education {{is the extent to}} which <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability are included in all mainstream educational activities, including educational accountability. In line with other Western countries, the extent of national testing conducted by Australian schools will increase in the near future. At the moment, the participation of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability in national testing is low and it is unlikely to significantly increase without the development of clear guidelines about allowable accommodations in testing, and the development of alternative assessment protocols for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> high support needs. This paper reviews the recent literature on both accommodations and alternative testing for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability and makes a number of recommendations about the inclusion of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability in national and in school-based testing...|$|R
40|$|This study {{surveyed}} Australian preservice {{primary and}} secondary teachers to investigate their understandings and expectations about <b>students</b> <b>with</b> learning disabilities. Results show that preservice teachers form a negative attribution cycle about <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> learning disability in comparison to a positive attribution cycle formed about students without a learning disability. Furthermore, preservice teachers view <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> learning disability more from a medical model viewpoint that emphasises deficits. Thus, they are generally more positive towards <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> learning disability, less frustrated, more sympathetic, and have lower expectations of their future performances. Philosophically, their educational view towards <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> learning disability is driven by ability, rather than effort, which {{is in contrast to}} their view towards students without a learning disability. Implications for future practice and recommendations for future research will be presented...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the representation and attainment of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing loss was carried out, based upon students who were registered on undergraduate courses at the Open University during 1996. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing loss were older, {{were more likely to}} be female and had begun their studies <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower level of prior education than <b>students</b> <b>with</b> no reported disability.

40|$|Masteroppgave - Norges idrettshÃ¸gskole, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this master thesis was to write a {{research}} article concerning assessment of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability in physical education. Part I in this thesis is the supplementary theory and method being used, and part II is the research article. The main goal for this master thesis was to understand how <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability were assessed, and how they perceive the assessment process in physical education. It was also of interest {{to find out if}} there were differences between the assessments related to <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability and for those without a disability. It is based in a Norwegian context, were there is political support to front inclusion in a comprehensive school. Despite this political support for inclusion, little research has examined how teachers attempt to assess <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability. The research question for the article was: How do <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability report the assessment in physical education, and are there any differences between <b>student</b> <b>with</b> and without <b>a</b> disability concerning this? The research question was answered through an analysis of the responses given to a major questionnaire concerning assessment in physical education. In order to answer the research question, there were developed seven independent sum-variables as a tool to present the empirical results. The variables were knowledge concerning the competence aims, knowledge about the assessment criteria, engaging students in assessment for learning, feedback, perceived justice, self-reported movement during the lessons and marks in physical education. The results showed differences between <b>students</b> <b>with</b> and without disability on how they perceive the assessment. These differences confirm that teachers do not assess all students in the same way, and that teachers seem unfamiliar with how to assess <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability have less knowledge about the assessment criteria, they get less feedback, perceive the assessment as less fair, move less during lessons, and get lower marks than students without a disability.

The motivating force behind this program was to bring outstanding students from these Yugoslav Universities to the UIC and the UIUC for one month in order to introduce them to graduate programs and advanced research. The Yugoslav Student Summer Program was successful due to its strict system of pre-selection and final selection of participants. Participants were chosen {{on the basis of}} their academic success - only <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> average grade of 9.00 and higher (where the top grade was 10.00) were able to apply.

25|$|The {{option of}} {{completing}} a work term abroad {{is also a}} possibility through the University of Ottawaâ€™s co-op program. Although {{there may not be}} as many job opportunities abroad directly presented, the opportunity still remains. However, most of the work terms abroad are discovered by students themselves, outside the co-op program. Typically, the requirements remain the same as for the co-op program itself. In certain cases, additional features may be considered. If one is considering working abroad there are information sessions held to further inform students at the University of Ottawa on work term abroad possibilities. The sessions outline what students should expect, various costs of living abroad, and the challenges they may come across. Furthermore, if a student chooses to pursue a work term abroad, the University of Ottawaâ€™s co-op program offers further assistance right up to the departure date in order to ensure student success. Services offered may include meeting with a professional development specialist in order to compose a job-finding strategy, learn various success strategies, and work towards having everything ready before the departure date. In addition, training can be offered to help prepare <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> idea of what to expect, necessary documents, and further information on the work they will be completing and the country students may be traveling to.|$|E
