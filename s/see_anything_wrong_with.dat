25|$|Justice White's dissent {{argued that}} the act should have been upheld. Determining the level of {{spending}} {{by the federal government}} is a legislative function, not an executive one, he argued. Even if the power were executive, White did not <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> delegating that power to an agent as long as Congress could influence him only by a means that is subject to the Presentment and Bicameralism Clause requirements, which the act satisfied, since the Comptroller General could be influenced by Congress only through a joint resolution.|$|E
500|$|R.E.M., {{for their}} part, held no hard {{feelings}} towards Sweet. Peter Buck has said, [...] "The guy wanted to make records. I don't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> that." [...] Years later, Sweet recorded with R.E.M.'s Mike Mills on the song [...] "The Ballad of El Goodo", on the Big Star tribute Big Star, Small World. It was originally scheduled {{to come out in}} 1998, but its release was delayed until 2006. On March 26, 2011, Sweet and Mills performed the Big Star song [...] "September Gurls" [...] together live at a tribute to Big Star singer Alex Chilton; Stipe also performed at this concert, singing [...] "The Letter", by Chilton's 1960s group, the Box Tops.|$|E
500|$|Some artists {{labeled with}} the [...] "hypnagogic pop" [...] tag, such as Neon Indian and Toro Y Moi, have {{rejected}} the label or denied {{that such a}} unified style exists. The Guardian called the hypnagogic tag [...] "pretentious". New York Times writer Jon Pareles criticized the style as [...] "annoyingly noncommittal music." [...] In 2009, producer Daniel Lopatin (AKA Oneohtrix Point Never) said: [...] "I don't think the hpop tag is representative of a movement or constituted by {{a select group of}} artists. I see it more as a discussion about nostalgia and its subliminal effects on culture. I don't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the tag—it's just a way of engaging with a phenomenon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's deceiving {{at first}} because he's good to look at," [...] said Lucy. [...] "But I wouldn't own him. A saddle will turn on him. He's not vicious, but he'll never get over his scare. He's narrow between the eyes--a bad sign. His ears are stiff--and too close. I don't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> him." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nannie {{was first}} married at age 16 to Charley Braggs, her co-worker at a linen factory. With her father's {{approval}} they married {{after four months}} of dating. Braggs was the only son of a single mother who insisted on continuing {{to live with him}} after he married. Nannie later wrote: I married, as my father wished, in 1921 to a boy I only knowed about four or five months who had no family, only a mother who was unwed and who had taken over my life completely when we were married. She never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> what he done, but she would take spells. She would not let my own mother stay all night... Braggs' mother took up a lot of his attention and limited Nannie's activities. The marriage produced four daughters from 1923 to 1927. The stressed-out Nannie started drinking, and her casual smoking habit became a heavy addiction. Both unhappy partners suspected each other, correctly, of infidelity, and Braggs often disappeared for days on end.|$|R
500|$|In the album's liner notes, Gaye {{explained}} {{his views on}} the themes of sex and love, stating [...] "I can't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one {{important part of the}} magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh was {{approached}} at the Oberoi by an Indian man, {{who was also}} staying at the hotel. The man called himself [...] "John" [...] and gave no surname. John {{said he was a}} man who had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge about the team, such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US$4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed to provide information about the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place until the end of the 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> his actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a related}} event, Purefoods {{alternate}} governor Rene Pardo resigned {{as chairman of}} the PBA ethics committee as a direct offshoot of the team’s disgruntlement on the way Barrios handled the James Yap case. Pardo said that, Barrios, who suspended Yap on the same day the commissioner met with some top Sta. Lucia officials at the EDSA Shangri-la Hotel, [...] "the timing was awful. It should have been with some sense of propriety that the lunch offer was turned down." [...] Barrios on his part didn't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the lunch meeting since the meeting was done at a public place.|$|E
50|$|Through this {{catalog of}} corruption, the Commission {{concluded}} that there was systematic and widespread abuse of public trust by public officials, to the extent that many officials failed to <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> morally <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> their allocating land illegally. T*here were many centers of power which were responsible for the illegal allocation of land, yet the Commission makes it clear that the lead in public plunder has consistently been given from the top. Kenya, it concludes, has fallen into a state of ‘moral decadence’, this epitomized no more clearly than by the extensive participation in land grabbing by churches, mosques, temples and other faith institutions, these including such venerable institutions as the Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi, the Church Commission of Kenya, and the Anglican Church.|$|R

2500|$|In a {{newsletter}} published {{by a group}} calling itself [...] "The trade union of Hungarian police officers prepared for action", the following was allegedly printed: [...] "Given our current situation, anti-Semitism is not just our right, {{but it is the}} duty of every Hungarian homeland lover, and we must prepare for armed battle against the Jews." [...] The editor of the union, Judit Szima, was a Jobbik candidate in the upcoming election for the European Union parliament. Haaretz alleged Szima [...] "didn't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the content of the article." [...] Cooperation between Jobbik and the trade union led by Szima was dismantled in 2010 and since then there is no affiliation between them.|$|E
2500|$|While Buddhism {{does not}} <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> wealth gained ethically, it does see greed and craving for riches as negative, and praises contentment as 'the {{greatest}} wealth'. Poverty and debt {{are seen as}} causes of suffering, immorality and social unrest if they prevent one from having basic necessities and peace of mind. For laypeople, Buddhism promotes the middle way between a life of poverty and a materialistic or consumerist life in which one is always seeking to enrich oneself and to buy more things. For Buddhist laypersons then, to be Buddhist does not mean to reject all material things, but, according to Sizemore and Swearer: [...] "it specifies an attitude to be cultivated and expressed in whatever material condition one finds oneself. To be non-attached is to possess and use material things but not to be possessed or used by them. Therefore, the idea of non-attachment applies all across Buddhist society, to laymen and monk alike." ...|$|E

I don't know if you <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the letter, but the way Sam looked at it was that, for a first love-letter, it might have been longer and perhaps a shade warmer. And, without running any risk of writer's cramp, she might have signed it.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 November 2006, Hajduk Kula coach Nebojša Vučićević racially insulted Red Star Belgrade's Senegalese defender Ibrahima Gueye.

5000|$|In 2013, the Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that the law firm had made donations to the medical community for mesothelioma research. Dr. Harvey Pass stated during {{an interview that he}} often recommended Levy Konigsberg and several other firms to sufferers. According to the article, Jerome H.

But he doesn't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> doctors recommending attorneys with good reputations".|$|E
5000|$|This {{provoked}} its rival The Northern Argus, which {{published an}} editorial {{highly critical of}} the views expressed in The Bulletin. The editor of The Argus clearly expressed that they didn't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Griffin's head having been cut off, nor did they view the act as desecration or criminal. The editor took most offence at The Bulletin referring to Griffin as a [...] "victim", and also criticised the sexton for having another body placed above that of a murderer.|$|E

The act was not cut from all the tapes, and the Popsicle Twins incident has aired in reruns. Barris said in a 2001 interview with Salon.com that this particular act began making him reconsider his career.|$|E

Egan describes [...] "Phil Lynott" [...] as “a totally honest song about the things that happened.....one night.
