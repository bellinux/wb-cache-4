5|$|Scarborough is at {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway system. There are three subway stations in Scarborough: Victoria Park, Warden, and Kennedy. Beginning at Kennedy station, Line 3 Scarborough, {{also known as the}} Scarborough RT, runs north and east toward Scarborough City Centre. It runs at grade for two stops until Ellesmere Road where it becomes elevated until it reaches its terminus at McCowan Road. The system is nearing the end of its life and the city is planning an extension of the Line 2 Bloor–Danforth subway line to Scarborough Centre with construction slated to commence in 2018. In addition to the <b>subway</b> <b>and</b> RT, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) runs an extensive bus network throughout Scarborough. Many of the bus lines run to and from the <b>subway</b> <b>and</b> RT stations.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} runs {{in its own}} right-of-way on a route {{similar to}} that of the Dulles Access Road, running both at grade and via aerial structures.

The City wanted to get funding before July 2005, at which time the International Olympic Committee would vote on funding. However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> <b>and</b> East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After a proposal for the West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West Side Yard, was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid.|$|E

5|$|The hotel {{had its own}} railway platform, Track 61, {{that was}} part of the New York City <b>Subway</b> <b>and</b> was {{connected}} to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform. However, it is rarely opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened on}} December 31, 1936 {{as the new}} {{terminal}} for the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard Line. The opening of the station brought significant growth to the adjacent communities of Forest Hills and Kew Gardens, transforming them from quiet residential communities to active population centers. Today, the station serves as a major transfer point between the <b>subway</b> <b>and</b> local buses. Bus service to eastern Queens or southern-central Queens {{is provided by the}} Q46, and the Q10 and Q37, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's first railway was a 4km Victorian {{broad gauge}} {{line between the}} Melbourne (or City) Terminus (on the site of modern-day Flinders Street station) and Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), {{constructed}} by the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company and opened in September 1854. Today, Melbourne's suburban railway network consists of 16 electrified lines, the central City Loop <b>subway,</b> <b>and</b> 200 stations, with a total length of 372km of the electrified lines, operated by Metro Trains Melbourne under franchise to the Government of Victoria.|$|E

5|$|While {{awaiting}} the first delivery of stone, Simson {{noticed that the}} battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve {{a portion of the}} battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange <b>Subway</b> <b>and,</b> after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed electric lighting.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} restructuring, 3G {{also moved}} to change many aspects of {{corporate}} operations throughout 2011-2012. One of the first moves was to terminate Burger King's relationship with ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, replacing it with McGarryBowen. 3G also began a menu restructuring, with the first product being a revamped version of BK's Chicken Tenders product. Other new or reformulated products would follow. In terms of its franchise operations, Burger King initiated a move to become more like competitors <b>Subway</b> <b>and</b> KFC and began to sell off the majority of corporately owned restaurants {{in order to become}} an exclusive franchised operation. 3G also moved to mend relations with its American franchises, which had become rather rancorous during TPG's tenure. Several lawsuits were settled and corporate policies that were {{at the center of the}} corporate disputes with the franchises were ended or amended.|$|E
5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} <b>subway</b> <b>and</b> bus systems, for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E

5|$|However, in 2007, {{construction}} resumed on the Second Avenue <b>Subway,</b> <b>and</b> {{as part of}} the line's construction, the BMT side of {{the station}} would finally be used. The orange wall was removed and replaced by a temporary barrier. Beige-white wall tiles were installed on the station walls adjacent to the tracks. The never-opened entrance at Third Avenue was redesigned with multiple elevators, and the station's false ceiling was removed. Before Second Avenue Subway service began operating, the temporary walls were removed, revealing the BMT side of the station. On January 1, 2017, {{the first phase of the}} Second Avenue Subway opened, with Q trains, and limited rush hour N trains serving the BMT half of the station. Ridership has increased at the station with the opening of the Third Avenue exit and the introduction of Q service. Many passengers now take advantage of the cross-platform transfer available between the F and the Q.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the Royal Mail built a mail {{conveyor}} {{at the northern}} end of the station, with significant aesthetic impact. This was out of use for many years following the transfer of Royal Mail's activities to the West of England Mail Centre at Filton and the opening of the short-lived Railnet Hub next to Bristol Parkway station in May 2000. It was finally dismantled in stages and removed between October and December 2014. In 1990/91, £2 million was spent by InterCity on a renovation of the main train shed and another £7 million on restoring some of the older areas of the station, including the refurbishment of the <b>subway</b> <b>and</b> construction of new retail outlets. The shorter of the two 1935 platform islands had been used only for parcels traffic since the 1960s but was temporarily brought back into passenger use during this work. It was fully restored for passenger use in 2001.|$|E

Scully tells Doggett to pour water on it, which stops the flashes. Lyle takes the badly injured Melnick to the surface and Doggett continues onward with Bianco. When Melnick returns to the surface, he seems to be getting worse, but Lyle appears healthy. Scully then sees the three bodies being taken away by non-CDC hazmat people. When Scully confronts Karras about this, he says that he is organizing it. Scully tells Karras that she has already organized the CDC to collect the bodies and accuses Karras of attempting a cover-up. Although Karras tries to deny his involvement, he eventually allows her to send the bodies to the actual CDC.|$|E
