50|$|It is the {{advantage}} of the <b>stealth</b> <b>dicing</b> process that it does not require a cooling liquid. Dry dicing methods inevitably have to be applied for the preparation of certain microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), in particular, when these are intended for bioelectronic applications. In addition, <b>stealth</b> <b>dicing</b> hardly generates debris and allows for improved exploitation of the wafer surface due to smaller kerf loss compared to wafer saw.|$|E

50|$|Dicing {{of silicon}} wafers {{may also be}} {{performed}} by a laser-based technique, the so-called <b>stealth</b> <b>dicing</b> process. It works as a two-stage process in which defect regions are firstly introduced into the wafer by scanning the beam along intended cutting lines and secondly an underlying carrier membrane is expanded to induce fracture.|$|E
50|$|After {{preparing}} {{a large number}} of MEMS devices on a silicon wafer, individual dies have to be separated, which is called die preparation in semiconductor technology. For some applications, the separation is preceded by wafer backgrinding {{in order to reduce the}} wafer thickness. Wafer dicing may then be performed either by sawing using a cooling liquid or a dry laser process called <b>stealth</b> <b>dicing.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Stealth</b> <b>dicing</b> {{appears to}} be the {{appropriate}} methode to singulate surface sensitive microelectromechanical devices, without producing dicing debris or using water jet. The operating mode of the <b>stealth</b> <b>dicing</b> will be explained. A three dimensional integration project with open micromachined structures is taken as a reference to evaluate the advantages and limitations of this new dicing method. The preconditions for successful singulations will be discussed. Optical and SEM inspection results after successful separation will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{original work}} {{in the development of}} multi-strata subsurface infrared (1. 342 [mu]m) nanosecond pulsed laser die singulation (<b>stealth</b> <b>dicing)</b> to enable defect-free ultra-thin stacked memory dies. The over-arching contribution is the first comprehensive and systematic experimental study of <b>stealth</b> <b>dicing,</b> encompassing process physics and simulation, characterization, optimization, and integration, as well as operations management, including statistical process control, sensitivities, interactions, and risk analysis. This work exploits the multi-strata interactions between generated thermal shockwaves and the preceding dislocation layers formed to initiate controlled crack fractures that separate the individual dies from within the interior of the wafer as a method for significant singulation-related defect reduction and die strength enhancement. A new partial-stealth dicing before grinding (p-SDBG) integration based upon the tandem use of three-strata <b>stealth</b> <b>dicing</b> followed by static loading from backgrinding to complete full kerf separation has successfully demonstrated defect-free eight die stacks of 25 and 46 [mu]m thick 2 D NAND memory dies on high backside reflectance wafers for the first time. This work resulted in a 3. 5 % mean increase in memory/system test yield and has been used to realize production-worthy 64 GB retail memory products after passing reliability tests. Based on unit loadings at SanDisk Shanghai for 2014, this translates to annual cost savings averaging $ 12.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years the backend {{assembly}} process has become increasingly complex in order to add more value to products. Two processes that are linked to the changes in assembly are wafer thinning and dicing. Ultra thin stacked die and the implementation of TSVs are driving improvements to the traditional stress relief and fixed abrasive grinding processes. Both CMP (Chemo-Mechanical Polishing) and MCP (Mechano-Chemical Polishing) are being used. Wafer dicing has a number of products and processes behind its evolution. Thin and stacked die with DAF (Die Attach Film) require modifications to existing blade dicing processes. Low-k and copper wafers are requiring the use of lasers to remove materials from the dicing streets. A new and alternative laser dicing process called <b>Stealth</b> <b>Dicing</b> is an enabling technology for a number of products...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical blade dicing is a {{state-of-the-art}} technique for the chip separation of SiC devices. Due to the hardness of SiC this technique suffers from low feed rate and high wear of the diamond coated dicing blade, {{resulting in the}} risk of uncontrolled tool breakage during the dicing process. With the upcoming transition to 150 mm diameter of SiC wafers this technique will most probably reach its limit. For dicing SiC wafers of those diameters on a productive scale three alternative dicing technologies are considered in this paper: ablation laser dicing, <b>Stealth</b> <b>Dicing</b> and Thermal Laser Separation. All these methods are based on laser processing. The benefits of these technologies are discussed in detail and compared to the classical mechanical diamond blade dicing, including a brief summary of first experimental results on each of the three laser dicing technologies...|$|E
40|$|When a {{nanosecond}} pulse laser is irradiated into {{a single}} crystal silicon, a local area near the focal point is melted and solidified, and internal cracks develop from this modified layer to the surrounding single crystal layer. This processing is applied to a dicing of silicon wafer, which is called <b>stealth</b> <b>dicing</b> (SD) and attracts attention in industries of semiconductor. A light of 1064 nm penetrates usually through a single crystal silicon. When a pulsed laser of this wavelength with high pulse energy is focused up to near the diffraction limit inside the silicon, however, strong absorption occurs near the focal point. This phenomenon depends on not only increase of beam intensity by focusing but also the temperature dependence of absorption coefficient. We conducted the thermo-elastic-plastic analysis by the finite element method, and calculated the stress intensity factor. As a result, the stress intensity factor exceeds the fracture toughness of a silicon. This result suggests the possibility of crack development from the modified layer to the surrounding single crystal layer...|$|E
