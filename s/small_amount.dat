5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of {{quarrying}} activity {{takes place}} in the city, with 46 active mines and quarries in Gyeongju. Most are engaged in the extraction of kaolin, fluorspar and Agalmatolite and Kaolin is exported.|$|E
5|$|Aaron and Abe require {{palladium}} {{to build}} their machine. This is the reason they take the catalytic converter containing a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of palladium from a car.|$|E
5|$|Chirality {{can also}} be {{incorporated}} into a phase by adding a chiral dopant, which may not form LCs itself. Twisted-nematic or super-twisted nematic mixtures often contain a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of such dopants.|$|E
50|$|Trade between Tanzania and North Korea is not substantial. Tanzania only exports <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> {{of coffee}} to North Korea and North Korea exports <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of medical {{instruments}} or pharmaceuticals.|$|R
50|$|First, sulfur {{compounds}} were severely restricted. <b>Small</b> <b>amounts</b> {{of sulfur}} are naturally present in fossil fuels. It was known that sulfur and sulfur compounds attack metals at high temperatures. In addition, even <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of sulfur assist polymerization.|$|R
50|$|<b>Small</b> <b>amounts</b> of gas {{within a}} vacuum tube will ionize, causing {{undesired}} conduction leading to major malfunction. <b>Small</b> <b>amounts</b> of gas within a vacuum insulated panel can greatly compromise its insulation value. Getters help {{to maintain the}} vacuum.|$|R
5|$|Deep spectroscopic {{analysis}} of NGC 6543 {{may indicate that}} the nebula contains a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of material which is highly enriched in heavy elements; this is discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Even in 2011, the Filwood ward {{was still}} an area with a {{relatively}} <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of ethnic minorities, with 85.8 per cent of the 12,267 residents being White British.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a <b>small</b> <b>amount,</b> 40 to 270ppm, of vanadium in Wootz steel and Damascus steel significantly improved {{the strength of the}} product, though the source of the vanadium is unclear.|$|E
5|$|<b>Small</b> <b>amounts</b> of CO are {{beneficial}} and enzymes {{exist that}} produce it {{at times of}} oxidative stress. Drugs are being developed to introduce <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of CO during certain kinds of surgery, these drugs are called carbon monoxide-releasing molecules.|$|R

50|$|Aluminosilicate {{glass or}} vitroceramic glass, {{contains}} 20% aluminium oxide (alumina-Al2O3) often including calcium oxide, magnesium oxide and boric oxide in relatively <b>small</b> <b>amounts,</b> but with only very <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of soda or potash. It {{is able to}} withstand temperatures as high as 750 °C.|$|R
5|$|The sealed {{spark gap}} {{assemblies}} in ignition exciters in some older jet engines contain a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of krypton-85 to produce consistent ionization levels and uniform operation.|$|E
5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of {{industrial}} production involves wet chemical processes, which start with aqueous solutions of zinc salts, from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated. The solid precipitate is then calcined at temperatures around 800°C.|$|E
5|$|At high {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 20atm or twoMPa), {{a mixture of}} helium and oxygen (heliox) can lead to high-pressure nervous syndrome, a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.|$|E
50|$|Divisibility: Coins can {{be easily}} spent or traded in <b>small</b> <b>amounts.</b> In contrast, minted silver bullion is rarely smaller than a troy ounce, while minted gold bullion (and other {{precious}} metals) is highly valued in even <b>small</b> <b>amounts,</b> like the American Gold Eagle coins.|$|R
50|$|Gatehouseite has {{the space}} group P212121. The crystal {{structure}} consists of Mn(O, OH)6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The five manganese sites are occupied by manganese and <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of magnesium. The two phosphorus sites are occupied by phosphorus and <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of silicon and arsenic.|$|R

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} drinking ethylene glycol. Early symptoms include intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain. Later symptoms may include a decreased level of consciousness, headache, and seizures. Long term outcomes may include kidney failure and brain damage. Toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a <b>small</b> <b>amount.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of gene flow may remove genetic differences between {{parts of a}} population. Generally, {{sympatric speciation}} in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.|$|E
5|$|First {{recorded}} and surveyed in 1840, North Island {{has been a}} seasonal camp for western rock lobster fishermen {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, and this remains the principal focus of human activity on the island. There is also a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of tourism, though for the most part it is reserved as conservation habitat for vegetation communities and rare birds.|$|E
50|$|Just like regular Bordeaux {{these are}} blends, with the reds being {{predominantly}} Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts</b> of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec {{and even some}} Carmenere. For the whites Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon are favored with <b>smaller</b> <b>amounts</b> of Muscadelle, Ugni Blanc, and Sauvignon Gris.|$|R

5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being potassium and a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, such as the Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as a by-product from pollucite.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{produced}} between 1930 and 1945 {{was about}} 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen), which was adequate for airships. In 1945, a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.|$|E

Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating {{the age of the}} Earth.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium reacts violently {{with water}} and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass {{ampoules}} in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> of air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second lift arrived, the first supply drop was made onto LZ 'L'. Although most {{supplies}} arrived, only a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> could be collected as the area was not under full British control. The poor radio communication meant {{that it was not}} possible to alert the RAF and unsecured drop zones would be a major problem in the days to come.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a regular}} {{practice}} to give <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> of beer to race horses in Ireland. Ruminant farm animals have natural fermentation occurring in their stomach, and adding alcoholic beverages in <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> to their drink will generally do them no harm, and will not cause them to become drunk.|$|R
