A topic on Self Assessment System (SAS) is added so as to help employers and individual taxpayers in comprehending their responsibilities as well as helping the employers in managing tax payments for their employees. The <b>Schedular</b> <b>Tax</b> Deduction (STD) scheme is the main focus under the Self Assessment System in order to settle the tax payment to the Inland Revenue Board (IRB), thus a better understanding on the system is crucial. The content of this book {{is based on the}} implementation by IRBM through the provision of Statement of Tax Deductions under Income Tax (Deduction from Remunerations) Rules 1994 [DFR 1994]. Most examples shown in this book are based on examples provided by IRB for 2009 to ensure that readers are able to easily understand the effort done by them. Examples on calculations of the amount that must be deducted under the STD scheme is also included apart from the brief explanation on the application of eCP 39 and STD software program issued by the IRB...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Indonesian's income tax reforms and the {{development}} of Indonesian's income tax revenues in the period of 1983 - 2011. It points out two key features of the Indonesian's income tax reforms: 1) the tax reforms have embraced tax rates cutting and tax bases broadening apcomprehensive income tax system toward the <b>schedular</b> <b>tax</b> system. Then, regarding tax revenues, data shows that the Indonesian's nominal income tax revenues have increased considerably during that period; however they {{have not been able to}} increase Indonesian's income tax ratios significantly. This phenomenon indicates that even though the income tax reforms did have positive effects on increasing the income tax revenues, they were not the only factors for the steep increase of Indonesian's nominal income tax revenues. This paper shows that Indonesian's relatively high inflation rates and high economic growth during that period have considerably contributed to the steep increases of income tax revenues. At the end, in order to increase the Indonesian's income tax revenues fur- ther, this paper notes that beside tax regulation reform, it is equally necessary to promote public tax awareness, tax authorities' professionalism and integrity, and the implementation of governance practices in Indonesian's bureaucracy...|$|E
40|$|In Malaysia, the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system, {{known as}} the <b>Schedular</b> <b>Tax</b> Deduction Scheme (STD) or ‘Potongan Cukai Berjadual (PCB) ’ in the Malay Language, was first {{introduced}} in 1995 through Income Tax (Deduction from Remuneration) Rules 1994. The STD scheme shifts the responsibility of tax collection from the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) to the employers who are now charged with the duty to deduct monthly taxes from employees and to remit the amount to IRB by the 10 th of the following month. The aim is to ensure an efficient manner of collecting tax from employees through salary deductions by employers. The STD scheme is central to employees {{in the era of}} Self Assessment System (SAS), which takes effect from 2004. However, since its introduction in 1995, it is not known whether the implementation of STD scheme in Malaysia has achieved its intended purpose or not particularly on SMEs. The cost of compliance for the employers under the STD system is also unknown. As far as this study is concerned, there has been no empirical study conducted to find out the compliance costs borne by the employers of SMEs under the administration of the STD system. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} find out the compliance costs borne by employers of SMEs under the STD system. Findings from this study have shown that smaller size SMEs incurred a high compliance cost compare to a larger size SMEs. This exploratory attempt is essential to provide preliminary strategic information to policy makers in the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) to examine the relevancy of STD system on SMEs thus improve the efficiency and productivity of the STD administration system without putting the burden especially on smaller SMEs. In addition, it further pointed to the associated costs that are currently faced by the employers of SMEs in trying to comply with the STD system...|$|E

Whereas, under the“traditional view”, closer {{integration of the}} corporate and personalincome tax systems is suggested, an alternative policy orientationemphasizing the non-distorting features of the classical system is impliedby the “new view”.

40|$|This article {{examines}} a specific category of legal transfers between the United Kingdom and Canada, considering {{the legacy of}} UK tax concepts in Canadian income tax law. Two main areas are considered where, in our view, this influence has been most profound: (i) the concept of income deployed for Canadian tax purposes; and (ii) judicial approaches to statutory interpretation and tax avoidance. Although the rules and concepts that Canadian courts and legislatures have adopted {{in each of these}} areas have necessarily evolved over time, the path of this evolution as well as current approaches reflect the enduring influence of UK tax concepts on Canadian income tax law. The first substantive section examines the structure and concept of income in Canadian tax law, linking its origins and development to the global and <b>schedular</b> <b>taxes</b> that were adopted in the United Kingdom in 1799 and 1803, and to the source and trust concepts that UK courts have employed to interpret the meaning of income for tax purposes. The next section considers judicial approaches to the interpretation of tax statutes and tax avoidance in Canada, tracing the origins of a strict construction approach to interpretation and a formalistic approach to the characterisation of transactions and relationships to early judicial decisions in the UK, and explaining the influence of this traditional approach on subsequent legislative and judicial developments. The final section concludes that the traditional approach endures, albeit uneasily, in Canadian income tax law in the continuing emphasis on textual interpretation of tax legislation and in the formalist application of the general anti-avoidance rule by the Supreme Court of Canada...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} the arguments {{in favor of}} a shift from comprehensive to dual income taxation and complements the discussion by an overview of tax reforms, which reveals the characteristic features of a dual income tax system. The scope of our analysis is not restricted to the Nordic countries; we also include other European countries whose tax reform steps can be regarded as a move toward a dual income tax. We focus on problems of running a final withholding income tax regime under individual and household taxation, including the most recent dual-income-tax reforms in the Nordic countries, but nevertheless argue that it may be worthwhile for the EU Commission to consider dual income taxation as a blueprint for income tax coordination in the EU. income tax reform, dual income <b>tax,</b> <b>schedular</b> income taxation...|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong {{is known}} for its simple and low rate tax system. Its current <b>schedular</b> income <b>tax</b> {{mechanism}} has its origin from the United Kingdom back in the 1940 s. When capital gains tax (CGT) was introduced in the UK in 1965, no similar step was taken in Hong Kong. The economic and social conditions underlying the original design of the system have changed dramatically over the years and will continue to change, but the system itself remains largely the same without much reform to keep pace with these changes. Furthermore, recent years have seen Hong Kong develop one of the world’s least affordable housing markets, exerting a profound influence on the prospects of the city and its people, particularly the younger generation. Among other things, the tax measures undertaken by the Hong Kong government in tackling the situation focus solely on stamp duty levied on transactions involving residential properties. This paper argues for the need to introduce in Hong Kong a CGT with Hong Kong characteristics with a view to reducing speculative property investment, stabilising the housing market and alleviating the social divide between the rich and the poor. The stamp duty changes in recent years show that the tax system in Hong Kong is not wholly immune from changes and in fact Hong Kong people are not necessarily resistant to any of such changes. This paper also provides a design of the proposed CGT, with references to its equivalent in the United Kingdom (UK) and taking into account the peculiar Hong Kong circumstances and characteristics...|$|R
