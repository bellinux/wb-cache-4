Transaction costs from measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions, permit trading and general informational costs are considered. Transaction costs from MRV and permit trading are of non-linear form and dependent on annual emission and trading volumes based on OLS and nonparametric estimation. As a consequence of non-linear {{transaction costs}}, welfare losses occur compared to a first-best setup under zero transaction costs. In practice, <b>smaller</b> <b>emitters</b> will emit less (abate more) compared to larger emitters and vice versa due to economies of scale {{in the management of}} emissions trading. The results further imply that optimal firm size might be influenced by transaction costs in the EU ETS because of relatively high average transaction costs amongst <b>smaller</b> <b>emitters.</b> Overall annual transaction costs in the EU ETS in Germany are estimated to be EUR 8. 7 million. ...|$|R

40|$|There is extreme {{heterogeneity}} of firms regulated under the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) {{in terms of}} emissions evels and employed technology. We present a model that shows that behavior of firms under quantity regulation can differ strongly, dependent {{on the characteristics of}} the firms when the assumption of full information is relaxed. If there are informational costs with regard to abatement options and costs, relatively <b>small</b> <b>emitters</b> and emitters with relatively complex technology will face a threshold for evaluating abatement options and costs. We compare the EU ETS to the US SO 2 trading scheme and show that 'adjoining' markets to quantity regulation, supplying goods (i. e. abatement technology) or services (i. e. assistance in permit trading), play a crucial role to reduce transactions costs. Given high complexity of technology and/or strongly limited demand for certain technologies, markets will fail to provide appropriate assistance, generating efficiency losses. The presence of technological complexity and heterogeneous firms can have major consequences for the design of environmental regulation, when considering transaction costs.

40|$|Independence of installation-level {{emissions}} from endowments of allowances allocated for free constitutes {{a necessary condition}} for the cost-effectiveness of a cap-and-trade system. A causal relationship between allocations and emissions suggests the presence of an endowment effect induced by free allocation and indicates a loss in cost effectiveness. The issue is relevant to the EU's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), where a large share of the total allocation occurs for free. This paper tests for the presence of an endowment effect among European electricity sector plants as regulated under the EU ETS by evaluating whether growth in plant-level emissions of power generators changed due to a switch from free allocation to full auctioning. To overcome the endogeneity of allocations I exploit a natural experiment inducing exogenous variation in the allocation of allowances to power producers. While electricity producers located in EU- 15 countries were subject to full auctioning starting in 2013, free allocation continued under the so-called 10 c rule in eight member states. I apply a matched difference-in-differences research design to a unique EU-wide plant-level dataset of emissions and technical characteristics, constructing a synthetic control group. I find no evidence of a general endowment effect. However, there is some evidence in favor of an endowment effect for a sub-sample of <b>small</b> <b>emitters...</b>|$|E
40|$|International offset {{certificates}} have systematically traded at a {{lower price}} than European Union Allowances (EUAs), although they are perfect substitutes. Firms therefore had a strong incentive to use the cheaper certificates up to the maximum quantity fixed by the regulator. This study highlights that a considerable number of firms did not use their offset credit entitlement and by doing so seemingly forwent profits, which supports the idea that significant transaction costs exist in carbon permit trade. While most of the literature on emission trading evaluates the efficiency of regulation in a frictionless world, firms in reality face managerial costs of compliance with regulation. This study examines the use of international offset credits within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) for carbon dioxide, in order to assess the relevance of such managerial and information-related transaction costs. This study further establishes a model of firm decision under fixed entry costs and estimates the size of transaction costs rationalizing firm behavior using both standard parametric and semi-parametric binary quantile regression methods. These costs appear to be sizable and make active optimization of compliance unprofitable for many <b>small</b> <b>emitters.</b> It appears that a large portion of these transaction costs stems from participation in the EU ETS in general, rather than additional participation in the offset trade...|$|E
40|$|Randomly {{oriented}} relativistic emitters in a relativistically expanding shell {{provide an}} alternative to internal shocks as a mechanism for producing gamma-ray bursts' variable light curves with efficient conversion of energy to radiation. In this model, the relativistic outflow is broken into <b>small</b> <b>emitters</b> moving relativistically in the outflow's rest frame. Variability arises because an observer sees an emitter only when its velocity points toward him so {{that only a small}} fraction of the emitters is seen by a given observer. Significant relativistic random motion requires that a large fraction of the overall energy is converted to random kinetic energy and is maintained in this form. While it is not clear how this is achieved, we explore here, using two toy models, the constraints on parameters required to produce light curves comparable to the observations. We find that a tight relation between the size of the emitters, and the bulk and random Lorentz factors is needed and that the random Lorentz factor determines the variability. While both models successfully produce the observed variability there are several inconsistencies with other properties of the light curves. Most of which, but not all, might be resolved if the central engine is active for a long time, producing a number of shells, resembling to some extent the internal shocks model...|$|E

40|$|The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the {{cornerstone}} of the European Union's climate policy and covers just under half of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. More than ten years since the EU ETS was first introduced, there continues to be substantial research interest regarding its functioning and the behavior of participating companies. DIW Berlin conducted three econometric studies based on microdata at company and/or installation level. The findings suggest that, overall, there are only minor distortions in the behavior of companies regulated by the EU ETS. However, the studies also show that small companies exhibit distinctive behavior which could result in inefficiencies. For instance, during Trading Phase I, small companies participated less actively in trading allowances than companies with a higher turnover. Moreover, the emissions produced by small power plants depend, to a certain extent, on the allocation rules. Small companies also often fail {{to take full advantage of}} the cost reduction potential of international offset credits: for a total of 22 percent of all companies (predominantly <b>small</b> <b>emitters),</b> an average of 31, 000 euros in cost reduction potential remained unused.

The use of optic fibers offers a low-cost alternative to traditional copper-wire harnesses. This paper presents a bidirectional, alignment-tolerant optoelectronic interconnect for automotive applications. The proposed interconnect offers a low manufacturing potential cost because it uses inexpensive alignment tolerant large core plastic fiber for ease of connector alignment. The optoelectronic interface chip uses time-division multiplexing to combine several information sources into a serial data stream that can be easily decoded by a microcontroller. By using a colocated <b>small</b> <b>emitter</b> in the middle of a large detector, the system achieves both bidirectional communication on a single fiber and alignment tolerant capabilities. Results show that this optoelectronic interconnect is a feasible replacement for wire harnesses in automobiles. Index Terms—Alignment tolerant link, bidirectional single fiber links, large core plastic optic fibers, low-cost automotive link, optoelectronic interconnect. I...|$|R
