5|$|His {{international}} breakthrough {{came at the}} 2001 Wimbledon Championships where a 19 {{year old}} Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader Pete Sampras. The teenage Swiss stunned the seven time Wimbledon champion and #1 seed in a dramatic five set epic to reach the quarterfinals. In the quarters he faced Englishman Tim Henman, eventually losing in an overtime fourth set tiebreaker. Federer's breakthrough at Wimbledon <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> record breaking dominance he would display at the All England Club {{over the next two}} decades.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Congress {{repealed}} termination {{and restored}} federal {{recognition of the}} Menominee tribe. The Menominee Restoration Act was signed by Richard Nixon; it repealed the Menominee Indian Termination Act, reopened the tribal rolls, re-established the trust status and provided for the reformation of tribal government. The tribe was the first terminated tribe to be restored to trust and recognition status. The Restoration Act <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> end of the termination era.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} additionally comprises {{a method}} and apparatus for generating and mixing signals for frequency-domain lifetime and spectral fluorometry. The present invention comprises {{a plurality of}} signal generators that generate a plurality of <b>signals</b> where <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> generators modulate <b>the</b> amplitude and/or the frequency of <b>the</b> <b>signals.</b> <b>The</b> present invention uses one of these signals to drive an excitation <b>signal</b> that <b>the</b> present invention then directs and transmits at a target mixture, which absorbs the energy from <b>the</b> excitation <b>signal.</b> <b>The</b> property of fluorescence causes the target mixture to emit an emitted <b>signal</b> that <b>the</b> present invention detects with a <b>signal</b> detector. <b>The</b> present invention uses a plurality of mixers to produce a processor reference signal and a data <b>signal.</b> <b>The</b> present invention then uses a processor to compare <b>the</b> processor reference <b>signal</b> with <b>the</b> data <b>signal</b> by analyzing <b>the</b> differences in the phase and {{the differences in the}} amplitude between <b>the</b> two <b>signals.</b> <b>The</b> processor then extracts the fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence spectrum of <b>the</b> emitted <b>signal</b> from <b>the</b> phase and amplitude information using a chemometric analysis...|$|R
5|$|In addition, Mermaid <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> {{re-establishment}} of {{the musical}} film format as a standard for Disney animated films. The majority of Disney's most popular animated films from the 1930s on had been musicals, though by the 1970s and 1980s the role of music had been de-emphasized in the films. 1988's Oliver & Company {{had served as a}} test of sorts to the success {{of the musical}} format before Disney committed to the Broadway-style structure of The Little Mermaid.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month of Ramadan, the Musaher {{of a town}} would yell and beat his drum to wake up the town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit. 'of dawn')—usually {{very early in the}} morning, ranging from 4-6 am. The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E
5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the end for these mystics.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, he {{was briefly}} {{minister without portfolio}} in the cabinet of Premier Miron Cristea, created by Carol to combat the ascension of the Iron Guard, and opposed the monarch's option to renounce the 1923 Constitution and proclaim his dictatorship (the latter move <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> end of the People's Party), but was among the figures displayed by Carol's regime. He died soon after in Bucharest, and {{was buried in the}} World War I heroes' crypt in Mărăști. In December, the king created the National Renaissance Front as the political instrument of his authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|Although the Colorados had {{defected}} to the Flores insurgency, {{the national guard}} continued to support the fusionist government. Blanco partisans filled its depleted ranks. They also replaced army officers who had deserted to Flores. The Blancos received aid from several Argentine Federalists who joined their cause. As in Uruguay, Argentina had long been a battleground of rival parties, and Bartolomé Mitre's victory at Pavón in 1861 had <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> triumph of his Unitarian Party over the Federal Party led by Justo José de Urquiza. Mitre denied any involvement in the Flores rebellion, even though his complicity was widely known and taken for granted.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, {{the treaty}} pushed American {{diplomatic}} relations away from France and towards Great Britain, as the French government {{concluded that it}} violated the Franco-American treaty of 1778, and that the U.S. government had accepted the treaty against the overwhelming public sentiment against it. This set {{up a series of}} diplomatic and political conflicts over the ensuing four years, culminating in {{what became known as the}} Quasi-War. The Jay Treaty also helped ensure American control of its own frontier lands. After the signing of treaty, the British withdrew their support from several Native Americans tribes, while the Spanish, fearing that the Jay Treaty <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> creation of an Anglo-American alliance, sought to appease the United States.|$|E
5|$|Mount St. Helens {{remained}} dormant {{from its}} last {{period of activity}} in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial reading was 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank, <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> volcano's violent return from 123years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels {{in the next two}} days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.|$|E
5|$|Nixon ended American {{involvement}} {{in the war in}} Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home, and ended the military draft. Nixon's visit to China in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from Washington D.C. to the states. He imposed wage and price controls for ninety days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing, which <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> end of the moon race. He was reelected in one of the largest electoral landslides in U.S. history in 1972 when he defeated George McGovern.|$|E

5|$|As the Japanese ships {{continued}} to pound the Tsesarevich, the battleship , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet, boldly charged Tōgō's battleline {{in an attempt}} to divert the Japanese shellfire. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away. Ukhtomsky <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized. Peresvet received a total of 39 hits of all sizes that killed 13 men and wounded 69. Her forward 12-inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding; compartments of the double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her stability. Repairs took until late September.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{took office}} on 25 May 2003. Roberto Lavagna, {{credited}} with the economic recovery during Duhalde's presidency, was retained as minister of economy and continued his economic policies. Argentina negotiated a swap of defaulted debt and repaid the International Monetary Fund. The National Institute of Statistics and Census intervened to underestimate growing inflation. Several Supreme Court judges resigned while fearing impeachment, and new justices were appointed. The amnesty for crimes committed during the Dirty War in enforcing the full-stop and due-obedience laws and the presidential pardons were repealed and declared unconstitutional. This led to new trials for the military who served during the 1970s. Argentina increased its integration with other Latin American countries, discontinuing its automatic alignment with the United States dating to the 1990s. The 2005 midterm elections were a victory for Kirchner, and <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> end of Duhalde's supremacy in Buenos Aires Province.|$|E
5|$|On August 4, Governor General Manuel Macías y Casado sent Colonel Pedro del Pino {{and about}} 220 troops, {{including}} civil guardsmen {{to recapture the}} city. When Colonel Pino entered Fajardo on August 7, he found it nearly deserted because the residents, fearing a battle, had fled to the Fajardo Light and the surrounding hills. At close to midnight on August 8, Pino's troops began their assault on the lighthouse. The landing party of Amphitrite's sailors occupying the lighthouse doused the light and <b>signaled</b> <b>the</b> ships offshore, initiating shore bombardment as the naval guns began firing a protective pattern. After two hours, the Spanish forces retreated back to the town. The Americans suffered no casualties, despite a close call when a wayward naval shell smashed through the 2-foot thick walls of the lighthouse within touch of 6 men but failed to explode. The Spanish losses were 2 dead and 3 wounded, including a lieutenant.|$|E
