40|$|Proteinase {{treatment}} with chymotrypsin {{has been used}} to probe the structure of native Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase MoFe protein (Kp 1). Reaction with chymotrypsin did not bleach Kp 1, suggesting that it did not destroy the metal centres, and the Mo and Fe contents <b>of</b> <b>Kp</b> 1 were unchanged. High ratios <b>of</b> chymotrypsin to <b>Kp</b> 1 (1 : 1 by mass) cleaved the beta-chain <b>of</b> <b>Kp</b> 1 to give 44 and 14 kDa polypeptides, which N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed to be derived from cleavage at residue beta-Phe 124. A mutant MoFe protein, Kp 1 Met- 124, in which beta-Phe 124 is replaced by methionine, was not cleaved by chymotrypsin. Under non-denaturing conditions, the 'nicked' beta-chain of the wild-type protein remained associated with the alpha-chain. The alpha-chain was not cleaved by the proteinase treatment. Fission of the wild-type beta-chain was accompanied by loss <b>of</b> enzyme <b>activity,</b> loss <b>of</b> intensity of the g = 3. 7 e. p. r. signal derived from dithionite-reduced FeMoco and by changes in the visible spectrum. The e. p. r. spectra of potassium ferricyanide-oxidized native and digested Kp 1 show differences in the signals between g = 1. 6 and 2. 0. After prolonged treatment, the final specific <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kp</b> 1 was about 25 +/- 5 % <b>of</b> the initial <b>activity.</b> This corresponded to 25 +/- 5 % of the beta-chain which was resistant to proteolytic action. Brief treatment <b>of</b> <b>Kp</b> 1 with a lower concentration of chymotrypsin (chymotrypsin/Kp 1 ratio = 1 : 10 by mass, for 10 min) preferentially cleaved high-molecular-mass polypeptides that routinely contaminate preparations <b>of</b> <b>Kp</b> 1 prepared by standard procedures. Treatment with chymotrypsin followed by gel filtration to remove the proteinase and cleaved protein fragments can therefore be used to increase significantly the specific <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kp</b> 1 preparations and remove contaminating activities, such as the ATPase <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> myokinase...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To verify {{whether a}} {{synthetic}} therapeutic killer decapeptide (KP), a functional mimotope of a yeast killer toxin with wide-spectrum microbicidal <b>activity,</b> inclusive <b>of</b> AIDS-related opportunistic micro-organ isms, through interaction with P-glucan receptors, {{which has been}} found to possess sequence homology with critical segments in gp 160 V 1 /V 2 and V 3 loops, may also be inhibiting HIV- 1 replication. Methods: Primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultures established from HIV- 1 -infected patients were treated with KP in comparison with zidovudine and supernatants and cells were harvested for analysis of HIV RNA and proviral contents, respectively. Virus production in exogenous in-vitro PBMCs infection with lymphocytotropic and monocytotropic HIV- 1 strains was also assessed in presence <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay HIV p 24 gag antigen detection. The binding affinity <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> to CD 4, CCR 5 and CXCR 4 was evaluated on CD 4 -CCR 5 or CD 4 -CXCR 4 transfected astroglioma cell lines. Results: KP was shown to be devoid of cytotoxicity on PBMCs and to inhibit HIV- 1 replication in PBMCs of a patient in the acute phase of infection. The antiretroviral <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>KP,</b> which proved to be more potent than zidovudine at micromolar concentrations, is abolished by beta 1, 3 -glucan but not by beta 1, 6 -glucan.

Sixteen dogs with naturally occurring M. pachydermatis otitis externa were enrolled, and the in vitro fungicidal <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> was evaluated using yeasts recovered from these animals. The therapeutic activity was evaluated in four groups of four animals each. The dogs were topically treated with KP (150 μl, 2 mg/ml) three times per week (group A) or every day (group B), treated with a scramble peptide every day (group C), or left untreated (group D). Assessment of clinical signs (pruritus, erythema, and lichenification and/or hyperpigmentation), expressed as mean of the total clinical index score (mTCIS), the population size of M. pachydermatis at the cytological examination (mean number of yeast cells at 40 × magnification [mYC]), and culture testing (mean number of log 10 CFU/swab [mCFU]), were conducted daily {{from the first day}} of treatment (T 0) until two consecutive negative cultures (mCFU ≤ 2).

Methods: Fungicidal <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> was assessed in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of colony forming units and by histological examination, 8 days after infection, of organs from mice intravenously injected with a virulent strain of P. brasiliensis (3 x 10 (6) yeast cells) and intraperitoneally treated with KP (3. 3 mug/g body weight, three doses), in comparison with control animals equally administered with a scrambled decapeptide (SP). Results: KP but not SP was fungicidal in vitro at 39 ng/multiply-budding yeast cell and less efficiently in its D-isomeric form (0. 31 mug/multiply-budding yeast cell). It was also able to markedly reduce the fungal load in organs (liver, lung, spleen) of infected animals.

This study aimed {{to test the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> 1339 on the in vitro and in vivo <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, the current standard first-line therapy for advanced hepatoma. Anticancer <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the parental compounds {{as compared to the}} drug combination was tested against a panel of cancer cell lines with a focus on hepatoma. Combination <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> 1339 with sorafenib induced in the majority of all cases distinctly synergistic effects, comprising both sorafenib-resistant as well as sorafenib-responsive cell models. Several mechanisms were found to underlie these multifaceted synergistic activities. Firstly, co-exposure induced significantly enhanced accumulation levels of both drugs resulting in enhanced apoptosis induction. Secondly, sorafenib blocked KP 1339 -mediated activation of P 38 signalling representing a protective response against the ruthenium drug. In addition, sorafenib treatment also abrogated KP 1339 -induced G 2 /M arrest but resulted in check point-independent DNA-synthesis block and a complete loss of the mitotic cell populations. The <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>KP</b> 1339 /sorafenib combination was evaluated in the Hep 3 B hepatoma xenograft. KP 1339 monotherapy led to a 2. 4 -fold increase in life span and, thus, was superior to sorafenib, which induced a 1. 9 -fold prolonged survival. The combined therapy further enhanced the mean survival by 3. 9 -fold. Synergistic activity was also observed in the VM- 1 melanoma xenograft harbouring an activating braf mutation.

Furthermore, I compared the soil fertility of both types of forest stand using a biochemical soil quality indicator. The studies were conducted in the following reserves: ‘Bogdanieckie Cisy’, ‘Cisy Rokickie’, ‘Cisy Tychowskie’, ‘Cisy w Czarnem’, as well as in managed forest stands with the same soil and habitat type as the above-mentioned reserves. Analyses showed a lower <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> urease, asparaginase, acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase in soils of the managed forests than in soils of the reserves. The soil nutrient availability given by the total organic carbon, nitrogen, and alkaline cation content as well as soil sorption capacity were significantly lower outside the forest reserves. Chemical and biochemical parameters were used to calculate a biochemical index of soil fertility. The index was higher for soil in forest reserves than for soil in managed forest stands located outside reserves. The result held true regardless of the biochemical parameters used in calculation. As has been shown in previous studies on protected areas with no cultivation that are largely influenced by natural processes, biochemical indices can be very useful for comparative analyses aiming at estimating soil quality or the reaction of soil to external factors, both natural and anthropogenic.

Many different tools are now widely used to investigate the rate of glaciers’ movement, intensity of calving events and subglacial freshwater outflows or changes in an ice concentration at the sea surface. However, harsh polar conditions {{make the most of}} them difficult to conduct and temporal and spatial resolution is often unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop new methods for quantifying glacier processes. Recently, the application of passive marine acoustics has proved to be promising in this field. Here measurements of ambient noise field directionality made during summer 2013 and spring 2014 in different locations in the Hornsund Fjord, Spitsbergen are presented and discussed. Field data were collected from an inflatable boat using floating buoy equipped with two omnidirectional broadband hydrophones mounted on a horizontal axis, tilt sensor and magnetic compass. A few hours of recordings were analyzed and time differences of arrivals were calculated to obtain directions to the sound sources. The results not only confirm previous observations that underwater sounds in the Hornsund fjord propagates from various directions in distinct spectral bands. They primarily reveal that determined arrival angles together with calculated noise spectral intensity may provide valuable information about the <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> individual glaciers and the distribution of melting glacial ice across the Arctic fjord.

40|$|Kaempferia parviflora (KP) {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} folk remedy to treat several diseases including cancer, and several studies have reported cytotoxic <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> extracts <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> against {{a number of different}} cancer cell lines. However, many aspects of the molecular mechanism <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> remain unclear. In particular, the ability <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> to regulate cancer cell growth and survival signaling is still largely unexplored. The current study aimed to investigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> on cell viability, cell migration, cell invasion, cell apoptosis, and on signaling pathways related to growth and survival of cervical cancer cells, HeLa. We discovered that KP reduced HeLa cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. The potent cytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> against HeLa cells was associated with a dose-dependent induction of apoptotic cell death as determined by flow cytometry and observation of nuclear fragmentation. Moreover, KP-induced cell apoptosis was likely to be mediated through the intrinsic apoptosis pathway since caspase 9 and caspase 7, but not BID, were shown to be activated after KP exposure. Based on the observation that KP induced apoptosis in HeLa cell, we further investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> at non-cytotoxic concentrations on suppressing signal transduction pathways relevant to cell growth and survival. We found that KP suppressed the MAPK and PI 3 K/AKT signaling pathways in cells activated with EGF, as observed by a significant decrease in phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2, Elk 1, PI 3 K, and AKT. The data suggest that KP interferes with the growth and survival of HeLa cells. Consistent with the inhibitory effect on EGF-stimulated signaling, KP potently suppressed the migration of HeLa cells. Concomitantly, KP was demonstrated to markedly inhibit HeLa cell invasion. The ability <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> in suppressing the migration and invasion of HeLa cells was associated with the suppression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 production. These data strongly suggest that KP may slow tumor progression and metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. Taken together, the present report provides accumulated evidence revealing the potent anti-cancer <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> Kaempferia parviflora against cervical cancer HeLa cells, and suggests its potential use as an alternative way for cervical cancer prevention and therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{inactive}} MoFe protein (NifB-Kp 1) of nitrogenase from nifB mutants of Klebsiella pneumoniae may {{be activated}} by {{addition of the}} iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) extracted from active MoFe protein (Kp 1). However, when apparently saturated with FeMoco, our preparations of NifB-Kp 1 yielded activated protein, Kp 1 -asm, with a specific activity that was at best only 40 % of that expected. This was not due to degradation <b>of</b> <b>Kp</b> 1 -asm, NifB-Kp 1 or FeMoco during the activation reaction. Nor could activation be enhanced by addition of other nif-gene products or other proteins. Whereas fully active Kp 1 contains 2 FeMoco/molecule, apparent saturation of our NifB-Kp 1 preparations required the binding of only 0. 4 - 0. 65 FeMoco/molecule. By using chromatography Kp 1 -asm could be largely resolved from NifB-Kp 1 {{that had not been}} activated. However, we were unable to isolate fully active MoFe protein (i. e. Kp 1 -asm containing 2 FeMoco/molecule) from solutions of NifB-Kp 1 activated with FeMoco. The maximum activity/ng-atom of total Mo obtained for our purified Kp 1 -asm was approximately half the maximum activity for FeMoco. Since all NifB-Kp 1 preparations contained some Mo, we suggest that FeMoco activated only those NifB-Kp 1 molecules already containing one atom of (non-FeMoco) Mo, thus forming Kp 1 -asm with 2 Mo but only 1 FeMoco/molecule. Kp 1 -asm was identical with normal Kp 1 in terms of its Mr, stability, e. p. r. signals, pattern of substrate reductions, CO inhibition and ATP/ 2 e ratio.

40|$|Objectives: According to {{the current}} Polish {{legislation}} on occupational health services, occupational medicine physicians should perform workplace health promotion (WHP) activities {{as a part of}} their professional work. The concept of workplace health promotion or health promotion programs, however, has not been deﬁned in this legislation in any way. Therefore, two essential questions arise. First, what is the physicians’ attitude towards workplace health issues and second, what is actually carried out under the label of health promotion? The main objective of the research described in this paper was to answer these questions. Materials and Methods: The survey was carried out by the National Center for Workplace Health Promotion in 2002. A questionnaire prepared by the Center {{for the purpose of this}} survey was sent to a random sample of occupational medicine physicians. Results: The results of the survey showed that 53 % of occupational medicine physicians consider WHP just as a new name for prophylactics. On the other hand almost all of the respondents (94 %) agree that occupational medicine physicians should perform WHP activities and ﬁnd them useful in improving patients’ health (78 %). The main obstacle for the development <b>of</b> this <b>activity</b> in the perception of physicians is the lack of interest in workplace health promotion among employers (86 %). Conclusions: In the modern understanding of workplace health promotion concept this type of intervention includes not only safety measures and health education, but also a profound organizational change that allows employers, employees and social partners to improve wellbeing of people at work. Each of such projects should facilitate changes necessary to create a health promoting workplace. It also needs a skilled leader – well trained and aware of a multidisciplinary dimension of WHP interventions. Occupational medicine specialists should become natural partners of employers and employees.

Acute i. p. injection <b>of</b> <b>Kp</b> 54 -induced FOS (c-Fos) expression in a large number of GNRH neurons and pituitary gonadotrophs together with a strong increase in circulating testosterone. The activation of pituitary cells by Kp was inhibited by preadministration of the GNRH receptor antagonist acyline. Altogether, our results demonstrate that peripheral Kp 54 activates the gonadotropic axis by stimulating GNRH release and indicate that an appropriate protocol <b>of</b> long-term systemic <b>Kp</b> administration can recrudesce a photo-inhibited reproductive axis...|$|R
40|$|The {{kynurenine pathway}} of {{tryptophan}} catabolism {{plays an important}} role in several biological systems affected by aging. We quantified tryptophan and its metabolites kynurenine (KYN), kynurenine acid (KYNA), picolinic acid (PIC) and quinolinic acid (QUIN), and <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the kynurenine pathway enzymes indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO), tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO) and quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTase), in the brain, liver and kidney of young, middle-aged and old female Wistar rats. Tryptophan levels and TDO activity decreased in all tissues with age. In contrast, brain IDO activity increased with age, while liver and kidney IDO activity decreased with age. The levels of KYN, KYNA, QUIN and PIC in brain all increased with age, while the levels of KYN in the liver and kidney showed a tendency to decrease. The levels of KYNA in the liver did not change, but the levels of KYNA in the kidney increased. The levels of PIC and QUIN increased significantly in the liver but showed a tendency to decrease in the kidney. QPRTase activity in both brain and liver decreased with age but was elevated in the kidney in middle-aged (12 -month-old) rats. These age-associated changes in tryptophan metabolism have the potential to impact upon major biological processes, including lymphocyte function, pyridine (NAD(P) (H)) synthesis and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) -mediated synaptic transmission, and may therefore contribute to several degenerative changes of the elderly. The kynurenine pathway (KP) {{plays an important role}} in several biological systems affected by aging. In this study, the levels <b>of</b> several <b>KP</b> metabolites, and the <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> important <b>KP</b> enzymes have been examined in the brain, liver and kidney of physiologically aged female wistar rats.

40|$|The {{research}} {{revealed that}} European countries devote sufficient attention to ensuring {{the effectiveness of}} the institutions of self-organization {{in the context of their}} public services. The most common areas where they operate are a system of health, education and assistance during emergencies. The study showed that in the development of public services, there were significant transformations in terms of subject-provider. Historically it was confessional organizations working on a voluntary basis, and linked their activity with the realization of Christian mission. Subsequently, when there had been formation of a «welfare state», the state took over responsibility for the area of public services. In favor of institutions of self-organization has been a change in the system when it became clear that they are best in the provide public services, especially in the social sphere, because they are the demonstrating of social needs. The main mechanisms of cooperation between institutions of self-organization and the public sector are, first, subsidies for <b>statutory</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> the organization. Another mechanism is delegating services or outsourcing and in this case contracts mostly are for one year with possibility of further extension. In addition there is auxiliary element of providing of effectiveness institutions of self-organization, it consists in deprivation of their donors from taxes. Although institutions of self-organization are financed mainly by public authorities, they remain independent, because they have opportunity of funding from other sources. German experience showed that the starting point in the system of public services is the understanding of the necessity of paying taxes as acknowledgment of the rights of all members of society. That is why every taxpayer expects to receive public services at the appropriate level. This unwritten rule contributes to a very high level of provision of public services through an adequate level of financing carried out by persons with appropriate competence and qualifications. The example of Portugal discloses the status of self-organization institutions as public benefit organizations, which provides them of advantages, particularly in competition with private sector organizations. However, in the light of practical implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and other elements of decentralization is appropriate to introduce European experience in the domestic soil in the context of attracting self-organization institutions in the scope of public services delivery. The results of the study formulated the main components of a mechanism to ensure effectiveness of the self-organizations institutions in the provision of public services: subsidies of statutory activities; delegation of services; regulatory support; recognition of the status of self-organization institutions as public benefit organizations; limitation of agreements terms...|$|R

In our study, the ruthenium-based anticancer agent KP 1339 {{was tested}} in {{combination}} with electroporation for its cytotoxic effect on CHO and SA- 1 cell lines in vitro and on SA- 1 murine tumour model in vivo. Cells were treated with different doses <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> 1339 for 15 or 60 min with or without electroporation in vitro. Cell viability was measured with the MTS assay. In vivo, mice bearing SA- 1 tumours were treated with different doses <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> 1339 with or without electroporation. Tumour growth was measured at various time points after treatment. Intratumoural ruthenium content was analysed as a measure <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> 1339 accumulation to correlate it with antitumour effectiveness. Our results show that electroporation does not potentiate the cytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>KP</b> 1339 in vitro, but significantly potentiates antitumour effectiveness in vivo.
