40|$|This {{study of}} {{invertebrates}} in Bertrabouy bay was a by-product from {{an investigation of}} the distribution of escallops in Connemara examined by SCUBA diving and dredging. The bay is about 5 miles by 2 miles and has many small inlets and islands; it deepens to 18 fathoms near its entrance. Most of the escallops and lobsters are fished from the centre of the bay to its entrance. Small populations of escallops are fished with hand nets {{at the head of the}} bay where oysters were once cultivated on banks that are often covered with eelgrass. Cluaisíns are picked from the banks and winkles are found intertidally throughout the bay. In the course of the study an unexploited lobster population was discovered at the centre of the bay. Crawfish are taken at the bay entrance where razorfish and otter clams are also found. The oyster banks could be examined for future development and the use of a portable <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvester</b> to collect razorfish might be investigated...|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{potential}} impact of C. intestinalis introduction to new habitats, fish and <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvesters</b> are advised to avoid transfer of harvested shellfish and fishing gear to other areas, to dry gear thoroughly before transfer, to inspect boat hulls and, if necessary, to clean them thoroughly, disinfect with bleach or vinegar and dry before moving to other areas. It is also recommended to dispose of any organisms removed from boat hulls or gear on land and to release bilge water on land or disinfect it.|$|R
40|$|Section A. (4) {{describes}} agreements or memoranda {{of understanding}} between the Authority and individual <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvesters</b> or individual <b>shellfish</b> dealers, to allow harvesting during marine Biotoxin closures under specific, controlled conditions. The State of Florida has successfully implemented such an agreement to address Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP) for over a decade. This pilot project, developed in consultation with FDA, has resulted in zero cases of NSP in commercially harvested shellfish from Florida waters. NSP may affect any Gulf or South Atlantic state and therefore Florida wishes to provide ISSC member states with a proven quarantine protocol template for incorporation into the Model Ordinance Section IV.

40|$|International audiencePhycotoxins, {{secondary}} phytoplankton metabolites, {{are considered}} {{as an important}} food safety issue because their accumulation by shellfish may render them unfit for human consumption. However, the likely intakes of phycotoxins via shellfish consumption are almost unknown because both contamination and consumption data are very scarce. Thus, two 1 -year surveys were conducted (through the same population: recreational <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvesters</b> and from the same geographical area) to assess: shellfish consumption and contamination by major toxins (domoic acid (DA) group, okadaic acid (OA) group and spirolides (SPXs)). Recreational <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvesters</b> had been targeted as an at-risk subpopulation because they consume more shellfish than general population and because they eat not only commercial shellfish species controlled by official authorities but also their own harvests of shellfish species may be in non-controlled areas and more over shellfish species non-considered in the official control species. Then, these two kinds of data were combined with deterministic and probabilistic approaches for both acute and chronic exposures, on considering the impact of shellfish species and cooking on phycotoxin levels. For acute risk, monitoring programs seem to be adequate for DAs, whereas OAs could {{be a matter of}} concern for high consumers (their acute intakes were up to ninefold the acute reference dose (ARfD)). About chronic risk, OAs are a matter of concern. The daily OAs intakes were close to the ARfD, which is, by definition, greater than the tolerable daily intake. Moreover, SPX contamination is low but regular, no (sub) chronic SPX toxicity data exist; but in case of (sub) chronic toxicity, SPX exposure should be considered.

40|$|Future {{predictions}} of environmental conditions in Puget Sound exhibit an increased frequency and temporal extent of paralytic shellfish toxin closures.   These predictions, generated using experimentally-derived growth {{responses of the}} common toxin-producing Alexandrium together with simulations of climate and local hydrology, depict a scenario in which {{the number of days}} favorable to bloom development is increased by 30 by the year 2050.   We quantify the lost consumer surplus that would result from this reduced recreational opportunity, as impacted by future climate change.   Our economic model is estimated using a recent contingent behavior survey of recreational <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvesters</b> in Puget Sound.   Specifically, we estimate an incomplete count model demand system for recreational shellfish harvest trips along with the demand for close substitute trips. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceShellfish {{consumption}} {{can be a}} major pathway {{of exposure}} to pollutants for humans. It is fundamental to know if people eat enough shellfish to cause health problems, firstly in high consumers as recreational <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvesters.</b> The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the types of shellfish eaten, number of meals, portion size, sources of shellfish and shellfish consumption rates among French recreational shellfish harvesters; to determine factors affecting consumption patterns and to examine the reliability of the two methods used: a Food Frequency Questionnaire and a one-month food diary. The mean consumption rates were 11. 63 and 26. 21 g/person/day for shellfish derived from a self-harvested source only and from all sources, respectively. Harvester consumption rates were between 6 - and 15 -fold higher than the general French population. The comparison between the FFQ and the food diary showed that results were reliable. Thereby, our results are relevant to assess risk due to shellfish consumption...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} few decades, phycotoxins, {{secondary}} metabolites produced by toxic phytoplankton, have seen an increase in their frequency, concentrations, and geographic distribution. As shellfish accumulate phycotoxins making them unfit for human consumption, they are considered as an important food safety issue. Thus, a consumer exposure assessment on phycotoxins is necessary. Exposure assessment requires two types of information: contamination and consumption data. Shellfish contamination data on major toxins encountered by at-risk populations (Domoic Acid group, Okadaic Acid group, and Saxitoxin group) have been reviewed. Consumption data have been reviewed for both general and potential high-consumer populations. Then, we undertook acute and chronic exposure assessments, combining available French contamination data and our own consumption data. Studies including exposure assessment were then reviewed. Lastly, risk characterization was undertaken. It can be concluded that both acute and chronic exposure to phycotoxins via shellfish consumption {{is a matter of}} concern, mainly for high consumers identified in this review (specific populations and <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvesters).</b> However, the results for risk characterization must be improved. There is a need for (i) toxicological data to establish a Tolerable Daily Intake; (ii) an assessment of consumption and contamination data, undertaken at the same time, so as to assess exposure...|$|R
40|$|Harmful algal blooms {{and their}} {{impacts on the}} Greenshell mussel {{industry}} in New Zealand {{over the last decade}} are reviewed. The response of the regulatory authorities, seafood industry, and scientists to the first significant toxic Gymnodinium blooms in the summer of 1992 / 1993 has resulted in a well-organized interest group including scientists, commercial interests, and public health regulators. Nearly all known toxic species occur in New Zealand and unique and internationally accredited microalgal monitoring programmes have been developed. New methods, such as DNA probes, have been integrated into the system for rapid identification of species that are difficult to differentiate morphologically. Monitoring is carried out weekly, with results being dispatched within 24 h of sample receipt to enable risk assessments of toxicity by <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvesters.</b> The introduction of this system has saved the shellfish industry money and has reduced the amount of contaminated product being harvested and then rejected. All the main marine biotoxins are monitored, including paralytic, neurotoxic, diarrhetic, and amnesic shellfish toxins, and also compounds such as yessotoxin, pectenotoxin, and gymnodimine. Blooms that could affect farmed finfish or wild marine biota are also reported. Harmful algal monitoring is constantly reviewed in the light of new research and incorporates local knowledge of oceanographic and climatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{illness of}} three people due to diarrhetic {{shellfish}} poisoning (DSP) following their ingestion of recreationally harvested mussels from Sequim Bay State Park {{in the summer}} of 2011, resulted in intensified monitoring for diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) in Washington State. Rapid testing at remote sites was proposed as a means to provide early warning of DST events in order to protect human health and allow growers to test “pre-harvest” shellfish samples, thereby preventing harvest of toxic product that would later be destroyed or recalled. Tissue homogenates from several shellfish species collected from two sites in Sequim Bay, WA in the summer 2012, as well as other sites throughout Puget Sound, were analyzed using three rapid screening methods: a lateral flow antibody-based test strip (Jellett Rapid Test), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a protein phosphatase 2 A inhibition assay (PP 2 A). The results were compared to the standard regulatory method of liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). The Jellett Rapid Test for DSP gave an unacceptable number of false negatives due to incomplete extraction of DSTs using the manufacturer’s recommended method while the ELISA antibody had low cross-reactivity with dinophysistoxin- 1, the major toxin isomer in shellfish from the region. The PP 2 A test showed the greatest promise as a screening tool for Washington State <b>shellfish</b> <b>harvesters...</b>|$|R
