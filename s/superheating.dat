5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to the axle bearings and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further <b>superheating</b> area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel trailing truck, rocking grate, hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of eruptions. The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are another type of volcanic eruption, driven by the compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which {{is driven by the}} <b>superheating</b> of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} use of <b>superheating</b> on other Drummond classes, Robert Urie experimentally fitted a superheated boiler to No.126 in December 1920, {{together with an}} extended smokebox and larger cylinders. The additional weight of the new boiler raised the centre of gravity of the locomotive, thereby adding to problems of instability on faster main line trains, whilst simultaneously preventing its use on many branch lines. As a result, no further examples were fitted, and No.126 was eventually broken up for spare parts in 1937. In 1931 No. 672 was experimentally fitted with the Strowger-Hudd Automatic Warning System, but the equipment was not adopted by the Southern Railway and the equipment later removed.|$|E

The methodologies cover investigation of mechanisms of <b>superheated</b> steam in recovery, lab experiment, and numerical simulation. The study indicates that the injection of <b>superheated</b> steam can cause rock wettability conversion which is favorable to recovery.

5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) left over from the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the <b>superheating</b> surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E
25|$|This also {{coincided with}} the {{addition}} of coal rails to the bunker in an attempt to increase capacity. Because the class was not considered to have a long working life under Robert Urie, they were not equipped with <b>superheating.</b>|$|E
25|$|When <b>superheating</b> was adopted, {{primarily}} {{for use with}} steam turbines after 1900, the first Yarrow boilers placed their superheater coil outside the main tube bank.

40|$|This project {{focused on}} the {{comparison}} of conventional liquid chromatography and <b>superheated</b> water chromatography. It examined the differences in efficiency and retention {{of a range of}} different stationary phases. Alkyl aryl ketones and eight aromatic compounds were separated on PBD-zirconia, Xterra RP 18, Luna C sub 1 sub 8 (2) and Oasis HLB columns using conventional LC and <b>superheated</b> water chromatography system. The retention indices were determined in the different eluents. On changing the organic component of the eluent from methanol to acetonitrile to <b>superheated</b> water considerable improvements were found in the peak shapes and column efficiencies on the PBD-zirconia and Oasis HLB columns. PS-DVB, PBD-zirconia and Xterra RP 18 columns have been used in efficiency studies. It was found that simply elevating the column temperature did not increase the efficiency of a separation in <b>superheated</b> water chromatography. The efficiency depended on flow rate, injection volume and also mobile phase preheating system. Although high efficiencies were not achieved with <b>superheated</b> water on PS-DVB and Xterra RP 18 columns, a higher efficiency was achieved on a PBD-zirconia column with <b>superheated</b> water than with 25 - 35 % ACN at room temperature. The proposed theoretical increases in u sub o sub p sub t were measured on three columns using <b>superheated</b> water as the mobile phase. The application of the <b>superheated</b> water chromatographic method to the separation of the pungent constituents of ginger by <b>superheated</b> water chromatography-NMR coupling system was studied. The coupling of <b>superheated</b> water chromatography using deuterium oxide to NMR spectroscopy for the separation of dry ginger extract was successful, although the NMR sensitivity in on-line mode coupling system was low.

25|$|Compounding {{became popular}} for railway {{locomotives}} {{from the early}} 1880s and by the 1890s were becoming common. Large numbers were constructed, mostly two- and four-cylinder compounds, in France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the United States. It declined in popularity due to maintenance issues and because <b>superheating</b> provided similar efficiencies at lower cost. Nonetheless, compound Mallets were built by the Norfolk and Western Railway right up to 1952.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the success}} of the <b>superheating</b> the DD boiler, it was still {{somewhat}} limited in steam raising capabilities. In 1922, a new design of 2-8-0 branch line goods locomotive, the K class was introduced, with noticeably superior boiler performance to that of the DD. In 1929, a DD class locomotive was rebuilt with a larger boiler derived from the K class design. Based on {{the success of}} the rebuild, a further 93 D1or D2 class locomotives were converted between 1929 and 1947.|$|E
25|$|At a {{temperature}} below the boiling point, any matter in liquid form will evaporate until the condensation of gas above reach an equilibrium. At {{this point the}} gas will condense {{at the same rate}} as the liquid evaporates. Thus, a liquid cannot exist permanently if the evaporated liquid is continually removed. A liquid at its boiling point will evaporate more quickly than the gas can condense at the current pressure. A liquid at or above its boiling point will normally boil, though <b>superheating</b> can prevent this in certain circumstances.|$|E
30|$|Figure  4 c {{shows the}} {{profiles}} of <b>superheat</b> {{degree in the}} IJT and annuli and in the MT and AT. It is observed that (1) <b>superheat</b> degree in annuli increases {{at first and then}} begins to decrease with well depth. (2) <b>Superheat</b> degree in the IJT decreases rapidly from wellhead to the depth of 100  m, and then, the <b>superheat</b> degree decrease is gradual. In fact, in the case of CDTW, <b>superheat</b> degree in IJT and annuli is influenced not only by the injection conditions at wellhead, but also by the heat transfer between the IJT and annuli. For example, when the SHS in annuli absorbs heat from SHS in the IJT, the latter is just like a heat resource that can transfer heat to annuli, causing the <b>superheat</b> degree in annuli to increase with well depth. (3) The decrease rate of <b>superheat</b> degree in MT from wellhead to the depth of 100  m is smaller than that in IJT. This is because the heat transfer rate from MT to AT is smaller than that from IJT to annuli. As a result, <b>superheat</b> degree in AT has a small increase from wellhead to the depth of 50  m compared with that in annuli.|$|R

50|$|In the 1930s {{eighteen}} {{of these}} locomotives were rebuilt with piston valves and <b>superheated</b> boilers. The <b>superheated</b> locomotives were reclassified 250 Class and renumbered {{in the range}} from 251 to 268. In 1955 more renumbering took place, with the remaining saturated steam engines being renumbered {{in the range from}} 219 to 224 and the <b>superheated</b> engines in the range from 201 to 218, again as 200 Class. The <b>superheated</b> engines survived to the end of steam in the Congo in the early 1970s, being employed on both shunting and line working.|$|R
25|$|The {{similarity}} with GWR locomotive practice ended there, as a Midland Railway influence {{could be}} found in the placement of the locomotive fittings, with water top-feed into the boiler located inside a dome, although a modification was made to the cab area, which was a variation of those featured on the N class and the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler. The aesthetic aspects of the locomotive were contributed by another of Maunsell’s assistants, James Clayton, who had moved to the SECR from the Midland Railway. The new locomotives also varied with the increased amount of <b>superheating</b> surface area, and the outside valves were controlled by Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{particles}} are bound firmly but not rigidly. They {{are able to}} move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless <b>superheating</b> occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller. When the liquid reaches its freezing point the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs).|$|E
25|$|These small 0-4-0 tank engines {{were and}} are the {{standard}} shunter locomotives of the system, built between 1927 and 1937 by the firm of Breda in Milan. They have short side tanks, a rear coal bunker, and a unified, oval dome containing the steam dome inside a larger sand dome. This arrangement, popular worldwide in nations that favored the sand dome, helped both to insulate the steam dome {{and to keep the}} sand dry with the warmth. Large, prominent builder's plates adorn the domes. They utilise Walschaerts valve gear with piston valves and <b>superheating,</b> and are painted in the traditional European style of red below the running board, including frames and wheels, and black above, including boiler, cab, tanks etc. The purpose of the red paint is to make cracks and breakages in the locomotive's important running gear more obvious.|$|E

25|$|In 1956 {{a second}} reactor, R2, was bought from the United States under {{bilateral}} safeguards. A third reactor, {{better known as}} Ågesta, {{was designed as a}} dual-use facility to produce electricity and a small amount of plutonium in a crisis. In 1957, FOA suggested using Ågesta to produce a small number of weapons quickly. A fourth power reactor, Marviken, was set to produce larger quantities of nuclear fuel for an arsenal of 100 weapons. In May 1957, the Supreme Commander gave FOA the task of carrying out a new study of the possibilities to produce nuclear weapons focused on the plutonium option. Marviken was located approximately 150km away from Stockholm. Initially it was designed as 100 MW pressurized heavy water reactor that had a secondary circuit, where steam is produced from plain water. In the meantime, parallel to the pressurized reactor, a larger and more complicated design of reactor was under way. The alternative construction included <b>superheating</b> mechanism, internal reshuffling machine, and a complex process of boiling water, which ultimately complicated design and raised serious concerns.|$|E

Entering service in August 1917, No.810 was trialled for three years before another 15 locomotives (Nos. 811825) were ordered in 1919. These were built between 1920 and 1923; their construction delayed by a backlog of repairs caused by the war.
