5|$|In 2009, a Spanish {{research}} vessel conducted a <b>study</b> of the cephalopod population {{off the coast}} of Mozambique.

The <b>study</b> performed trawls in four depth groups, 200–400, 400–500, 500–600, and 600–700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they were most abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The <b>study</b> also noted that males were most common in the shallower two groups, while females were more common in the deeper two groups.|$|E
