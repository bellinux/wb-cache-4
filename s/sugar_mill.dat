5|$|In September 1740, as unrest rose {{among the}} Chinese population, spurred by {{government}} repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would {{be met with}} deadly force. On 7October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them <b>sugar</b> <b>mill</b> workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar Stream and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting <b>sugar</b> <b>mill</b> workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the walls}} skirmishes between the Chinese rebels and the Dutch continued. On 25October, after {{almost two weeks}} of minor skirmishes, 500 armed Chinese {{approached}} Cadouwang (now Angke), but were repelled by cavalry {{under the command of}} Ridmeester Christoffel Moll and Cornets Daniel Chits and Pieter Donker. The following day the cavalry, which consisted of 1,594 Dutch and native forces, marched on the rebel stronghold at the Salapadjang <b>sugar</b> <b>mill,</b> first gathered in the nearby woods and then set the mill on fire while the rebels were inside; another mill at Boedjong Renje was taken in the same manner by another group. Fearful of the oncoming Dutch, the Chinese retreated to a <b>sugar</b> <b>mill</b> in Kampung Melayu, four hours from Salapadjang; this stronghold fell to troops under Captain Jan George Crummel. After defeating the Chinese and retaking Qual, the Dutch returned to Batavia. Meanwhile, the fleeing Chinese, who were blocked to the west by 3,000 troops from the Sultanate of Banten, headed east along the north coast of Java; by 30October it was reported that the Chinese had reached Tangerang.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the Dutch {{colonisation}} of the East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), many people of Chinese descent were contracted as skilled artisans in the construction of Batavia on the northwestern coast of Java; they also served as traders, <b>sugar</b> <b>mill</b> workers, and shopkeepers. The economic boom, precipitated by trade between the East Indies and China via the port of Batavia, increased Chinese immigration to Java. The number of ethnic Chinese in Batavia grew rapidly, reaching a total of 10,000 by 1740. Thousands more lived outside the city walls. The Dutch colonials required them to carry registration papers, and deported those who did not comply to China.|$|E

30|$|The {{degree of}} {{technological}} development is not uniform {{in the sugar}} industry, even in the same country. It is possible to find these contrasting situations in African, Latin-American, and Indian sugarcane industries. For instance, all <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> existing {{in the state of}} Orissa, India (seven <b>sugar</b> <b>mills)</b> present a low and very low technological development. In contrast, in the Indian state of Maharashtra (24 <b>sugar</b> <b>mills),</b> there is a combination of well technologically developed <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> (three <b>sugar</b> <b>mills)</b> and low technologically developed <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> [19].|$|R
5|$|When the Chinese forces, {{numbering}} up to 1,000 {{and threatening}} to cut supply lines to Semarang, arrived in Tanjung in April 1741, Visscher told the regent to deal with them; however, the regent's forces stalled, refusing to move until they received a tribute of high quality rice. After Yonko sent the rice, the regent's men went to Tanjung, stood with the rebels outside of their range, then fired and left. The rebels soon occupied a <b>sugar</b> <b>mill</b> there. In Grobogan, Mertopuro, armed with weapons from the Dutch military command, staged {{an attack on the}} Chinese rebels, in which the Javanese troops opened fire on the Chinese before the Dutch came. Once the Dutch arrived, Mertopuro showed bullet wounds in horses—inflicted by his own men—as proof that he had fought.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February 1905, he {{was married}} to a divorcee, Frances Jane Wyatt, in London. In 1908, he was brought before the courts in {{bankruptcy}} proceedings, owing some ₤5,500. During the hearing he stated that he had been at sea during the period 1898–1902, and had not been working since he returned, although he had visited Ceylon late the previous year looking for work. He and his wife had one daughter. He was enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery in September 1910, having lowered his age and given Auckland as his place of birth. He served as a soldier for a year before leaving his wife and child at their Park Lane home in London and travelling to Sydney, Australia. In the remaining years before the outbreak of World War I he worked as a clerk at a <b>sugar</b> <b>mill</b> weighbridge in Proserpine, Queensland, and while doing so, lived at Kelly's Club Hotel in Brandon, where he formed a close connection to the publican's family.|$|E
5|$|Worsening {{economic}} conditions had put further pressure on industrial relations, with unemployment rising and employers seeking to cut costs. Strikes of <b>sugar</b> <b>mill</b> workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government {{failed to produce}} a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 Newcastle-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at Pelaw Main and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of lower wages. Attorney-General John Latham pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate {{an end to the}} dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards, undermining Bruce's own credibility as an impartial leader and law-and-order prime minister.|$|E

40|$|There are fifteen <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> in Bangladesh under Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation (BSFIC). But {{most of all}} {{the mills}} are being run with losses.

40|$|High sugar {{consumption}} {{cannot be}} fulfilled by domestic sugar production. The {{reason is that}} the performance and efficiency of the national <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> (PG) are still relatively low. Measurement of efficiency of <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> can be conducted by counting the sugar losses. This study aims to (1) to analyze the value of loss index and its implications on the efficiency of sugar mills;and (2) to assess the risk due to losses. Primary and Secondary data were used in this study containing annual data of <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> performance indicators in PTPN X such as Overall Recovery (OR), Boiling House Recovery (BHR), Mill Extraction (ME),the amount of bagasse, the amount of filter cake, and the amount if molasses at sugar cane factory (period of 2011 - 2015). The data were analyzed by evaluative descriptive analysis, index calculation, and risk assessment using Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method. The analysis shows that the losses produced by <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> in Indonesia are still quite high around 2. 60 – 2. 88 %. This level of losses shows the performance of <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> is inefficient and causes financial losses in <b>sugar</b> <b>mills.</b> Production risk assessment due to losses shows a high level of risk. Therefore, <b>sugar</b> <b>mills</b> must have a program to reduce its level of losses to the minimum level (< 2 %).
