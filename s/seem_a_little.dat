25|$|In 1972 the BBC {{terminated}} Bernard Braden's {{late night}} show, On the Braden Beat, {{replacing it with}} a similar programme, That's Life!, introduced by Esther Rantzen, who had worked with Braden. The reasons <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> complicated and may {{have had something to do}} with Braden's contract to advertise margarine on ITV. However, although Braden himself was publicly circumspect about the decision, Kelly was forthright in condemning it and was plainly hostile towards Rantzen.|$|E
500|$|According to Entertainment Weekly, {{the concept}} {{originated}} from a sketch by story artist Jorgen Klubien, in which Scar was depicted as Hitler. Although hesitant that then-Disney Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg would approve, the filmmakers ultimately {{decided to pursue}} it, describing the sequence as a [...] "Triumph of the Will-style mock-Nuremberg rally." [...] The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reviewed, [...] "those goose-stepping hyenas <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> much in hindsight," [...] while Film School Rejects coined it a [...] "hellish gathering." ...|$|E
500|$|Adam thought Petipa [...] "charming" [...] as both {{dancer and}} actor, {{and that he}} had [...] "rehabilitated" [...] male dancing with his performance. Of Dumilâtre he wrote, [...] "... in spite of her coldness, [...] {{deserved}} the success she achieved by the correctness and the 'mythological' quality of her poses: perhaps this word may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pretentious, but I can think of no other to express such cold and noble dancing as would suit Minerva in a merry mood, and in this respect [...] seems to bear a strong resemblance to that goddess." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Elements {{of the opening}} scene were lauded. Matt Roush of TV Guide praised Spacey's self introduction as a Machiavellian politician in which he says [...] "I have no patience for useless things." [...] Boston Globe Matthew Gilbert noted that [...] "the first two episodes were expertly directed by David Fincher" [...] and Spacey's harmonious cadence such as those used in the first scene of this episode [...] "makes even his character’s mercy killing of an injured dog [...] which he does by hand [...] <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less brutal." [...] Not only is Underwood described as Machiavellian, one critic from The New York Times notes that {{his belief in the}} omnipresence of dirt expressed as [...] "Nobody’s a Boy Scout, not even a Boy Scout" [...] harkens back to Willie Stark in All the King's Men who said [...] "There's always something".|$|E
500|$|Laura Herbert of BBC News {{said that}} many of the album's songs, {{including}} [...] "Radar" [...] and [...] "Toy Soldier" [...] "are repetitive and over-produced." [...] Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel said that [...] "Musically, songs such as 'Piece of Me,' 'Radar' and 'Break the Ice' are one-dimensional, robotic exercises." [...] Chris Wasser from the Irish Independent said the album had single potential, exemplifying that [...] "There's little doubting we'll hear the bouncing and digitally affected vocals of Radar and the livelier Hot As Ice on the radio soon enough, but both tracks still <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under par." [...] After the release of [...] "Radar" [...] single from Circus, Nick Levine of Digital Spy said it [...] "still sounds pretty ace, one of the best examples of the robopop sound Blackout essentially invented, but its fresh-out-the-box sheen has long since faded". On July 29, 2009, [...] "Radar" [...] was chosen as single of the week by FHM.|$|E
500|$|Yousafzai's memoir I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban, co-written with British {{journalist}} Christina Lamb, {{was published}} in October 2013 by Little, Brown and Company in the US and by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK A reviewer for The Guardian called the book [...] "fearless" [...] and stated that [...] "the haters and conspiracy theorists {{would do well to}} read this book", though she criticised [...] "the stiff, know-it-all voice of a foreign correspondent" [...] that is interwoven with Yousafzai's. A reviewer for The Washington Post called the book [...] "riveting" [...] and wrote [...] "It is difficult to imagine a chronicle of a war more moving, apart from perhaps the diary of Anne Frank." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the book a [...] "B+", writing [...] "Malala's bravely eager voice can <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thin here, in I Am Malala, likely thanks to her co-writer, but her powerful message remains undiluted." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} {{was praised}} by reviewers, especially {{in comparison to}} the single-player [...] "Story Mode". The multiplayer element was noted for appealing to a diverse demographic for its party game qualities and being an [...] "'everybody' title". Conversely, [...] "Story mode" [...] was criticised for exacerbating issues relating to pace, which was already remarked as having [...] "snail's pace". Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence involved was bemoaned for contributing an imbalance in the game, with the random availability of quality items giving players an unfair advantage. The [...] "reversal of fortune" [...] space, which initiates a minigame by which the victor would receive another player's stars or coins, was criticised for similar reasons, as it potentially penalises players who do well in the game. The minigames were mainly met with a positive reaction, with critics praising their simplicity. The grouping feature in the minigames were also welcomed for contributing a new dynamic of gameplay, although Bramwell commented that [...] "It might <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> odd to gang up with your competitors in some cases".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised {{the choice of}} having Rivers guest star since {{she was able to}} [...] "employ her trademark humor within the world of The Simpsons without hijacking the plot or satire." [...] He also noted that while the Simpson family does not appear heavily, [...] "Krusty is such {{a large part of the}} supporting cast that he carries this episode well. While it may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> funny that Castellaneta, who voices Krusty, wrote such a large part for himself, it is also a testament to his empathy for Krusty that this episode both deepens our understanding of Krusty and actually allows him growth as a character in an organic fashion." [...] Ology's Josh Harrison similarly praised [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] for having [...] "some wonderful Krusty the Klown moments and some clutch guest star appearances". He also cited the visual gags in the episode as [...] "clever". Harrison concluded his review by writing that though the episode [...] "wasn't Simpsons gold, it was a great chance to focus on a secondary character and an opportunity for Joan Rivers to, um, be Joan Rivers. I imagine your assessment of the episode may be based largely on your opinion of the guest star. That said? I dug it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sequencing}} of the record's track list was done strategically, starting with songs that lyrically depict societal injustices {{and ending with}} those that explore love, relationships and sexuality. This decision also factored into the album's artwork and marketing, giving it an overt black and white militant imagery. Jam explained that [...] "he idea of putting 'Rhythm Nation', 'Living in the World' and 'The Knowledge' as the first three songs on the record really set the tone {{as to what the}} record was. Then to have the segue after that where she says, 'Get the point? Good. Let's dance...' and then go into 'Miss You Much', that was purposely done." [...] He also stated that the safer marketing strategy for the project would have been [...] "a beautiful colored picture of Janet on the cover" [...] with Escapade as its title, starting the track listing with [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] and [...] "Escapade", and ending it with [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "The Knowledge" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] but noted that despite being the same collection of songs, the alternate sequencing and imagery would not have had the same impact. Of its lyrical themes, Kate Kelly stated the album [...] "reveals a social conscience speaking of getting an education, avoiding drugs, and feeding the homeless. All this might <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> heavy for dance music or pop radio, but Jackson fuses her concepts with driving dance energy that hits the hearts of those hitting the dance-floor." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety described it as [...] "a quasi-concept album whose opening three songs directly addressed crime, the crack epidemic, racism, homelessness and youth illiteracy — not exactly a recipe for a party. And yet the record was somehow even more successful than Control, generating a then-record seven top 5 singles." ...|$|E

500|$|Davies {{created the}} {{expectation}} of Rose's return in the fourth series by mentioning her in dialogue and featuring Piper in cameo appearances in [...] "Partners in Crime", [...] "The Poison Sky", and [...] "Midnight". Speaking on how Rose's character had changed between her appearances, Davies described the fourth series Rose as [...] "tougher, more independent, and [...] might, at times, <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> harder". Piper stated she rewatched her earlier episodes to remember how the character spoke and acted as {{she felt she had}} [...] "been playing posh birds" [...] since she left the programme and by contrast [...] "Rose {{is a bit of a}} chav". Rose is re-united with the Doctor near the climax of [...] "The Stolen Earth". Director Graeme Harper insisted that the scene appear [...] "mystical" [...] because the characters' reunion was [...] "the most magical moment" [...] in the entire episode and Ernie Vincze, the Director of Photography for the show, compared the scene's feeling to the 1980s science-fiction film Blade Runner. Davies characterised the reunion between Rose and the Doctor as [...] "the biggest romance [...] has ever seen" [...] and joked that seminal films such as Gone with the Wind should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead. He had difficulty splitting up the characters for a second time for the necessity of the plot. He felt that [...] "Rose has to be stupid to fall in love with Doctor #2" [...] because [...] "she's doing what the plot demands, not what she'd demand". At one stage he considered giving an explanation that Rose's dimension hopping and the Dalek's meddling with reality had contaminated her with [...] "voidstuff" [...] and that she would die if she stayed in her original universe. In the final episode it is enough for her to stay that the human Doctor needs her and is able to reciprocate her love. Porter felt that the climax of [...] "Journey's End" [...] indicated that [...] "Rose's role as a sidekick has been completed" [...] as she has a second Doctor to humanise, one who she can be equals with.|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic's Mike DeGagne liked [...] "Everything's Turning to White" [...] and [...] "Sweet Guy" [...] from So Much Water So Close to Home, {{he calls}} the latter [...] "a {{disturbing}} piece" [...] and observed that [...] "oth songs are true to Kelly's intriguing knack of fiction telling, making {{some of the other}} tunes <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> weak in the content department". While for his review of Hidden Things, DeGagne wrote that [...] "the slower version ... 'Sweet Guy Waltz' ... presents an even eerier feel than the quicker version".|$|E
2500|$|Ebert, {{despite his}} praise, stated, [...] "I won't {{go so far}} as to {{describe}} it as a character study" [...] but that the film is more than the sum of its parts – parts that may at first <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> generic or clichéd, since many other films (such as Very Bad Things) have already explored the idea of a weekend in Vegas gone wrong. The film's premise has several similarities to Dude, Where's My Car? Both films are about [...] "a couple guys waking up after a night of getting trashed, only to find they are missing something important", whose adventures include [...] "a trail of clues, a missing car, dubious encounters with strippers and wild animals, a brush with the law and gangs chasing them for something they don't realize they have".|$|E

2500|$|To those {{unfamiliar}} with music therapy the idea may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> strange, but music therapy {{has been found}} to be as effective as traditional forms of therapy. In a meta-analysis of the effects of music therapy for children and adolescents with psychopathology, Gold, Voracek, and Wigram (2004) looked at ten studies conducted between 1970 and 1998 to examine the overall efficacy of music therapy on children and adolescents with behavioral, emotional, and developmental disorders. The results of the meta-analysis found that [...] "music therapy with these clients has a highly significant, medium to large effect on clinically relevant outcomes." [...] More specifically, music therapy was most effective on subjects with mixed diagnoses. Another important result was that [...] "the effects of music therapy are more enduring when more sessions are provided." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crosby {{described}} her hymn-writing process: 'It may <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> old-fashioned, always to begin one’s work with prayer, but I never undertake a hymn without first asking the good Lord {{to be my}} inspiration.' Her capacity for work was incredible and could often compose six or seven hymns a day. [...] Her poems and hymns were composed entirely in her mind and she worked on as many as twelve hymns at once before dictating them to an amenuensis. On one occasion Crosby composed 40 hymns before they were transcribed. Her lyrics would usually be transcribed by [...] "Van" [...] or later by her half-sister, Carolyn [...] "Carrie" [...] Ryder or her secretary Eva C. Cleaveland, as Crosby herself could write little more than her name. While Crosby had musical training, she did not compose the melody {{for most of her}} lyrics. In 1903 Crosby claimed that [...] "Spring Hymn" [...] was the only hymn she wrote both the words and music.|$|E
2500|$|In late October 2012, it was {{revealed}} {{to the public that}} the Saturdays were in talks to feature in their own reality television programme. Although, they had already done this previously with [...] broadcast through ITV2. It was later revealed that American television network, E! were interested in showing their show programme. It was announced that they did sign a contract with the network and Chasing The Saturdays would be broadcast through E! internationally. It was later revealed that the band had signed a joint record deal with [...] Island Def Jam Records and Mercury Records. The joint deal would enable the group to release future material internationally mainly the United States and Canada. While the band were filming their reality television in America the band began working on new music and collaborating with a number of producers. Rodney Jerkins, who is known as [...] "Darkchild" [...] {{was revealed}} {{to be included in the}} band's fourth studio album. He is known for producing hits for Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Whitney Houston and Justin Bieber and others. Diane Warren was revealed to be working on the album. It was said by Frankie Sandford that the band were afraid to try and crack America due to the band having constant success in their native, England and Ireland. She said: [...] "Nowadays, luckily, [...] people are a lot more open to their favorite acts going to America. It used to be a little bit like, 'They're leaving us! They're going to the U.S. and they're never coming back!' People <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more accepting of that now." [...] Many fans speculated that the album would be the band's last after Healy, Humes and Sandford all became mothers, but the band denied it and claimed they have been plans for the future including touring.|$|E
