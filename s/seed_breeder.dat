Subsequently, he founded Coker's Pedigreed Seed Company, and through this organization extended his efforts with equal success to include most of the principal southern field crops. In this undertaking, his close associate was George James Wilds, dedicated plant breeder. Under Mr. Coker's direction, ably supported by a staff of loyal scientists, these farms became a center of scientific endeavor. Combined with his signal success in plant breeding and his crusading zeal for improved agricultural methods, Mr. Coker's inspiring example of selfless devotion to Southern farmers resulted in his becoming widely acclaimed as the South's foremost agricultural statesman]Rogers and Nelson, 1994, p. 269].

40|$|In the mid- 1990 s, the {{leadership}} of the National Sunflower Association (NSA) gambled that trans fats would someday become a health issue in North America. Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L., Asteraceae) is naturally high in linoleic acid. This acid provides a pleasant taste profile but does not provide frying stability. The food industry had grown very accustomed to using partially hydrogenated (PH) soybean oil for frying. Hydrogena-tion is a chemical process that breaks down unstable fatty acids. The result of this process is the production of trans fatty acids. Soybean oil has always been inexpensive, being a by-product of the protein industry, and has always been available in surplus supplies. The NSA leadership recognized that high linoleic sunflower had no advantages over soybean oil since both oils are unstable when used in frying. Yet, sunflower producers needed to gain the most value from the oil since sunflower is a high oil content seed of 40 % and higher. The process to shift to an oleic based sunflower oil began with <b>seed</b> <b>breeders.</b> The first task was to convince public and private <b>seed</b> <b>breeders</b> that a stable oil would be in demand in the future. This was not an easy task given only limited public discussion about trans fatty acids. Human health research to trans consumption was underway but results were not conclusive at that time. The second task was to convince farmers, elevators, and processors that segregating this new type of sunflower seed was necessary to test the market.

40|$|Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops in Nicaraguan agriculture. Bean production is carried out on small scale farms, where farmers generally lack key inputs. Seeds have been identified as the most critical input in bean production. For this reason, national seed program will be a priority during next ten years. Among the four main seed quality components, genetic component has been the least studied. The occurrence of offtype seeds and plants in the cultivar ‘INTA ROJO’ during seed production has hindered the seed certification process and questioned the genetic quality of the cultivars produced in Nicaragua. The present study aimed to compare the genetic composition of different seed categories in the cultivar ‘INTA ROJO’, and to confirm the genetic identity of offtype seeds and plants found in this cultivar. The genotype frequencies of fourty individuals were analyzed using ten microsatellite markers in the following <b>seed</b> categories: <b>Breeder’s</b> <b>seed,</b> foundation seed, registered seed and certified seed. The genotype frequencies were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test, where <b>breeder’s</b> <b>seed</b> was assigned as a reference population. Additionally, twenty offtype seeds and plants, among them the offtype seeds known as “frijol viterra” and “frijol rojo oscuro”, were contrasted with <b>breeder’s</b> <b>seed</b> through pairwise comparisons of genetic distances. The results suggest that changes in genotype frequencies take place during seed production and they are ascribed to the selection pressures caused by environmental differences among production regions and inadequate varietal depuration procedures during seed production. In addition, the offtypes denominated “frijol rojo oscuro” were identified as an unknown cultivar probably derived from natural segregations, mutations and out-crossing among bean seed lots, and in less degree from accidental seed mixtures. In contrast, “frijol viterra” was confirmed to be the same cultivar ‘INTA ROJO’. Its differences in seed weights were associated rather to environmental effects than to genotypic ones.

50|$|All {{of these}} {{elements}} of modern agriculture {{are used in the}} context of the traditional intensive cropping patterns. To maximize year-round use of the land, two or more crops are planted each year where possible. Rice, wheat, cotton, vegetable, and other crop seedlings are sometimes raised in special seedbeds and then transplanted to fields. Transplanting shortens the time required for a crop to mature, which allows farmers the opportunity to squeeze in an additional crop each growing season. Another method to make optimum use of scarce land is to plant seedlings in a mature stand of another crop. For example, when planting winter wheat in October, farmers in the north leave spaces among the rows so that cotton seedlings can be planted or transplanted in April and May. Without intercropping, farmers could raise only one crop a year. Mechanization supports this intensive cropping pattern. Despite a huge rural labor force, labor shortages occur each season when farmers are required to harvest one crop and plant another in its place, all within the space of a few weeks. In the 1980s farmers invested in harvesting and planting machinery to overcome the shortage of labor. <b>Seed</b> <b>breeders</b> also supported intensive cropping patterns by selecting and breeding varieties that had shorter growing seasons.|$|R

Most farmers source seed from informal seed systems, including own-saved seed, exchanges with neighbors, and local seed markets. At the local level, informal seed systems are preferred by farmers because of proximity and local varietal preferences (e. g., crop variety tastes and suitability for local environmental conditions).

30|$|In contrast, global {{corporations}} {{tended to}} have fewer varieties to offer. The few private <b>seed</b> <b>breeders</b> seem to limit the cultivar choices they offer in GM-adopting countries to GM seed cultivars endowed with private property rights {{in the form of}} patents while farmers in non-adopting countries continue to enjoy a similar or even increasing choice of seed cultivars. This trend was also noted by the US NRC [9] which stated that “research is needed to investigate the extent to which U.S. farmers are having difficulty purchasing high-yielding, non-GE seed.” and “… such market power [of the seed industries] could lead to decreased variability in the types of seed being produced for the market, as well as increased prices, which could limit the ability of farmers to purchase those seeds most suited for local environmental conditions.” At the time of writing this analysis, new reports confirm this concern. In the summer 2012, US farmers suffered from a drought of significant proportion. Additionally, farmers were hit by the fast spreading resistance in the target pest Diabrotica virgifera (corn rootworm) that rendered their presumed rootworm resistant GM maize susceptible to that pest, effectively compounding their problems from drought as this pest targets the root system. But the high adoption of GM maize now “left farmers without access to corn that doesn’t include the [Bt] gene” [25].|$|R
