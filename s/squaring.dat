5|$|Tessellations {{have given}} rise to many types of tiling puzzle, from {{traditional}} jigsaw puzzles (with irregular pieces of wood or cardboard) and the tangram to more modern puzzles which often have a mathematical basis. For example, polyiamonds and polyominoes are figures of regular triangles and squares, often used in tiling puzzles. Authors such as Henry Dudeney and Martin Gardner have made many uses of tessellation in recreational mathematics. For example, Dudeney invented the hinged dissection, while Gardner wrote about the rep-tile, a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of the same shape. Inspired by Gardner's articles in Scientific American, the amateur mathematician Marjorie Rice found four new tessellations with pentagons. <b>Squaring</b> the square is the problem of tiling an integral square (one whose sides have integer length) using only other integral squares. An extension is <b>squaring</b> the plane, tiling it by squares whose sizes are all natural numbers without repetitions; James and Frederick Henle proved that this was possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} of two fields is {{expressed by the}} notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and <b>squaring</b> the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history <b>squaring</b> with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E

50|$|<b>Square</b> Stealing - If <b>Square</b> Stealing {{has been}} {{declared}} any player may enter a <b>square</b> that has been fully vacated by its owner. In order to vacate a <b>square,</b> a player must be completely outside the <b>square.</b> In order to claim a <b>square,</b> a player must get both feet inside {{the boundaries of the}} <b>square.</b> If the owner of a <b>square</b> reenters his <b>square</b> before it has been claimed, he'll retain the <b>square.</b> He retains the <b>square</b> by having any body part enter the <b>square.</b> Ties go to the owner (remember, the center has the right to settle disputes). If a <b>square</b> is stolen, the previous owner may claim any open <b>square.</b> If no <b>squares</b> are open, the displaced player is eliminated. If the owner of a <b>square</b> is eliminated while his <b>square</b> is stolen, he is eliminated from play, but his <b>square</b> is still retained by the successful <b>square</b> stealer.|$|R

5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of the {{activity}} of a hurricane season. It is calculated by <b>squaring</b> the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the International Date Line to 140°W) is given in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of how active a {{hurricane}} season is. It is calculated by <b>squaring</b> the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was not as strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E
5|$|On 10 December, {{the first}} match after United's {{elimination}} from the UEFA Champions League, Nani scored a brace {{in a home}} match against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He opened the scoring in the 17th minute to put them 1–0 up with a shot into the bottom left corner. He scored his second goal in the 56th minute, tapping in from Antonio Valencia's drilled cross across the six-yard box to extend the lead to 3–1. He was later replaced by winger Ashley Young as the match finished 4–1 to the home side. Nani scored his sixth league goal {{of the season and}} provided two assists in a 5–0 away win at Fulham on 21 December. He first advanced on a run down the left flank before crossing for Danny Welbeck to slot home. He then met a Ryan Giggs cross with his head to glance United into a 2–0 lead. He then returned the compliment, <b>squaring</b> for Giggs to put United 3–0 up before half-time.|$|E

5|$|On the five-Test Indian series which followed, O'Neill started slowly, {{aggregating}} 60 runs in {{the first}} two Tests, which were shared 1–1. He returned to form with a leg-side dominated 163 in a high-scoring draw in the Third Test at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay. After scoring 40 in an innings victory in the Fourth Test in Madras, Australia needed a draw in the Fifth Test in Calcutta with four players injured or ill, while Benaud had a dislocated spinning finger. O'Neill scored 113 in the first innings to help a depleted team take a 137-run first innings lead and prevent India from <b>squaring</b> the series. He was Australia's leading scorer in the Tests, with 376 runs at 62.66. He also made his highest first-class score of 284, against an Indian President's XI in Ahmedabad. He was the top scorer for the whole subcontinental Test tour, with 594 runs in eight matches at 66.00.|$|E
25|$|The {{slope of}} the tangent line to the <b>squaring</b> {{function}} at the point (3, 9) is 6, that is to say, it is going up six {{times as fast as}} it is going to the right. The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the <b>squaring</b> function. This defines the derivative function of the <b>squaring</b> function, or just the derivative of the <b>squaring</b> function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the <b>squaring</b> function is the doubling function.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of <b>squaring</b> an integer {{can be reduced to}} the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that <b>squaring</b> is not more difficult than multiplication, since <b>squaring</b> can be reduced to multiplication.|$|E
