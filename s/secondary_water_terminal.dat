40|$|With {{rapid growth}} and limited water supplies, many water systems {{throughout}} the United States, in particular those in western states, {{are aware of}} the need for <b>water</b> conservation. Supplying <b>secondary</b> <b>water</b> is an approach that reduces demand on potable water and allows for more connections. However, unmetered <b>secondary</b> <b>water</b> use has resulted in an increase in overall water use. The regulation of <b>secondary</b> <b>water</b> would provide utilities increased control of water supplies and would allow residential users to actively conserve water used for outdoor purposes. The authors explore current practices that water suppliers are using, including filtration and innovative meter designs, to conserve precious water resources. Their experiences show that not only is secondary metering a future necessity, it is also a current possibility. Water suppliers can use this information to learn from the experiences of other systems and plan the future of their own distribution systems...|$|R
40|$|Several prokaryotic ClC {{proteins}} {{have been}} demonstrated to function as exchangers that transport both chloride ions and protons simultaneously in opposite directions. However, {{the path of the}} proton through the ClC exchanger and how the protein brings about the coupled movement of both ions are still unknown. In the present work, we demonstrate that a previously unknown <b>secondary</b> <b>water</b> pore is formed inside a ClC exchanger by using an atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. From the systematic simulations, it was determined that the glutamate residue exposed to the intracellular solution, E 203, plays an important role as a trigger for the formation of the <b>secondary</b> <b>water</b> pore. Based on our simulation results, we conclude that protons in the ClC exchanger are conducted via a water network through the <b>secondary</b> <b>water</b> pore and we propose a new mechanism for the coupled transport of chloride ions and protons...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{residential}} <b>secondary</b> or dual <b>water</b> systems for irrigation purposes {{is common in}} the western United States where water supplies are scarce. While the use of non-potable <b>water</b> in <b>secondary</b> systems has successfully curtailed demands on potable systems, experience has shown that overall water use actually increases {{with the introduction of}} a secondary supply because users commonly pay a fixed fee and have unlimited water use. While water metering and billing effectively reduce water use, there are two main obstacles to the widespread installation of meters in secondary systems. The first obstacle is that standard residential water meters do not normally function in debris-filled <b>secondary</b> <b>water.</b> Metering mechanisms can clog or be degraded by suspended debris of both organic and inorganic nature in the water. By way of innovative meter designs or filtration, a few secondary systems have had success metering their <b>secondary</b> <b>water.</b> Other systems have experimented with possible debris-resistant meters but have had little success. In addition to the physical limitations of <b>water</b> meters, <b>secondary</b> systems face economic obstacles from the increased expense of metering. Since <b>secondary</b> <b>water</b> is intended to be an inexpensive alternative to potable water for outdoor irrigation, any cost increase due to the expense of meters, filtration, meter reading, etc., interferes with the main objective of a secondary system. A system-specific economic analysis is necessary to determine the financial feasibility of the implementation of metering in any secondary system. The objective of this research is to identify feasible ways for metering <b>secondary</b> <b>water</b> systems. An overall analysis is made of the performance, benefits, and drawbacks of each technological approach. Approximate costs and design requirements of these technologies are identified, thereby allowing water suppliers to determine the economic feasibility of metering. In addition, other design precautions for implementing secondary metering and investigations {{of residential}} meter performance in secondary systems using filtration are discussed...|$|R
