25|$|Since the {{personal}} computing <b>software</b> <b>industry</b> in France is heavily {{dominated by a}} few companies (such as Microsoft and Apple Computer), which also provide DRM systems, it was feared that the law would reinforce these dominant positions and prevent competition from free software.

It is officially considered instrumental in controlling the IT expenses of public administrations.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, however, Sam Ramji, {{the then}} head of open source {{software}} strategy in Microsoft, began working closely with Bill Gates to develop a pro-open source attitude within the <b>software</b> <b>industry</b> as well as Microsoft itself.

These contributions would have been previously unimaginable by Microsoft. Microsoft’s change in attitude about open source and efforts to build a stronger open source community is evidence of the growing adoption and adaption of open source.|$|E

He left Microsoft in 2002 to co-found, with business partner Gregor Kiczales, a company called Intentional Software. This company markets the intentional programming concepts Simonyi developed at Microsoft Research. In this approach to software, a programmer first builds a language environment specific to a given problem domain (such as life insurance). Domain experts, aided by the programmer, then describe the program's intended behavior in a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)-like manner. An automated system uses the program description and the language to generate the final program. Successive changes are only done at the WYSIWYG level.|$|E
25|$|Technopark is a {{technology}} park in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. It {{is the largest}} Information Technology park in Asia in terms of built up area. The park is dedicated to IT ventures. Launched in 1990, Technopark as of 2015 has 9.33 {{million square feet of}} built-up area, and is home to over 350 companies, employing nearly 60,000professionals. Technopark is currently on an expansion mode by adding another 37 hectares as part of Phase III expansion and 423 acres as Technocity—an integrated IT township near Pallippuram. The policy of economic liberalisation initiated by the government of India in 1991 and the rapid growth of the global <b>software</b> <b>industry</b> during the 1990s substantially contributed to its growth. During the global financial crisis of 2007–2010, the park saw a period of reduced growth in 2009-10, where the exports recorded was only 2.8% more than the previous year. During the financial year 2014-15, the park recorded IT exports of Rs 5,100 crores, contributing 55 percent of the state's total IT exports.|$|E
25|$|Organised retail {{will need}} workers. Walmart employs 1.4 {{million people in}} United States alone. With United States {{population}} of about 300 million, and India's population of about 1200 million, if Walmart-like retail companies were to expand in India {{as much as their}} presence in the United States, and the staffing level in Indian stores kept at the same level as in the United States stores, Walmart alone would employ 5.6 million Indian citizens. Walmart has a 6.5% market share of the total United States retail. Adjusted for this market share, the expected jobs in future Indian organised retail would total over 85 million. In addition, millions of additional jobs will be created during the building of and the maintenance of retail stores, roads, cold storage centers, <b>software</b> <b>industry,</b> electronic cash registers and other retail supporting organisations. Instead of job losses, retail reforms are likely to be massive boost to Indian job availability.|$|E

Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%). However, it was the <b>software</b> <b>industry</b> which invested in {{the greatest number of}} deals overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals.

Phantasmagoria was banned from most retailers in Australia by decree of the government's Office of Film and Literature Classification. The Roberta Williams Anthology collection was also banned in Australia because it featured a one-chapter preview of the game. The governments of two other countries also banned Phantasmagoria.
