5|$|Bonventre {{was called}} to a meeting with Rastelli in Queens. He {{was picked up by}} Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage. En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he would kill Bonventre with two more shots when they reached their destination. The task of {{disposing}} of Bonventre's corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre's remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> two 55-gallon glue drums.|$|E
5|$|Mass-produced {{pizza cheese}} {{is used by}} the foodservice industry, quick service restaurants, and other {{industries}} and businesses. The world's largest manufacturer of pizza cheese, Leprino Foods Company, processes 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons, 1,322,760,000 pounds) a year. Leprino Foods holds patents for some specialized Mozzarella production processes that enable the quick manufacture of the product. One such product is a frozen shredded cheese used for pizza that is created in a few hours from milk. Other U.S. companies also mass-produce pizza cheese, which is shipped in a frozen state. As of 2000, Glanbia is the largest producer of pizza cheese in Europe. Some retail and commercially mass-produced frozen pizzas have cheese <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> the pizza crust.|$|E
5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E

25|$|Holishkes, stuffed cabbage, {{also known}} as the cabbage roll, is also a European Jewish dish that emerged from more impoverished times for Jews. Because having a live cow was more {{valuable}} than to eat meat in the Middle Ages, Jews used fillers such as breadcrumbs and vegetables to mix with ground beef. This gave the effect of more meat that was <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> the cabbage leaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} Jasmine Fiore {{occurred}} on August 15, 2009. Fiore (born Jasmine Lepore) {{was a model}} from Santa Cruz, California, United States.

25|$|According to Lawrence, {{following}} earlier alleged {{threats from}} Chan, on 5 April 2005 Sukumaran met with Si Yi Chen, Martin Stephens and Lawrence at a Sydney hotel where police allege drug smuggling {{tools such as}} sealable plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> the bags of Stephens and Lawrence. Lawrence claimed she was given cash; whilst Stephens claimed that his life was threatened. The following day, Sukumaran allegedly provided another group with cash for airflight tickets.|$|E
25|$|The exact origin is unknown, {{but many}} {{believe it was}} created by Italian {{immigrants}} who worked for Chicago's old Union Stock Yards in the early 1900s. They often would bring home some of the tougher, less desirable cuts of beef sold by the company. To make the meat more palatable, it was slow-roasted {{to make it more}} tender, then slow-simmered in a spicy broth for flavor. Both the roasting and the broth used Italian-style spices and herbs. The meat was then thinly sliced across the grain and <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> fresh Italian bread.|$|E
25|$|In the Białystok Ghetto on 16 August 1943, Jewish insurgents revolted {{when the}} Germans {{announced}} mass deportations. The fighting lasted five days. On 14 October 1943, Jews in Sobibór, including Jewish-Soviet prisoners of war, attempted an escape, killing 11 SS officers {{and a couple}} of Ukrainian camp guards. Around 300 prisoners escaped, but 100 were recaptured and shot. In October 1944, Jewish members of the Sonderkommando at Auschwitz attacked their guards and blew up Crematorium IV with explosives that had been smuggled in. Three German guards were killed, one of whom was <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> an oven. The Sonderkommando attempted a mass breakout, but all were killed.|$|E

25|$|Zahau was gagged with a blue, long sleeve T-shirt {{wrapped around}} her head with the sleeves double knotted and <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> her mouth. There was also what {{appeared}} to be tape residue on her legs. Medics attempted to revive her, but pronounced her dead at the scene. The police initiated forensic and toxicology testing on her body as part of an autopsy to determine the cause of death. She was buried at St. Joseph's Memorial Park in St. Joseph, Missouri on July 23. Speculations of foul play began early on in the case; however, investigators were unable to find any other DNA at the scene besides Zahau's. On September 2, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department formally announced their finding that Zahau committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|On that occasion, Reles dragged Irving {{from the}} hallway of his home out into the street. Reles beat, kicked, and then shot Irving {{numerous}} times, killing him. Two months later, Reles met Meyer Shapiro {{on the street and}} killed him by shooting him in the face. Another three years elapsed before Reles finally got the last Shapiro brother, William. William was abducted off the street and taken to a gang hideout. Once there, he was beaten nearly to death, <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> a sack, and driven out to the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and buried. Before the gang could finish burying William, a passerby spotted them and they had to flee the scene. William Shapiro's body was exhumed shortly thereafter, and after being autopsied it was determined that he had been buried alive.|$|E
25|$|According to Lawrence, again under Chan's instructions, Lawrence {{departed}} Australia on 6 April 2005. The day before, Lawrence, Stephens and Si Yi Chen {{met with}} Sukumaran where police allege drug smuggling {{tools such as}} sealable plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> the bags of Lawrence and Stephens. Lawrence claims she was given cash; whilst Stephens claims that his life was threatened. Media reports claim that police records show that Lawrence was in daily contact with Chan, whilst in Bali, until 13 April, when Chan changed his mobile phone number. On the same day, he instructed Lawrence {{and other members of}} the Bali Nine to change hotels. The original planned departure date of 14 April from Bali was delayed as Chan suspected Australian and Indonesian police were aware of his plans.|$|E

25|$|The {{places were}} overrun by the Soviet 4th Guards Tank Corps {{on the night}} of 10 and 11 February 1943. After the reconquest by the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking with the support of 333 Infantry Division and the 7th Panzer Division on 18 February 1943 the Wehrmacht {{soldiers}} discovered numerous deaths. Many of the bodies were horribly mutilated, ears and noses cut off and genital organs amputated and <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> their mouths. Breasts of some of the nurses were cut off, the women being brutally raped. A German military judge who was at the scene stated in an interview during the 1970s that he saw a female body with her legs spread-eagled and a broomstick rammed into her genitals. In the cellar of the main train station around 120 Germans were herded into a large storage room and then mowed down with machine guns.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, 1862, Little Crow led a {{group that}} {{attacked}} the Lower Sioux (or Redwood) Agency. Andrew Myrick {{was among the first}} who were killed. He was discovered trying to escape through a second-floor window of a building at the agency. Myrick's body later was found with grass <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> his mouth. The warriors burned the buildings at the Lower Sioux Agency, giving enough time for settlers to escape across the river at Redwood Ferry. Minnesota militia forces and B Company of the 5th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment, sent to quell the uprising, were defeated at the Battle of Redwood Ferry. Twenty-four soldiers, including the party's commander (Captain John Marsh), were killed in the battle. Throughout the day, Dakota war parties swept the Minnesota River Valley and near vicinity, killing many settlers. Numerous settlements including the townships of Milford, Leavenworth and Sacred Heart, were surrounded and burned and their populations nearly exterminated.|$|E
25|$|Fiore's {{body was}} {{discovered}}, but not identified, on Saturday, August 15, 2009 at about 7 a.m. Her badly beaten and crushed {{body was discovered}} inside a suitcase inside a dumpster in an alley in Buena Park, California. According to Buena Park police, Fiore's teeth and fingers had been removed before her nude body was <b>stuffed</b> <b>into</b> the suitcase. She had also been strangled. Authorities believe the mutilation {{was an attempt to}} impede identification. On August 18, her remains were identified using the serial numbers from her breast implants. The Orange County coroner's office reported Fiore had died a couple of hours before her body was found. Fiore's white Mercedes was found abandoned in a parking lot in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, about a mile from the penthouse Fiore shared with Jenkins in Fairfax District, Los Angeles. Police reported that there was a significant amount of blood, and some evidence of hair pulling.|$|E
