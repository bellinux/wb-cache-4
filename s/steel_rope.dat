5|$|Establishing a {{partnership}} with Robert Stirling Newall in 1850, Bell set up the first factory {{in the world with}} machines able to manufacture <b>steel</b> <b>rope</b> and submarine cable. Two years later his brothers Thomas Bell and John Bell joined him to build a major iron works at Port Clarence, Middlesbrough on the north bank of the River Tees. By 1853 there were three blast furnaces, each with a capacity of just over 6000 cubic feet, making them the largest in Britain at the time. The works produced iron for bridges and steel rails for railways across the British Empire including the North Eastern Railway company, of which Bell was a director from 1864 onwards, and deputy chairman from 1895 until his death. The Bell brothers' company operated its own ironstone mines at Normanby and Cleveland, and its own limestone quarries in Weardale, employing about 6000 men in mining and manufacturing. By 1878 the firm was producing 200,000 tons of iron per annum. Bell was a professional metallurgist and industrial chemist, constantly pioneering processes such as the recycling of heat from escaping flue gases, and trialling many process improvements.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} method and dynamical characteristics of <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> {{has been researched}} for several decades. In the past, <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> were usually modeled as a two dimensional system, which was only suitable for the planar motion. Also, no kink-wave propagation was considered when <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> were used in relatively low speed engineering application areas. By contrast, a three dimensional approach to model <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> used in high energy absorber apparatus is presented in this paper. Three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> and other objects and kink-wave propagation in <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> are taken into consideration when applying the new approach to model <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes.</b> Compared to the two dimensional model of <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes,</b> the proposed model regards <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> as a multi-body system consisting of identical cylindrical elements with {{6 degrees of freedom}} connected by space constraints. Impact forces generated by three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> and other objects are calculated and theories of elastic wave propagation are applied to analyze the kink-wave propagation when <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> are loaded with a sudden perpendicular impact by a high speed moving object. In addition, mathematical model of <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> is established and numerical simulation of the three dimensional model of <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> is implemented. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data available, the model of <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be valid and correct. Therefore, the proposed {{modeling method}} can be treated as a new approach in the research field of modeling <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes.</b> The dynamical characteristics of the <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> based on this new modeling approach are addressed simultaneously and plots of the dynamics of <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> cannot only be regarded as a basis for the further comparative studies, but also can provide some significant and interesting results...|$|R

He had also seen very little of Barbara Heathcote for some time, and she had been to him as a mental stimulant, of which he felt the loss, while now his prospects seemed as dreary as the dripping waste he stared across with heavy eyes.

High strength, low relaxation <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> with minor radius, high tensile strain and good corrosion resistance were used in this reinforcement. The construction process for strengthening with prestressed steel wire ropes—including wire rope measuring, extruding anchor heads making, anchorage installing, tensioning <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> and pouring mortar was described. Ultimate bearing capacity of the bridge after strengthening was discussed based on the concrete structure theory. The flexural strength of RC T-beam bridges strengthened with prestressed <b>steel</b> wire <b>ropes</b> was governed by the failure of concrete crushing. To investigate effectiveness of the strengthening method, fielding-load tests were carried out before and after strengthening. The results of concrete strain and deflection show that the flexural strength and stiffness of the strengthened beam are improved. The crack width measurement also indicates that this technique could increase the durability of the bridge. Thus, this strengthened way with prestressed <b>steel</b> wire <b>rope</b> is feasible and effective...|$|R
