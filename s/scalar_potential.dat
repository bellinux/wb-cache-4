40|$|We {{study the}} Aharonov–Bohm effect (AB effect) in quantum {{resonances}} for magnetic scattering in two dimensions. The system {{consists of four}} scatters, two obstacles and two <b>scalar</b> <b>potentials</b> with compact support, which are largely separated from one another. The obstacles by which the magnetic fields are completely shielded are horizontally placed between the supports of the two potentials. The fields do not influence particles from a classical mechanical point of view, but quantum particles {{are influenced by the}} corresponding vector potential which does not necessarily vanish outside the obstacle. This quantum phenomenon is called the AB effect. The resonances are shown to be generated near the real axis by the trajectories trapped between two supports of the <b>scalar</b> <b>potentials</b> as the distances between the scatterers go to infinity. We analyze how the AB effect influences the location of resonances.

On the other hand a part of space may very well be imagined without an electromagnetic field; thus in contrast with the gravitational field, the electromagnetic field seems to be only secondarily linked to the ether, the formal nature of the electromagnetic field being as yet in no way determined by that of gravitational ether.
