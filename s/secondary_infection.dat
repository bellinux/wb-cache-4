5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than systemic medication, with topical corticosteroids being the mainstay treatment. Systemic treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> of the ulcers.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> with a {{different}} strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It {{may be caused by}} poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction. There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications, and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the complement system.|$|E
50|$|During <b>secondary</b> <b>infections,</b> even {{low dose}} {{exposure}} can stimulate immune response {{at the level}} of typical high dose exposure.

5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and <b>secondary</b> <b>infection.</b> Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E

40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} {{is very common}} and may be complicated by <b>secondary</b> <b>infections.</b> Chronic lymphoedema is a potentially debilitating condition, which may occur due to <b>secondary</b> <b>infections</b> or the dermatitis itself. The problem of chronic lymphoedema following allergic {{contact dermatitis}} has been infrequently reported. We report {{a case of a}} 47 -year-old woman with severe allergic contact dermatitis complicated by chronic, intractable lymphoedema of the hands and forearms. This case report reminds us that allergic hand dermatitis may be complicated by a chronic and debilitating state of lymphoedema. Also, it underlines the importance of fast and adequate treatment of both the dermatitis and the <b>secondary</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R

25|$|Necrotic lesions {{are caused}} by {{invasion}} of blood vessels leading to thrombosis and infarcation. Though uncommon, cutaneous infections can become disseminated infections. Lesions extend into muscle, tendon, bone, and ultimately spread by the bloodstream to other organs. The brain {{is the most common}} site of <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> but necrotic lesions may also form in the spleen and heart.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there have}} been no formal {{clinical}} studies evaluating the effectiveness of topical application of calamine lotion (a topical barrier preparation containing zinc oxide, {{and one of the most}} commonly used interventions), it has an excellent safety profile. It is important to maintain good hygiene and daily cleaning of skin with warm water to avoid secondary bacterial infection.

30|$|Conclusion T {{lymphopenia}} (whatever the sepsis severity) {{is associated}} with a decreased monocytic HLA-DR expression suggesting a synergistic change in both innate and adaptive immunity. This phenomenon can be physiologic, but could be a marker of immunosuppression associated to <b>secondary</b> <b>infections.</b> Monitoring mHLA-DR expression and lymphocyte phenotype over the course of sepsis may argue in favor of immunostimulation therapy, especially if <b>secondary</b> <b>infections</b> occurred.|$|R

25|$|Bite {{symptoms}} include extreme pain, tingling, throbbing, swelling, and severe nausea. Damage can occur to muscle and bone tissue, {{especially when the}} bite occurs in the outer extremities such as the hands and feet, areas {{in which there is}} not a large muscle mass to absorb the venom. A bite from any venomous snake should be taken very seriously and immediate medical attention sought, as allergic reaction and <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> are always possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} {{symptom of}} ONJ is {{the exposure of}} mandibular or maxillary bone through lesions in the gingiva that do not heal. Pain, inflammation of the surrounding soft tissue, <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> or drainage {{may or may not}} be present. The development of lesions is most frequent after invasive dental procedures, such as extractions, and is also known to occur spontaneously. There may be no symptoms for weeks or months, until lesions with exposed bone appear. Lesions are more common on the mandible than the maxilla.|$|E
25|$|Dry socket is {{more likely}} to occur where there is a {{pre-existing}} infection in the mouth, such as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or chronic periodontitis. Wisdom teeth not associated with pericoronitis are less likely to cause a dry socket when extracted. The oral microbiota has been demonstrated to have fibrinolytic action in some individuals, and these persons may be predisposed to developing dry sockets after tooth extraction. Infection of the socket following tooth extraction is different from dry socket, although in dry socket <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> may occur in addition.|$|E

25|$|Fever is {{rare and}} should raise {{suspicion}} for <b>secondary</b> <b>infection.</b> Patients can be lethargic, {{and might have}} sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet. Kussmaul breathing, a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion. Blood pressure drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time. Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, seizures, or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common, especially in children.|$|E
25|$|Once the dog {{can keep}} fluids down, the IV fluids are {{gradually}} discontinued, and very bland food slowly introduced. Oral antibiotics are administered {{for a number}} of days depending on the white blood cell count and the patient's ability to fight off <b>secondary</b> <b>infection.</b> A puppy with minimal symptoms can recover in 2 or 3 days if the IV fluids are begun as soon as symptoms are noticed and the CPV test confirms the diagnosis. If more severe, depending on treatment, puppies can remain ill from 5 days up to 2 weeks. However, even with hospitalization, {{there is no guarantee that}} the dog will be cured and survive.|$|E
25|$|In Ghana, a {{study that}} {{combined}} the sanitation and fungicide application showed {{a significant reduction in}} the percentage of disease incidence, where greater black pod incident were observed from pods on the trunk than the canopy in control treatment (no fungicide application). This suggested that the application of fungicide on the trunk would protect pods from infection, therefore reduce primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> rate, both on the trunk and in the canopy. In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of fungicide for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (metalaxyl) fungicide showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based fungicide) in both locations that were used in the experiment.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two forms}} of CPV2: {{intestinal}} and cardiac. Puppies are most susceptible, but more than 80 percent of adult dogs show no symptoms. With severe disease, dogs can die within 48 to 72 hours without treatment by fluids. In the more common, less severe form, mortality is about 10 percent. Certain breeds, such as Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, and Pit bull terriers {{as well as other}} black and tan colored dogs may be more susceptible to CPV2. Along with age and breed, factors such as a stressful environment, concurrent infections with bacteria, parasites, and canine coronavirus increase a dog's risk of severe infection. Dogs who catch Parvovirus usually die from the dehydration it causes or <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> rather than the virus itself.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is cause-related, {{but also}} {{symptomatic}} if {{the underlying cause}} is unknown or not correctable. It {{is also important to}} note that most ulcers will heal completely without any intervention. Treatment can range from simply smoothing or removing a local cause of trauma, to addressing underlying factors such as dry mouth or substituting a problem medication. Maintaining good oral hygiene and use of an antiseptic mouthwash or spray (e.g. chlorhexidine) can prevent <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> and therefore hasten healing. A topical analgesic (e.g. benzydamine mouthwash) may reduce pain. Topical (gels, creams or inhalers) or systemic steroids may be used to reduce inflammation. An antifungal drug may be used to prevent oral candidiasis developing in those who use prolonged steroids. People with mouth ulcers may prefer to avoid hot or spicy foods, which can increase the pain. Self-inflicted ulceration can be difficult to manage, and psychiatric input may be required in some people.|$|E
25|$|The {{causal agent}} of {{bacterial}} wilt and canker of tomato survives in or on seeds {{for up to}} 8 months but occasionally also in plant refuse in the soil. The pathogen can be spread long distances because of its association with seeds. The risk of spreading the bacteria to healthy tomato plants is greatest during transplanting, tying, and suckering or any time when the host may be wounded. Once the bacteria enters the plant through a wound, it will move and multiply primarily in the xylem vessels. Once established, the bacteria may move into the phloem, pith, and cortex. Infection can result in either systemic or superficial disease. Systemic infections appear in 3–6 weeks {{and the risk of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>infection</b> goes up with water-splashing. The common occurrence of latent infections – presence of the pathogen within the host yet the host shows no symptoms – makes this pathogen especially dangerous.|$|E
50|$|No {{specific}} treatment {{is available for}} WNV infection. In severe cases treatment consists of supportive care that often involves hospitalization, intravenous fluids, respiratory support, and prevention of <b>secondary</b> <b>infections.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{majority}} infections {{caused by}} dengue virus (DENV) are asymptomatic, but a {{higher incidence of}} severe illness, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, is associated with <b>secondary</b> <b>infections,</b> suggesting that pre-existing immunity plays a central role in dengue pathogenesis. Primary infections are typically associated with a largely serotype-specific antibody response, while <b>secondary</b> <b>infections</b> show a shift to a broadly cross-reactive antibody response. We hypothesized that the basis for the shift in serotype-specificity between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>infections</b> {{can be found in a}} change in the antibody fine-specificity. To investigate the link between epitope- and serotype-specificity, we assembled the Dengue Virus Antibody Database, an online repository containing over 400 DENV-specific mAbs, each annotated with information on 1) its origin, including the immunogen, host immune history, and selection methods, 2) binding/neutralization data against all four DENV serotypes, and 3) epitope mapping at the domain or residue level to the DENV E protein. We combined epitope mapping and activity information to determine a residue-level index of epitope propensity and cross-reactivity and generated detailed composite epitope maps of primary and secondary antibody responses. We found differing patterns of epitope-specificity between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>infections,</b> where <b>secondary</b> responses target a distinct subset of epitopes found in the primary response. We found that <b>secondary</b> <b>infections</b> were marked with an enhanced response to cross-reactive epitopes, such as the fusion-loop and E-dimer region, as well as increased cross-reactivity in what are typically more serotype-specific epitope regions, such as the domain I-II interface and domain III. Our results support the theory that pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells form the basis for the secondary antibody response, resulting in a broadening of the response in terms of cross-reactivity, and a focusing of the response to a subset of epitopes, including some, such as the fusion-loop region, that are implicated in poor neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement of infection...|$|R
