5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
5|$|One action RPG that avoided these {{limitations}} is Deus Ex (2000), designed by Warren Spector. It offered multiple <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> through intricately layered dialogue choices, a deep skill tree, and hand-crafted environments. Players were challenged {{to act in}} character through dialog choices appropriate {{to his or her}} chosen role, and by intelligent use of the surrounding environment. This produced a unique experience that was tailored to each player. According to Spector, the game's dialogue choices were inspired by a console role-playing game, Suikoden.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{thrives on}} change and new experiences, and many {{handlers}} find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in obedience competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead {{it to find}} <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} petitioners, {{many of whom}} are {{citizens}} of the players' cities, who request <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> and changes to city policies, such as lowering tax rates or enacting an ordinance. They may also give the player rewards or request certain structures to be erected in the city.|$|E
25|$|Engineers apply {{mathematics}} and sciences such as physics to find novel <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> or to improve existing solutions. More than ever, engineers are now {{required to have}} a proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.|$|E
25|$|Rehabilitation {{engineering}} is the systematic application of engineering sciences to design, develop, adapt, test, evaluate, apply, and distribute technological <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> confronted by individuals with disabilities. Functional areas addressed through rehabilitation engineering may include mobility, communications, hearing, vision, and cognition, and activities associated with employment, independent living, education, and {{integration into the}} community.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{election}} of Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential elections, Jeremy Corbyn said that he believes that President Trump is not offering <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems,</b> but simply being divisive.

25|$|The Rose-Hulman Engineers Without Borders (EWB-RHIT) {{organization}} implements sustainable engineering <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> {{faced by}} impoverished {{communities in the}} third world. The chapter {{is a part of}} the international Engineers Without Borders (USA) organization, and is open to Rose-Hulman students of all disciplines. Although several technical advisers are affiliated with the program, EWB-RHIT is student-led and each of the chapter's project plans are developed primarily by its student members.|$|E
25|$|Benefits of {{community-based}} program design include gaining {{insight into the}} social context of an issue or problem, mutual learning experiences between consumer and provider, broadening understanding of professional roles and responsibilities within the community, interaction with professionals from other disciplines, and opportunities for community-based participatory research projects. Increased sustainability is an advantage {{of community-based}} program design. The program sustainability is ensured by the identification of <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> based on existing resources accessible to all community members. Also, the involvement of local community leaders and local volunteers reinforce the sustainability {{of the impact of the}} program.|$|E

25|$|Second, the {{psychology}} of cognitive development involves understanding how cognitive change takes place and recognizing the factors and processes which enable cognitive competence to develop. Education also capitalizes on cognitive change, because the construction of knowledge presupposes effective teaching methods that would move the student from a lower {{to a higher level}} of understanding. Mechanisms such as reflection on actual or mental actions vis-à-vis alternative <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems,</b> tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them are just a few examples of how mechanisms of cognitive development may be used to facilitate learning.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{and local}} governments have taken {{political}} steps in reducing maternal deaths. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute studied maternal health systems in four apparently similar countries: Rwanda, Malawi, Niger, and Uganda. In comparison to the other three countries, Rwanda has an excellent recent record of improving maternal death rates. Based on their investigation of these varying country case studies, the researchers conclude that improving maternal health depends on three key factors: 1. reviewing all maternal health-related policies frequently {{to ensure that they}} are internally coherent; 2. enforcing standards on providers of maternal health services; 3. any local <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> discovered should be promoted, not discouraged.|$|E
25|$|Community Outreach and Resources (COAR) is {{a student}} run diverse group of {{students}} serving community needs through an active exchange of service and learning while continually striving to find <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> that challenge the community. Throughout the school year, COAR organizes several events on and off campus to create an opportunity for students to help better the community. Some of these events include Into the Streets, Pumpkin Palooza (an on-campus trick-or-treat for area children), a Gift Box Drive for Head Start, a Variety Show and silent auction {{to raise money for}} Alternative Breaks with Habitat for Humanity, Spring Forward Festival (an Easter egg hunt and crafts for area children), and Pay it Forward Week. Each event is fun and unique for students and the general public.|$|E
