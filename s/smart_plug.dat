40|$|AbstractThe UAE {{per capita}} energy {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the highest in the world. Since the energy sector is the center of most ecological problems facing the world today, eco-efficiency and eco-innovations are {{at the top of the}} sustainability agenda in most countries. The UAE “Green Economy for Sustainable Development” (2012 – 2021) aims to position the country as a center for the export and re-export of green products and technologies. In light of the above, the focus of this paper is to present a <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> system for monitoring and controlling household energy consumption using a mobile application. The <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> system is an essential component in smart grids as it provides real-time high-resolution information for distribution companies to aid them in decision-making. In addition, the study measures the perceived usefulness and satisfaction of the <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> system and its mobile application in the UAE. The paper makes an important theoretical contribution by including environmental concern as an additional variable to a well-established information systems success model. Our findings suggest that the <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> system provides users with convenient access to information regarding their personal energy consumption and allows them to control their per capital energy consumptions via the mobile application at very low costs. Further, we validated our theoretical model using structural equation modeling and conclude that environmental concern has an indirect impact on the perceived satisfaction and both an indirect and a direct impact on the perceived usefulness of the <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> system. The practical implications of our study suggest that per capita energy consumption is likely to significantly decrease with wide adoption of the <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> system in the UAE...|$|E

40|$|Abstracts] The Internet of Energy (IoE) {{represents}} a novel paradigm where electrical power systems work cooperatively with smart devices {{to increase the}} visibility of energy consumption and create safer, cleaner and sustainable energy systems. The implementation of IoE services {{involves the use of}} multiple components, like embedded systems, power electronics or sensors, which are {{an essential part of the}} infrastructure dedicated to the generation and distribution energy and the one required by the final consumer. This article focuses on the latter and presents a smart socket system that collects the information about energy price and makes use of sensors and actuators to optimize home energy consumption according to the user preferences. Specifically, this article provides three main novel contributions. First, what to our knowledge is the first hardware prototype that manages in a practical real-world scenario the price values obtained from a public electricity operator is presented. The second contribution is related to the definition of a novel wireless sensor network communications protocol based on Wi-Fi that allows for creating an easy-to-deploy <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> system that self-organizes and auto-configures to collect the sensed data, minimizing user intervention. Third, it is provided a thorough description of the design of one of the few open-source <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> systems, including its communications architecture, the protocols implemented, the main sensing and actuation components and the most relevant pieces of the software. Moreover, with the aim of illustrating the capabilities of the <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> system, the results of different experiments performed are shown.

40|$|The {{revolution}} in the energy market and the end user need to control the things he has around him lead {{to the creation of}} a new concept: flexoffers. The flexoffer is built around scheduling energy usage with the prices of the energy market. The flexoffer is comprised of the pattern of usage and a window of when the pattern can begin. Those parameters are exposed to the energy markets using an Aggregator, entity responsible for gathering all the flexoffers in a region. The market will reply to the flexoffer proposition with the best time for the consumption of that energy, which in this case is when the prices are the lowest. This project revolves around the implementation of a pilot capable of applying that concept to a real life situation. Thus FlexHousing was created. It allows for the control of the energy usage of the appliances in a home or building. Such is possible by the integration of external technologies. Virtual Power Solutions, a national energy solutions company developed a product called Cloogy. The Cloogy is a gateway installed in one’s house and is capable of communicating with smart device provided by VPS. In this case, <b>smart</b> <b>plugs</b> were deployed. These <b>smart</b> <b>plugs</b> are placed between the appliance and the electrical outlet. From there the plug is able to control the flow of electricity towards the appliance. Sensors are also installed in these plugs, capable of collecting data regarding the energy usage amongst other metrics. In order to operate the plugs, VPS also provided us with an external API, capable of receiving request and forwarding those request back to the plugs. FlexHousing is comprised of 2 modules: the FlexHousing middleware and the FlexHousing FrontEnd. The middleware acts as a hub for every operation in the FlexHousing environment. It bridges the various system in play, the flexoffer services and the VPS services. FlexHousing allows for the creation of rooms and the attachment of devices equipped with VPS technology. The user is then able to perform a variety of operations, such as, applying flexoffers, remotely controlling the appliances and collect data from the sensors in the VPS devices. For the interaction with the user, FlexHousing FrontEnd was developed. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for the user to setup and control FlexHousing middleware. The interface revolves around the rooms and the devices. The user is able to check the flexoffers he has applied and the schedules the flexoffers services sent back. If the user wants, he can deploy the VPS <b>smart</b> <b>plugs</b> to non flexoffer complaint devices, such as lamps, television and computer. Using the FrontEnd, he is also capable of using them. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Fine-grained {{real-time}} metering is {{a fundamental}} service of wireless energy auditing networks, where metering data is transmitted from embedded power meters to gateways for centralized processing, storage, and forwarding. Due to limited meter capability and wireless bandwidth, the increasing sampling rates and network scales needed to support new energy auditing applications pose significant challenges to metering data fidelity and secrecy. This paper exploits the compression and encryption properties of compressive sensing (CS) to design a joint data compression and encryption (JICE) approach that addresses these two challenges simultaneously. Compared with a conventional signal processing pipeline that compresses and encrypts data sequentially, JICE reduces computation and storage complexities due to its simple design. It thus leaves more processor time and available buffer space for handling lossy wireless transmissions. Moreover, JICE features a machine-learning-based reconfigu-ration mechanism that adapts its signal representation basis to changing power patterns autonomously. On a <b>smart</b> <b>plug</b> platform, we implemented JICE and several baseline approaches including downsampling, lossless compression, and the pipeline approach. Extensive testbed experiments show that JICE achieves higher data delivery ratios and lower recovery distortions under a range of realistic settings. In particular, JICE increases the number of meters supported by a gateway by 50 %, compared with the pipeline approach, while keeping a distortion rate lower than 5 %. I...|$|E

To successfully respond to this growing usage of direct current (DC) systems it is important to provoke an evolution in the provision of DC infrastructure. At present, there are doubts about the safety, efficiency, reliability and economical aspects of DC grids.
