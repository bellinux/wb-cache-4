50|$|Hypnosis {{has been}} used in various professions {{including}} dentistry, medicine, psychotherapy and sports, as a performance enhancement tool. Sports hypnosis incorporates cognitive and sports science methodologies. Hypnosis in sports therefore overlaps with areas such as biomechanics, nutrition, physiology and <b>sports</b> <b>psychology.</b> Generally <b>sports</b> hypnosis is studied within the field of <b>sports</b> <b>psychology,</b> which examines the impact of psychological variables on athletes' performance. While <b>sports</b> <b>psychology</b> began to be studied around the 1920s, the study and use of hypnosis was not documented until the 1950s.
