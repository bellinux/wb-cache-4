However, {{it is well}} known that the parabolic interpolation gives a biased motion estimate for displacements greater than |y. 2 | samples (y = 0, 1, …). Grid slope <b>sub-sample</b> interpolation is less biased, but it shows large variability for displacements close to y. 0. We therefore propose to combine these <b>sub-sample</b> methods into one method (GS 15 PI) using a threshold to determine when to use which method. The proposed method was evaluated on simulated, phantom, and in vivo ultrasound cine loops and was compared to three <b>sub-sample</b> interpolation methods. On average, GS 15 PI reduced the absolute <b>sub-sample</b> estimation errors in the simulated and phantom cine loops by 14, 8, and 24 % compared to <b>sub-sample</b> interpolation of the image, parabolic <b>sub-sample</b> interpolation, and grid slope <b>sub-sample</b> interpolation, respectively. The limited in vivo evaluation of estimations of the longitudinal movement of the common carotid artery using parabolic and grid slope <b>sub-sample</b> interpolation and GS 15 PI resulted in coefficient of variation (CV) values of 6. 9, 7. 5, and 6. 8 %, respectively.

Open ocean (shallow and deep) and coastal (shallow and deep) samples were collected and five <b>sub-samples</b> from each collection were filtered through a cartridge filter.

To evaluate the gains of avoiding specification search on the estimation <b>sub-sample,</b> we follow Gong (1986) [8] and calculate the expected excess error, which is a measure of excess optimism concerning model fit on the specification sample.
