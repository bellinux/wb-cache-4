5|$|As {{the team}} with the best regular season record, the Presidents' Trophy winner is {{guaranteed}} home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> playoffs, provided they advance that far. However, it does not guarantee that success; only eight of these winners have gone on to win the <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup.</b> Three other teams reached the <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> Finals, but failed to win. The last team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> in the same season was the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks. The only team to accomplish this more than once is the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 'challenge' {{format of}} <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> play before 1915, {{there is often}} {{confusion}} about how many Stanley Cups the Senators should be given credit for: nine, ten or eleven. The Senators were <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> champions {{at the end of}} nine hockey seasons without dispute. In another two seasons, 1905–06 and 1909–10, the Senators won <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> challenges but were not champions {{at the end of the}} season. The Hockey Hall of Fame and the National Hockey League agree that the Senators of 1906 were champions but disagree on whether the Senators were champions in 1910. In both seasons, the Senators were the undisputed defending champions, and during that year's hockey season, the Senators won <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> challenges. However, by the end of both hockey seasons, they were no longer holders of the <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E

Morenz was the first NHL player to score a second <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> winning goal, with the Canadiens' victory in the 1930 <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> Finals over the Boston Bruins. The Bruins, who {{finished}} with a 38–5–1 record {{and at one point}} during the season went 23 games without a defeat, lost consecutive games to Montreal in the finals, 3–0 and 4–3.

In the 1926 <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> final, the Cougars lost the series 3–1 against the Montreal Maroons. That marked {{the last time a}} non-NHL team appeared in the <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> finals, as the WHL folded after the 1926 <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> final, and its players were absorbed by the NHL.

5|$|In 1924–25, {{after the}} Metropolitans folded {{and the rest}} of the PCHA merged with the WCHL, Holmes joined the Victoria Cougars. In his first season with the Cougars, Holmes posted a 16–12 regular season record, with three shutouts and a 2.25goals-against average. In the WCHL playoffs, Holmes was undefeated in four games. He had two wins and ties each, with one shutout and a 1.75goals-against average. In the <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> final, Holmes posted a 3–1 record with a 2.00goals-against average against the Montreal Canadiens. It was the last time a non-NHL team won the <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup.</b> It was Holmes' fourth and last <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> victory.|$|E
5|$|In November 1917, Holmes {{signed as}} a free agent with the Montreal Wanderers. The Wanderers, in turn, loaned Holmes back to Seattle on December 12, 1917. On January 4, 1918, the Metropolitans {{returned}} Holmes under loan to the Torontos, now in the newly formed NHL. In his only full season with the Torontos/Arenas, Holmes appeared in 16 regular season games, posting a 9–7 record, with a 4.73goals-against average and no shutouts. In the NHL playoffs, Holmes played two games, winning and losing one apiece. In the <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> finals, Holmes had a 3–2 record over five games, with a 4.00goals-against average, en route to Holmes' third <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> win. He is the only member of both the Blueshirts' 1914 <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> win and the Torontos' 1917 <b>Stanley</b> <b>Cup</b> win. After playing only two games with the Toronto Arenas the following season, surrendering nine goals in two losses, Holmes was recalled by the Metropolitans on December 27, 1918.|$|E
