An Ungerboeck [...] like set partitioning of the multidimensional CCK symbol constellation is given. For the proposed RSSE algorithm {{based on this}} partitioning, numerical results are provided for a typical indoor wireless channel.

40|$|We {{investigate}} optimal and suboptimal decision {{rules for}} parallel code acquisition in chip-asynchronous direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS/SS) systems. The conventional decision rule for parallel acquisition {{is to choose}} the largest correlator output of a receiver. However, such a scheme is optimum only for chip-synchronous models. In this letter, an optimal decision rule is derived based on the maximum-likelihood criterion for chipasynchronous models. A simpler suboptimal decision rule is also discussed. The performance of the optimum and <b>suboptimum</b> <b>decision</b> rules is {{compared to that of}} the conventional decision rule. Numerical results show, that for chip-asynchronous models, both the optimal and suboptimal decision rules outperform the conventional decision rule...|$|E
40|$|Optimum crop {{protection}} strategies {{are not always}} feasible because of social constraints. For example, paddy-upland rotation, which is a common weed control and soil fertility management method in Japan, is not always practiced. When group decisions on cooperative land rotation that were undertaken to comply with government policy on reducing rice production have failed, rotation of upland wheat, upland soybean, and fallow is practiced. This is necessary because the location of paddy cultivation must be in one place, which makes rotation of paddy rice, upland wheat, upland soybean, and fallow unfeasible. In this case, farmers have to employ weed control methods other than paddy flooding which {{can be considered as}} ecological weed management. However, potential weed control options are limited to, for example, application of herbicides and lime, which are not necessarily effective because of the existence of herbicide-resistant weeds. Furthermore, increased use of herbicides tends to increase environmental degradation as well as economic costs. Thus, farmers are forced to make the second-best (suboptimum) decisions. This paper defines the second-best decisions made under social constraints by constructing a decision making structure on weed control for wheat cultivation in Japan. Two-objective decision models, which are presented graphically using influence diagrams, are developed for the analysis. The results indicate that under social constrains, famers are forced to make the second-best decision, in which they cannot apply paddy flooding as ecological weed management for reducing the use of herbicides, and that the <b>suboptimum</b> <b>decision</b> affects the environment as well as the economy...|$|E
40|$|While {{the focus}} of the project {{management}} literature has been on the management of single projects, the management of multiproject environments is largely neglected. In this research I am focusing on mutiproject environments which exist within a single firm (hereafter called Alpha). Through my investigation in this multiproject environment I explored root causes for project inefficiencies which rather than being possible to attribute to source within each single project boundary, are caused by the effects which I term them systemic effects. System effects are dynamics triggered by the complex linear, nonlinear and time delayed interaction of large number of factors. I develop a model which explains the dynamics through which the systemic effects deteriorate the performance of the projects in this organization. The model is useful in creating awareness among the managers about the lack of holistic approach in decision making and the effects of <b>suboptimum</b> <b>decisions</b> in this environment...|$|R
40|$|Optimum {{diversity}} and worst-case partial-band noise jamming conditions have been derived for noncoherent energy detection of frequency-hopped (FH) M-ary frequency-shift keyed (MFSK) signals using a soft-chip <b>decision</b> <b>suboptimum</b> linear combining metric with perfect jamming-state side information. However, the assumption implicit in previous publications {{is that the}} error is first maximized over the jammer's partial-band duty factor for arbitrary diversity, {{and the result is}} then minimized over the amount of diversity. This paper shows that if the order of optimization is reversed, different conditions and performance are produced; that is, the previous solution is not a saddlepoint. This introduces some game-theoretic considerations for the communicator and the jammer, the risks and advantages of which are explored...|$|R
40|$|Various {{types of}} {{multistage}} decoding for multilevel block modulation codes, {{in which the}} decoding of a component code at each stage can be either soft decision or hard decision, maximum likelihood or bounded distance are discussed. Error performance for codes is analyzed for a memoryless additive channel based on various types of multi-stage decoding, and upper bounds on the probability of an incorrect decoding are derived. It was found that, if component codes of a multi-level modulation code and types of decoding at various stages are chosen properly, high spectral efficiency and large coding gain can be achieved with reduced decoding complexity. It {{was found that the}} difference in performance between the <b>suboptimum</b> multi-stage soft <b>decision</b> maximum likelihood decoding of a modulation code and the single stage optimum decoding of the overall code is very small, only a fraction of dB loss in SNR at the probability of an incorrect decoding for a block of 10 (exp - 6). Multi-stage decoding of multi-level modulation codes really offers a way to achieve the best of three worlds, bandwidth efficiency, coding gain, and decoding complexity...|$|R
