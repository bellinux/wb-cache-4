40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{utilization}} of oil shale mining waste rock in Estonia. Crushed waste rock is utilized as an aggregate in civil engineering in frost-free environmental conditions and in road building in unbound mixtures where required resistance to fragmentation LA ≤ 35 %. This study determines areas of utilization of waste rock and shows that waste rock aggregate produced using selective mining or <b>selective</b> <b>crushing</b> technology is usable in civil engineering in partially saturated conditions and in unbound mixtures where aggregates require resistance to fragmentation LA ≤ 30 %. Waste rock is usable for backfilling the already mined areas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In case of {{stratified}} deposits {{like oil}} shale deposit in Estonia, mining losses depend on mining technologies. Current {{research focuses on}} extraction and separation possibilities of mineral resources. Selective mining, <b>selective</b> <b>crushing</b> and separation tests have been performed, showing possibilities of decreasing mining losses. Rock crushing and screening process simulations were used for optimizing rock fractions. In addition mine backfilling, fine separation, and optimized drilling and blasting have been analyzed. All tested methods show potential and depend on mineral usage. Usage in addition depends on the utilization technology. The questions like stability of the material flow and influences of the quality fluctuations to the final yield are raised...|$|E
40|$|Olivine {{crystal size}} {{distributions}} (CSDs) have been measured in three suites of spinel- and garnet-bearing harzburgites and lherzolites found as xenoliths in alkaline basalts from Canary Islands, Africa; Victoria Land, Antarctica; and Pali Aike, South America. The xenoliths derive from lithospheric mantle, from depths ranging from 80 to 20 km. Their textures vary from coarse to porphyroclastic and mosaic-porphyroclastic up to cataclastic. Data {{have been collected}} by processing digital images acquired optically from standard petrographic thin sections. The acquisition method {{is based on a}} high-resolution colour scanner that allows image capturing of a whole thin section. Image processing was performed using the VISILOG 5. 2 package, resolving crystals larger than about 150 gm and applying stereological corrections based on the Schwartz-Saltykov algorithm. Taking account of truncation effects due to resolution limits and thin section size, all samples show scale invariance of crystal size distributions over almost three orders of magnitude (0. 2 - 25 mm). Power law relations show fractal dimensions varying between 2. 4 and 3. 8, a range of values observed for distributions of fragment sizes in a variety of other geological contexts. A fragmentation model can reproduce the fractal dimensions around 2. 6, which correspond to well-equilibrated granoblastic textures. Fractal dimensions > 3 are typical of porphyroclastic and cataclastic samples. Slight bends in some linear arrays suggest <b>selective</b> tectonic <b>crushing</b> of crystals with size larger than I mm. The scale invariance shown by lithospheric mantle xenoliths in a variety of tectonic settings forms distant geographic regions, which indicate that this is a common characteristic of the upper mantle and should be taken into account in theological models and evaluation of metasomatic models.

The sub- 10 -micrometer fraction of ash generated by pyroclastic flows formed by Lava dome collapse contains 10 to 24 weight percent crystalline silica, an enrichment of 2 to 5 relative to the magma caused by <b>selective</b> <b>crushing</b> of the groundmass. The sub- 10 -micrometer fraction of ash generated by explosive eruptions has much lower contents (3 to 6 percent) of crystalline silica.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{alternative methods}} for {{the processing of}} concrete waste. The mechanical stresses needed for the embrittlement of the mortar matrix and further <b>selective</b> <b>crushing</b> of concrete were generated by either electric impulses or microwaves heating. Tests were carried out on lab-made concrete samples representative of concrete waste from concrete mixer trucks and on concrete waste collected on a French demolition site. The results obtained so far show that both techniques {{can be used to}} weaken concrete samples and to enhance aggregate selective liberation (that is the production of cement paste-free aggregates) during crushing and grinding. Electric pulses treatment seems to appear more efficient, more robust and less energy consuming (1 - 3 kW h t− 1) than microwave treatment (10 - 40 kW h t− 1) but it can only be applied on samples in water leading to a major drawback for recycling aggregates or cement paste in the cement production process...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhosphate mining {{represents}} a significant {{industry in the}} State of Florida. In view of the great demand for resources, the industry is in a strong public focus. In mining and processing, the phosphate ore mining process alone is responsible for about 45 % of the total energy consumption. Slurry pumping to the processing plant accounts for {{one third of the}} energy consumption during mining. Various {{studies have shown that the}} optimum solid-water ratio for slurry pumping is approximately 60 wt%. It is difficult to achieve this value with the technology of hydraulic monitor operations applied at the present time. For operational reasons, more precise control of the solids content is almost impossible. The Florida Industrial and Phosphate Research Institute therefore funded this research project. Disaggregation and slurrying of phosphate matrix represents the principle problem in pumping slurry. It is still state of the art to use draglines in phosphate ore mining. The dragline dumps the phosphate matrix in the pit, where it is slurried with the help of hydraulic monitors and conveyed to a static grizzly. The grizzly is used to scalp larger rocks and roots. It requires cleaning at regular intervals. A suction pump situated behind the grizzly, pumps the slurry to the processing plant. The average solids content of the slurry is only about 25 - 35 wt%, and varies widely depending on the material properties. Under this investigation, four different types of phosphate ore were examined. In the first step the phosphate ores were analyzed and characterized. Then two different methods were evaluated to improve the slurrying process. First, tests were performed using high pressure water jets of up to 200 bars in order to disaggregate the phosphate matrix. In principle, it is possible to achieve disaggregation and slurrying using this technology, but the necessary throughput cannot be acquired due to the long retention time required. Second, <b>selective</b> <b>crushing</b> tests were carried out using a wet hammer mill. This technology was able to achieve a solids content of 60 wt%, while still producing a high degree of disaggregation of the clay agglomerates, without destroying the valuable material. A preliminary design for a mobile disaggregation and slurrying unit was developed on the basis of these test results. The new technology could reduce water demand from 2. 16 m 3 /t to only 0. 58 m 3 /t and energy consumption from 1. 32 kWh/t to 0. 36 kWh/t...|$|E
