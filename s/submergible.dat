These technologies were compared and recommendations {{given to the}} United States Geological Survey (USGS) for adoption by the National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. The goal is to reduce labor costs and increase information content. This paper examines lotic system samplers, portable autonomous whole-water samplers, and autonomous <b>submergible</b> whole-water samplers. When investigating whole-water sampling technology, it was imperative {{to take into consideration}} what chemical classifications can be sampled for by each respected technology. Chemical classifications considered are: emerging contaminants, major ions, nutrients, polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, and trace elements. The result of this project shows that USGS is currently using the best technology available for lotic systems. For portable autonomous whole-water samplers it is recommended that USGS incorporate certain brands and models to reduce cost and improve data collection for their sampling events. Autonomous <b>submergible</b> whole-water samplers are primarily advertised for oceanic research; however, if deployed in fresh water systems, USGS can reduce labor cost and increase data collection.

Such projects are often also dogged by siltation, delays in construction and heavy debt burdens-factors that are not considered in the project planning exercise. A simple constrained optimization model for the benefit ost analysis of large hydropower projects that considers these features is proposed. The model is then applied to two sites in India. Using the potential productivity of an energy plantation on the <b>submergible</b> land is suggested as a reasonable approach to estimating the opportunity cost of submergence. Optimum project dimensions are calculated for various scenarios. Results indicate that the inclusion of submergence cost {{may lead to a}} substanual reduction in net present value and hence in project viability. Parameters such as project lifespan, contruction time, discount rate and external debt burden are also of significance. The designs proposed by the planners are found to be uneconomic, whIle even the optimal design may not be viable for more typical scenarios.

40|$|Several imaging {{techniques}} aimed at detecting ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) echo signals, while suppressing signals {{coming from the}} surrounding tissue, have been developed. These techniques are especially relevant for blood flow, perfusion, or contrast dispersion quantification. However, despite several approaches being presented, improving {{the understanding of the}} ultrasound/UCAs interaction may support further development of {{imaging techniques}}. In this paper, the physical phenomena behind the formation of harmonic components in tissue and UCAs, respectively, are addressed as a possible way to recognize the origin of the echo signals. Simulations based on a modified Rayleigh, Plesset, Noltingk, Neppiras, and Poritsky equation and transmission and backscattering measurements of ultrasound propagating through UCAs performed with a single element transducer and a <b>submergible</b> hydrophone, are presented. Both numerical and in vitro results show the occurrence of a cumulative time delay between the second harmonic and fundamental component which increases with UCA concentration and propagation path length through UCAs, and that was clearly observable at frequencies (f 0 ¿=¿ 2. 5 ¿MHz) and pressure regimes (mechanical index¿=¿ 0. 1) of interest for imaging. Most importantly, this delay is not observed in the absence of UCAs. In conclusion, the reported phenomenon represents a marker for UCAs with potential application for imaging...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect {{of water in the}} dynamic {{response}} of large trash-racks used in hydropower plants. These are large structures that are fully submerged in water and located in the hydraulic circuits to prevent debris and large bodies from entering the turbine. These structures are prone to suffering fatigue damage. Broken bars are rather common, which can produce damage in the turbine and other hydraulic components. To avoid fatigue problems, the trash-racks must be designed to avoid coincidence between the excitation frequencies of vortex shedding and the natural frequencies of the trash rack. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to know which are the natural frequencies and the associated mode-shapes, so as to avoid fluid–structure coupling (lock-in), which can lead to high vibration levels. Finite element models, including the surrounding mass of water, are used for this study. The methodology is applied to two existing trash-racks by calculating the modal parameters and using the numerical finite element model. An experimental investigation is also carried out in one of the trash-racks by impacting the underwater grille and measuring the response using <b>submergible</b> accelerometers. Experimental modal analysis is utilized to extract the modal characteristics of the actual trash rack. There is a good agreement between the numerical and the experimental results. With the validated model, the effects of fluid added mass and damping on the dynamic response of both trash-racks are evaluated and discussed in order to extract some common conclusions.

40|$|In this paper, {{the natural}} {{frequencies}} and mode shapes of a rotating disk submerged and totally confined inside a rigid casing, have been obtained. These have been calculated analytically, numerically and experimentally for different axial gaps disk-casing. A simplified analytical model to analyse the dynamic response of a rotating disk submerged and confined, {{that has been}} used and validated in previous researches, is used in this case, generalised for arbitrary axial gaps disk-casing. To use this model, it is necessary to know the averaged rotating speed of the flow with respect to the disk. This parameter is obtained after an analytical discussion of the motion of the flow inside the casing where the disk rotates, and by means of CFD simulations for different axial positions of the disk. The natural frequencies of the rotating disk for the different axial confinements can be calculated following this method. A Finite Element Model has been built up to obtain the natural frequencies by means of computational simulation. The relative velocity of the flow with respect to the disk is also introduced in the simulation model in order to estimate the natural frequencies of the rotating disk. Experimental tests have been performed with a rotating disk test rig. A thin stainless steel disk (thickness of 8 mm, (h/r< 5 %) and mass of 7. 6 kg) rotates inside a rigid casing. The position of the disk can be adjusted at several axial gaps disk-casing. A piezoelectric patch (PZT) attached on the rotating disk is used to excite the structure. Several miniature and <b>submergible</b> accelerometers have measured the response from the rotating frame. Excitation and measured signals are transmitted from the rotating to the stationary frame through a slip ring system. Experimental results are contrasted with the results obtained by the analytical and numerical model. Thereby, the influence of the axial gap disk-casing on the natural frequencies of a rotating disk totally confined and surrounded by a heavy fluid is determined.
