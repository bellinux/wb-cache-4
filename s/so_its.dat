5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was moving along the coastline {{of the southeastern}} United States, a new hurricane was observed in the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west-northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October7.

60|$|A {{moment later}} the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered into the room. Heavily built and massive, there was a {{suggestion}} of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head <b>so</b> masterful in <b>its</b> brow, <b>so</b> alert in <b>its</b> steel-gray, deep-set eyes, <b>so</b> firm in <b>its</b> lips, and <b>so</b> subtle in <b>its</b> play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Rhine Campaign of 1795 the {{two sides}} had called a truce. Despite the truce, both sides planned for war. In a decree on 6 January 1796, Lazare Carnot gave Germany {{priority}} over Italy as a theater of war. The First French Republic's finances were in poor shape <b>so</b> <b>its</b> armies would be expected to invade new territories and then live off the conquered lands. Knowing that the French planned to invade Germany, on 20 May 1796 the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May, and prepared for invasion.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{can bind to}} troponin C to act as troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators that bind to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has been tested in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, <b>so</b> <b>its</b> biological target is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{has reduced}} dragonfly populations across the world, {{for example in}} Japan. Over 60% of Japan's wetlands {{were lost in the}} 20th century, <b>so</b> <b>its</b> dragonflies now depend largely on rice fields, ponds, and creeks. Dragonflies feed on pest insects in rice, acting as a natural pest control. Dragonflies are steadily declining in Africa, and represent a conservation priority.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst {{predicted}} that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas; and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is {{not affected by}} dust absorption, and <b>so</b> <b>its</b> Doppler shift {{can be used to}} map the motion of the gas in our galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy. With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, tessellations can be {{extended}} to spaces other than the Euclidean plane. The Swiss geometer Ludwig Schläfli pioneered this by defining polyschemes, which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schläfli symbol notation {{to make it easy}} to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, <b>so</b> <b>its</b> Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.|$|E

Although Stamford Corporation {{attempted}} to sell it after closure, its ownership was disputed, and they were unable to do <b>so.</b> <b>Its</b> course and some of its structures can still be traced in the landscape. These include warehouses at the terminus in Stamford, and a weir which regulated water levels on the River Gwash, which it crossed on the level.|$|E
5|$|Smithfield is the City of London's {{only major}} {{wholesale}} market (Leadenhall Market nowadays attracting more tourist trade) which has escaped relocation out of central London to cheaper land, better transport links and more modern facilities (as have Covent Garden, Spitalfields and Billingsgate).

5|$|The N3 center {{consists}} of three nitrogen atoms surrounding a vacancy. Its concentration is always {{just a fraction of}} the A and B centers. The N3 center is paramagnetic, <b>so</b> <b>its</b> structure is well justified from the analysis of the EPR spectrum P2. This defect produces a characteristic absorption and luminescence line at 415nm and thus does not induce color on its own. However, the N3 center is always accompanied by the N2 center, having an absorption line at 478nm (and no luminescence). As a result, diamonds rich in N3/N2 centers are yellow in color.|$|E

5|$|The {{island was}} {{subsequently}} visited by many government and whaling ships sailing between New South Wales and Norfolk Island {{and across the}} Pacific, including many from the American whaling fleet, <b>so</b> <b>its</b> reputation as a provisioning port preceded settlement, some ships leaving goats and pigs on the island as food for future visitors. Between July and October 1791 the Third Fleet ships arrived at Sydney and within days the deckwork was being reconstructed for a future in the lucrative whaling industry. Whale oil was to become Australia's most profitable export until the 1830s, {{and it was the}} whaling industry that shaped Lord Howe Island's early history.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} not {{accepted}} by the Union Navy <b>so</b> <b>its</b> builder began seeking buyers elsewhere; Otto von Bismarck expressed some interest, {{and the thought of}} Prussia armed with such a vessel prompted France to purchase her and commission her in 1867 with the name Rochambeau. She was initially placed in reserve, but was mobilized in 1870 to participate in the Franco-Prussian War. The ship saw no action and was decommissioned {{after the end of the}} war. Rochambeau was stricken from the Navy List in 1872 and scrapped in 1874.|$|E
