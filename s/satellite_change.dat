40|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>change</b> {{detection}} methods are usually fixed-threshold, single-image oriented and {{very difficult to}} extend to different geographical areas or to different satellite sensors. Generally, when satellite data are used to give quantitative measurements, the difficulty to correctly estimate spectral atmospheric transmittance (requiring ancillary data not always, not everywhere available) can be responsible of highly biased estimates. On the other hand, {{it is possible to}} identify a number of satellite remote sensing applications (mainly devoted to environmental monitoring or, from a wider point of view, to change detection problems) for which the use of satellite data in se might be sufficient and effective. In this context, a different approach (RST, Robust Satellite Technique) to Earth surface and atmosphere monitoring, at the same time reliable and exportable (on different satellite sensors and geographic areas) has been proposed and it will be described in this paper together with its applications relevant for Sub Saharan region. In particular results so far achieved by using optical and microwaves passive sensors for monitoring forest fire and dust storms, for floods mapping, monitoring and early warning, for volcanic eruption monitoring and prediction, for earthquake precursors monitoring, oil spill detection and pipeline networks monitoring, will be presented...|$|E
40|$|This work proposes methodologies {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the damage {{occurred in the}} Amatrice town by using optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) change features obtained from satellite images. The objective is to achieve a damage map employing the <b>satellite</b> <b>change</b> features in a classifier algorithm, namely the Features Stepwise Thresholding (FST) method. The main novelties of the proposed analysis concern the estimation of derived features at object scale and the exploitation of the unsupervised FST algorithm. A segmentation {{of the study area}} into several buildings blocks has been done by considering a set of polygons, over the Amatrice town, extracted from the open source Open Street Map (OSM) geo-database. The available satellite dataset is composed of several optical and SAR images, collected before and after the seismic event. Regarding the optical data, we selected the Normalised Difference Index (NDI), and two quantities coming from the Information Theory, namely the Kullback-Libler Divergence (KLD) and the Mutual Information (MI). In addition, for the SAR data we picked out the Intensity Correlation Difference (ICD) and the KLD parameter. The exploitation of these features in the FST algorithm permits to obtain a plausible damage map that is able to indicate the most affected areas...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{unsupervised}} <b>satellite</b> <b>change</b> detection method, which is robust to illumination changes. To achieve this, firstly, a preprocessing strategy {{is used to}} remove illumination artifacts and results in less false detection than traditional threshold-based algorithms. Then, we use the corrected input data to define a new fitness function based on the difference image. The purpose of using Self-Adaptive Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (SAPSOGA) is to combine two meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to search and find the feasible solution in the NP-hard change detection problem rapidly and efficiently. The hybrid algorithm is employed by letting the GA and PSO run simultaneously and similarities of GA and PSO have been considered to implement the algorithm, i. e. the population. In the SAPSOGA employed, in each iteration/generation the two population based algorithms share different amount of information or individual(s) between themselves. Thus, each algorithm informs each other about their best optimum results (fitness values and solution representations) which are obtained in their own population. The fitness function is minimized by using binary based SAPSOGA approach to produce binary change detection masks in each iteration to obtain the optimal change detection mask between two multi temporal multi spectral landsat images. The proposed approach effectively optimizes the change detection problem and finds the final change detection mask...|$|E

40|$|Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks can augment {{terrestrial}} wireless {{networks to}} provide global broadband services to users {{regardless of the}} users' locations. Delivering QoS guarantees to the users of LEO satellite networks is complicated since footprints of LEO satellites move as the satellites traverse their orbits, and thus, causing frequent user handovers between the satellites. Traffic on inter-satellite links of a particular <b>satellite</b> <b>change</b> as the user traffic served by the satellite changes with the satellite's mobility. The change in user traffic on the inter-satellite links may cause violation of QoS requirements of on-going calls. We propose a novel routing algorithm called Predictive Routing Protocol (PRP), that exploits the predictive nature of the LEO satellite topology to maximize {{the total number of}} users served by the system, while maintaining each user's QoS requirements. PRP predicts the user traffic load on the inter-satellite links up to a short time in the future by using the deterministic knowledge of the LEO satellite topology, and user location information. PRP determines multiple paths for a particular connection that effectively help avoid possible future bottlenecks as predicted by estimated future traffic on the inter-satellite links. The algorithm is compared with other non-predictive routing protocols such as IP routing by extensive simulations and it is shown that PRP can deliver deterministic QoS guarantees (such as delay jitter), without over-reserving channel bandwidth. An admission control curve has also been obtained which may be used to ensure that the desired QoS metrics may be guaranteed...|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted to investigate the retrieval of meso-γ scale precipitable water vapor (PWV) distribution with the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) using output from a non-hydrostatic model (JMA NHM). The evaluation was performed on PWV values obtained by simulating three different methods: using all GPS satellites above an elevation angle higher than 10 ° (PWVG) (conventional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) meteorology method), using only the QZSS satellite at the highest elevation (PWVQ), and using only the GPS satellite at the highest elevation (PWVHG).  The three methods were compared by assuming the vertically integrated water vapor amounts of the model as true PWV. As a result, the root mean square errors of PWVG, PWVQ, and PWVHG were 2. 78, 0. 13, and 0. 59 mm, respectively, 5 min before the rainfall. The time series of PWVHG had a large discontinuity (˜ 2 mm) when the GPS satellite with the highest elevation changed, while that of PWVQ was small because the elevation at which the highest QZSS <b>satellites</b> <b>change</b> was much higher. The standard deviation of PWVQ was smaller than those of PWVG and PWVHG, which vary significantly depending on GPS satellite geometry.  When the spatial distributions of PWVG and PWVQ were compared to the meso-γ scale distribution of the reference PWV, PWVG smoothed out the PWV fluctuations, whereas PWVQ captured them well, due to the higher spatial resolution achievable using only high-elevation slant paths. These results suggest that meso-γ scale water vapor fluctuations associated with a thunderstorm can be retrieved using a dense GNSS receiver network and analyzing PWV from a single high-elevation GNSS satellite. In this study, we focus on QZSS, since this constellation would be especially promising in this context, and it would provide nearly continuous PWV observations as its highest <b>satellite</b> <b>changes,</b> contrary to using the highest satellites from multiple GNSS constellations...|$|R

Still, this increasing complexity does not prevent us from using X–ray clusters {{as a tool to}} constrain cosmological parameters. In addition, observations of clusters up to redshift∼ 1. 3, allowed us to trace the thermodynamical and chemical evolution of the ICM on a time interval as large as 8 Gyr.

40|$|Abstract – Continuous global {{time series}} of {{vegetation}} indices, {{which are available}} since early 1980 s, are of great value to detect changes in vegetation status at large spatial scales.

This Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) approach showed that large parts of the world are subjected to trend changes. The timing of the breakpoints could in some cases be related to <b>satellite</b> <b>changes,</b> but also to large-scale natural influences like the Mt. Pinatubo eruption.

40|$|In many recent low {{earth orbit}} (LEO) {{satellite}} networks, line-of-sight (LOS) wireless links, called intersatellite links (ISL's), are used to enhance the capability of the networks.

To estimate the number of blocked ongoing calls, which is needed to control the admission of new calls, the proposed scheme uses two techniques: traffic recasting and traffic projection.
