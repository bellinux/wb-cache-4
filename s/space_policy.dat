40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the stability of}} traffic flow on a highway when the vehicles operate under an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. ACC systems are commonly designed to maintain a constant time-gap between vehicles during vehicle following. Previous researchers in literature have produced contradictory results on whether the traffic flow is stable when the constant time gap <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> is used. This chapter resolves the contradiction and shows that the boundary conditions used at the inlets and exits influence traffic flow stability {{in the case of}} the constant time-gap policy. Further, the chapter shows that it is possible to design an unconditionally stable <b>spacing</b> <b>policy,</b> i. e. a <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> which guarantees traffic stability under all boundary conditions. The practical implications of instability are shown through traffic simulation results. The advantages of an unconditionally stable <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> over the constant time-gap policy are demonstrated. The answer to the question “Should ACC systems be designed to maintain a constant time gap between vehicles? ” is NO. It is quite easy to develop alternate <b>spacing</b> <b>policies</b> with superior stability properties. 1...|$|R

40|$|A novel delay-based <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> for {{the control}} of vehicle platoons is {{introduced}} together with a notion of disturbance string stability. The delay-based <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> specifies the desired inter-vehicular distance between vehicles and guarantees that all vehicles track the same spatially varying reference velocity profile, as is for example required for heavy-duty vehicles driving over hilly terrain. Disturbance string stability is a notion of string stability of vehicle platoons subject to external disturbances on all vehicles that guarantees that perturbations do not grow unbounded as they propagate through the platoon. Specifically, a control design approach in the spatial domain is presented that achieves tracking of the desired <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> and guarantees disturbance string stability {{with respect to a}} spatially varying reference velocity.

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} the trade-off between safety and traffic flow and {{deals with the}} design of new adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems that can improve traffic flow {{while at the same}} time ensuring safe operation on today’s highways. The new <b>spacing</b> <b>policy,</b> referred to as a variable time-gap (VTG) policy developed in chapter 3, is shown analytically to lead to better traffic flow and a higher highway capacity. Practical advantages of using the new <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> have been demonstrated through traffic simulations. However, a detailed analysis of safety shows that the traditional CTG policy is superior in several scenarios. The VTG policy is therefore modified by explicitly taking inter-vehicle relative velocity into account in the definition of desired spacing. The resulting new <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> is shown to retain the advantages of stable traffic flow and a higher capacity while providing the same level of safety as the CTG policy. 1. HIGHER CAPACITY AT THE COST OF SAFETY? The traffic flow advantages of the new VTG <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> from Chapter 3 have been clearly demonstrated. The VTG policy provides a higher traffic capacity and the ability to accommodate ramp inflows at high operating densities. However, the inter-vehicle spacin...|$|R

40|$|Objectives This paper {{describes}} {{patterns in}} the international published literature regarding smoke-free <b>spaces</b> <b>policy</b> through a bibliometric analysis of journals, articles and authors from 1990 to 2009. Methods Secondary data from a recent systematic literature review were analyzed. Bibliometric techniques included statistical analysis of publication counts and co-citation analysis. Findings were generated through calculations of frequencies of journals, authors, and articles published per year. Analysis was conducted for five policy-relevant domains: public place, schools, private space, workplace, and tobacco industry tactics. Results Of the 5656 total articles examined, scientific articles written for the public place and workplace domains far outweighed those for schools, private spaces, and tobacco industry. This bibliometric analysis indicated that publication patterns aligned with patterns of policy activity and increasing sophistication {{in the evolution of}} smoke-free <b>spaces</b> <b>policy</b> development. This finding held for analyses by article, journal, and author over all years. The analysis also revealed relatively high numbers of unique authors publishing on smoke-free <b>spaces</b> <b>policy</b> each year.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of {{different}} <b>spacing</b> <b>policies</b> for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems on traffic and environment. The largest deal of existing studies focus on assessing the performance in terms of safety, while only few deal with the effect of ACC on the traffic flow and the environment. In particular, very little is know on traffic stability and energy consumption. In this study, the vehicles equipped with ACC are modelled and controlled by two different <b>spacing</b> <b>policies.</b> Besides, Human Driving Behavior (HDB) is modelled by using Gipps model for comparison and for simulating different penetration rates. As distinguished from other studies, vehicle dynamics and energy consumption of an electric car is formulated, which has completely different characteristics and limitations than combustion engine cars. Hence the study aims at providing additional understanding of how ACC-equipped electric vehicles will behave in dense traffic conditions. HDB and ACC vehicles are placed in a roundabout at different penetration rates. String stability and energy consumption are investigated by giving a shock wave to a stable traffic condition. It is found that ACC with quadratic <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> has significantly positive effects on string stability and energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{green spaces}} {{play a key}} role in {{improving}} the liveability of our towns and cities. The quality and viability of cities depend largely on the design, management and maintenance of urban green as well as of open and public spaces in order to fulfil their role as an important social constellation and a visual focus. Actually, urban green spaces are seen as an important contribution to a sustainable development of cities. However, the potential of green spaces is not always realized, so that current management practices are sometimes sub-optimal. From a “policy perspective”, the results of several case studies have shown important needs and priorities for the development and management of urban green spaces. It is of strategic importance to compare and evaluate urban green <b>space</b> <b>policies</b> for highlighting the “best practices” for relevant policy recommendations and guidance for society and planning authorities to improve the quality of life in cities. The present study investigates urban green <b>spaces</b> from a <b>policy</b> evaluation perspective and analyses European cities in order to obtain strategic and policy relevant information on the key features of urban green. The study aims to compare and evaluate the current management practices in European cities on the basis of the performance of urban green <b>space</b> <b>policies.</b> The data and information used for comparison and evaluation are based on extensive survey questionnaires filled out by relevant departments or experts of municipalities in European cities that aim to share their experience in innovative green <b>space</b> <b>policies</b> and strategies.

40|$|The current paper shows string {{stability}} of {{a platoon of}} vehicles when the <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> within the platoon is dynamic, i. e., it has time-varying parameters. This problem setup is to address the safety issues that arise due to malfunction of some redundant sensing/communicating devices installed on the vehicles. In such a faulty situation, the controller is still functional due to the redundancy of the sensing/communicating devices as well as estimating resources which provide the controller with the required information. However, {{the accuracy of the}} controller will be reduced. This loss of accuracy should be compensated by doing a more conservative design of safety important parameters such as the safe inter-vehicle distance, which is selected based on the string stability requirement. The decision of a change in the inter-vehicle distance, or equivalently the <b>spacing</b> <b>policy,</b> is made by a so called 'safety checker' function which can be introduced into the loop of vehicle and controller. Here, it is shown that an adopted cooperative adaptive cruise controller renders the string of vehicles stable even if the <b>spacing</b> <b>policy</b> is time variant. The stability requirement of the closed-loop system is that the switching signal suggested by the safety checker unit being piecewise constant, i. e., the safe inter-vehicle distance policy does not change continuously. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
