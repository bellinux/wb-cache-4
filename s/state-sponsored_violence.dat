40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with <b>state-sponsored</b> electoral <b>violence</b> in liberalized autocracies. The first section of the paper identifies a number of variables that can help explain the decision calculus of authoritarian incumbents to deploy force against strong electoral challengers. The second section then examines these propositions with reference to Egypt and Morocco. Drawing on recent parliamentary elections in both countries the article questions why, despite facing the challenge of political Islam, the two regimes differed so markedly in their willingness to manipulate the polls by recourse to violence. Whilst the Egyptian authorities decided to abrogate all pretence of peaceful elections in favour of violent repression against the Muslim Brotherhood candidates and sympathizers, no such tactics were deployed by the ruling elite in Morocco. We suggest that three principal factors influenced the regimes 2 ̆ 7 response to this electoral challenge: (1) {{the centrality of the}} elected institution to authoritarian survival; (2) the availability of alternative electioneering tools; and (3) the anticipated response of the international community. The article concludes by suggesting that in order to understand better when and how states deploy violence in elections, {{we need to focus on}} a more complex set of factors rather than simply on the electoral potency of key opposition challengers or the authoritarian nature of the state...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the festival}} became a bigger tourist attraction, {{there was a}} {{backlash}} from purists that saw the ancient traditions being used for vulgar commercial purposes. There is a subgroup in Oaxaca that vocally pushes for a Populist Guelaguetza, or {{a return to the}} more spontaneous celebrations of the pre-Hispanic era before colonialism and the current system. Among other issues, the 2005 decision to conduct two performances a day for each of the two Mondays, was perceived by many traditionalists as a blatant, crass, and disrespectful attempt by powerful economic forces and political interests to accommodate more monied, ticket-purchasing, national and international tourists. Due to widespread protests against the Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PRI) - led state government and its leader by the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO); or in Spanish the Asamblea Popular del Pueblo de Oaxaca, which were met with state violence, the government-sponsored Guelaguetza was not held at the Fortín hill as planned in 2006, but instead a free, shared, [...] "Popular Guelaguetza" [...] held by the APPO organization. The following year, the 2007 official Guelguetza celebration was boycotted by the APPO, and attempts to hold a Popular Guelaguetza were thwarted by government police repression and <b>state-sponsored</b> military <b>violence</b> throughout the city[...] Due to some changes made in the makeup of the state government and the PRI's longstanding one-party monopoly on power in the state, subsequent Guelaguetza festivals have had a lesser degree of civil unrest although numerous controversial issues still remain.|$|R
40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union has encouraged democratisation in most parts of Africa. At the same time, Western donors' attitudes towards r~cipients of foreign aid have changed. This has resulted in a new practice, which attempts to force Third World states to move toward liberal democracy by conditioning lending on the holding of mUlti-party elections. In Africa this has resulted to the holding of multi-party elections. This study attempts to examine donor conditionalities and democratisation in Kenya by examining the results of 1992 and 1997 multi-party elections. Kenya attained independence from the British and ushered in a multi-party democracy in 1963. Since then, the country has undergone a full circle of political development, starting with a multi-party democracy at independence, through a one party dictatorship between 1982 and 1992 and back to a multi-party democracy in 1993. The need to satisfy foreign donors forced the leadership to amend Section 2 (A) of Kenya' s constitution that had legalised single-party rule in 1982 thus allowing plural politics. The externally pressured transition to multi-party democracy though has resulted in increased corruption, <b>state-sponsored</b> ethnic <b>violence,</b> continued political authoritarianism and disastrous economic mismanagement of what was once considered a model for the continent. This study urges that Western donors should focus less on elections and more on the fostering of democratic institutions through breaking patterns of neo-patrimonial rule that have inforn 1 ed and continue to inform politics in Kenya. Political reforms have been resisted by the incumbency in the fear tha! they may curtail the power of the political leadership whose main objective has been to cling to power. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} “evil” means {{different}} things depending upon context. For some, {{it is an}} archaic term, while others {{view it as a}} central problem of ethics, psychology, or politics. Coupled with state power, the problem of evil takes on a special salience for most observers. When governments do evil –in whatever way we define the term – the scale of harm increases, sometimes exponentially. The evils of state violence, then, demand our attention and concern. Yet the linkage of evil with state power does not resolve the underlying question of how to understand the concepts that we invoke when we use the term. Instead, the question becomes what evil means in the context of and in relation to state power. The fifteen essays in this book bring multiple perspectives to bear on the problems of <b>state-sponsored</b> evil and <b>violence,</b> and on the ways in which law enables or responds to them. The approaches and conclusions articulated by the various contributors sometimes complement and sometimes stand in tension with each other, but as a whole they contribute to our ongoing effort to understand the characteristics and workings of state power, and our need to grapple with the harm it causes.

40|$|This thesis explores {{internal}} {{dynamics of}} post-violence legitimacy {{in the context}} of transitional justice (TJ) from a standpoint of the local Serbian Bosniaks - those who were during the 1990 s exposed to direct <b>state-sponsored</b> or state-tolerated <b>violence.</b> As such, this thesis presents an empirical, exploratory and discovery-oriented work which sheds light not only on the social meanings and perceptions of legitimacy, violence, and justice from the perspective of those who were harmed, but also on how the victims with their experiences and knowledge situate themselves within the existing institutional transitional justice context(s) and ideological discourse(s), and how they relate to such situation. Specifically, this study revolves around the following questions: 1) Have the transitional justice mechanisms and processes contributed to the result that victims from Sandžak and their families recognize the new post-violence socio-political constellations as legitimate, and to feel again like full members of the polity?; 2) What have the victims asked for after period of violence?; 3) How victims' rules of recognition of post-violence socio-political constellations relate to those envisioned and promoted through and with TJ mechanisms? Through engagement with these questions, I have striven not only to expand transitional justice scholarship on Serbia (which have been lacking empirical people-oriented studies), and to shed the light on Sandžak area that has been traditionally neglected in the Balkan area studies, but also to further contribute to cumulative empirical evidence of critical transitional justice and peacebuilding scholarship which are focused on discovering conditions for sustainable peace. The overall conclusion is that transitional justice processes and mechanisms, in their current ideological and institutional form, design, and manifestation in Serbian context have been unable to properly address victims' needs and justice claims, in particular their socio-economic justice demands and need for recovery of life. The experience of transitional justice processes and mechanisms in Serbia, did not establish enough grounds for the victims to feel fully included in the polity in the way they had expected. The formal procedures which were introduced as a response to past injustice were neither effective nor efficient in delivering the kind of justice(s) the victims had expected to get. Paradoxically enough, the effects of transitional justice and ordinary democratization endeavors created a feeling of continuity of injustices and exclusions among the victims. This feeling of continuity of sufferings and exclusions provides a basis for deficit of legitimacy of the post- 2000 socio-political constellations and governance...|$|R
