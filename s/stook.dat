2500|$|However {{the work}} which has {{attracted}} {{the most attention}} and praise from critics in recent decades is {{what appears to be}} his [...] "only known landscape", View across Sandown Bay, Isle of Wight probably of 1855, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, who describe it as a [...] "minor masterpiece". [...] This small painting, which more closely approaches a Pre-Raphaelite landscape style, shows a half-harvested cornfield, with tools and jugs of the farm-workers piled up beside a corn <b>stook.</b> [...] But the only figures visible are two clearly middle-class women, no doubt part of the same party as the artist, one sitting against a <b>stook</b> reading a book, and the other walking with a parasol. [...] Any georgic or realist focus on agriculture is absent [...] "his cornfield is just part of a landscape where middle-class people take their leisure. [...] The corn is no more or no less useful than the beaches which we imagine to be in the distance of this brilliantly coloured painting". Here too a more subtle hint of religious feeling is found: [...] "the church in the distance hints at the source of the bounty represented by the partially garnered harvest in the foreground fields". [...] Treatments of the almost identical view by William Dyce and James Collinson (Mother and Child, Mellon Centre, Yale), both Burchett's colleagues at the school, are taken by Geoffrey Grigson to mean that the three artists were on a visit, or holiday, together. [...] Dyce, like Burchett, was an artist who saw himself as a history painter but is now most often remembered for a single Pre-Raphaelitish landscape, his Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858.|$|E
2500|$|The title origin is unknown. It {{was used}} as [...] "evidence" [...] {{throughout}} the history of historioraphy to prove ideological assumptions on Avars, and specific theories on the origin of early medieval Croats. The starting point of the debate was year 1837, and the work of historian and philologist Pavel Jozef Šafárik, whose thesis has influenced generations of scholars. In his work Slovanské starožitnosti (1837), and later Slawische alterthümer (1843) and Geschichte der südslawischen Literatur (1864), was the first to connect the ruler title of ban, obviously not of Slavic lexical <b>stook,</b> which ruled over župas of today Lika region, with the Eurasian Avars. He concluded how Avars lived in that same territory, basing his thesis on a literal reading of the statement from Constantine VII's 30th chapter, [...] "there are still descendants of the Avars in Croatia, and are recognized as Avars". However, modern scholars until now proved the opposite, that Avars never lived in Dalmatia proper, and that statement occurred somewhere in Pannonia.|$|E

60|$|I {{was born}} in September, and love it best of all the months. There is no heat, no hurry, no thirst and weariness in corn harvest {{as there is in}} the hay. If the season is late, as is usual with us, then mid-September sees the corn still {{standing}} in <b>stook.</b> The mornings come slowly. The earth is like a woman married and fading; she does not leap up with a laugh for the first fresh kiss of dawn, but slowly, quietly, unexpectantly lies watching the waking of each new day. The blue mist, like memory in the eyes of a neglected wife, never goes from the wooded hill, and only at noon creeps from the near hedges. There is no bird to put a song in the throat of morning; only the crow's voice speaks during the day. Perhaps there is the regular breathing hush of the scythe—even the fretful jar of the mowing machine. But next day, in the morning, all is still again. The lying corn is wet, and when you have bound it, and lift the heavy sheaf to make the <b>stook,</b> the tresses of oats wreathe round each other and droop mournfully.|$|E

"In strange {{contrast}} with this Dandiacal Body stands another British Sect, originally, as I understand, of Ireland, where its chief seat still is; but known {{also in the}} main Island, and indeed everywhere rapidly spreading. As this Sect has hitherto emitted no Canonical Books, it remains {{to me in the}} same state of obscurity as the Dandiacal, which has published Books that the unassisted human faculties are inadequate to read. The members appear to be designated by a considerable diversity of names, according to their various places of establishment: in England they are generally called the Drudge Sect; also, unphilosophically enough, the White Negroes; and, chiefly in scorn by those of other communions, the Ragged-Beggar Sect. In Scotland, again, I find them entitled Hallanshakers, or the <b>Stook</b> of Duds Sect; any individual communicant is named <b>Stook</b> of Duds (that is, Shock of Rags), in allusion, doubtless, to their professional Costume. While in Ireland, which, as mentioned, is their grand parent hive, they go by a perplexing multiplicity of designations, such as Bogtrotters, Redshanks, Ribbonmen, Cottiers, Peep-of-Day Boys, Babes of the Wood, Rockites, Poor-Slaves: which last, however, seems to be the primary and generic name; whereto, probably enough, the others are only subsidiary species, or slight varieties; or, at most, propagated offsets from the parent stem, whose minute subdivisions, and shades of difference, it were here loss of time to dwell on. Enough for us to understand, what seems indubitable, that the original Sect is that of the Poor-Slaves; whose doctrines, practices, and fundamental characteristics pervade and animate the whole Body, howsoever denominated or outwardly diversified.|$|E
