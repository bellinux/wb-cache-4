5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the shearing stress is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking <b>stress</b> <b>point</b> than those of birds.|$|E

However the dissymetry of the disentanglement process cannot be denied, and therefore double reptation has to be proven.

The results can be summarized in the same way: the stress relaxation function is proportional to the density of polymer segments limited by <b>stress</b> <b>points.</b> These points can be relaxed either by reptation or by “tube release”...|$|R

50|$|Authentic paint craquelure {{occurs because}} paint dries and becomes less {{flexible}} as it ages and shrinks. In {{the case of}} paintings on canvas, the canvas slackens as it ages as it cannot endure the long-term stress of stretching. Paint {{at the center of}} a painting is the least cracked, whereas paint at the edges is the most cracked, or stressed. The precise pattern of craquelure depends on where, when, and under what conditions the picture was painted, and subsequently kept. Cracks caused by stretching or slackening the canvas are quite different from cracks due to other factors, such as drying and ageing of the paint. The paint cracks when the stress upon it is greater than the breaking <b>stress</b> <b>point</b> of the paint layer and the paint will crack approximately at right-angles to the direction of the stress, relieving that stress. The stress at the corners is more than double that of the center.|$|E

50|$|The {{shape of}} an air-supported {{structure}} {{is limited by the}} need to have the whole envelope surface evenly pressurized.

50|$|One {{key element}} to infighting is the {{distance}} traveled by the attacking limb. Infighting {{is a way}} to attack to the opponent's center line while preventing a counterattack that can travel straight towards the attacker's center line. Even at a close distance, when the fighters' torsos are very close, the attacker might use their arms at full extension and focus the <b>stress</b> <b>point</b> or attack/defense portions of their limbs at their ends. Distance in infighting isn't what gives it its name, but instead, it's how to get past the opponent's guard and fight inside of it. An example would be to say that a fighter, even at a distance where his jab is touching his opponent's chin with the opponent not leaning backwards or forwards, at a neutral stance, is an infighter when his blows and blocks use the space between them and the opponent has to attack from an outward angle (use haymakers or hooks).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reformulation {{of the original}} Matsuoka–Nakai criterion for overcoming the limitations which make its use in a <b>stress</b> <b>point</b> algorithm problematic. In fact, its graphical representation in the prin- cipal stress space is not convex as it comprises more branches, plotting also in negative octants, {{and it does not}} increase monotonically as the distance of the <b>stress</b> <b>point</b> from the failure surface rises. The proposed mathematical reformulation plots as a single, convex surface, which entirely lies in the positive octant of the stress space and evaluates to a quantity which monotonically increases as the <b>stress</b> <b>point</b> moves away from the failure surface. It is an exact reproduction, and not an approximated one, of the only significant branch of the original criterion. It is also suitable for shaping in the deviatoric plane the yield and plastic potential surfaces of complex constitutive models. A very efficient numerical algorithm for the implicit integration of the proposed formulation is presented, which enables the evaluation of the stress {{at the end of each}} incre- ment by solving a single scalar equation, both for associated and non-associated plasticity. The algorithm can be easily adapted for other smooth surfaces with linear meridian section. Finally, a close expression of the consistent Jacobian matrix is given for achieving quadratic convergence in the external structural new- ton loop. It is shown that all this results in extremely fast solutions of boundary value problems...|$|E
