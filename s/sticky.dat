40|$|Abstract <b>Stickies</b> {{refer to}} tacky {{contaminants}} in recovered paper, excluding wood extractives. <b>Stickies</b> originate from adhesives, ink binders and coating binders. <b>Stickies</b> {{able to pass}} a sieve of 100 or 150 μm (depending on standard) are called micro <b>stickies,</b> whereas the particles retained on the screen are called macro <b>stickies.</b> Dissolved and colloidal <b>stickies</b> are called secondary <b>stickies.</b> There are standard methods for macro <b>stickies,</b> but a standard method measuring {{the total amount of}} <b>stickies</b> is lacking. Furthermore, the size distribution, and nature of <b>stickies</b> in the sense if they are free particles or agglomerated with some other substances, has not been previously known. The information on the removal of <b>stickies</b> in different unit operations was also not known very well except for macro <b>stickies.</b> The aim of this thesis was thus to develop an analysis method for the total amount of <b>stickies,</b> determine the size distribution and nature of <b>stickies,</b> and find ways to better remove <b>stickies</b> in the deinking process. Extraction with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with Size Exclusion Column (SEC) was used here to separate hydrophobic polymers (<b>stickies)</b> from the pulp suspension. An Evaporating solvent Light Scattering (ELS) detector was utilized to quantify the polymers after SEC. This analysis procedure was used in this thesis to measure <b>stickies.</b> Fractionation of pulp before the analysis was carried out if information of different-sized <b>stickies</b> was desired. The majority of <b>stickies</b> are micro <b>stickies.</b> A significant, although lower, portion of <b>stickies</b> are macrostickies, especially {{in the beginning of the}} deinking process. The dissolved and colloidal phase was found to contain wood extractives, and only trace amounts of <b>stickies.</b> Flotation is very effective in <b>stickies</b> removal. Ink and micro <b>stickies</b> were removed nearly equally in flotation, because they both are hydrophobic and are both in an optimal size range for removal in flotation. Ink measurements may be used for estimating the trends of <b>stickies</b> removal in flotation. The <b>stickies</b> removal in flotation may be enhanced by optimizing the pulper chemistry...|$|R
40|$|To ensure {{paper machine}} runnability, {{trouble-free}} converting, and high quality products, <b>stickies</b> {{must be removed}} during stock preparation of recycled pulp. However, the <b>stickies</b> removal efficiency along the process {{is not easy to}} assess since there are many different types of <b>stickies</b> that have to be considered in mill <b>stickies</b> audit. Total <b>stickies,</b> macro-stickies, micro-stickies, and secondary <b>stickies</b> are quantified by different methods. Macro-stickies allow us to monitor the removal efficiency of the process while micro-stickies and secondary <b>stickies</b> predict the deposition potential of the pulp under different conditions. Micro-stickies predict calcium-soap deposits and secondary <b>stickies</b> predict the destabilization of the dissolved and colloidal material. Cationic demand only predicts a certain type of <b>stickies.</b> Therefore, an integrated approach for the full characterization of <b>stickies</b> throughout the papermaking process is necessary...|$|R
50|$|<b>Stickies</b> {{that pass}} through a slotted plate screen of 0.10 - 0.15 mm are called micro <b>stickies.</b> Micro <b>stickies</b> can be finely {{dispersed}} (100 µm - 100 nm), colloidal (100 - 10 nm) or molecularly dissolved (< 10 nm). Macro <b>stickies</b> are those which are retained as screening residue. The reason for this classification is that macro <b>stickies</b> are easy to remove from the deinked pulp during the deinking process by means of filtration. Micro <b>stickies</b> are transported with the pulp to the paper machine and might agglomerate and cause problematic deposits there.|$|R

40|$|The study evaluates <b>stickies</b> removal {{efficiency}} of the different process stages in a deinking line of a newsprint paper mill, using 100 % recovered paper as raw material. Two different situations have been considered, namely, a normal one, with {{a low level of}} <b>stickies</b> {{at the beginning of the}} line, and a critical situation with a high level of <b>stickies.</b> Removal efficiencies have been compared with data available in the literature. Although results show a high {{efficiency of the}} process for contaminants removal in both cases (80 - 90 %), residual <b>stickies</b> levels at the end of the line are very different (a double initial <b>stickies</b> content causes four times higher <b>stickies</b> content at the end of the line).

40|$|Magnesium {{aluminum}} hydroxides (MAH) of nitrate and carbonate {{forms were}} prepared by co-precipitation, dried at different temperatures, and employed as an adsorbent for pitch and <b>stickies</b> in papermaking. Results indicated that MAH {{that had been}} heat-treated had higher adsorption capacity to model pitch and <b>stickies</b> at neutral pH. Low-temperature-dried magnesium aluminum hydroxides of nitrate form (MAH-NO 3) had higher adsorption capacity to model pitch and model <b>stickies</b> {{than those of the}} carbonate form (MAH-CO 3). Increasing the drying temperature of MAH reduced the difference of adsorption capacity between MAH-NO 3 and MAH-CO 3. Higher-temperature-dried magnesium aluminum hydroxides also showed higher adsorption capacity to model pitch and <b>stickies</b> when the drying temperature was lower than 550 oC. MAH displayed higher adsorption capacity while a lower initial adsorption rate of model <b>stickies</b> than of model pitch.

40|$|The <b>stickies</b> content, both macrostickies and <b>stickies</b> {{extractable}} in a solvent, {{was determined}} for samples taken at short time intervals from deinking lines producing deinked pulp for newsprint production. The study {{was carried out}} at three mills on different continents, with each having a different source of recycled paper as raw material. The short-term variations in extractable <b>stickies</b> in the incoming raw material were quite extreme, with differences of 100 % being seen within hours. Despite this, the final deinked pulp contained fewer sudden variations and with no correlation to the incoming <b>stickies</b> content. While the raw material appeared to affect the incoming <b>stickies</b> content, a well-optimised deinking line was able to buffer the raw material variability and the final <b>stickies</b> content was more dependent on the deinking process. This result was seen for the two mills examined for this phenomenon, despite a different raw material supply. Macrostickies were found to exhibit the same tendencies, although with smaller and less sudden variations. However, the variations of macrostickies and extractable <b>stickies</b> never correlated, even when both were measured for the same pulp fraction, thus confirming that solvent extraction is not an appropriate method for determination of macrostickies and is more a reflection of microstickies...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} year, {{having been}} appointed Bradman's vice-captain, McCabe {{had a successful}} Ashes series in 193637.

40|$|In recent years, {{the world}} has {{expressed}} an increasing interest in the recycling of waste paper to supplement the use of virgin fiber {{as a way to}} protect the environment. Statistics show that major countries are increasing their use of recycled paper. For example, in 1991 to 1996, the U. S. increased its recovered paper utilization rate from 31 % to 39 %, Germany went from 50 % to 60 %, the UK went from 60 % to 70 %, France increased from 46 % to 49 %, and China went from 32 % to 35 % [1]. As recycled fiber levels and water system closures both increase, recycled product quality will need to improve in order for recycled products to compete with products made from virgin fiber [2]. The use of recycled fiber has introduced an increasing level of metal, plastic, and adhesive contamination into the papermaking process which has added to the complexity of the already overwhelming task of providing a uniform and clean recycle furnish. The most harmful of these contaminates is a mixture of adhesives and polymeric substances that are commonly known as <b>stickies.</b> <b>Stickies,</b> which enter the mill with the pulp furnish, are not easily removed from the repulper and become more difficult the further down the system they get. This can be detrimental to the final product quality. <b>Stickies</b> are hydrophobic, tacky, polymeric materials that are introduced into the papermaking system from a mixture of recycled fiber sources. Properties of <b>stickies</b> are very similar to the fibers used in papermaking, viz. size, density, hydrophobicity, and electrokinetic charge. This reduces the probability of their removal by conventional separation processes, such as screening and cleaning, which are based on such properties. Also, their physical and chemical structure allows for them to extrude through screens, attach to fibers, process equipment, wires and felts. <b>Stickies</b> can break down and then reagglomerate and appear at seemingly any place in the mill. When subjected to a number of factors including changes in pH, temperature, concentration, charge, and shear forces, <b>stickies</b> can deposit [3]. These deposits can lead to decreased runnability, productivity and expensive downtime. If the stickie remains in the stock, then machine breaks can be common. Finally, if the stickie is not removed or deposited, it will either leave in the final product causing converting and printing problems or recirculate within the mill. It has been estimated that <b>stickies</b> cost the paper industry between $ 600 and $ 700 million a year due to the cost of control methods and lost production attributed to <b>stickies</b> [3]. Also, of the seven recycling mills opened in the United States between 1994 and 1997, four have closed citing <b>stickies</b> as the main reason responsible for the closure [4]. Adhesives are widely used throughout the paper and paperboard industry and are subsequently found in the recycled pulp furnish. Hodgson stated that even the best stock preparation process can only remove 99 % of the contaminants, of which the remaining 1 % is usually adhesives of various types which are usually 10 - 150 microns in effective diameter [5]. The large particles are removed by mechanical means such as cleaners and screens, and the smaller, colloidal particles can be removed with washing. The <b>stickies</b> that pass through the cleaning and screening processes cause 95 % of the problems associated with recycling [6]. The cleaners will remove most of the <b>stickies</b> that have a density varying from the pulp slurry ({approx} 1. 0 g/cm 3) and will accept <b>stickies</b> with densities ranging from 0. 95 - 1. 05 g/cm 3 [2]. The hydrophobicity of the material is also an important characteristic of the stickie [7]. The hydrophobicity causes the <b>stickies</b> to agglomerate with other hydrophobic materials such as other <b>stickies,</b> lignin, and even pitch. The tacky and viscous nature of <b>stickies</b> contributes to many product and process problems, negatively affecting the practicality of recycled fiber use. The source of <b>stickies</b> that evade conventional removal techniques are usually synthetic polymers, including acrylates, styrene butadiene rubber, vinyl acetates, and polypropylene [5, 6, 8 - 12]. Sources of these adhesives are usually broken down into categories based on application...|$|R
