30|$|It {{should be}} noted that free (non-silicate) iron can affect the {{specific}} <b>surface</b> of <b>clay.</b> For instance, the maximum difference in the specific <b>surface</b> for <b>clays</b> (98  m 2 /g) was observed in the Elcg horizon, which corresponds to the maximum difference of 5  % in free iron content.|$|R
50|$|Of their 37 matches, 19 {{have been}} on hard court, 15 {{have been on}} clay, and 3 have been on grass. Federer has a winning record on his best surface, grass (2-1), and on hard court (10-9) while Nadal leads on his best <b>surface,</b> <b>clay</b> (13-2). Nadal leads in Grand Slam tournament matches (9-3), with five of these wins coming on the clay courts of Roland Garros.|$|E
50|$|Clay courts {{slow down}} the ball and produce a high bounce in {{comparison}} to grass or hard courts. For this reason, the clay court takes away many {{of the advantages of}} big serves, which makes it hard for serve-based players to dominate on the <b>surface.</b> <b>Clay</b> courts are cheaper to construct than other types of tennis courts, but a clay surface costs more to maintain. Clay courts need to be rolled to preserve flatness. The clay's water content must be balanced; green clay courts generally require the courts to be sloped to allow water run-off.|$|E
50|$|The tournaments {{are played}} on a {{rectangular}} flat surface, {{commonly referred to as}} a tennis court. The dimension of a tennis court are defined and regulated by the ITF and the court is 23.78 m long, 10.97 m wide. Its width is 8.23 m for singles matches and 10.97 m for doubles matches. Tennis is {{played on a}} variety of surfaces and each surface has its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game. There are four main types of courts depending on the materials used for the court <b>surface,</b> <b>clay,</b> hard, grass and carpet courts with the ITF classifying five different pace settings ranging from slow to fast.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 {{the tournament}} {{moved from the}} West Side Tennis Club, Forest Hills, Queens to the larger USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, three miles to the north. In the process, the tournament {{switched}} the court <b>surface</b> from <b>clay,</b> used {{in the last three}} years at Forest Hills, to hard courts. Jimmy Connors is the only individual to have won US Open singles titles on all three <b>surfaces</b> (grass, <b>clay,</b> hardcourt), while Chris Evert is the only woman to win on two <b>surfaces</b> (<b>clay,</b> hardcourt). The US Open is the only Grand Slam tournament that has been played every year since its inception. During the 2006 US Open, the complex was renamed the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in honor of four-time tournament champion and women's tennis pioneer Billie Jean King.|$|R

5000|$|As {{much of the}} Mid Sussex {{area has}} clay not far under the <b>surface,</b> <b>clay</b> {{has in the past}} been a focus of {{industry}} in central Sussex, in particular in the Burgess Hill area. In {{the first quarter of the}} 20th century, Burgess Hill and the Hassocks and Hurstpierpoint areas had many kilns, clay pits and similar infrastructure to support the clay industry: nowadays the majority of this form of industry has left the area, although it still can be seen in place names such as [...] "Meeds Road", [...] "The Kiln", or Oakmeeds Community College, which is named after the oak trees in the area and Meeds Pottery, a once significant pottery in the centre of Burgess Hill. At the height of the success of this industry, tiles and bricks from Sussex were used to build landmarks such as Manchester's G-Mex. In 2007 the local district council produced plans to close the only remaining tile works in the area and use the site for residential development. Then in 2015 the last tile works moved to a new home in Surrey.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Spectral {{approach}} in satellite image analyses such as vegetation indices {{have been widely}} used in many applications, and it frequently gave good results. However, problems came up when spectral indices based on multispectral data were used for analysing rocks or soils in wet tropical regions due to the presence of vegetation cover. Therefore, spectral index-based analyses for rocks and soils were only effective in large, non-vegetated bare lands. In order to overcome such problem, study tried to integrate spectral and geostatistical approaches for mapping soil <b>surface</b> <b>clay</b> content in Gunung Kidul area, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. As an initial stage, a Landsat- 8 image was corrected radiometrically and geometrically, so that its pixel values were transformed to at-surface reflectance, while the geometric position of each pixel refers to Indonesian topographic (RBI) map. After that, two spectral indices for accentuating <b>surface</b> <b>clay</b> content, i. e. SRCI=Band 7 /Band 6 and NDCI=(Band 7 – Band 6) /(Band 7 + Band 6) were applied for generating two tentative clay content-related images. Since those images also represent areas other than open soils, two other processes were undertaken in order to isolate the open soils. The first process was applying normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), by which the areas representing vegetation cover and water were masked out. The second one was multispectral classification for generating built up features such as asphalt, concrete and housing rooftops, since those objects could not be separated from open soils using previously mentioned indices. The clay index images were then correlated with field samples containing information on laboratory-analysed cla...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{relation between}} soil emittance (E) at L-band and soil surface moisture content (M) is {{compared with a}} theoretical one. The latter depends on the soil dielectric constant, which {{is a function of}} both soil moisture content and of soil texture. It appears that a difference of 10 percent in the <b>surface</b> <b>clay</b> content causes a change in the estimate of M on the order of 0. 02 cu m/cu m. This is based on calculations with a model that simulates the flow of water and energy, in combination with a radiative transfer model. It is concluded that an experimental determination of the E-M relation for each soil type is not required, and that a rough estimate of the soil texture will lead to a sufficiently accurate estimate of soil moisture from a general, theoretical relationship obtained by numerical simulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Polymeric {{materials}} {{are used in}} detergent formulations since thirty five years, for performing useful functions like adsorption on fabric, <b>surface,</b> <b>clay</b> soil dispersancy and removal of Ca and Mg ions by sequestrization. In the present work, rosinated alkyds have been synthesized based Coconut oil, Rosin & Maleic anhydrides. The entire samples have been analyzed for physicochemical characteristics like acid value, HLB ratio, viscosity, oxirane-oxygen value and molecular weight. The spectroscopic studies indicate the presence of free acid, ester, ether and free hydroxyl groups in the polymer structure. Use of polymeric materials in detergent gives good foam height, cleansing capability and stain removing chacteristics such formulations can be easily prepared and compared with the commercial samples. An alter-native production line has been suggested for existing alkyd resins plants and some formulations which are technically excellent, environ-mentally viable option and yet cost effective has been identified for pilot plant production...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{explanation}} of the origin and formation on the minerals which are formed as a consequence on deterioration. Several small marble samples were collected for research by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). SEM is especially useful because it gives elemental, mineralogical and morphological data at the same time. Loss of face characters and presence of black crusts are evident. The results show that the black crusts consisting of gypsum, calcite and elements such as Si, Al, Fe, Pb, Ti, Zn and Mn, were being formed from interaction between the marble surface and atmospheric pollutants. Dissolution of calcite from the surface by rain water, CO 2 and SO 2 enables the Fe compounds to become enriched and oxidized on the <b>surface.</b> <b>Clay</b> minerals are occur in the finishing layers covering the surface on the monument and they originated from atmospheric dust naturally deposited...|$|E
40|$|A {{wildfire}} burned about 15, 000 ha of Monterrey Pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) plantations near Yungay, Chile, in January of 2007. Post-fire {{water repellency}} (hydrophobicity) {{was measured using}} the water-drop-penetration-time (WDPT) method at depths of 0, 5, and 10 mm from the soil surface. These measurements were collected on burned sites of both young (4 -years old) and old (11 -years old) plantations having both sand- and clay-rich soils. For purpose of comparison, water repellency was also measured {{one year after the}} wildfire on four unburned sites representing the same soil types and plantation ages as those occurring on the burned sites. The statistical analyses indicated that water repellency was present only on old stands, being located on the soil <b>surface</b> (<b>clay</b> soils) or as a layer 10 mm deeper or below (sandy soils). However, a water repellent layer was found on young stands growing on sandy soils, five millimeters below the surface, assumed to be formed when a wildfire burned the area before the new plantation was established...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} verify if an increase in environmental stress level would affect the interactions between two species of nurse shrubs and seedlings of Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco. This is a mesic species with a generalist distribution over an extensive environments gradient. The relationship between Larrea divaricata and seedlings of A. quebracho-blanco was studied in two contrasting soils, a silty loam soil with higher <b>surface</b> <b>clay</b> content and a sandy loam soil. The effect of seasonal variability of rainfall on the initial establishment of seedlings {{under the shade of}} L. divaricata was evaluated in three consecutive years. The effect of nurse plant shade was tested comparing two shrub species with different types of leaf life span (sclerophyllous-evergreen and leguminous-deciduous). The natural establishment of A. quebracho-blanco depended on shaded microsites, but not on the type of shade provided by different nurse shrubs. Emergence and initial establishment depended on interactions of soil type and seasonal rainfall variation with nurse plants. The importance of facilitation increased with clay soil (CS). Sandy soil was 'less humid' than CS under shrub shade. However, establishment success depends on opportune even rainfall distribution in interaction with nurse plant presence...|$|E

40|$|Polymer nanocomposites {{revolutionized}} {{the research in}} this field owing to the tremendous improvement in the composite properties at very low filler volume fraction. The surface modification of the filler, generally layered silicate montmorillonite clay, is required to compatibilize the organic and inorganic phases. The inorganic clay was modified conventionally with alkyl ammonium ions and the exfoliated nanocomposites with polar polymers could be formed where the clay could be dispersed at nanometer scale. During the initial phase of nanocomposite developments, only ammonium ions of fixed chain length were exchanged on the <b>clay</b> <b>surface.</b> However, this technology suffered when polyolefins and other non-polar polymers were used owing to the difficulties in dispersion of polar clay in the hydrophobic matrices. At best, only partially exfoliated composites could be formed by using these ammonium modified clays. To circumvent these limitations, two possible routes have been followed. By polarizing the polymer matrix (e. g. by addition of compatibilizers or surfactants), one can achieve compatibilization between the organic-inorganic phases. However, this technology leads to deterioration of nanocomposite properties even though better delamination is achieved. On the other hand, one can also focus on the more efficient modification of the filler surface so that the residual polarity after modification of the surface with conventional ammonium ions is also eliminated. A number of new <b>clay</b> <b>surface</b> modification techniques have been developed in the recent years which help in the generation of more exfoliated polymer nanocomposites. These techniques do not rely on the ion exchange of fixed chain length ammonium ions, but lead to generation/exchange of long and polydisperse polymer chains. These techniques include grafting of polymers to the <b>clay</b> <b>surface,</b> grafting of polymers from the <b>clay</b> <b>surface,</b> controlled living polymerization from the <b>clay</b> <b>surface,</b> in situ generation of polyolefins from the <b>clay</b> <b>surface</b> and <b>clay</b> <b>surface</b> reactions etc. and form very robust technologies for the complete organophilization of the <b>clay</b> <b>surface.</b> The generation of thick brushes around the <b>clay</b> <b>surface</b> owing to the better surface modification leads to better coverage of the electrostatic forces binding the clay platelets together and also leads to higher basal plane spacing between them. As a result, the modified platelets are more susceptible to exfoliation when compounded with the polymer matrices...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{sepiolite}} has {{low price}} and produced in large amount (Chao and Chen 2012). Generally, negative <b>surface</b> <b>clay</b> minerals showed little success to adsorb anionic pollutants especially acidic dyes (Jin et al. 2014). Several methods {{can be used}} to alter the properties of sepiolite surface (Gök et al. 2008; Özcan et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2012; Lazarević et al. 2007): modification by the use of surfactant through simple ion-exchange reaction to direct van der Waals interaction between adsorbate and organic surfactant cations is one of them. The surfactant-modified clay entitled “organoclay,” surfactant modification strongly enhanced the transformation of organophobic compound toward organophilic surface, and finally, the adsorption capacity increases (Li and Bowman 2001). In the previous study, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) was used to enhance adsorption capacity related to nitrate, chromate and arsenate (Li and Bowman 2001). Hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA-Br) bromide, a cationic surfactants with tetra-substituted ammonium with permanently charged quaternary nitrogen and a long straight alkyl (C 16) chain that make unique {{with a high degree of}} hydrophobicity, is a good candidate for sepiolite modification (Kaboorani and Riedl 2015). HDTMA has good points such as availability, low cost and possibility to be degraded by some microorganism in the environment (Kaboorani and Riedl 2015). Malakootian et al. conducted studies on the removal dyes from aqueous solutions (Malakootian et al. 2015; Malakootian 2016; Malakootian et al. 2013, 2016).|$|E
40|$|Mobilization of {{colloidal}} {{particulate matter}} (most important, clay particles) from a soil matrix in the subsurface environment {{is an important}} environmental process. As many contaminants tend to adsorb onto various colloidal mineral particles, co-transport of contaminants in association with mobilized particles could contribute significantly to the migration of these contaminants in the environment. Numerous studies have observed the effects of pH on colloid mobilization but have overlooked the possible direct role of acidity. This study looked at the role of acidity with H? as a chemical agent. Through cyclic elution of a natural sand column with a weak acid and base solution, {{there was an increase}} in mobilized clay colloids. It was found that low concentrations of organic acids could assist in detaching surface clays through lysing of labile Ca?? and Mg?? ions. The H? ions sever the chemical bonds between the grain surface and the colloidal surface by being substituted for the interstitial Ca and Mg ions. This substitution has been found to release over 1 kg of <b>surface</b> <b>clay</b> per 1 mole of H? consumed. It was postulated that pH oscillation addition to proton dynamics could {{play a major role in}} subsurface colloid transport. The results from this study could help improve predicting of subsurface contaminant fronts and aid in managing contaminant transport in the soil water environments...|$|E
