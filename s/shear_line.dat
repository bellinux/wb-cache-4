5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1946, the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the Eastern Pacific moved {{north of}} its typical position. An {{associated}} weather disturbance moved over Central America and interacted with a surface low-pressure area over Guatemala. Meanwhile, a broad high-pressure area moved over the United States behind an intense storm that moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Connected to the cyclone was a <b>shear</b> <b>line</b> stretching from Bermuda to the Caribbean Sea, which spawned an upper-level low over open waters. It moved westward on October 4, and {{by the next day}} it was located over the Southeastern United States. The feature over Guatemala began moving toward the northeast as the upper-level low approached and began deepening. Modern-day analysis estimates that the system became a tropical storm early on October 5, shortly after emerging into the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, {{and may be}} preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a <b>shear</b> <b>line,</b> though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and sea breeze boundaries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The mountainous Canary Islands present {{obstacles}} {{to the trade}} winds and to the Canary Current flowing equatorward past them. In situ observations of hydrographic properties and surface winds south of Gran Canaria, together with advanced very high resolution radiometer and synthetic aperture radar images during 2 weeks in summer 1995 are analyzed. A cyclonic eddy shed from {{the west of the}} island drifted southwestward at 5 cm s-•, while the southeast coast was approached by an upwelling filament originating off NW Africa. A wind lee region bounded by intense horizontal <b>shear</b> <b>lines</b> had a weak return islandward wind in its center. The lee formed a triangular, diurnally varying, warm water pool with two sea surface temperature maxima separated by lower temperatures below the return wind. Shallow temperature stratification occurred behind the island in contrast o the uniform surface mixed layer in exposed regions. Upwelling and downwelling of 10 - 20 rn d- • were indicated on the cyclonic and anticyclonic sides of the lee region. In the SAR images, lines of strong current shear along a temperature front between the cyclonic eddy and the upwelling filament were identifiable. However, the radar images were dominated by atmospheric phenomena, including mountain •ee wave packets, windrows, and wind <b>shear</b> <b>lines.</b> Estimation of the wind field from the SAR backscatter intensity revealed complex structure and intensification on the edges of the warm lee. 1...|$|R

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other.

A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into <b>shear</b> <b>lines,</b> but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other.
