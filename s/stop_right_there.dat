Sadly, it was at this time that Egbert was struck down with cancer and {{replaced}} by his sidekick, Byers Burlingame."Burlingame and I got on very well so I asked him to send me a Daytona chassis- the best chassis around at the time, and one which boasted special suspension. Its front axle was overloaded in the original design but I figured that if I could find a way of moving the engine backwards to a certain extent then the assembly would become better balanced. So Burlingame sent me a Daytona chassis at Milwaukee and I got to work on my designs, taking a great deal of inspiration from the Mercedes SSK. I loved Mercedes cars and personally owned a 1928 SS Phaeton. My idea was to create a vehicle along similar lines, using contemporary running gear and selling for a very competitive price. I said to Burlingame: 'I'm going to build you a contemporary classic', to which he replied: 'Great...but what exactly is a contemporary classic?' I replied: 'Well, it's a new old car'...and the conversation <b>stopped</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> Burlingame hanging up the receiver in obvious dismay! It had been a brief discussion, but as a result the Excalibur was born!" ...|$|R
50|$|As {{a legend}} goes, Adi Shankara, the much revered spiritual leader from Kerala, once offered intense worship to Saraswati, {{the goddess of}} wisdom and learning. The goddess {{appeared}} before Shankara {{in response to his}} prayers. Shankara told her of his wish to have her come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her as yet. Goddess Saraswati agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way for her to follow, without doubting her and not looking back even once to check if she was with him. Should he break the condition, she would <b>stop</b> and stay <b>right</b> where she was at the time. Shankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess’ anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess <b>stopped</b> <b>right</b> <b>there.</b> Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Impressed by his determination, the goddess finally agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid-day.|$|R

Well, he saw Sadie, who was my mother's oldest sister, and I guess she looked good to him, for he <b>stopped</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> in Salt Lake and didn't go a step. He was a great Indian fighter, too, and I heard my Aunt Villa say, when I was a little girl, that he had the blackest, brightest eyes, and that the way he looked was like an eagle.

6000|$|The {{next day}} was a Sunday, {{when there was no}} {{business}} to be looked for. Uma asked me in the morning if I was going to [...] "pray"; I told her she bet not, and she stopped home herself with no more words. I thought this seemed unlike a native, and a native woman, and a woman that had new clothes to show off; however, it suited me to the ground, and I made the less of it. The queer thing was that I came next door to going to church after all, a thing I'm little likely to forget. I had turned out for a stroll, and heard the hymn tune up. You know how it is. If you hear folk singing, it seems to draw you: and pretty soon I found myself alongside the church. It was a little, long, low place, coral built, rounded off at both ends like a whale-boat, a big native roof on the top of it, windows without sashes and doorways without doors. I stuck my head into one of the windows, and the sight was so new to me--for things went quite different in the islands I was acquainted with--that I stayed and looked on. The congregation sat on the floor on mats, the women on one side, the men on the other, all rigged out to kill--the women with dresses and trade hats, the men in white jackets and shirts. The hymn was over; the pastor, a big buck Kanaka, was in the pulpit, preaching for his life; and by the way he wagged his hand, and worked his voice, and made his points, and seemed to argue with the folk, I made out he was a gun at the business. Well, he looked up suddenly and caught my eye, and I give you my word he staggered in the pulpit; his eyes bulged out of his head, his hand rose and pointed at me like as if against his will, and the sermon <b>stopped</b> <b>right</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} staff {{began work}} on the game's story, which Miyamoto intended to be an extra story based around Twilight Princess. However, the staff had been coming up with {{what could be better}} described as [...] "epic tales" [...] rather than [...] "side stories". When Miyamoto revealed that he would not make the game with an [...] "epic tale", much of the staff was shocked, saying it was like killing all of the ideas they had been working with until then. Some argued that they should not even do it, as it would be simply reusing existing software and selling it to the consumers. Miyamoto proposed that they make a working prototype and have test players give impressions of the game. If they did not like it, Miyamoto would <b>stop</b> development <b>right</b> <b>there.</b> Nintendo of America gathered together several die-hard The Legend of Zelda fans, who all reacted positively to the game. Reports from these test players were given to the development team daily, allowing them to tweak the game as they went along.|$|R

50|$|Another legend {{associated}} {{to the temple}} {{was that of the}} spiritual leader Shankaracharya(Adi Shankara). During the time where he lived, Adi Shankara realised that there wasn't a single temple in Kerala that signified the worship of goddess Saraswati. As a result, he himself went to the Chamundi hills in Karnataka and meditated for many days for the goddess to appear before him. His meditation bore fruit and before him stood the stunningly beautiful goddess, clad in white. On enquiry, he said {{that he would like to}} bring the goddess to Kerala and establish a temple dedicated to her worship. This way the people from Kerala would not have to go such far off distances to worship her, as in the case for those who were old and aged. After a lot of persuasion, the goddess agreed; she would follow him by foot wherever he went, but only on one condition. If he trusts her, then he was not allowed to look back to see if she followed him or not. If he did, then wouldn't go any further. He agrees and they proceed walking. They were walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess' anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess <b>stopped</b> <b>right</b> <b>there.</b> Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. After many pleas, the goddess agrees to a compromise. From early hours of morning, she would come and appear before the devotees at the Chottanikkara temple. Then in the afternoon, she would return to the spot where she stopped. This is the spot which would turn out to be the Mookambika temple. Since then, before the doors of the main sanctum in Mookambika temple were opened, the sanctum doors of the Chottanikkara temple were opened during early morning hours in honour of worshipping goddess Saraswati, where the idol is clad in white garments.|$|R

50|$|Fewer {{and fewer}} people believe nowadays. It's {{possible}} {{that in a}} generation, there simply won’t be religion across Europe and large sections of North America, Australia, and Asia. That's not necessarily a problem. However, it is worth thinking about why people made up religion in the first place, and what we’re doing with the needs and longings that led them to do so. At one level, religions are about asking us to believe in something. When people say, they can’t believe, they tend to <b>stop</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> with the whole religion business. They often then point out all the horrid things that religions have undoubtly done and continue to do. In this sense, belief is almost the least important and defiantly the least interesting side of religion. What's fascinating is all the other stuff religions get up to. For example, the way they regularly gather people around, {{and tell them to}} be nice to one another. Also, the way they create a sense of community, teaching others to see everyone else as human beings (Gruber, 2008). Religions use rituals to point stuff out to us and lodge it in our fickle minds. For example, that the seasons are changing or that it's the time to remember our ancestors. Religions know were not just intellectual creatures, so they carefully appeal to us via art and beauty. We think of beauty in one category, a frivolous and superficial thing, and truth and depth in another. Religions join them together. They build temples, cathedrals, and mosques that use beauty to lend depth to important ideas. They use the resources of art to remind us of what matters. Its directed at making us feel things, calm, pity, awe.|$|E

He had {{followed}} that little stream more than once, and now he found it just as he remembered it.

5000|$|Gayle was {{homeless}} {{for approximately}} twenty years, playing saxophone {{on street corners}} and subway platforms around New York City.

I can't do the rent, the odd jobs, the little rooms, scratchin', and all that, no!" [...] At the same time, this allowed Gayle to devote most of his time to playing music, although he often earned less than US$3 a day from busking:First of all, I played to play because I need to play. Second of all, the money, a dollar {{meant a lot to me}} at that time. Playing out there is obviously different than playing on a stage but that is so rich out there. It's such a whole 'nother world of playin'. I mean I used to walk from Times Square, for instance, all the way to Wall Street playin'. I could walk back and never stop playing. I didn't think about it as anything other than what it was. These were people and I wasn't overly concerned with what they thought. I was playing, I had to play. Also I had to eat some way and I'm not the type to put my hand out. I'd stand there playing with a coffee cup sometime and people would put money in my coffee Laughs and you don't get that on the stage. That's beautiful.When Gayle first set out on the streets, he did not imagine he would remain homeless as long as he did, although he estimates that this period lasted closer to fifteen years than twenty.|$|E
