50|$|The AW4 is {{also used}} behind the 2.5 L (150 CID) AMC Straight-4 engine. It has a {{removable}} bell housing with a mount for the crankshaft position sensor. Early AW4s used 21-spline output shafts. In 1991 the AW4 was changed to a 23-spline output shaft, concurrent with adoption of the High Output (commonly known as H.O.) inline six-cylinder engine. Some sources state that the output <b>shaft</b> <b>spline</b> change occurred for the 1990 model year. The change most likely occurred during the 1990 model run with early 1990 models receiving 21-spline transmission and later models receiving 23-spline. If swapping transmissions in 1990 model year vehicles either swap the transfer case as well or make sure to check spline count. The input on the transfer case can also be changed to match the output <b>shaft</b> <b>spline</b> count.

Here, a newly developed on-machine non-contact measurement prototype based on laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder is proposed.

For the spline with position requirements, that is: one of the spline tooth is located at an angle of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> cross section, cold rolling processing can't guarantee the spline tooth position. The paper analyzes the defects existed in the rolling and processing of this kind of spline. Through transforming a hydraulic press and design special frock clamp to ensure the spline tooth position angle, the small modulus involute spline processing with position requirements is realized in the way of punch press processing...|$|R

The static analysis results regarding the effects, due to the backlash, on the axes geometry of the broached and <b>spline</b> <b>shafts,</b> which make the intermediate shaft, are at first illustrated. An angular speed range that guarantees a pressure distribution without critical areas, between the broached <b>shaft</b> and the <b>spline</b> one, is afterwards specified. A model for dynamic analysis of the flexural vibrations that is capable of estimating the deflection and bending moment diagram, is furthermore developed. The way in which this model can forecast the limits of the above-mentioned speed range is finally described...|$|R
30|$|The {{dimensional}} {{change of the}} tooth root is about 20  μm after rolling. Thus, the measurement precision of the conventional mechanical measuring instrument is not enough and it is time-consuming due {{to the complexity of}} the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft.</b> In order to solve such problems, it is necessary to develop a new measuring system with high efficiency and high precision. The laser triangulation displacement sensor (LDS) is a common-used tool in high precision and short-distance measuring, which can measure the displacement change of an object without any contact. It is mainly used in automatically measuring the geometrical parameter such as thickness, distance, diameter, etc [7 – 10]. Over a period of time there were several novel measuring systems by combining it with other devices, such as identification of location error of rotary axes for five-axes machine tools [11], on machine measurement of RFQS [12], automated inner dimensional measurement system for long-stepped pipes [13] and piston secondary motion measurement [14]. For <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> measuring system, a rotary encoder is needed to record the rotation angle. Together with the radius recorded by the laser displacement sensor, the section contour of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> is obtained by plotting each point of the measuring section in a polar coordinate system.|$|R

Since the external dimensions {{are similar to the}} TH-350 (overall length, drive <b>shaft</b> yoke <b>spline</b> count/diameter and general size), 200-4Rs are often swapped in place of TH-350s in older vehicles to provide an overdrive gear.

The coupling includes an input member having a <b>splined</b> <b>shaft,</b> a coupling member connected to the <b>splined</b> <b>shaft,</b> and a coaxial output member. The coupling member and the output member having complementary sets of axially facing clutch teeth. Guides {{in the form of}} helical grooves on the coupling member and spring loaded followers acting with the guides affect the engagement and disengagement of the clutch teeth by moving the coupling member toward and away from output member, the followers and guides themselves disengaging to permit free wheeling of output member when input member is stopped...|$|R
30|$|<b>Spline</b> <b>shaft</b> is an {{important}} part of a machine to transmit power or bear torque. Its section contour is like a gear. It suffers from great loads and alternating stress during the runtime. The tooth root of the <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> has a risk of fracture due to fatigue stress [1 – 4]. Thus, it is essential to conduct a surface hardening process such as rolling after machining. In order to control the quality of product, a rolling performance evaluation becomes essential. The commonly used evaluation parameters of surface integrity involve the surface roughness, the surface residual stress and the micro-hardness. However, measurement of surface roughness or through-thickness residual stresses in difficult locations or complex geometries is not easy. Many measurement techniques are destructive, such as the centre-hole drilling method, the ring core method and the block removal method. There are non-destructive techniques (e.g., X-ray and neutron diffraction, optical, magnetic or ultrasonic methods) [5], but they often require the off-machine measuring. Note that for the rolling process, it is an efficient alternative to conventional cutting processes to manufacture <b>spline</b> <b>shaft</b> as it possesses several advantages i.e. shorter process times, no material loss and no chip disposal, high surface quality [6]. The residual stress is only induced by the residual strain and the residual strain appears as the dimensional change in the macroscopic view. Therefore, it is probably feasible to use the dimensional change of tooth root as an alternative evaluation parameter.|$|R

40|$|In many {{rotating}} machinery applications, such as helicopters, the splines of an externally-splined steel shaft {{that emerges from}} the gearbox engage with the reverse geometry of an internally <b>splined</b> driven <b>shaft</b> for the delivery of power. The splined section of the shaft is a critical and non-redundant element which is prone to cracking due to complex loading conditions. Thus, early detection of flaws is required to prevent catastrophic failures. The acoustic emission (AE) method is a direct way of detecting such active flaws, but its application to detect flaws in a <b>splined</b> <b>shaft</b> in a gearbox is difficult due to the interference of background noise and uncertainty {{about the effects of}} the wave propagation path on the received AE signature. Here, to model how AE may detect fault propagation in a hollow cylindrical <b>splined</b> <b>shaft,</b> the <b>splined</b> section is essentially unrolled into a metal plate of the same thickness as the cylinder wall. Spline ridges are cut into this plate, a through-notch is cut perpendicular to the spline to model fatigue crack initiation, and tensile cyclic loading is applied parallel to the spline to propagate the crack. In this paper, the new piezoelectric sensor array is introduced with the purpose of placing them within the gearbox to minimize the wave propagation path. The fatigue crack growth of a notched and flattened gearbox spline component is monitored using a new piezoelectric sensor array and conventional sensors in a laboratory environment with the purpose of developing source models and testing the new sensor performance. The AE data is continuously collected together with strain gauges strategically positioned on the structure. A significant amount of continuous emission due to the plastic deformation accompanied with the crack growth is observed. The frequency spectra of continuous emissions and burst emissions are compared to understand the differences of plastic deformation and sudden crack jump. The correlation of the cumulative AE events at the notch tip and the strain data is used to predict crack growth. The performance of the new sensor array is compared with the conventional AE sensors in terms of signal to noise ratio and the ability to detect fatigue cracking...|$|R
