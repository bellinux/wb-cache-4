As the transmit signal is not strictly bandlimited, we have considered power containment bandwidth criteria with 90 % and alternatively 95 % power containment. The transmit sequences are constructed based on various QAM and PSK input symbol alphabets and various <b>signaling</b> <b>rates.</b> Concrete sequence designs, namely reconstructible 4 -ASK (and with this 16 -QAM) sequences and runlength-limited sequences for faster-than-Nyquist <b>signaling</b> <b>rates,</b> are proposed.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{explores the}} design of time-limited {{input-output}} waveforms, the outputs being orthogonal, for band-limited channels, whose characteristics are known a-priori. Hence, the channel can support baseband multiplexed transmission without Intersymbol Interference. The problem has been worked out for two cases of channel modeling- the rational transfer function channel model and the distributed parameter channel model, using three methods of signal orthogonalization. For the rational function channel model, the signaling interval can be made arbitrarily small, thus permitting high <b>signaling</b> <b>rates.</b> For the distributed parameter channel model, the signaling rate works {{out to be a}} function of the line parameters and line length. At the receiving end, since the signals are orthogonal, a bank of matched filters separates the signals. The system performance has been evaluated in the presence of channel noise...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing with on-off keying (OFDM-OOK) offers {{a means to}} near BPSK <b>signaling</b> <b>rates</b> with the simplicity of non-coherent processing. At high frequencies source receiver acceleration induces time varying signal dilations that adversely effect both frequency alignment and multicarrier orthogonality. Dilation process estimation is coupled with a decision directed frequency domain channel magnitude response estimator for non-coherent equalization of OFDM-OOK. Joint co-channel estimation is presented for near optimal decisions under loss of orthogonality due to Doppler spreading. Data from a moving source experiment at ranges from. 8 km to 2. 0 km, conducted in the shallow water {{off the coast of}} Elba Italy were used to test the feasibility of OFDM-OOK at 18 kHz center frequency with 4 kHz bandwidth. The effects of source receiver relative motion, frequency selectivity, and Doppler spreading on bit error rates were assessed.

To assess {{the utility of}} various PMD mitigation schemes, temporal and spectral measurements of differential group delay (DGD) were made on 95 km of buried standard single-mode fiber over an 86 -d period to determine the distribution and rate of change of high-DGD events. As expected, statistical analysis of variations in DGD indicate that excursions from the mean DGD by factors of 3. 7 or higher have very low probability. For this link, the DGD varied slowly with time (having a drift time of about 3. 4 d) and rapidly with wavelength. The DGD data agree well with results of similar experiments reported in the literature. Statistical analysis of the measured DGD data shows that high-DGD episodes will be exceedingly rare and short-lived. The impact of PMD on network operations is explored and approaches to ensure network reliability are reviewed for network operators given the task of transporting high-bit-rate channels over fiber links with known PMD characteristics...|$|E
