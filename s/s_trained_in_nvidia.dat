40|$|This {{experiment}} reexamined displacement {{as originally}} formulated by Murray and Berkun. Similarity {{to the goal}} and spatial placement of the alleys were manipulated with an additional variable of brightness (black) and texture (hardware cloth floor) preference in rats. It was found that 5 s traveled least down the white smooth-floor alleys, midway down the gray screen-floor alleys, and farthest down the black hardware cloth-floor alleys. This occurred regardless of the spatial arrangement of the alleys or {{the color of the}} alley in which 5 s received the initial approach-avoidance <b>training.</b> Furthermore, 5 <b>s</b> <b>trained</b> <b>in</b> the nonpreferred (white) alleys took a greater number of trials to recover from approach-avoidance conflict than <b>Ss</b> <b>trained</b> <b>in</b> the preferred (black) alleys. The importance of a preference variable in studies of conflict behavior is stressed. A three-dimensional model predicting recovery from approach-avoidance (AP-AV) conflict was formulated and tested by Murray and Berkun (19 SS). Rats were given an AP-AV conflict in one alley and then allowed to enter adjoining alleys which differed in similarity (color and width) from the original alley. They found that the rats ran least down the original alley, part way down the most similar alley, and farthest down the least similar alley. These results confirmed the predictions of the model which combined Miller's (1944) AP-AV gradients of nearness to a goal and similarity to a goal. However, more recent studies have pointed out that the similarity variable was confounded with a spatial variable in the Murray and Berkun study (Elder, 1962; Elder, Noblin, & Maher, 1961). That is, the least similar alley was also the alley farthest from the original alley. When similarity and spatial arrangement were manipulated parametrically, it appeared that the spatial variable, rather than the similarity variable, determined displacement. A more complete description of this issue can be found in Maher (1966, pp. 154 - 156). A variable which has not been directly examined in much of the AP-AV literature is the a priori preference of the animals used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii are {{important}} nosocomial pathogens with wide intrinsic resistance. However, {{due to the}} dissemination of the acquired resistance mechanisms, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and metallo beta-lactamase (MBL) production, multidrug resistant strains have been isolated more often. Case presentation We report {{a case of a}} Hungarian tourist, who was initially hospitalized in Egypt and later transferred to Hungary. On the day of admission PER- 1 -producing P. aeruginosa, PER- 1 producing A. baumannii, SHV- 5 -producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and VIM- 2 -producing P. aeruginosa isolates were subcultured from the patient's samples in Hungary. Comparing the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of the P. aeruginosa strains from the patient to the P. aeruginosa strains occurring in this hospital, we can state that the PER- 1 -producing P. aeruginosa and VIM- 2 -producing P. aeruginosa had external origin. Conclusion This is the first report of PER- 1 -producing P. aeruginosa,and PER- 1 -producing A. baumanii <b>s</b> <b>trains</b> <b>in</b> Hungary. This case highlights the importance of spreading of the beta-lactamase-mediated resistance mechanisms between countries and continents, showing the importance of careful screening and the isolation of patients arriving from a different country. </p...|$|R

Hillenius described himself as a new variant of the human species who was equipped with 'a biological eye for almost everything'. 'Almost everything', however, included not only human (social and intimate) behavior, but also art and culture.

Although MT is simple in concept, it has demonstrated very impressive fault-finding ability, and has recently been attracting a great deal of interest. Training students and practitioners to effectively apply MT has become an important goal, but to date, no textbook or guidelines have been made readily available. This paper, written by some of the leading voices in the MT community, is a sharing of some of the experiences, reflections and insights gained through teaching MT (and other related subjects). These experiences indicate that not only is MT effective in industry and at fault-finding, it has the potential to really engage students in creative SE classroom activities...|$|R

40|$|Acquisitions, {{the process}} by which {{libraries}} order, claim, and receive material, was once {{an essential part of the}} library school curriculum. Since the 1930 <b>s,</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> this area has diminished significantly and over the past several years there appears to be a preponderance of opinion among acquisitions librarians that more formalized library school training is needed. A survey of acquisitions librarians employed in ARL-member libraries was used to determine where contemporary training for acquisitions does occur and where it should occur. In addition, the survey identified those acquisitions librarians most recognized in their field and compared and contrasted their formal and informal acquisitions training with ARL acquisitions librarians. The significant findings were: (1) ARL acquisitions librarians receive more than 75 % of their acquisitions training outside the library science classroom. Despite this, only about 26 % of the respondents believe that the majority of their acquisitions training should come from library school. (2) ARL acquisitions librarians believe that most of their education for acquisitions should come from on-the-job training, followed by library school training, workshops and conferences, vendor interaction, and other sources, including professional readings. (3) Acquisitions librarians identified as being most recognized and effective in their work differ little from ARL acquisitions librarians in their perceptions about acquisitions education and received comparatively less formal <b>training</b> <b>in</b> acquisitions. Members of this population were more active in continuing education than their ARL counterparts. The findings demonstrate that the library school curriculum should contain more about acquisitions, with particular reference to specific areas, but that the primary training for acquisitions work should continue to occur in the workplace...|$|R

40|$|There are {{reciprocal}} {{connections between}} visual and motor {{areas of the}} cerebral cortex. Although recent studies have provided intriguing new insights, in comparison with volume {{of research on the}} visual control of movement, relatively little is known about how movement influences vision. The motor system is perfectly suited to learn about environmental forces. Does environmental force information, learned by the motor system, influence visual processing? Here, we show that learning to compensate for a force applied to the hand influenced how participants predicted target motion for interception. <b>Ss</b> <b>trained</b> <b>in</b> one of three constant force fields by making reaching movements while holding a robotic manipulandum. The robot applied forces in a null [null force field (NFF) ], leftward [leftward force field (LFF) ], or [rightward force field (RFF) ] direction. Training was followed immediately with an interception task. The target accelerated from left to right and Ss’s task was to stab it. When viewing time was optimal for prediction, the RFF group initiated their responses earlier and hit more targets, and the LFF group initiated their responses later and hit fewer targets, than the NFF group. In follow-up experiments, we show that motor learning is necessary, and we {{rule out the possibility that}} explicit force direction information drives how Ss altered their predictions of visual motion.

TRIM (100 - 1000 mu M) reduced the tension of rat anococcygeus muscles when contracted with guanethidine (10 mu M) and clonidine (0. 1 mu M). Relaxations to TRIM persisted {{in the presence of}} the non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME (100 mu M) and the inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase ODQ (1 mu M). TRIM also reduced tension when muscles were contracted with phenylephrine (3 mu M), noradrenaline (3 mu M) or high K physiological salt solution (high KPSS; 60 mM). Influx of calcium ([Ca 2 +](i)) in response to high KPSS was significantly reduced in the presence of TRIM (1 mM). TRIM also inhibited the influx of Ca- 45 (2 +) induced by KPSS, but had no effect on the influx induced by phenylephrine (10 mu M). TRIM (300 mu M) had a modest, but significant, inhibitory effect on nitrergic relaxations that were evoked by electrical field stimulation (1 - 10 Hz, 15 V, 10 <b>s</b> <b>trains)</b> <b>in</b> muscles contracted with guanethidine and clonidine. In contrast, L-NAME (1 - 100 mu M) inhibited these nitrergic responses with an IC 50 of 9. 31 +/- 0. 87 mu M (n= 4). The results suggest that the smooth muscle relaxant effect of TRIM in the rat anococcygeus muscle may affect the entry of Ca 2 + possibly through voltage-operated calcium channels. Furthermore, the relatively modest effect of TRIM on nitrergic responses indicates that it is not a particularly reliable inhibitor of nNOS...|$|R
