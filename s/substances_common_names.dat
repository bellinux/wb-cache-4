5000|$|The <b>common</b> <b>name</b> [...] "Carolina lily" [...] {{reflects}} an older taxonomy that used the name Lilium carolinianum for both L. michauxii and L. catesbaei.

Despite its <b>common</b> <b>names,</b> {{it is not a}} member of the {{subfamily}} Viperinae. This nonvenomous, semiaquatic, fish-eating snake was given its <b>common</b> <b>names</b> due to behavioural and aesthetic similarities with sympatric adder species.|$|R
5000|$|However these <b>common</b> <b>names</b> {{appear to}} be in use {{exclusively}} in Western Australia, as the two species of Adenanthos that occur outside Western Australia are both woollybushes, yet have <b>common</b> <b>names</b> based on the term gland flower, which is also used in the <b>common</b> <b>name</b> of A. barbiger (hairy glandflower), a Western Australia jugflower species.|$|R
5000|$|... 13 {{species of}} Adenanthos possess these properties. Many {{of these have}} <b>common</b> <b>names</b> that include the woollybush epithet. However the two species of Adenanthos that occur outside Western Australia are both woollybushes yet have <b>common</b> <b>names</b> based on the name Gland Flower. This {{suggests}} that the <b>common</b> <b>name</b> woollybush is exclusively a Western Australian name.|$|R

40|$|Complex <b>common</b> <b>names</b> such as Indian {{elephant}} {{or green}} tea denote {{a certain type}} of entity, viz. kinds. Moreover, those kinds are always subkinds of the kind denoted by their head noun. Establishing such subkinds is essentially the task of classifying modifiers that are a defining trait of endocentrically structured complex <b>common</b> <b>names.</b> Examining complex <b>common</b> <b>names</b> of different lexico-syntactic types(NN compounds, N+N syntagmas, NP/PP syntagmas, A+N syntagmas) and from different languages (particularly English, German and French) it can be shown that complex <b>common</b> <b>names</b> are subject to language- independent formal and semantic constraints. In particular, complex <b>common</b> <b>names</b> qualify as name-like expressions in that they tend to be deficient in terms of formal complexity and semantic compositionality...|$|R
