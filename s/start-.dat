25|$|Berlioz was {{convinced}} by Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein– {{with whom he}} had corresponded for some time– that he should begin to compose a new opera. This work would eventually become Les Troyens (The Trojans), a monumental grand opera with a libretto (which he wrote himself) based on Books Two and Four of Virgil's Aeneid. The idea of creating an opera based on the Aeneid had already been in his mind several years, by the time Sayn-Wittgenstein had approached him, and despite a long disillusionment, his creative flame seems to have remained lit. Les Troyens proved to be a very personal work for Berlioz, as it paid homage to his first literary love, whom he still cherished– even after his discoveries of Shakespeare and Goethe. The opera was planned around five acts, similar in size to the grand opera of Meyerbeer. It was composed with the Paris Opéra in mind, a most prestigious venue. Berlioz's chances of securing a production in which his work would receive attention equal to its merits were negligible from the <b>start–</b> a fact he must have been aware of. Despite these grim prospects, Berlioz saw the work through to its completion in 1858.|$|E
