5|$|Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just {{far enough}} away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or <b>solid</b> <b>angle)</b> of these two bodies match because, {{although}} the Sun's diameter is about 400 times {{as large as the}} Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.|$|E
5|$|A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a {{radius of}} one astronomical unit, {{so that the}} {{interior}} surface would receive {{the same amount of}} sunlight as Earth does per unit <b>solid</b> <b>angle,</b> would have a surface area of approximately , or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 yottawatts (3.846 × 1026 watts) of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's evolution. This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.|$|E

25|$|Mainlobe jamming can {{generally}} only {{be reduced}} by narrowing the mainlobe <b>solid</b> <b>angle</b> and cannot fully be eliminated when directly facing a jammer which uses the same frequency and polarization as the radar. Sidelobe jamming can be overcome by reducing receiving sidelobes in the radar antenna design and by using an omnidirectional antenna to detect and disregard non-mainlobe signals. Other anti-jamming techniques are frequency hopping and polarization.|$|E

25|$|These {{distributions}} {{represent the}} spectral radiance of blackbodies—the power emitted from the emitting surface, per unit projected area of emitting surface, per unit <b>solid</b> <b>angle,</b> per spectral unit (frequency, wavelength, wavenumber or their angular equivalents). Since the radiance is isotropic (i.e. independent of direction), the power emitted {{at an angle}} to the normal is proportional to the projected area, and therefore to the cosine of that angle as per Lambert's cosine law, and is unpolarized.|$|E
25|$|Among the Platonic solids, {{either the}} dodecahedron or the {{icosahedron}} {{may be seen}} as the best approximation to the sphere. The icosahedron has the largest number of faces and the largest dihedral angle, it hugs its inscribed sphere the most tightly, and its surface area to volume ratio is closest to that of a sphere of the same size (i.e. either the same surface area or the same volume.) The dodecahedron, on the other hand, has the smallest angular defect, the largest vertex <b>solid</b> <b>angle,</b> and it fills out its circumscribed sphere the most.|$|E
25|$|The candela (cd) is the SI unit of {{luminous}} intensity, that {{is power}} per unit <b>solid</b> <b>angle</b> {{in a given}} direction, weighted according to {{the sensitivity of the}} human eye to various colours of light. A typical candle produces light with about 1 candela of luminous intensity in all directions. A lamp can produce higher luminous intensity either by producing more light, or by focusing it tighter. The luminous intensity of a light depends on many factors, including the colour of the light and the eye's sensitivity to that colour, the optics involved, reflector and lens. Despite its complexity, it is a more useful measure than watts, because it defines how much usable light is shed in a given place: a dynamo headlight designed for road use and focused for seeing the road makes more efficient use {{of the power of the}} lamp than lights using rotationally symmetrical optics.|$|E

500|$|Caelum [...] is a faint {{constellation}} in {{the southern}} sky, introduced in the 1750s by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille and counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name means “chisel” in Latin, and it was formerly known as Caelum Scalptorium (“the engravers’ chisel”); It is a rare word, unrelated to the far more common Latin caelum, meaning “sky, heaven, atmosphere”. It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and subtends a <b>solid</b> <b>angle</b> of around 0.038steradians, just {{less than that of}} Corona Australis.|$|E

5000|$|Gibson {{stressed}} that the environment is not composed of geometrical solids on a plane, as in a painting, but is instead best understood as objects nested within one another and organized hierarchically by size. The ambient optic array, therefore, is also organized hierarchically by size, though the components are the <b>solid</b> <b>angles</b> from the object {{to the point of}} observation. Large <b>solid</b> <b>angles</b> come from the facades of various objects and interspaces between objects in the environment. Smaller <b>solid</b> <b>angles</b> are nested within the larger angles, and detail the facets and finer properties of the object. As the observer explores the environment, her relation to these angles change, and accordingly the appearance of the environment changes. For example, objects appear to grow larger or smaller depending on whether the observer moves towards or away from the object. This is because the angle subtended by the object to the observer becomes bigger as the observer gets closer, and smaller as the observer recedes. However the objective size of the actual object in the environment never changes. Put simply by philosopher Alva Noë, the ambient optic array is [...] "how things look from here in these conditions." ...|$|R
