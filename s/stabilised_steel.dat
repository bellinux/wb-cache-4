40|$|The high {{temperature}} cracking of 17 wt-%Cr {{ferritic stainless steel}} during continuous casting was investigated in detail. No relationship between the {{high temperature}} internal cracking and the ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT) was found. The experimental results imply that the cracking is owing {{to a combination of}} factors: a high ferrite potential, a hot ductility gap, and the weaker grain boundary cohesion. The 17 wt-%Cr Ti stabilised grades were found to be the most sensitive ferritic grades for crack formation at high temperatures. The ductility was evaluated by means of hot tension tests. At 1200 degreesC, the fracture surfaces of the Ti free ferritic steel had an intergranular character. At temperatures between 700 and 1100 degreesC, the fracture surfaces were dimpled. Below 600 degreesC cleavage fracture occurs. The 17 wt-%Cr Ti <b>stabilised</b> <b>steel</b> contained solidification related cracks. These cracks widen during the further cooling and could clearly be seen on the surface of a cracked specimen. The Ti stabilised grades had a ductility gap at 1100 degreesC. The DBTT was measured by means of Charpy tests. Most grades had a DBTT higher than 200 degreesC. Type AISI 430 Ti and AISI 409 ferritic steel both had a lower DBTT of similar to 90 degreesC...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Austenitic {{stainless}} steels are used extensively throughout power stations in high temperature {{applications such as}} superheater tubes and fuel rod guides. For these applications, welding is often required to join sections of components or pipes/tubes due to their large sizes and lengths. In this paper, samples of a cast niobium <b>stabilised</b> stainless <b>steel</b> welded to a wrought 321 stainless steel were investigated. The sections were joined together using an autogenous Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) weld. The effects of long term ageing at 750 °C for up to 4000 hours have been studied. The ageing treatments were conducted in an inert atmosphere. Compositional changes and precipitates have been investigated using SEM with EDX and EBSD analysis. Niobium dissolved completely into the weld melt however it is observed to precipitate back out during long term ageing. Titanium carbonitrides however remained intact during the welding process, creating agglomerated particles throughout the weld bead. Ageing above 100 hours causes further Nb rich MX precipitates to form, which coarsen with longer ageing times up to 4000 hours...|$|R

Post-ratcheting tensile test results show that while yield strength and tensile strength linearly increase, tensile ductility, both total and uniform, linearly decreases with increase {{in the amount of}} prior ratcheting strain. The extrapolated tensile strength and total elongation data at zero ratcheting strain show extremely good correspondence with the measured tensile strength and total elongation data of the steel in as-received condition.

40|$|In {{modern times}} {{continuous}} casting {{is the preferred}} way to convert molten steel into solid forms to enable further processing. At Columbus Stainless the continuous casting machine cast slabs of constant thickness with varying width. One {{important aspect of the}} continuously cast strand that must be controlled, is the strand width. The strand width exiting from the casting machine, has a direct influence on the product yield which in turn influences the profitability of the company. In general, the strand width control on the austentic and ferritic type steels achieved is excellent {{with the exception of the}} 12 % chrome non <b>stabilised</b> ferritic <b>steel.</b> This steel type exhibited different strand width changes when a sequence of different heats was cast. The strand width changes corresponded to the different heats in the sequence. Each heat has a unique chemistry and a relationship between the austenite and ferrite fraction at high temperature and the resulting strand width change was explained by Siyasiya[27]. The relationship between the heat composition and width change has in the past resulted in the development of a model that enabled the prediction of the expecte...|$|R

The train hall roof was fitted with stronger glazing, and the overall structure was <b>stabilised</b> by new <b>steel</b> double arches. At the same time, steel structural units, described as arches and depicted in the photo at right, were also installed. They are necessary for structural reasons, {{because there is a}} transit line between two of the platform tracks. At that point, the roof weights could not be forwarded directly into the ground but are diverted via the arches. This transit line is not needed at the moment and remains non electrified to this day. It is used exclusively for the stabling of railcars.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the chemical reactions that may occur at the fuel- clad interfaces of fuel elements used in advanced gas-coooled reactors (A. G. R.) The initial investigation involved {{a study of the}} inner surfaces of irradiated stainless steel clad and evidence was obtained to show that fission products, in particular tellerium, were associated with reaction products on these surfaces. An accelerated rate of oxidation was observed on the inner surfaces of a failed A. G. R. fuel pin. It is believed that fission product caesium was responsible for this enhancement. A fundamental study of the reaction between 20 %Cr/ 25 %Ni/niobium <b>stabilised</b> stainless <b>steel</b> and tellerium was then undertaken over the range 350 - 850 degrees C. Reaction occurred with increasing rapidity over this range and long term exposure at ≤ 750 degrees resulted in intergranular attack of the stainless steel and chromium depletion. The reaction on unoxidised steel surfaces involved the formation of an initial iron-nickel-tellerium layer which subsequently transformed to a chromium telluride product during continued exposure. The thermodynamic stabilities of the steel tellurides were determined to be chromium telluride > nickel telluride > iron telluride. Oxidation of the stainless steel surface prior to tellerium exposure inhibited the reaction. However reaction did occur in regions where the oxide layer had either cracked or spalled...|$|R

This stainless steel is designed for high temperature use in automotive exhaust systems. This requires a good blend of hot strength, creep and corrosion resistance.

40|$|Objectives: This study explores {{feasibility}} of tissue-engineered osteogenesis using sterile coral implants loaded with homologous osteoblasts to repair bone defects. Study Design: A unilateral 4 mm transverse dis- continuity defect was produced approximately mid-way along left radius of young female rabbits using ro- tary diamond disc under continuous saline irrigation and <b>stabilised</b> with autoclaved <b>steel</b> miniplate and screws. The defect was then fitted with sterile bioresorbable coral implant loaded with homologous neonatal calvarial osteoblasts or control implants without osteoblasts. All animals underwent radiography immedi- ately post-operative, at weekly intervals {{for four weeks}} and at fortnightly intervals thereafter. Operated bones were histologically evaluated for osteogenesis at 12 weeks.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a new irradiation facility that allows to perform accelerated damage tests of nuclear reactor materials at temperatures up to 400 °C using the intense proton (< 100 μA) and heavy ion (≈ 10 μA) beams produced by a 5 MV tandem ion accelerator. The dedicated beam line for radiation damage studies comprises: (1) beam diagnosis and focusing optical components, (2) a scanning and slit system that allows uniform irradiation of a sample area of 0. 5 – 6 cm 2, and (3) a sample stage designed {{to be able to}} monitor in-situ the sample temperature, current deposited on the sample, and the gamma spectrum of potential radio-active nuclides produced during the sample irradiation. The beam line capabilities have been tested by irradiating a 20 Cr– 25 Ni–Nb <b>stabilised</b> stainless <b>steel</b> with a 3 MeV proton beam to a dose level of 3 dpa. The irradiation temperature was 356 °C, with a maximum range in temperature values of ± 6 °C within the first 24 h of continuous irradiation. The sample stage is connected to ground through an electrometer to measure accurately the charge deposited on the sample. The charge can be integrated in hardware during irradiation, and this methodology removes uncertainties due to fluctuations in beam current. The measured gamma spectrum allowed the identification of the main radioactive nuclides produced during the proton bombardment from the lifetimes and gamma emissions. This dedicated radiation damage beam line is hosted by the Dalton Cumbrian Facility of the University of Manchester...|$|R
40|$|Mould powders are {{synthetic}} slags {{that contain}} mixtures of silica (SiO 2), lime (CaO), sodium oxide (Na 2 O), fluorspar (CaF 2), and carbon (C). When heated to elevated temperatures these powders liquefy and float on the liquid steel in the mould. Mould oscillation helps the liquid flux {{to penetrate the}} tiny gap between the mould and the newly formed solid steel shell. In this position the liquid flux partially solidifies against the water cooled mould, while {{a small portion of}} the flux remains liquid next to the steel shell to provide lubrication between the moving parts. Effective horizontal heat transfer in the mould is critical for solidifying the liquid steel inthe mould. This process is largely influenced by the thickness and the nature of the flux layer that infiltrates the mould/shell gap. When casting titanium <b>stabilised</b> stainless <b>steels</b> the alloying element reacts with the molten flux, ultimately changing the behaviour of the flux. During the casting process, titanium from the liquid steel reacts with the molten flux producing solids at high temperatures known as perovskite (CaTiO 3). Research has shown that perovskite reduces the lubrication capabilities of casting fluxes leading to detrimental effects on product quality while posing a serious threat of machine damage (breakout). The focus of this study is to investigate the effect of titanium pickup on the solidification nature of mould flux and the consequences on horizontal heat transfer. To achieve this, an experimental setup was constructed to simulate the behaviour of mould flux during continuous casting. Analyses of the test flux indicated that the liquid flux closest to the cold side (mould) instantly froze to produce a glassy solid structure. Closer to the hot side (steel shell), solid particles such as perovskite, cuspidine (Ca 4 Si 2 O 7 F 2), olivine (Ca,Mg,Mn) 2 SiO 4 and nepheline (Na 2 O. Al 2 O 3. (SiO 2) 2) could be identified. Similar solid particles were also found in a slag rim sample taken during the industrial casting of 321 - titanium <b>stabilised</b> stainless <b>steel</b> using SPH-KA 1 mould powder. Further investigations of the crystalline flux layers showed the entrapment of many tiny gas bubbles during solidification. This porous structure acted as a thermal heat barrier limiting horizontal heat transfer. Experimental testing on 3. 0 and 6. 0 mm flux thickness revealed that the overall thermal conductivity of mould flux decreased as the flux porosity increased. Larger amounts of gas entrapment (in the solid flux structure) resulted in higher thermal resistances which ultimately reduced the heat transfer capabilities of the flux. A second heat barrier, which has a far more dominating effect on the overall heat transfer, is created on mould surface during flux solidification. This thermal contact resistance is also found to be the result of entrapped gas bubbles. Experimental results concluded that the effect of titanium pickup on heat transfer is primarily overshadowed by the larger effect of the thermal contact resistance that is formed during mould flux solidification. The contact resistance in combination with gas entrapment in the solid crystalline structure is considered to be the key factors preventing horizontal heat transfer during continuous casting.

40|$|International audienceMicrostructural {{modifications}} {{induced by}} welding of 316 stainless steels and {{their effect on}} creep properties and relaxation crack propagation were examined. Cumulative strain due to multi-pass welding hardens the materials by increasing the dislocation density. Creep tests were conducted on three plates from different grades of 316 steel at 600 °C, with various carbon and nitrogen contents. These plates were tested both in the annealed condition and after warm rolling, which introduced pre-strain. It {{was found that the}} creep strain rate and ductility after warm rolling was reduced compared with the annealed condition. Moreover, all steels exhibited intergranular crack propagation during relaxation tests on Compact Tension specimens in the pre-strained state, but not in the annealed state. These results confirmed that the reheat cracking risk increases with both residual stress triaxiality and pre-strain. On the contrary, high solute content and strain-induced carbide precipitation, which are thought to increase reheat cracking risk of <b>stabilised</b> austenitic stainless <b>steels</b> did not appear as key parameters in reheat cracking of 316 stainless steels...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHot rolling of {{stainless}} steel {{is one of the}} most important steps in manufacturing process regarding surface quality of the product. <b>Stabilised</b> ferritic stainless <b>steels</b> are widely used in automotive and cosmetic appliances but are also concerned by sticking phenomenon. These grades, having high dry corrosion and creep resistance, are enriched in specific chemical elements such as Cr, Nb or Ti, limiting also slab oxidation during hot rolling. Nevertheless, the mastered oxidation of slab surface is a way to protect metal surface from direct contact with rolls. In order to better understand initiation of sticking, a first campaign was based on topography and rolls surface state wear analysis. This study revealed that sticking initiation is not due to the presence of roll scratches which depth is higher than oxide layer thickness. Indeed, the probability that roll scratches are deeper than oxide layer thickness is very low. In a second time, a pilot was designed, reproducing tribological conditions of a roll bite, to better understand mechanisms that initiate sticking. Keeping in mind the importance of rolls and slab surface state, this pilot is able to use specimen taking from industrial products, having the original oxide layer surface. This second study highlighted the major role of silicon oxides on scale adherence and the high heterogeneity of this scale layer in thickness and in chemical composition...|$|R
