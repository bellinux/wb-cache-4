40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} define a process that allows for the {{reconfiguration}} of management processes, {{in a manner that}} is easier than those afforded by existing approaches. This project proposes to achieve this through the use of a Software Distribution Management System (SDMS) that employs a service-oriented mechanism. This constitutes an improvement over more traditional distribution systems because SDMS allows for the reconfiguration of management distribution processes. In addition, this study applies a Service-Oriented Software Engineering (SOSE) development methodology for designing and building of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based on SDMS. While based on a conventional methodology this gives consideration to added dimensions such as service choreography, and service bus. The result is a approach that allows software engineers to readily reconfigure and recombine services from a range of different <b>systems,</b> <b>applications,</b> <b>architectures</b> and ages. This paper provides the service identification results and monitoring methodology of the SDMS produced by this project. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{parallel}} systems, {{a number}} of measures of performance are not accurate or representative of their functioning. These measures allow to quantify the benefit of parallelism. Very often, programs are designed and tested for smaller problems on fewer processing elements. However, the real problems these programs are intended to solve are much larger, and the machines contain {{a great number of}} processing elements. Hence, it is necessary to create a model that allows to extrapolate the application execution over a few processing elements to larger machine configurations. These measures are more complex if we consider faults. When we take measures we must understand the interaction among <b>system</b> <b>architecture,</b> <b>application</b> <b>architecture</b> and fault tolerant system.

For example, important decisions are prepared by computer systems, but the actual decision is always taken by a person following an evaluation and control step. With this development path, there is less of an impact on many knowledge-based jobs since people retain decision-making powers and responsibilities. Computers here have supporting functions for decision-making, and their interfaces in all areas of life and work are geared towards humans.|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{emergence}} {{more than}} a decade ago, information architecture remains a problematic concept. A study of relevant literature suggests significant advocacy with inadequate supporting evidence on its existence, application or value. The available limited research evidence generally presents unsatisfactory information architecture experience. Notwithstanding the unresolved issues and reported unsatisfactory experience, information architecture continues to be referenced as an important information management issue. Hence this doctoral study sought to investigate it. In the first stage, the study set out to clarify the position of information architecture via a large scale postal survey of 294 organisations. The survey found that information architecture is being used in association with IS planning, particularly in organisations which position IT as a strategic resource, but perceptions on its two conventional key components vary. While <b>application</b> <b>architecture</b> is viewed as being useful for IS planning, corporate data model is seen as being more relevant to data management and project implementation. Both models are regarded as tools facilitating integrated information systems development. In the second stage of research, case studies on 6 large organisations were conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of successful information architecture practice. The investigation reaffirmed <b>application</b> <b>architecture's</b> position as an IS planning tool and cast further doubt on corporate data model's role not only in IS planning but also in IS practice as a whole. Business area/project data model was identified as the pragmatic high-level data model for both application/database development and data management. A major finding of the case studies was on business system architecture, a pictorial model depicting IT in its business setting. It is seen as being of value for integrating IS planning with strategy development and business planning - a tool for fusing IT with the business. The case studies concluded that the value and effectiveness of information architecture is dependent on the targeting of its components - business <b>system</b> <b>architecture,</b> <b>application</b> <b>architecture</b> and business area/project data model - in terms of tasks and recipients. The case for a holistic approach to business/IS planning and implementation is currently being argued by a number of leading management and IS scholars. This thesis embraces the holistic approach and positions the (redefined) information architecture as a valuable tool in its implementation. </p...|$|R
