5|$|Apocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of Egypt, {{and were}} {{described}} on the Tempest Stele of Ahmose I, {{have been attributed to}} short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption. The difficulty with this interpretation is that in the conventional but disputed Egyptian chronology Ahmose I ruled from c. 1539–1514 BCE, whilst the eruption is thought to have occurred <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> 1642–1540 BCE.|$|E

The gameplay {{was designed to be}} <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> that of the faster, more competition-oriented Melee and the slower, more casual-friendly Brawl. The 3DS version was released in Japan in September 2014, and in North America, Europe, and Australia the following month.

5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel steering and those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the {{original}} mansion began in April 1879, George O. Garnsey, a Chicago architect, designed the Ellwood Mansion for DeKalb barbed wire entrepreneur Isaac Ellwood. At the time, Garnsey had designed other structures in DeKalb and Sycamore. By November 1879 the Ellwood family occupied the home. Newspaper accounts of the day put the cost <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> US$40,000 and $50,000. The original Ellwood House {{had a number of}} elements common to Victorian designed homes and combined several styles. Its mansard roof remains one of the home's most striking features. In addition, the home still incorporates Gothic columns, pitched gables, and a cast iron roof cresting with a trefoil design.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, the Manipur Horse Riding and Polo Association was {{established}} to promote the Manipuri pony breed and the game of polo. In recent years, breed numbers have decreased, and estimates place the breed at <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> 2,300 and 1,000 in population in the 21st century. Population numbers continue to dwindle {{in part due to}} high numbers of ponies being smuggled into Myanmar (Burma), where the breed is in demand, after either having been purchased or stolen from their Indian owners. In 2005, a heritage park was begun by the Manipur Horse Riding and Polo Association with the goal of preventing the extinction of the breed and promoting them to tourists.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In a {{literary}} career that spanned {{more than a}} quarter of a century, Trimmer authored <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> 33 and 44 texts.

While many of her texts were for children, some of her works, such as The Œconomy of Charity, were also for specific adult audiences. Still others were written for both children and adults, such as The Servant’s Friend (1786–7), which was meant to instruct servants of all ages.|$|E

The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a dirt road that enabled them to drive to within three or four miles of the crash site. The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E
5|$|Lucius Aelius Sejanus {{had served}} the {{imperial}} family for {{almost twenty years}} when he became Praetorian Prefect in AD15. As Tiberius became more embittered with the position of Princeps, he began to depend more and more upon the limited secretariat left to him by Augustus, and specifically upon Sejanus and the Praetorians. In AD17 or 18, Tiberius had trimmed {{the ranks of the}} Praetorian Guard responsible for the defense of the city, and had moved it from encampments outside of the city walls into the city itself, giving Sejanus access to <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> 6000 and 9000 troops.|$|E
5|$|NGC 2537, {{known as}} the Bear's Paw Galaxy, lies about 3 degrees north-northwest of 31 Lyncis. It is a blue compact dwarf galaxy that is <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> 17 and 30 million light-years away from Earth. Close by is IC 2233, a very flat and thin spiral galaxy that is between 26 and 40 million light-years away from Earth. A {{comparatively}} quiet galaxy with a low rate of star formation (less than one solar mass every twenty years), it was long suspected to be interacting with the Bear's Paw galaxy. This is now considered highly unlikely as observations with the Very Large Array showed the two galaxies lie at different distances.|$|E

The flood of refugees turned the operation {{into one of the}} largest emergency evacuations by sea in history— over a period of 15 weeks, <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> 494 and 1,080 merchant vessels of all types and numerous naval craft, including Germany's largest remaining naval units, transported about 800,000 - 900,000 refugees and 350,000 soldiers across the Baltic Sea to Germany and occupied Denmark. This evacuation was one of the German Navy's most significant activities during the war.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>between</b> the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
