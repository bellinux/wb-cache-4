25|$|The {{primary mission}} was {{anticipated}} to last 90 sols (Martian days) – just over 92 Earth days. However, the craft exceeded its expected operational lifetime {{by a little}} over two months before succumbing to the increasing cold and dark of an advancing Martian winter. Researchers had hoped that the lander would survive into the Martian winter so that it could witness polar ice developing around it – perhaps up to 1 metre of <b>solid</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide ice could have appeared. Even had it survived some of the winter, the intense cold would have prevented it from lasting all the way through.|$|E

Properties, Uses, Applications: CO2 Gas and Liquid Carbon Dioxide|url =http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html|accessdate = 2009-07-26}} First, gases {{with a high}} {{concentration}} of carbon dioxide are produced. Such gases can be a byproduct of another process, such as producing ammonia from nitrogen and natural gas, oil refinery activities or large-scale fermentation. Second, the carbon dioxide-rich gas is pressurized and refrigerated until it liquefies. Next, the pressure is reduced. When this occurs some liquid carbon dioxide vaporizes, causing a rapid lowering of temperature of the remaining liquid. As a result, the extreme cold causes the liquid to solidify into a snow-like consistency. Finally, the snow-like <b>solid</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide is compressed into small pellets or larger blocks of dry ice.|$|E

This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the efficiency and characteristics of de-nitrification using bamboo as <b>solid</b> phase <b>carbon</b> source in a batch and continuous flow mode. Compared to no <b>solid</b> phase <b>carbon</b> source system, the higher nitrate-N removal efficiency and the less nitrite-N accumulation was observed in a de-nitrification system by using bamboo as <b>solid</b> phase <b>carbon</b> source. The results showed that nitrate-N volumetric load averaged between 2. 09 mg/L. h when filamentous bamboo as single carbon source, and mean nitrite-N accumulations was only 0. 23 mg as 1 g nitrate-N was removed. Moreover, temperature was an important influencing factor for nitrate-N volumetric load and nitrite accumulation. In addition, refractory organic compounds and nitrate-N can simultaneous remove...|$|R
25|$|A higher {{cracking}} temperature (also {{referred to}} as severity) favors the production of ethene and benzene, whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of propene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. The process also results in the slow deposition of coke, a form of carbon, on the reactor walls. This degrades {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, so reaction conditions are designed to minimize this. Nonetheless, a steam cracking furnace can usually only run for a few months at a time between de-cokings. Decokes require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This converts the hard <b>solid</b> <b>carbon</b> layer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Once this reaction is complete, the furnace can be returned to service.|$|E
500|$|By this time, it {{was known}} that the main process by which mesotrons lose energy is {{ionisation}} energy loss, which is described by the Bethe formula, and {{is proportional to the}} mass per unit area of the layer of material traversed. [...] If this were the only process, the intensity of the hard component passing through a layer of solid material would decrease by the same amount as in an equivalent layer of air. Rossi and his collaborators found that the decrease was significantly larger in the atmosphere than in a corresponding layer of <b>solid</b> <b>carbon.</b> [...] Because the distance traversed in air was much larger than that in carbon, they interpreted this result as evidence for decay of the mesotron, and taking into account the effect of relativistic time dilation, estimated its mean life at rest as roughly 2microseconds.|$|E

[...] This increased pressure allows more dust {{to be held in}} the atmosphere. [...] Moisture in the atmosphere will fall as snow or as ice frozen onto dust grains.

[...] General circulation models of the Martian atmosphere predict accumulations of ice-rich dust in the same areas where ice-rich features are found.|$|E

40|$|Coal chars, {{like most}} <b>solid</b> <b>carbons,</b> have a {{pronounced}} tendency to chemisorb oxygen at low and moderate temperatures. Characterization by XPS of surface oxides on carbon {{has been accomplished}} {{with the aim of}} providing a better atomistic insight into: (a) reactions involved in molecular oxygen adsorption on coals and (b) the relations between the nanostructure of <b>solid</b> <b>carbons</b> and the chemistry of oxidation. High-resolution C 1 s and O 1 s core level and valence band XPS spectra effectively reflected the oxidative functionalization of different types of coals and synthetic carbons upon oxidation in air at moderate temperatures (300 and 500 °C). More specifically, analysis of C 1 s and valence band spectra could be directed to monitor the structural evolution of the carbons in terms of extension of sp 2 versus sp 3 conjugation, carbon vacancies and oxidized carbon. Comparison of the O 1 s spectra, on the other hand, provided a tool to characterize the nature of oxygen bonding on carbon and to determine the relative abundance of carbon-oxygen species. Results underline the important role of epoxy groups {{in the early stages of}} oxidation, providing a mechanistic framework for the identification of the stable and metastable intermediates in the heterogeneous oxidation of coal by molecular oxygen. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
