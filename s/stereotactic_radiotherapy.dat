40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{tremendous}} interest has arisen {{in the use}} of nonoperative therapies for patients with non–small cell lung cancer. Of these therapies, <b>stereotactic</b> body <b>radiotherapy</b> has become established as an effective modality for treating peripheral cancer in medically inoperable patients. Toxicity is low, and the treatment is effective, with excellent local control rates. Several investigators have suggested that <b>stereotactic</b> body <b>radiotherapy</b> could be effective for high-risk operable patients (usually treated with sublobar resection) and even perhaps for standard-risk operable patients (usually treated with lobectomy); however, this is less accepted. A direct comparison of <b>stereotactic</b> body <b>radiotherapy</b> and sublobar resection is difficult for a number of reasons. These include different definitions of recurrence, different populations of patients in these studies (with those undergoing <b>stereotactic</b> body <b>radiotherapy</b> tending to be the medically inoperable group), and different methods of classifying morbidity in the surgical and radiation oncology studies. Imaging follow-up has also not been standardized among the studies. Thus, a randomized study is necessary and timely. Investigators from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group have collaborated to develop a phase III randomized study comparing <b>stereotactic</b> body <b>radiotherapy</b> and sublobar resection (with or without brachytherapy) for high-risk operable patients with non–small cell lung cancer.

40|$|Seung-Gu Yeo Department of Radiation Oncology, Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Hospital, Cheonan, Republic of Korea Abstract: Primary lung sarcoma (PLS) is an {{extremely}} rare, very aggressive malignancy. Surgical removal is considered the treatment of choice, and patients who have been given conventional radiotherapy have had inferior outcomes. This study is the first describing a case of PLS treated with <b>stereotactic</b> ablative <b>radiotherapy</b> (SABR), which precisely targets a small tumor with a markedly higher biologically effective dose than conventional radiotherapy. The patient was an 82 -year-old man who was diagnosed with primary lung leiomyosarcoma based on radiology, pathology, and immunohistochemical examinations. The PLS was located in the right lower lobe and measured 2. 5 cm. No regional nodal or distant organ metastasis was observed. He was inoperable medically. The SABR was performed using volumetric modulated arc therapy and a dose of 56 Gy in four fractions. Follow-up computed tomography 2 months after SABR revealed a complete tumor response. The toxicity was limited to mild respiratory symptoms. The patient is alive and has had no evidence of disease for 2 years. This study suggests that SABR can be a safe and effective treatment option for PLS.

50|$|A second, {{more recent}} {{evolution}} extrapolates the original concept of stereotactic radiosurgery to extra-cranial targets, {{most notably in}} the lung, liver, pancreas, and prostate. This treatment approach, entitled <b>stereotactic</b> body <b>radiotherapy</b> or SBRT, is challenged by various types of motion. On top of patient immobilization challenges and the associated patient motion, extra-cranial lesions move {{with respect to the}} patient’s position due to respiration, bladder and rectum filling. Like stereotactic radiosurgery, the intent of <b>stereotactic</b> body <b>radiotherapy</b> is to eradicate a defined extra-cranial target. However, target motion requires larger treatment margins around the target to compensate for the positioning uncertainty. This in turn implies more normal tissue exposed to high doses, which could result in negative treatment side effects. As a consequence, <b>stereotactic</b> body <b>radiotherapy</b> is mostly delivered in a limited number of fractions, thereby blending the concept of stereotactic radiosurgery with the therapeutic benefits of fractionated radiotherapy. To monitor and correct target motion for accurate and precise patient positioning prior and during treatment, advanced image-guided technologies are commercially available and included in the radiosurgery programs offered by the CyberKnife and Novalis communities.|$|R

The aim of this report was to analyze the results of our preliminary experience with extracranial <b>stereotactic</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> in locally or distantly recurrent gynecological tumors. Extracranial <b>stereotactic</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> was planned by the Precise-Plan treatment planning system. Patients were immobilized using the Stereotactic Body-Frame. Five consecutive daily fractions were delivered; dose/fraction and total dose were defined based on an institutional dose-escalation protocol. A class solution with 4 non-coplanar fixed beams based on the tetrad configuration was used in all patients. Eleven patients (12 lesions), were included in the analysis. <b>Stereotactic</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> was delivered as first radiotherapy treatment (5 patients), or as retreatment (6 patients). Complete clinical response was achieved in 8 / 12 lesions (66. 6 %), while partial response was documented in 2 / 12 lesions (16. 6 %). With a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 2 - 37 months), 7 patients (63 %) experienced local and/or distant progression of disease.

40|$|Background: A phase III multi-centre {{randomised}} trial (ROSEL) {{has been}} initiated {{to establish the}} role of <b>stereotactic</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> in patients with operable stage IA lung cancer. Due to rapid changes in radiotherapy technology and evolving techniques for image-guided delivery, guidelines had to be developed {{in order to ensure}} uniformity in implementation of <b>stereotactic</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> in this multi-centre study. Methods/Design: A Quality Assurance Working Party was formed by radiation oncologists and clinical physicists from both academic as well as non-academic hospitals that had already implemented <b>stereotactic</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> for lung cancer. A literature survey was conducted and consensus meetings were held in which both the knowledge from the literature and clinical experience were pooled. In addition, a planning study was performed in 26 stage I patients, of which 22 were stage IA, in order to develop and evaluate the planning guidelines. Plans were optimised according to parameters adopted from RTOG trials using both an algorithm with a simple homogeneity correction (Type A) and a more advanced algorithm (Type B). Dose conformity requirements were then formulated based on these results. Conclusion: Based on current literature and expert experience, guidelines were formulated for this phase III study of <b>stereotactic</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> versus surgery.
