40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{application}} of a new method in identifying the accumulated <b>sludge</b> <b>deposits</b> (e. g., oily sludge, water sludge, and filter sludge). The method is an excellent approach for identifying the inorganic materials found <b>in</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>deposits</b> generated <b>in</b> refineries and gas plants. The phase identification and quantification on inorganic material in the form of corrosion products are important to facilitate chemical cleaning and prevent the reoccurrence to stop the generation of sludges. Therefore, the authors developed a new method to separate the inorganic materials from the hydrocarbon of the as-received sludge samples from the fields. When the sample preparation was taken with great care, the results revealed that this method is fast and can accurately identify very small quantities (> 0. 5 [*]wt%) of <b>sludge</b> <b>deposits</b> present <b>in</b> the sample. Additionally, if the color of the dichloromethane soluble part collected is changed, it indicates the presence of hydrocarbon in the sludge. Thermal gravimetric analysis results revealed that the sludge contained approximately 3 [*]wt% of inorganic compound, 25 [*]wt% of water, and 72 [*]wt% of hydrocarbon. Subsequently, gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis results revealed that the type of hydrocarbon was diesel with the C 10 –C 27...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{fundamental}} {{studies on the}} use of a special tank for converting. organic matter in night soil into more suitable form before night soil is disposed of by being used as manure, the author performed studies on the influence of temperature on the survival of Ascaris eggs in night soil in the process of digestion. The survival rate of Ascaris eggs in the tank would serve as an index for functional activities of the tank. Ascaris eggs were exposed to differing temperature, 45 ℃, 40 ℃, 37 ℃, 30 ℃, and 25 ℃, as well as to a normal room temperature, in tanks experimentally simulated, and their survival rates were investigated. On the other hand, the behavior of Ascaris eggs in some tanks already in practical operation was subjected to studies, and the results were correlated with those of experimental studies. (1) It was shown that higher the temperature to which eggs were exposed, the lower was the survival rate of them. (2) All the eggs exposed to 45 ℃ died in 8 hours. (3) The survival rate of the eggs exposed to 40 ℃ was reduced to less then 65 per cent in 2 hours. They all died in 4 to 5 days. (4) It was presumed that the eggs exposed to 37 ℃ would dieun 7 to 10 days, depending on circumstances. (5) It seemed that it would take 45 to 50 days for all of eggs to die if they were exposed to 30 ℃. (6) When eggs were exposed to 25 ℃ for 75 days, only 1 per cent of them survived. It would take 80 days for all of them to die in this condition. (7) When eggs in a simulated experimental tank were kept at a room temperature of 18. 4 ℃, an average temperature for the period from February to October, 11 per cent of them survived in 190 days. They all died in 200 days. (8) Examinations of Ascaris eggs in the tank at Muroran, Hokkaido where night soil is stored for 15 days and heated at 35 ℃ showed that 76 per cent of the eggs found in raw night soil were live ones, while the rates of survival <b>in</b> the <b>sludge</b> <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the bottom and in the supernatant were 15 per cent and 15. 5 per cent, respectively. (9) In the digestion tank at Sunamachi, Tokyo where night soil is heated at 30 ℃ and stored for 30 days, 88. 1 per cent of Ascaris eggs found in raw night soil were live ones, while 35 per cent and 13. 5 per cent of the eggs found in the sludge sedimented in the bottom and in the supernatant, respectively, were live ones. There were no live eggs in the dried sludge. (10) In the tank at Shuzenji, Shizuoka where night soil is stored for digestion without being heated, the survival rates of Ascaris eggs were 73. 7 per cent in raw night soil, 47. 5 per cent in the sludge and 17. 8 par cent in the supernatant. Twenty-two per cent of the eggs found in the dried sludge were live ones. (11) In view of the results of present studies, it would seem that, while the temperature lower than 30 ℃. would have no effect on expediting digestion of night soil, extermination of Ascaris eggs would result if night soil were stored for 15 days and heated at 37 ℃...|$|R

Six years later, in 1991, the dam sediments were flushed out for the first time and impacted on the downstream of Kurobe River. The dam sediments and the suspension contained a large amount of organic matter (with high C, N and S contents) with sludge-smell. The annual catch of bentic fishes (exp. flatfish) and the annual haul of wakame seaweed have been decreased year by year since the first discharge of the dam sediments in 1991. Until now, it has been reported that the <b>sludge</b> has <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the Toyama Bay which is apprehensive of influence of discharged dam sediments, because suspended particles affect the fish's gill respiration. In this study, suspension of river water were collected at three bridges during discharge from Dashidaira and Unazuki Dam in June 19 th- 22 nd and in June 30 th-July 2 nd, 2001. River water quality and suspended solid were analyzed chemically, physically and mineralogically. Extremely low DO and Eh values were observed at the periods during first discharge in June 19 th- 22 nd at two bridges. Moreover, during second discharge in June 30 th-July 2 nd, DO and Eh values were constant. Therefore it was shown that drastic decreased of DO and Eh values were a peculiar phenomenon during first discharge in June 19 th- 22 th, 2001. The results of NCS elemental analyses were suggested that high organic contents were related with drastic decreased of DO and Eh values. Clay mineralogy of both Unazuki Dam sediments and suspended solid on the seabed at the offing of Kurobe River mouth, show abundant semctite with chlorite, mica clay minerals and kaolin minerals, suggesting those are the almost same origin.

40|$|It was {{discovered}} in a Korean PWR that an extensive number of very short and shallow cracks in the SG tubes were undetectable by eddy current in-service-inspection because of the masking effect of <b>sludge</b> <b>deposits.</b> Axial stress corrosion cracks at the outside diameter of the steam generator tubes near the line contacts with the tube support plates are the major concern among the six identical Korean nuclear power plants having CE-type steam generators with Alloy 600 high temperature mill annealed tubes, HU 3 & 4 and HB 3 ∼ 6. The tubes in HB 3 & 4 have a less susceptible microstructure so that the onset of ODSCC was substantially delayed compared to HU 3 & 4 whose tubes are most susceptible to ODSCC among the six units. The numbers of cracks detected by the eddy current inspection jumped drastically after the steam generators of HB 4 were chemically cleaned. The purpose of the chemical cleaning was to mitigate stress corrosion cracking by removing the heavy <b>sludge</b> <b>deposit,</b> since a corrosive environment is formed in the occluded region under the <b>sludge</b> <b>deposit.</b> SGCC also enhances the detection capability of the eddy current inspection at the same time. Measurement {{of the size of}} each crack using the motorized rotating pancake coil probe indicated that the cracks in HB 4 were shorter and substantially shallower than the cracks in HU 3 & 4. It is believed that the cracks were shorter and shallower because the microstructure of the tubes in HB 4 is less susceptible to ODSCC. It was readily understood from the size distribution of the cracks and the quantitative information available on the probability of detection that most cracks in HB 4 had been undetected until the steam generators were chemically cleaned...|$|R

40|$|The {{vertical}} flow constructed wetland (VFCW) {{has become}} an attractive decentralised technology for septage treatment. One of the main purposes of the septage treatment {{is to reduce the}} volume of raw septage through dewatering, where the solids content is retained in the wetland bed and the water content is released. The retention of solids forms a layer of <b>sludge</b> <b>deposit</b> at the wetland surface, and the drained water, the so-called leachate, typically contains a lower solids content. This article reports the performance of dewatering and filtration of a pilot-scale VFCW designed for septage treatment. A comparison between two feeding strategies, hydraulic loading rate (HLR) and solids loading rate (SLR), is presented. The dewatering efficiency through drainage was found to be dependent on the solids load. The removal of total solids (TS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were excellent as the quality of leachate showed that more than 90 % of TS and COD were retained in the system. This study reveals that the feeding based on SLR delivered a more sustainable performance for dewatering and solids removal. The build-up of <b>sludge</b> <b>deposit</b> significantly deteriorated the dewatering efficiency through drainage, but it tended to improve the filtration capacity...|$|R

International audienceThe design of French VFCWs leads to the formation of a sludge layer at the surface of the first filters due to the retention of suspended solids from the percolation of unsettled wastewater. This layer {{plays a major role in}} the system but still little is known on its characteristics and evolutions. In this study, suspended solids and <b>sludge</b> <b>deposits</b> sampled from two French VFCW plants were analyzed by different methods in the objective to assess the evolution of particulate organic matter (POM) along the treatment chain and within the sludge layer, and identify relevant analytical indicators of these phenomena. The treatment chain included an aerobic trickling filter followed by FeCl 3 injection and two successive stages of filters. Thermal analyses showed that OM contents of suspended solids decreased along the treatment chain. POM in inflow suspended solids was predominantly composed of reactive, biodegradable compounds which were partly hydrolyzed and mineralized notably at the trickling filter stage. 3 D fluorescence spectra collected from aqueous POM extracts confirmed the evolution of organic matter from low-molecular reactive compounds to more complex and stable structures such as humic-like substances. FTIR confirmed the mineralization of POM's reactive constituents along the treatment chain by the decrease in the intensities of the characteristics bands of aliphatic compounds or proteins, and its humification <b>in</b> the <b>sludge</b> <b>deposits</b> through the relative increase of the bands at 1634 cm− 1 (vC = O) and 1238 cm− 1 (δC = O and/or δOH).

The higher values of δ 2 H/ 1 H and δ 15 N/ 14 N ratios measured <b>in</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>deposits</b> as compared to inflow suspended solids were related to POM humification and to microbial processes of POM hydrolysis and mineralization, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{biochemical}} {{degradation of}} domestic <b>sludge</b> <b>deposits</b> exposed to benthic marine conditions was investigated using a laboratory Deep Sea Simulator. The rate {{and extent of}} deposit stabilization were determined for select hydrostatic pressures and hydrogen acceptor conditions by monitoring depletion of particulate organic carbon in 2. 0 and 3. 0 centimeter deposits. The extent of aerobic and anaerobic-exogenous zones in a 33 centimeter deep deposit was determined by measuring dissolved oxygen, sulfate and hydrogen sulfide concentrations {{as a function of}} distance from the deposit surface. Marine deposit stabilization processes and a set of mathematical expressions for temporal particulate organic carbon changes were formulated based on studies of fresh water organic matter stabilization and characteristics of the benthic marine environment. Aerobic depletion of particulate organic carbon amounted to between 14 and 19 percent in 20 days. After 120 days, depletion reached 30. 6 percent ([superscript k]avg = 0. 042 day ⁻¹) and the remaining refractory component was 0. 21 mg-C/mg solid. Thereafter, degradation proceeded slowly. Comparable anaerobic decreases were 2. 5 to 4. 0 percent in 20 days and 7. 0 percent in 130 days ([superscript k]avg = 0. 024 day ⁻¹). Calculated anaerobic particulate organic carbon residuals ranged from 0. 25 to 0. 28 mg-C/mg solid. Differences in the aerobic and anaerobic biochemical depletion rates resulted in a 30 percent higher particulate organic carbon concentration in the anaerobic zone than in the near-surface aerobic zone in 120 days. Variance analyses confirmed the significance of degradation rate differences as a function of hydrogen acceptor zone, but indicated that differences were not significant for hydrostatic pressures of one and 34 atmospheres. Interactive hydrostatic pressure/hydrogen-acceptor-type effects were also found to be insignificant. The <b>sludge</b> <b>deposit</b> aerobic zone extended from the sea water/ sludge interface to approximately two millimeters. The anaerobicexogenous zone (defined by a ten-fold reduction in the surface dissolved sulfate concentration) extended from the dissolved oxygen diffusion limit to approximately 16 centimeters deep in a 33 centimeter deposit, 180 days after deposit formation. Hydrogen sulfide concentrations in excess of 500 mg/ 1 were measured at the 16 centimeter depth in the 33 centimeter deposit, whereas the maximum hydrogen sulfide concentration measured in 2. 0 and 3. 0 centimeter deposits was 20 mg/l. Although aerobic particulate organic carbon degradation rates were larger than anaerobic rates, overall depletion of particulate organic carbon occurred principally in the anaerobic zone which was 15 times greater than the aerobic zone in a 3. 0 centimeter deposit. Study findings indicate that the formation of marine <b>sludge</b> <b>deposits</b> which are greater than a few millimeters in depth enhances material preservation. When deposits become deeper than a few centimeters, dissolved hydrogen sulfide may accumulate to levels known to be toxic to marine organisms...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSedimentary {{phosphate}} mines produce {{millions of}} tons of waste rocks during their open-pit mining. In addition, during ore phosphate beneficiation, fluorapatite is separated from associated gangue minerals by a combination of successive mineral processing steps that involve crushing / screening, washing, and flotation. These operations generate large volume of tailings (called phosphate <b>sludge)</b> that are <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> large surface ponds and waste rocks stockpiled within the mining site. The potential reuse of these phosphate mine by-products (waste rocks and sludge) has been investigated in the last 10 years. The first investigated option consisted in using the alkaline waste rocks (APW) to control the acid mine drainage (AMD). Indeed, these alkaline mine wastes contain significant quantities of calcite (46 wt%) and dolomite (16 wt%) that help in neutralizing the acidity generated by the wastes from the closed Kettara mine, located near Marrakech, Morocco. The addition of 15 wt% APW to the coarse Kettara tailings produced leachates with significantly lower acidity and metal loads in comparison to the un-amended control sample. Secondly, the efficiency of APW was assessed in the laboratory as an alternative alkaline material for passive AMD water treatment. In semi-arid climate, the oxic passive treatment has been proven to be the most suitable. The pH of the water and its quality were significantly improved. As a third option, the hydrogeotechnical characterization of original and screened phosphate limestone waste rocks as well as the phosphate sludge showed their suitability for use as a component of store-and-release (SR) covers for industrial mine site reclamation. Lab tests (columns) and field tests (instrumented columns and experimental cells) showed that water infiltration can be controlled, even for extreme rainfall events (150 mm/day), by 1 m thick of a SR cover made with APW. Further research is currently being investigated around the recycling and valorization of phosphate sludge from phosphate mines as ceramics. Furthermore, the overburden of the phosphates sedimentary basins are mainly composed of marls; limestones blocks; silex bed; silex nodule; marls and clays; silicified limestone; which have a significant reuse potential as marble-mosaic floor, mortars and concrete, and natural stone products slabs for floors and stairs...|$|R
