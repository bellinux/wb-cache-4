40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we explore}} a general {{methodology}} for convert-ing composite order pairing-based cryptosystems into the prime order setting. We employ the dual pairing vector space approach initiated by Okamoto and Takashima and formulate versatile tools in this framework {{that can be}} used to translate composite order schemes for which the prior techniques of Freeman were insufficient. Our techniques are typically ap-plicable for composite order schemes relying on the canceling property and proven <b>secure</b> <b>from</b> variants of the subgroup decision assumption, and will result in prime order schemes that are proven <b>secure</b> <b>from</b> the decisional linear assumption. As an instructive example, we obtain a translation of the Lewko-Waters composite order IBE scheme. This pro-vides a close analog of the Boneh-Boyen IBE scheme that is proven fully <b>secure</b> <b>from</b> the decisional linear assumption. In the full version of this paper, we also provide a translation of the Lewko-Waters unbounded HIBE scheme. ...|$|R
