5|$|Andrew {{wanted to}} secure his <b>suzerainty</b> over {{the rulers of}} Moldavia and Wallachia. He {{initially}} wanted to replace Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, with his brother, Stephen, but Michael swore fealty to him on 26 June. Andrew's envoys {{signed an agreement with}} Ieremia Movilă, Voivode of Moldavia, about the marriage of the voivode's daughter and Andrew's half-brother, János Iffjú, on 3 July. Andrew also started negotiations with the Ottoman Empire, demanding the confirmation of his hereditary rule and his <b>suzerainty</b> over Wallachia, and refusing the payment of the tribute for six years.|$|E
5|$|After Michael the Brave's death, Transylvania {{was ruled}} by an {{imperial}} military commission, but under Stephen Bocskay (16041606) the principality voluntarily accepted Ottoman <b>suzerainty.</b> In the next decades, the princes of Transylvania, among them Gabriel Bethlen (16131629), made several unsuccessful attempts to unify Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its large}} {{financial}} power, the Kingdom of Hungary quickly rebuilt its army and {{found itself in}} conflict with the Holy Roman Empire in 1337. However, the Hungarian king maintained a de jure <b>suzerainty</b> over Wallachia until the diplomatic disputes had been resolved.|$|E
5|$|Henry I of Jerusalem came to Antioch {{to mediate}} {{a peace treaty}} in early 1195. After Bohemond renounced his claim to <b>suzerainty</b> over Cilicia and {{acknowledged}} Leo's possession of Bagras, Leo released him and his retainers. Before long, Bohemond's son, Raymond, married Leo's niece and heir, Alice.|$|E
5|$|Multiple vassalage {{became an}} {{important}} aspect of Romanian diplomacy after the Christian Balkan states (Bulgaria, Serbia) one by one fell to the Ottoman Empire in the course {{the second half of the}} 14th century. For example, Mircea the Elder (1386–1418) accepted the <b>suzerainty</b> of Poland in 1387 and that of Hungary in 1395, and Wallachia was paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417. When accepting Hungarian <b>suzerainty,</b> the princes of Wallachia usually also received the district of Făgăraş in Transylvania from the Hungarian monarchs, for example in 1366 King Louis I of Hungary (1342–1382) granted the region to Prince Vladislav I of Wallachia (1364–1377), with the title of duke, and Prince Mircea the Elder received it from King Sigismund (1387–1437).|$|E
5|$|A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought {{assistance}} from Stephen after his domains, which were {{situated in the}} regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops {{in the second half}} of 1263. Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria. The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria. Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his <b>suzerainty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Béla {{supported}} {{the development of}} towns. For instance, he confirmed the liberties {{of the citizens of}} Székesfehérvár and granted privileges to Hungarian and German settlers in Bars (Starý Tekov, Slovakia) in 1237. Zadar, a town in Dalmatia which had been lost to Venice in 1202, acknowledged Béla's <b>suzerainty</b> in 1240.|$|E
5|$|In fear of {{a crusade}} by Emeric, Ban Kulin of Bosnia held a synod of the Church of Bosnia at Bilino Polje on 6 April 1203. The synod {{acknowledged}} papal primacy and ordered the reform of the rites. Kulin also acknowledged Emeric's <b>suzerainty.</b> In a letter written in 1203, the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan informed Pope Innocent that Emeric had occupied five districts in Bulgaria, and Kaloyan demanded the Pope's intervention.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Azon is {{defeated}} and killed, and Pharnavaz becomes {{the king of}} Kartli {{at the age of}} 27. He is reported to have acknowledged the <b>suzerainty</b> of the Seleucids, the Hellenistic successors of Alexander in the Middle East, who are afforded by the Georgian chronicles the generic name of Antiochus.|$|E
5|$|King John I {{accepted}} Ottoman <b>suzerainty</b> in 1529, {{but in the}} Treaty of Nagyvárad of 1538 {{he conceded}} {{the right of the}} Habsburgs to succeed him after his death. At that point his voivodes, Stephen Majláth and Emeric Balassa, decided to separate Transylvania from the kingdom in order to save the province from an Ottoman invasion. Although other leading Transylvanian noblemen soon joined them, King John I overcame their rebellion in some weeks.|$|E
5|$|Kucha {{supported}} Karasahr {{when the}} oasis state made a marriage {{alliance with the}} Western Turks and ended its tributary relationship with the Tang court in 644. The king of Kucha, Suvarnadeva, renounced Tang <b>suzerainty</b> and allied with the Western Turks. Emperor Taizong responded by dispatching a military campaign led by the general Guo Xiaoke against Karasahr.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, after {{continued}} {{unrest in}} Crete, {{which included the}} murder of the British vice-consul, Prince George of Greece was made the Governor-General of Crete under the <b>suzerainty</b> of the Sultan, after the proposal was put forward by the Great Powers. Greece was effectively in day-to-day control of Crete {{for the first time in}} modern history.|$|E
5|$|Leo had {{meanwhile}} united the Armenian Church in Cilicia with Rome {{and acknowledged}} the <b>suzerainty</b> of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry VI. The emperor's envoy, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, was present when Leo was crowned the first king of Armenian Cilicia on 6January 1198. Before long, Conrad went to Antioch and persuaded Bohemond and his barons to swear {{an oath to}} accept Raymund-Roupen's right to inherit Antioch.|$|E
5|$|Levski's death {{intensified}} {{the crisis in}} the Bulgarian revolutionary movement and most IRO committees soon disintegrated. Nevertheless, five years after his hanging, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 secured the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule {{in the wake of the}} April Uprising of 1876. The Treaty of San Stefano of 3 March 1878 established the Bulgarian state as an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria under de jure Ottoman <b>suzerainty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuks were {{advancing}} towards al-Jazira, and {{the descendants}} of Qatada ibn Idris fought with their Ayyubid overlords over control of Mecca. The conflict between them was taken advantage of by the Rasulids of Yemen who attempted to end Ayyubid <b>suzerainty</b> in the Hejaz and bring the region under their control which they accomplished in 1238 when Nur al-Din Umar captured Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. Some {{believe it was}} a relationship of loose <b>suzerainty</b> that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1877, it {{was through}} Kogălniceanu's speech in Parliament that Romania {{acknowledged}} she was discarding Ottoman <b>suzerainty.</b> He was rewarded by Carol, {{becoming one of the}} first three statesmen received into the Order of the Star of Romania. The Minister also negotiated the terms under which the Romanian Land Forces were to join the war effort in Bulgaria, specifically demanding Russian reparations and indemnities.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman troops entered Wallachia in the summer, {{but they}} were {{defeated}} by Michael the Brave at Călugăreni and by the united armies of the three principalities at Giurgiu. In the meantime, however, the Poles had invaded Moldavia and replaced Ştefan Răzvan by Ieremia Movilă (15951606). In June 1598 Michael the Brave recognized the <b>suzerainty</b> of Emperor Rudolph II, who had promised to grant subsidies to him to finance his mercenaries.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Posada ended Hungarian <b>suzerainty</b> in Wallachia, and {{the first}} {{independent}} Romanian principality was consequently declared. Basarab's descendants ruled Wallachia {{for at least two}} centuries. The region of Bessarabia, situated between the rivers Dniester and Prut, was named for the Basarab dynasty, also Basarabi (Basarabov) a village in present day Bulgaria, close to Ruse.|$|E
5|$|The Northumbrian hegemony over Northern Britain, won by Ecgfrith's predecessors, {{had begun}} to disintegrate. Several of Northumbria's subject nations had rebelled in recent years, leading {{to a number of}} {{large-scale}} battles against the Picts, Mercians, and Irish, with varied success. Following sieges on neighbouring territories carried out by the Picts, Ecgfrith led his forces against them, despite advice to the contrary, in an effort to reassert his <b>suzerainty</b> over the Pictish nations.|$|E
5|$|The Styrian noblemen rose up in {{rebellion}} against Béla's governor Stephen Gutkeled and routed him in early 1258. Béla invaded Styria, restored his <b>suzerainty</b> and appointed his oldest son, Stephen, Duke of Styria. In 1259, Batu Khan's successor, Berke, proposed an alliance by offering to marry {{one of his}} daughters to a son of Béla, but he refused the Khan's offer.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks on}} the Southern Pictish Zone at Dunnottar and Dundurn {{represented}} {{a major threat to}} Ecgfrith's <b>suzerainty.</b> Ecgfrith was contending with other challenges to his overlordship. In June 684, countering a Gaelic-Briton alliance, he sent his armies, led by Berhtred, son of Beornhæth, to Brega in Ireland. Ecgfrith's force decimated the local population and destroyed many churches, actions which are treated with scorn by Bede.|$|E
5|$|The present {{shape of}} the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full {{independence}} from Venetian <b>suzerainty,</b> but the peak of its construction lasted {{from the beginning of}} the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century. Being constructed very solidly, the walls were generally unaffected by a strong earthquake occurring in 1667.|$|E
5|$|The {{succession}} to the throne, {{similarly to}} Wallachia, was {{governed by the}} hereditary-elective principle. Thus either a legitimate or an illegitimate member of the Muşatin family could be proclaimed prince by an assembly of the boyars. In 1387 Peter I Muşat recognized Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland as his suzerain, but Hungary also maintained its claim of <b>suzerainty</b> over the principality.|$|E
5|$|These events {{threatened}} Serbia, {{which had}} severed ties with Catholicism and {{was once again}} fully Orthodox. The marriage alliance between Vladislav and Ivan Asen II may {{be a result of}} the Hungarian threat to both of the rulers' countries. Some scholars have speculated that Vladislav accepted Bulgarian <b>suzerainty,</b> but this speculation has no evidence to support it, since no contemporary sources say that Vladislav recognized Asen as overlord of Serbia. However, Asen likely had the largest influence on the politics of Vladislav. Vladislav seems to have been left out of Orthodox alliance founded by Asen. Vladislav may have been afraid of close ties with Bulgaria, since his brother Radoslav's close ties with the Despotate of Epirus had caused dissatisfaction among the Serbian nobility. This shows that Vladislav was not too dependent upon Bulgaria, as he was not obliged to join the alliance; if he had recognized the <b>suzerainty</b> of Asen, he likely would have forced to join the alliance.|$|E
5|$|Under Theodosius I (15211522) the Ottoman {{governor}} of Nicopolis {{take advantage of}} the internal fights among the boyar parties, and thus dominated the political life of Wallachia. Due to the imminent danger of annexation, the boyars grouped around Radu V of Afumaţi (15221529) who fought about 20 battles against the Ottomans. Finally, he was, in 1525, forced to accept Ottoman <b>suzerainty</b> {{and the rise of the}} tribute.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned by Emperor Manuel, Stephen IV {{approached}} Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Around {{the same}} time, {{a group of}} Hungarian barons and prelates {{sent a letter to}} Emperor Frederick, stating that they were willing to accept his <b>suzerainty.</b> Stephen III also dispatched his envoys to Frederick, who decided not to intervene, but ordered his vassalsthe King of Bohemia, the Duke of Austria, and the Margrave of Styriato {{keep an eye on the}} political situation in Hungary. King Vladislaus' son, Sviatopluk, even married Stephen III's sister, Odola. The betrothal of Stephen III to an unnamed daughter of Yaroslav Osmomysl, Prince of Halych, was also arranged around this time.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the nearly}} {{contemporaneous}} chronicle of John of Küküllő, Louis launched his first campaign against {{a group of}} Transylvanian Saxons, who had refused to pay taxes, and forced them to yield {{in the summer of}} 1344. During his stay in Transylvania, Nicholas Alexanderwho was the son of Basarab, the ruling prince of Wallachiaswore loyalty to Louis on his father's behalf in Brassó (now Brașov in Romania); thus the <b>suzerainty</b> of the Hungarian monarchs over Wallachia was, at least outwardly, restored.|$|E
5|$|After some {{territorial}} disputes, {{war broke}} out between Stefan Nemanja, Grand prince of Raška, {{and the city of}} Dubrovnik, at that time under Norman <b>suzerainty.</b> In 1185, Nemanja attacked the city and laid siege to it, but a Ragusan counter-attack drove Nemanja's forces back. According to chronicles from Dubrovnik, which are accepted by most historians, the siege ultimately failed. How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while repelling the siege is also not known exactly.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to occupy the}} neighboring Principality of Halych. His son, Béla, persuaded a group of Cumans to accept AndrewII's <b>suzerainty</b> in 1228 and established a new march in Oltenia (known as the Banate of Szörény) in 1231. Béla IV succeeded his father in 1235. His attempt to reacquire crown lands alienated by his predecessors created a deep rift between the monarch and the lords just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across the Eurasian steppes.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the gradual}} {{disintegration}} of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 16thcentury, the last voivodes of Transylvania, who came from the Báthory family, ceased to be high-ranking officials. Instead they were the heads of state, although under Ottoman <b>suzerainty,</b> of a new principality emerging in the eastern territories of the kingdom. Accordingly, Stephen Báthory, the voivode elected by the Diet of the new realm, officially abandoned the title of voivode and adopted that of prince in 1576, upon his election as King of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's stepmother, Sybil, {{wanted to}} secure the {{succession}} of Antioch to her son, William. Leo, Lord of Armenian Cilicia exploited her ambitions. With her assistance, he captured and imprisoned Bohemond III in early 1194. Leo also forced Bohemond III to surrender Antioch to him, but the Latin and Greek burghers formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from seizing the town. The commune proclaimed Bohemond III's elder son, Raymond, regent. Bohemond hurried from Tripoli to Antioch {{at the head of}} his army to help his brother, compelling the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia. Leo released their father only after Bohemond III renounced his claim to <b>suzerainty</b> over Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|Béla was crowned king {{at least}} {{two months after the}} death of Stephen II, {{implying}} that his accession to the throne did not happen without opposition. Two violent purges were carried out among the partisans of his predecessors to strengthen Béla's rule. King Coloman's alleged son Boris tried to dethrone Béla but the king and his allies defeated the pretender's troops in 1132. In the second half of Béla's reign, Hungary adopted an active foreign policy. Bosnia and Split seem to have accepted Béla's <b>suzerainty</b> around 1136.|$|E
5|$|Following Samuel Aba's death, Emperor Henry entered Székesfehérvár and {{restored}} Peter. Peter introduced Bavarian law in his realm, {{which suggests that}} Hungary became an imperial fief. He accepted the Emperor's <b>suzerainty</b> on Whitsun 1045, giving his royal lance to his overlord (who returned to Hungary). A number of plots to overthrow Peter indicate that he remained unpopular. Two of King Stephen I's maternal cousins (Bolya and Bonyha) conspired against Peter in 1045, but the King had them arrested, tortured and executed. Bishop Gerard of Csanád invited Vazul's exiled sons to the country. An uprising by pagan commoners ended Peter's second rule in 1046.|$|E
5|$|From 1782 onwards, {{the city}} was {{reshaped}} with large-scale civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the seven islands into a single amalgamated mass. This project, known as Hornby Vellard, was completed by 1784. In 1817, the British East India Company under Mountstuart Elphinstone defeated Baji Rao II, {{the last of the}} Maratha Peshwa in the Battle of Khadki. Following his defeat, almost the whole of the Deccan came under British <b>suzerainty,</b> and was incorporated into the Bombay Presidency. The success of the British campaign in the Deccan marked the end of all attacks by native powers.|$|E
5|$|In 1203, Renoart of Nephin, Bohemond's vassal, married Isabel the heiress of Gibelcar, {{without his}} authorization. The High Court of Tripoli ordered the {{confiscation}} of Renoart's fiefs. However, {{he decided to}} resist and gained the support of Leo of Cilicia and Aimery, King of Cyprus and Jerusalem. Bohemond traveled to Acre in summer 1204 to meet Marie of Champagne. Her husband, Baldwin, had been recently crowned emperor in Constantinople. He did homage to her, acknowledging the <b>suzerainty</b> of the Latin Emperors over Antioch. Marie tried to mediate a reconciliation between Bohemond and Leo of Cilicia, but she died in August.|$|E
