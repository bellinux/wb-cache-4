40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the scoring system for the <b>Seating</b> <b>and</b> Mobility Script Concordance Test (SMSCT), obtain and {{appraise}} internal and external structure evidence, and assess the validity of the SMSCT. The SMSCT purpose is to provide a method for testing knowledge of <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> mobility prescription. A sample of 106 therapists and 15 spinal cord injury experts contributed to the development of the scoring system. Validity evidence was obtained using 15 <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> mobility experts, 10 orthopedic experts, and 66 therapists with varying levels of <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> mobility expertise. Proxy measures of clinical expertise were used for external validity evidence since no criterion measures exist. The SMSCT was found to differentiate between <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> mobility experts' and orthopedic experts' intervention subtest scores (p = 0. 04). The proxy measure of clinical expertise, <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> mobility hours/week, was found to predict SMSCT intervention scores (p = 0. 002). The internal structure of the SMSCT may include evidence of reduced item performance but satisfactory convergent and discriminate evidence by construct definition. Although the SMSCT may be a promising approach for measuring <b>seating</b> <b>and</b> mobility expertise, limitations exist in the corrected content. Future application of the SMSCT should only be used after further development of the tool occurs. Copyright © 2009 RESNA...|$|R
