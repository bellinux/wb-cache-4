5|$|The final lock was the <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> at Woodmill. There are {{no visible}} remains of it, {{although}} its location {{can still be}} seen. The mill was to the west, and now forms part of the Woodmill Outdoor Activities Centre, with the main building used as a canoe shop. The centre {{was set up in}} the late 1960s, and is a registered charity. The navigation officially continued downstream to a wharf at Northam, and although there was never a towpath on the tidal section, the Itchen Way long distance footpath follows the eastern bank of the river for most of the way. Nothing remains of Northam Quay, and the bridge has been rebuilt twice since the first construction of 1796, the last time in 1954. The river also passes under the A3035 Cobden Bridge, and a railway bridge built in 1866, with two sets of round iron columns supporting the structure over the main channel, which retains most of its original appearance and now forms part of the West Coastway Line.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a {{river is}} made entirely {{non-tidal}} by constructing a <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> {{directly into the}} estuary.|$|E
25|$|The small {{shipyard}} {{that had}} existed at Annery was moved {{down to the}} <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> when the canal was built.|$|E
50|$|The tidal Outer Harbour is {{only used}} for {{entrance}} to the marina through twin <b>sea</b> <b>locks,</b> which are operated 24 hours a day. It needs frequent dredging to keep the access channel from the <b>sea</b> to the <b>locks</b> open and deep enough for vessels. The local RNLI lifeboat has its own mooring there. The entrance is beside Martello Tower No.66.|$|R
50|$|Cage on the <b>Sea</b> (Distant <b>Seas,</b> <b>Locked</b> Room) is a 1998 novel, {{written by}} Japanese author Kaoru Ohno {{about a group}} of Japanese holdouts on the island of Anatahan in the Pacific Ocean. The Anatahan holdouts had also {{inspired}} a 1953 film, Anatahan.|$|R
40|$|The inner port of Zeebrugge is {{a genuine}} brackish-water-basin. The inlet of {{seawater}} and the drainage of fresh water by the purification plant for household effluents are determining for {{the character of the}} harbour water. Temperature at the surface fluctuates between 0 and 28. 2 °C. The salinity near Bruges fluctuates between 12. 7 and 30. 3 9 Cl/kg and near the <b>sea</b> <b>locks</b> at Zeebrugge between 25. 1 and 31. 1 9 Cl/kg. Pollution is problematic in the Boudewijnkanaal. The situation is however much better in the docks near the <b>sea</b> <b>locks,</b> the latter is reflected in the abundance of species. Several parameters are compared with the national quality standards for surface water and fishing water. During the period 1996, 1997 and 1998, a small yearly improvement is noticeable...|$|R
25|$|A <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> is {{one that}} connects a canal or river {{directly}} with an estuary or ocean. All sea locks are tidal.|$|E
25|$|Today the <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> {{is still}} in working order, and the canal is 'in water' {{as far as the}} base of the first {{inclined}} plane. The <b>sea</b> <b>lock,</b> though, is the only lock on this section still in working order, so that navigation is not possible along the whole network. Much of the upper section has been ploughed over or has become overgrown, but it is possible to see many remaining signs of the canal's presence, in bridges and wharf buildings. On the feeder branch and on {{the lower part of the}} Launceston main line the alignment is indicated on current Ordnance Survey maps. In most cases the alignment is not open to the public, however.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 major {{plans were}} {{approved}} to re-develop the canal, including {{renewal of the}} two locks between the <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> and the first inclined plane. £3.8 million in funding for this project {{was provided by the}} Heritage Lottery Fund, Objective One and the South West Regional Development Agency. The plan states that work will start in 2007 and finish in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Between 1930 and 1932, new <b>sea</b> <b>locks</b> {{were built}} at either end, making the canal {{accessible}} at any state of tide. The swing bridge at Ardrishaig was installed at this time. The canal became {{the responsibility of}} British Waterways in 1962. It closed for nine-week period in October 1987 to allow some refurbishment. On 2 July 2012 the British Waterways functions in Scotland were transferred to Scottish Canals.|$|R
50|$|Further locks {{were added}} {{throughout}} the route's history. These include a new Stickins Lock, Sandywarps Lock in a cut located {{close to the}} confluence of the Irwell and Mersey, Butchersfield Locks (located on a short cut known as the Butchersfield Canal), Woolston New (located at the upper end of Woolston New Cut), Paddington Lock (lower end of Woolston New Cut), Woolston Old Lock, Latchford, and Old Quay <b>Sea</b> <b>Locks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, the Government {{undertook}} {{a study to}} assess the feasibility of building a tidal barrage across half of the Wash. The idea was to capture the freshwater from the River Witham, River Welland, River Nene and Great Ouse to build a freshwater reservoir. [...] The study also intended to establish potential improvements to the navigation of <b>sea</b> <b>locks,</b> provide recreational facilities and develop an area of land for a power station.|$|R
25|$|There was {{initially}} no {{direct connection to}} the Aberdeen docks, which made transshipment difficult, {{and it was not}} until 1834 that a <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> was constructed, enabling boats to enter the docks at certain states of the tide. The work was funded by those who held mortgages agreeing to forgo their dividends for a period, and the total cost was around £1,500. The weather also created problems, with the canal normally being shut between December and March due to icing.|$|E
25|$|There were {{plans to}} make the final part of the river navigable again, {{as part of a}} scheme to create a {{non-tidal}} route from King's Lynn to the Great Ouse, which included a marina at Boal Quay and a <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> near the final sluice. It would have been part of a much larger regeneration project for the south of the town, and the river would have been linked to the Great Ouse Flood Relief Channel, which currently terminates at a sluice a little to the south of the A47 road. Various routes for the connecting link were considered, but the preferred route was to utilise the flood diversion channel, constructed in 2001. This would have been enlarged, and the two bridges, located on Thiefgate Lane and the bank of the Flood Relief Channel, would have been rebuilt to provide more headroom. However, the non-tidal link was eventually abandoned, as there were concerns over environmental issues, the channel was thought to be too narrow to accommodate boats travelling in opposite directions, and some of the bridges would not have provided sufficient headroom. The scheme was modified to include a lock {{from the end of the}} flood relief channel back into the Ouse, with the <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> and marina being retained. These plans have since been deferred, due to the change in the financial situation and the collapse of land values.|$|E
25|$|Rotating-sector gates. Some {{of these}} work very like {{traditional}} swinging gates, but with each gate {{in the form}} of a sector of a cylinder. They close by rotating out from the lock wall and meeting in the centre of the chamber. Water is let in or out by opening the gates slightly: there are no paddles or other lock gear. The lock at Limehouse Basin, which gives access to the River Thames, is an example. A dramatically large one can be seen at the Maeslantkering (huge flood gates) near Rotterdam. There is a different type at the <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> on the Ribble Link: this is a rising sector gate, which has a horizontal axis: the gate drops to the bed of the river to allow boats to pass.|$|E
5000|$|New canals {{were opened}} up in {{southern}} France {{as they were}} needed to expand the network of canals. In the 19th century a canal was built from Arles to Bouc, located on the Mediterranean <b>sea.</b> <b>Locks</b> and bridges were built, too, to manage water and road traffic. Just outside Arles, the first bridge was the officially titled [...] "Pont de Réginelle" [...] but better known by the keeper's name as [...] "Pont de Langlois".|$|R
50|$|Besides the Velsen Municipality Hall (Raadhuis van de gemeente Velsen), {{designed}} by the architect Willem Dudok as a centerpiece to his plan for a new IJmuiden, important sights in IJmuiden are the North <b>Sea</b> <b>locks.</b> The latter are among {{the largest in the}} world and one set is able to close off a shipping lane 50 metres (164 ft) wide and 12 metres (39 ft) deep. There are plans to enlarge or build a new set to facilitate passage for even larger vessels.|$|R
2500|$|A canal {{joining a}} river whose levels are always {{lower than the}} canal. All that is needed is an {{ordinary}} lock, with the gates pointing up the canal. The lock is used normally {{so long as the}} tide is high enough to float boats through the lower gates. If near low tide the lock becomes unusable, then the gates can be barred (and simply become a [...] "reverse flood gate", holding water in the canal). This arrangement also applies to some <b>sea</b> <b>locks</b> (e.g. Bude Canal).|$|R
25|$|Between 1818 and 1827, {{the canal}} {{collected}} tolls of £2,546 per year, and its reserves rose from £8,520 in 1800 to £28,000 in 1829. If the £57,000 of public {{money spent on}} its restoration was ignored, it made a modest profit. William Dawson introduced a private passenger service from Portadown to Newry in 1813, and although he was always asking for the tolls to be reduced, the service continued for many years. Although the Tyrone Navigation had finally opened in 1787, this {{did not result in}} coal traffic using the canal. The importance of Newry as a port declined as Belfast became more prominent, and the ship canal could not cope with the increasing size of ships as sail was replaced by steam. Various engineers were consulted, including John Brownrigg, Sir John Rennie and Alexander Nimmo. All suggested that a larger <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> was required in deeper water, and that the ship canal needed to be enlarged.|$|E
25|$|After another {{crossing}} {{under the}} railway, the river skirts {{the eastern edge}} of Bramford and circles a hill, on top of which is Sproughton Manor, a grade II listed house built for Col Henry Phillipps in 1863 by the architect William Eden Nesfield. Sproughton Lock and mill are {{at the bottom of the}} hill. The mill is built in red brick and dates from the late eighteenth century. The mill race passes below the mill, which was operational until 1947, but all the machinery has been removed. Parts of the adjacent mill house date from around 1600. After passing under the A14 road, the river briefly heads north-east, through Chantry Cut, where Chantry Lock is situated, to pass under the railway. There are two bridges, as the railway line forks on the south side of the river. A flood barrier has been installed below the first bridge. Now passing through Ipswich, the river also forks, with the eastern branch being the River Gipping, and the western branch forming the start of the River Orwell. A modern sluice is located on the Orwell just below the junction. A final weir marks the position of Handford <b>Sea</b> <b>Lock,</b> below which the two channels rejoin. An outfall is situated below the junction, beyond which the river is tidal.|$|E
500|$|Passing through Spalding, {{where most}} of the flow is {{diverted}} through the Coronation channel, the town is protected by Marsh Road sluice and a <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> to the east. Below the town, it is approached by Vernatt's Drain, which runs parallel to the river carrying water pumped from Deeping Fen, and is crossed by the A16 road bridge. Nearby is Pinchbeck Marsh Pumping Station, which houses the last beam engine and scoop wheel {{to be used in the}} Fens for land drainage. It was built in 1833, and ran until 1952, when it was replaced by electric pumps. It now forms part of a museum of land drainage run by the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, in partnership with South Holland District Council. Vernatt's Drain passes through a sluice to join the river, while the sluice that protects the entrance to the River Glen is navigable, to allow boats to reach Tongue End, some [...] upstream from its mouth. There are pumping stations for Sea Dike and Lords Drain, and the outfalls of the Risegate Eau and Five Towns drainage channels before the final bridge at Fosdyke is reached. After it is joined by the Holbeach River, it is bordered by salt marshes, and finally flows into The Wash at The Cots in Fosdyke Wash.|$|E
50|$|Cardiff Harbour Authority {{today has}} a number of {{statutory}} duties, including traffic control, security, navigational safety (including buoys, beacons, bridge lights and channel surveys), conservation (including dredging, maintaining river banks and the wetland wildlife reserve), encouraging both commercial and leisure uses of the bay, and protecting its environment. The CHA is responsible for the operation of the three <b>sea</b> <b>locks,</b> the five sluices that maintain the water level in the bay and the fish pass that allows migratory Salmon and Sea Trout to return to the rivers to spawn.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 Berendrecht, Zandvliet and Lillo were {{incorporated}} in Antwerp and the polder landscape largely expropriated for harbour development. Since the decentralisation of 2000 these three old communities were joined {{under the name}} of Bezali, an acronym used by the media. The people of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo on the other hand were proud of the original names and used them in the hope {{that they would not be}} forgotten. The name Zandvliet became a household name, thanks to the 1967 naming of Zandvlietsluis, one of the largest <b>sea</b> <b>locks</b> in the world.|$|R
5000|$|Lying {{close to}} the right bank of the River Yser, the town {{suffered}} extensive flooding when, on 21 October 1914, the <b>sea</b> <b>locks</b> {{at the mouth of}} this river were opened as a defensive measure against the advancing German Army during the [...] "Race to the Sea" [...] phase of World War I. The operation was successful in halting the advance, with the result, however, that Keiem was to occupy the front line of the war for the next four years. By the end of the conflict, apart from three damaged houses which still stood, the town had been completely flattened.|$|R
2500|$|A {{tidal lock}} is {{generally}} any lock that connects tidal with non-tidal water. This includes a lock between a tidal {{river and the}} non-tidal reaches, or between a tidal river and a canal, or a <b>sea</b> <b>lock.</b> However, the term usually refers specifically to a lock whose method of operation {{is affected by the}} state of the tide. Examples: ...|$|E
2500|$|The towpath {{from the}} <b>Sea</b> <b>Lock</b> is navigable via powered {{wheelchair}} or a mobility carriage (with reasonable ground clearance) {{all the way}} to where the A39 crosses over it by Helebridge (approx [...] ), allowing less mobile users to enjoy the views of the surrounding countryside and wild life. [...] This will also improve when the new tow path extension is completed underneath the A39.|$|E
2500|$|Moneypenny's Lock (No. 14), {{which was}} named after the lock-keepers who lived there for over 80 years, has been {{restored}} by Craigavon Borough Council. Banbridge District Council maintain a small museum at Scarva, and the ship canal and <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> have been restored by Newry and Mourne District Council. It now provides access for leisure craft visiting Newry. It is suitable for boats up to [...] by [...] with a draught of up to [...] Victoria Lock, where the ship canal joins the sea, is tidal, and was automated in May 2007.|$|E
50|$|The berths were {{accessed}} {{from the}} river via <b>sea</b> <b>locks</b> with a maximum size of 180 by 31 ft. From 1844 the docks had a Steam powered, cable-towed puddled iron Drag-Dredger, Bertha, {{similar to the one}} Brunel had designed for Bristol Harbour. Now preserved at the World of Boats in Eyemouth, she is undergoing restoration {{at the head of the}} Old Harbour. The dock area contained flour mills, timber yards and chandlers. The docks opened on 25 March 1841, with volumes resultantly reaching a peak between 1880 and 1885; with an average of 3,600 ships per year entering the port. Peak tonnage occurred in 1857, with 142 vessels totalling 17800 tonne LT.|$|R
500|$|At its north-west end, the Basin is {{connected}} to No.1 dock by an [...] wide passage with another pair of wrought iron lock gates, so that when required, the Basin {{can act as a}} lock, with the water level adjusted according to the rising tide, so wide-beamed vessels can leave the basin before high water and can enter the basin after high water. In its twilight years of vessel movements, the Basin <b>sea</b> <b>locks</b> were only used for vessels of 'above normal' beam as unlike the Lady Windsor lock width of 65 feet, and opened on 4th January 1898, {{to the west of the}} Basin, the Basin entrance was 80 feet wide as was its north-west lock channel to & from No.1 dock.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} that some types of barrage could be used for transport links between southern England and southern Wales, and more specifically the areas around Weston super Mare and Cardiff but no demand surveys have been carried out to show whether such a link would be useful to commuters or businesses. The east-west position of any future barrage will impact the utility of any transport links across it. Various proposals include a dual carriageway road giving a further crossing in addition to the Second Severn Crossing and the Severn Bridge. The road would have to be taken over the <b>sea</b> <b>locks</b> on a bridge at a height of the Bridge of the Americas (i.e. with a clearance of 61.3 m) if the locks are Panamax-sized.|$|R
2500|$|In 1829, the {{government}} agreed to transfer both the ship canal and the Newry Canal {{to a private}} company, whose chairman was the Marquess of Downshire. The Directors General objected, as {{they had not been}} consulted, and felt that it was wrong to transfer an undertaking that had been built using public money to a private company. However, the company agreed to spend £80,000 on improvements over the following twenty years, and kept their word. By 1850, a new <b>sea</b> <b>lock</b> had been built, some [...] further down the estuary, which doubled the size of ships that could use it. The river had been dredged, and the Albert Basin had been constructed at Newry. The Newry Canal also benefitted, with receipts rising to £3,500 per year, resulting from the tonnage carried doubling to over 100,000 tons per year.|$|E
