Barnsby offers Running River his son {{in return for the}} medallion, and Running River agrees. Assuming William and Marisa are dead, Ray and Thomas attempt to rescue Seeing Farther, but Barnsby mortally wounds him. Dying, he <b>says</b> <b>William</b> and Marisa are still alive, and are being held captive by Mendoza in his alcázar. The brothers leave Running River to kill Barnsby, as they head to rescue William and Marisa. Speaking to his dead son, Running River renounces of his life of violence and hatred, stating that from now on, he shall live a life of peace, and be known as Calm Water.|$|E

2500|$|Certain naturopathic {{treatments}} {{offered by}} naturopaths, such as homeopathy, rolfing, and iridology, are widely considered pseudoscience or quackery. Stephen Barrett of QuackWatch and the National Council Against Health Fraud {{has stated that}} naturopathy is [...] "simplistic and that its practices are riddled with quackery". [...] "Non-scientific health care practitioners, including naturopaths, use unscientific methods and deception on a public who, lacking in-depth health care knowledge, must rely upon the assurance of providers. Quackery not only harms people, it undermines the ability to conduct scientific research and should be opposed by scientists", <b>says</b> <b>William</b> T. Jarvis.|$|E

2500|$|Fechner's general {{formula for}} getting {{at the number}} of units in any {{sensation}} is S =clogR, where S stands for the sensation, R for the stimulus numerically estimated, and c for a constant that must be separately determined by experiment in each particular order of sensibility. Fechner's reasoning has been criticized on the grounds that although stimuli are composite, sensations are not. [...] "Every sensation," [...] <b>says</b> <b>William</b> James, [...] "presents itself as an indivisible unit; and it is quite impossible to read any clear meaning into the notion that they are masses of units combined." ...|$|E

[...] <b>says</b> <b>William.</b> They could then say nothing to that. [...] "Then," [...] <b>says</b> <b>William,</b> [...] "if I mistake not, your business is money; now, I desire to know, if you conquer and kill two or three thousand of these poor creatures, they have no money, pray what will you get? They are poor naked wretches; what shall you gain by them?

Pray, what gain is in it? and what account can you give the captain for his lost men?" [...] In short, William argued so effectually, that he convinced them that it was mere murder to do so; and that the men {{had a right to}} their own, and that they had no right to take them away; that it was destroying innocent men, who had acted no otherwise than as the laws of nature dictated; {{and that it would be}} as much murder to do so, as to meet a man on the highway, and kill him, for the mere sake of it, in cold blood, not regarding whether he had done any wrong to us or no.|$|E

He compares this to [...] "the great tradition" [...] for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as Roy Rogers and The Lone Ranger. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc <b>says</b> <b>Williams</b> also composed a [...] "youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around when the kids are sailing or going out to sea.

6000|$|...

500|$|The central {{argument}} in the letter is that the British have negated {{the rights of the}} Irish people by relying on a completely British system to pass the patent without allowing the Irish Parliament a <b>say.</b> <b>William</b> Wood, according to the Drapier, was already involved in a similar dispute with a coin he minted for Massachusetts.
