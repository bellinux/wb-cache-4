50|$|There are {{alternatives}} to traditional types of DFB lasers. Traditionally, DFBs are antireflection coated {{on one side}} of the cavity and coated for high reflectivity on the other side (AR/HR). In this case the grating forms the distributed mirror on the antireflection coated side, while the semiconductor facet on the high reflectivity side forms the other mirror. These lasers generally have higher output power since the light is taken from the AR side, and the HR side prevents power being lost from the back side. Unfortunately, during the manufacturing of the laser and the cleaving of the facets, it is virtually impossible to control at which point in the grating the laser cleaves to form the facet. So sometimes the laser HR facet forms at the crest of the grating, sometimes on the slope. Depending on the phase of the grating and the optical mode, the laser output spectrum can vary. Frequently, the phase of the highly reflective side occurs at a point where two longitudinal modes have the same cavity gain, and thus the laser operates at two modes simultaneously. Thus such AR/HR lasers have to be screened at manufacturing and parts that are multimode or have poor <b>side</b> <b>mode</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> (SMSR) have to be scrapped. Additionally, the phase of the cleave affects the wavelength, and thus controlling the output wavelength of a batch of lasers in manufacturing can be a challenge.|$|E
50|$|In {{fiber optics}} and telecommunications, an index-matching {{material}} {{may be used}} in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: Optical fiber connector). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as <b>Side</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Suppression</b> <b>Ratio,</b> potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) are {{unipolar}} lasers {{based on}} intersubband transitions that have emission wavelengths in the mid- to far-infrared. Mid-infrared QCLs have recently reached {{a high level}} of technological maturity with watt level continuous wave output powers being demonstrated at room temperature. However, the performance of these conventional QCLs falls away very rapidly below - 4 urn where a number of important applications exist. This thesis details the design, fabrication and characterisation of high performance 'short wavelength' QCLs that operate in the 3 - 4 urn region. The high conduction band offset of the InGaAs/ AIAsSb material system and its compatibility with InP based waveguides and fabrication technology has made it the most attractive solution to achieving high performance QCLs in the 3 - 4 urn region. This thesis covers the development of InGaAs/AIAsSb based QCLs and covers the demonstration of a number of record high output powers and maximum operating temperatures. Watt level peak powers at room temperature and operation up to at least 400 K have been achieved across the - 3. 3 - 3. 7 urn range. These high performance InGaAs/ AIAsSb lasers are well suited for the realization of single-mode devices {{that can be used to}} create compact, ultra-sensitive trace-gas sensors based on absorption spectroscopy.
