50|$|In a {{consolidated}} {{drained test}} {{the sample is}} consolidated and sheared in compression slowly to allow pore pressures built up by the shearing to dissipate. The rate of axial deformation is kept constant, i.e., is <b>strain</b> <b>controlled.</b> The {{idea is that the}} test allows the sample and the pore pressures to fully consolidate (i.e., adjust) to the surrounding stresses. The test may {{take a long time to}} allow the sample to adjust, in particular low permeability samples need a long time to drain and adjust strain to stress levels.|$|E
40|$|Cell tensile {{technique}} {{is an important}} and widely used tool in cell mechanical research. However, the <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> condition in traditional tensile experiments is not satisfied and would result in big errors. These strain errors will seriously impact the experimental accuracy and decrease the reliability and comparability of experimental results. In order to achieve the accurate <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> of the membrane during stretching, a strain feedback compensation method based on the digital image correlation is proposed in this paper. To evaluate {{the effect of the}} proposed compensation method, a series of stretching experiments in different strains ranging from 5 % to 20 % were performed. The results showed that our proposed method significantly decreased the errors of <b>strain</b> <b>control.</b> These results indicate that the strain feedback compensation method is very effective in <b>controlling</b> <b>strain</b> and can greatly improve the experimental accuracy...|$|R
50|$|Analyzers {{are made}} for both stress (force) and <b>strain</b> (displacement) <b>control.</b> In <b>strain</b> <b>control,</b> the probe is {{displaced}} and the resulting stress of the sample is measured by implementing a force balance transducer, which utilizes different shafts. The advantages of <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> include a better short time response for materials of low viscosity and experiments of stress relaxation are done with relative ease. In stress control, a set {{force is applied to}} the same and several other experimental conditions (temperature, frequency, or time) can be varied. Stress control is typically less expensive than <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> because only one shaft is needed, but this also makes it harder to use. Some advantages of stress control include the fact that the structure of the sample is less likely to be destroyed and longer relaxation times/ longer creep studies can be done with much more ease. Characterizing low viscous materials come at a disadvantage of short time responses that are limited by inertia. Stress and <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> analyzers give about the same results as long as characterization is within the linear region of the polymer in question. However, stress control lends a more realistic response because polymers have a tendency to resist a load.|$|R
40|$|In shape-memory polymers, large strain can {{be fixed}} at a low {{temperature}} and thereafter recovered at a high temperature. If the shape-memory polymer is held at a high temperature for a long time, the irrecoverable strain can attain a new intermediate shape between the shape under the maximum stress and the primary shape. Irrecoverable <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> {{can be applied to}} the fabrication of a shape-memory polymer element with a complex shape in a simple method. In the present study, the influence of the strain-holding conditions on the shape recovery and the irrecoverable <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> in polyurethane shape-memory polymer is investigated by tension test of a film and three-point bending test of a sheet. The higher the shape-holding temperature and the longer the shape-holding time, the higher the irrecoverable strain rate. The equation that expresses the characteristics of the irrecoverable <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> is formulated...|$|R
5000|$|The {{probe of}} the pressuremeter is {{inserted}} into the borehole and is supported at test depth. [...] The probe is an inflatable flexible membrane which applies even pressure to {{the walls of the}} borehole as it expands. As the pressure increases and the membrane expands, the walls of the borehole begin to deform. The pressure inside the probe is held constant for a specific period of time and the increase in volume required to maintain the pressure is recorded. There are two types of tests that can be performed with the pressuremeter. The stress controlled test increases pressure in equal increments while the <b>strain</b> <b>controlled</b> test increases the volume in equal increments.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of Miner's rule using a loading issued from a mock-up of a RHR system (removal heat system) of PWR plant, made of 304 steel gives {{a very important}} non-conservative fatigue life in <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> when <b>strain</b> fatigue curve is used. This result {{is due to the}} absence of sequence effect in Miner's rule. Many non linear damage accumulation models have been proposed to get a sequence effect. Shortcomings of some non linear damage accumulation models are discussed. So Smith-Watson-Topper and Fatemi-Socie criterions with a linear damage accumulation rule are then applied to experimental data. A major issue is the need for an elastic-plastic constitutive law which is difficult to propose in the presence of high cycle secondary hardening observed in austenitic stainless steels. A conservative model for fatigue damage accumulation under variable amplitude loading is then proposed for austenitic stainless steels in <b>strain</b> <b>control,</b> which does not need a constitutive law, but takes into account plasticity through cyclic strain stress curve. The model uses a linear damage accumulation rule. This model is {{based on the fact that}} for stainless steels, pre-hardening is detrimental for fatigue life in <b>strain</b> <b>control,</b> while it is beneficial in stress control. In the presence of low mean stress, the model is approved based on a large number of tests. Moreover the model allows to explain the larger detrimental effect of a tension mean stress in <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> tests than in stress control tests...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{low cycle}} fatigue {{performance}} of the nickel based superalloy RR 1000 was investigated {{under a variety of}} load waveforms at high temperature, employing a double edge notch geometry under load control. Experiments on a plain cylindrical specimen design under <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> were later performed to simulate the constrained conditions {{at the root of the}} notch in order to characterise the interaction between surface constituents and the environment. A significant fatigue debit was demonstrated under both load/strain scenarios when superimposing a dwell period at the minimum point of the cycle. This debit was attributed to a reduction in fatigue crack initiation life resulting from oxidation damage which subsequently cracks under cyclic tension together with a modification to the mean stress through cyclic stabilisation. The same dwell period superimposed at the peak of the cycle was essentially benign for excursions under <b>strain</b> <b>control</b> loading...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus is}} on the lower temperature, {{uncoated}} and notched features of gas turbine blades. Constitutive and fatigue life prediction models applicable to these regions are being developed. Fatigue results are presented which were obtained thus far. Fatigue tests are being conducted on PWA 1480 single crystal material using smooth <b>strain</b> <b>controlled</b> specimens and three different notched specimens. Isothermal fatigue tests were conducted at 1200, 1400, and 1600 F. The bulk of the tests were conducted at 1200 F. The <b>strain</b> <b>controlled</b> tests were conducted at 0. 4 percent per second strain rate and the notched tests were cycled at 1. 0 cycle per second. A clear orientation dependence is observed in the smooth <b>strain</b> <b>controlled</b> fatigue results. The fatigue lifes of the thin, mild notched specimens agree fairly well with this smooth data when elastic stress range is used as a correlating parameter. Finite element analyses were used to calculate notch stresses. Fatigue testing will continue to further explore the trends observed thus far. Constitutive and life prediction models are being developed...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{discusses}} {{evaluation of}} material dependence of multiaxial {{low cycle fatigue}} (LCF) to develop a suitable strain parameter for life estimation under non-proportional loading.

40|$|A new low-cycle {{multiaxial fatigue}} {{criterion}} {{based on the}} concept of effective strain is proposed. The effective shear strain y(eff) is derived by averaging shear strains acting on all planes at a material point during a loading cycle. The criterion, {{in the form of a}} generalised Smith-Watson-Topper expression, can take into account of the effect of non-symmetrical loading cycles. The advantage of the proposed criterion relies on the minimum number of material parameters to be identified. The uniaxial stress-strain curve, the basic strain-life curve (Manson-Coffin) and an additional experiment curve obtained from zero to tension <b>strain</b> <b>controlled</b> axial fatigue tests are sufficient to apply the proposed criterion in all loading conditions. Different sets of proportional and non-proportional multiaxial <b>strain</b> <b>controlled</b> low-cycle fatigue test results have been compared with the predicted life, showing in all cases a good agreeement with the criterion...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of laboratory investigation carried out on Ahmedabad sand on the liquefaction and pore water pressure generation during <b>strain</b> <b>controled</b> cyclic loading. Laboratory experiments were carried out on representative natural sand samples (base sand) collected from earthquake-affected area of Ahmedabad City of Gujarat State in India. A series of <b>strain</b> <b>controled</b> cyclic triaxial tests were carried out on isotropically compressed samples to study the influence of different parameters such as shear strain amplitude, initial effective confining pressure, relative density and percentage of non-plastic fines on the behavior of liquefaction and pore water pressure generation.

In addition, an empirical relationship between pore pressure ratio and cycle ratio independent of the number of cycles of loading, relative density, confining pressure, amplitude of shear strain and non-plastic fines has been proposed...|$|R
