40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} qubit channels for which three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> always sufficient to achieve the Holevo capacity.

Here a systematic theory is given which provides criteria to distinguish cases where two <b>states</b> <b>are</b> sufficient, and determine whether these two <b>states</b> should <b>be</b> orthogonal or non-orthogonal. In addition, we prove a theorem on the form of the optimal ensemble when three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> required, and present efficient methods of calculating the Holevo capacity.
