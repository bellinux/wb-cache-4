In a 1984 oral history interview, he recalled the process: [...] "he difficulty is {{in such a short}} melody, I have to put in all the words.... t must be very simple, understandable for all the races in Singapore.... I consult also [...] an author in Malay language <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it in proper Malay language but not too deep and not too difficult."

500|$|Age of Empires IIIs {{multiplayer}} was {{the first}} in the series to be integrated into the game interface and was highly lauded, as was the Home City concept. The topic of multiplayer was touched by GameZone, who said [...] "this game demands multiplayer mode, and Ensemble Studios provided this for the players," [...] while at 1UP, the reviewer commented similarly, stating, [...] "Multiplayer support has been significantly upgraded with a slick interface, support for clans {{and a number of other}} useful features." [...] GameSpy commented on the Home City as well, saying, [...] "the 'home city' system creates long-term depth and strategy." [...] EuroGamer, however, stated: [...] "Stop with the gifts!...You do not need to let me flick to a home city screen every few minutes <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> select a free unit or resource windfall.

His song [...] "Sí, He Cantado Mal" [...] (Yes, I Have Sung Badly) from No Es lo Mismo references this, with Sanz saying [...] "I'm laughing a little at myself <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> laugh at other things. Sometimes, I'm harder on myself than any music critic can be. I'm laughing at that." [...] Throughout his youth, Sanz was heavily influenced by English-language heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden and Dio, referring to himself as a [...] "heavy metal radical". He also feels that living in the city of Cadiz had a major impact on his musical style, where [...] "Any 7-year-old kid you find knows how to play guitar, play the cajón, knows how to sing. When the family comes together we start to sing. In a way it's not just music, it's culture." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 21 years old, Zamzam Mohamed Farah was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Prior to the competition, Farah spoke of her and Mohamed's training which involved running through manned militia road blocks who occasionally mistaken them for suicide bombers and threatened to shoot them. Despite this, {{she said that she}} was [...] "very much excited" [...] to compete at the Games: “I hope I will win, inshah’Allah [...] That is what I am expected to do, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> change the narrative of Somalia.” Farah competed in the first heat of the women's 400 metre discipline on 3 August, finishing seventh and last of all runners, with a time of one minute and 20.48 seconds. She finished behind Geisa Coutinho of Brazil (53.43 seconds) and Kazakhstan's Marina Maslyonko (53.66 seconds) in a heat led by Francena McCorory of the United States (50.78 seconds). Farah finished 45th (and last) out of all runners overall, and was unable to advance into the semi-finals after finishing 28.39 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in her heat who made the later stages. After the event she was appaulded by the crowd and said: [...] "It was great to be here to participate in the Olympic Games and tell people Somalia is still here." ...|$|E

After saying he had lived alone for centuries in that cave, he told the peasant: [...] "Give me your hand, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see how strong are men today". The shepherd, scared, gave him the horn of the cow, which, when seized by the giant man, was immediately broken.

2500|$|While Italy {{declared}} war on France and Britain on 10 June, it was not prepared for war and made little impact {{during the last two}} weeks of fighting in the Italian invasion of France.

Doing just three minutes of prayer and a minimum of five minutes {{meditation}} twice a day sets the tone—like an arrow so that you're hitting your target. When I pray I always thank Mother Nature for all the beauty in the world; it's about having an attitude of gratitude. And then I pray to Christ to say, 'Thank you for this day and {{my family and my}} health,' and now that I'm older I've added, 'Please illuminate me. Please open my heart chakra.

Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> come home by and by and live with you.
