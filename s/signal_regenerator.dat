40|$|As {{data rates}} in {{broadband}} optical networks continue to grow, all optical signal processing technologies {{are expected to}} become important for future high bit-rate communication systems to address the growing demand for network flexibility, low cost and high bandwidth. Along {{the line of the}} capacity increased, many new modulation formats have been introduced. The most straightforward format is on-off-keying (OOK) modulation format. The state of art reveals that the differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) modulation format is the best candidate for high-speed long haul network segment, while OOK is suitable for short reach network segment. However, the next generation transmission systems will more likely employ mixed modulation formats. Thus, the shift towards these changes to be applied in many applications is necessary. Hence, it is worth investigating several signal processing, not only by using a single modulation format but also mixed modulation formats. In order to realize such systems, the scheme requirement must be transparent to modulation format and bit-rate. One of the promising candidates is based on the third-order nonlinear susceptibility x(3) in a nonlinear fiber, which is also called four-wave mixing (FWM). Fiber-based FWM, in a highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) is a preferable choice due to its fast nonlinear response and high conversion efficiency. FWM technique can be also be used as an all-optical AND logic gates and <b>signal</b> <b>regenerator.</b> In optical fiber communication systems, signal distortions due to chromatic dispersion in fiber dominantly limit transmission length and bit-rate. An improvement in the distorted signal is crucially needed, as the processed signal will become more degraded after some distance of transmission. Optical phase conjugation (OPC) and tunable dispersion compensation modulator (TDCM) are two attractive schemes used to increase the signal robustness in transmission systems. It is also desirable if a practical function such as flexible picosecond width-tunability can be accomplished. The advantageous of flexible converted pulse width are for the creation of higher bit-rate signals and the ability to support wider bandwidth requirements. In this thesis, the experimental demonstration using compressed RZ clock from Raman adiabatic-soliton compressor (RASC) and continuous wave (CW) signal as a pump signals in all-optical fiber-based FWM AND-gate using singleand mixed OOK-DPSK modulation formats in many applications can be realised. The applications including: all-optical nonreturn-to-zero(NRZ) -to-return-to-zero(RZ) wavelength-waveform conversions, all optical wave-length multicasting, all channel OTDM demultiplexing, and transmission performance between the midspan of OPC and TDCM. We experimentally demonstrated an all-optical NRZ-DPSK-to-RZ-DPSK waveform-wavelength conversion with flexible picosecond width-tunability and signal regeneration with reshaping functionality. The scheme is based on a RASC and a fiber-based AND-gate. In the first demonstration, we demonstrate waveform-wavelength conversion of a 10 -Gb/s DPSK signal without input signal degradation over wide input-output wavelength ranges. The measurement results of the converted RZ-DPSK signal are pedestal-free, and its converted pulse width can be adjusted by tuning the Raman pump power in RASC. Further investigation of the regenerative properties due to chromatic dispersion is conducted at several Raman pump power settings over 40 -km standard single-mode fibers (SSMFs) without dispersion compensation. Also, low power penalty with an error-free operation is obtained for the RZ-DPSK regenerated converted signal. Next, an all-optical 1 -to- 6 wavelength multicasting of a 10 -Gb/s picosecond-tunable-width converted OOK data signal using a parametric pulse source from a RASC is experimentally demonstrated. Width-tunable wavelength multicasting within the C-band with approximately 40. 6 -nm of separation with various compressed RZ data signal inputs has been proposed and demonstrated. The converted multicast pulse widths can be flexibly controlled down by tuning the Raman pump powers of the RASC. Nearly equal pulse widths at all multicast wavelengths are obtained. Furthermore, wide open eye patterns and low power penalties at the 10 ?? 9 BER level are found. An all-optical demultiplexing of 40 -Gb/s hybrid OTDM mixed format channels by using RASC-flexible control-window is also demonstrated. Error-free operations with less than 1. 3 -dB power penalties were obtained and this scheme is expected to be scalable toward higher bit-rates. Further demonstration related to NRZ-to-RZ waveform-wavelength conversion for 4 x 10 -Gb/s multichannel mixed OOK-DPSK data formats, deploying a single FWM and RASC has been done. The fiber-based switch in HNLF based on parametric process between mixed data signals and the compressed RZ clock from RASC. By flexibly tuning the Raman pump power from RASC in between 0. 20 and 0. 90 W, high quality converted signal can be achieved. Bit-error-rate measurements show negative power penalties for the obtained RZ signals with pedestal-free pulses. Finally, we demonstrated the transmission performance between the midspan of TDCM and OPC schemes with specialty using multichannel-mixed OOK and DPSK format. The OPC scheme has the advantage over the penalties performance compared to TDCM scheme. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E

40|$|Physical layer {{impairments}} severely {{limit the}} reach and capacity of optical systems, thereby hampering {{the deployment of}} transparent optical networks (i. e., no electrical <b>signal</b> <b>regenerators</b> are required). Besides, the high cost and power-consumption of regeneration devices makes it unaffordable for network operators to consider the opaque architecture (i. e., regeneration is available at every network node). In this context, translucent architectures (i. e., regeneration is only available at selected nodes) have emerged as the most promising short term solution to decrease costs and energy consumption in optical backbone networks. Concurrently, the coarse granularity and inflexibility of legacy optical technologies have re-fostered great interest in sub-wavelength switching optical networks, which introduce optical switching in the time domain so as to further improve resources utilization. In these networks, the complex regenerator placement and dimensioning problem emerges. In short, this problem aims at minimizing the number of electrical regenerators deployed in the network. To tackle it, in this paper both a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure and a biased random-key genetic algorithm are developed. Further, we enhance their performance by introducing both path-relinking and variable neighborhood descent as effective intensification procedures. The resulting hybridizations are compared among each other as well as against results from optimal and heuristic mixed integer linear programming formulations. Illustrative results over {{a broad range of}} network scenarios show that the biased random-key genetic algorithm working in conjunction with these two intensification mechanisms represents a compelling network planning algorithm for the design of future sub-wavelength optical networks.

40|$|Abstract—Optical <b>signal</b> <b>regenerators</b> (3 R) are {{required}} to overcome the adverse effect of fiber and other transmission impairments. 3 R units may be placed either at every node (full placement) or at some selected nodes (sparse palcement) of the optical network. It has been argued [1] that while the latter placement strategy may not be optimal {{in terms of the}} total number of 3 R units required to support a given set of static traffic demands, it offers a number of practical advantages over the former, e. g., a contained complexity of network management in terms of signaling overhead. In this paper the full and sparse placement strategies are compared in a dynamic optical network, whereby lightpaths are set up and torn down to best fit the offered changing demands. The study shows that the blocking probability due to the lack of available 3 R units achieved by the sparse placement strategy may be comparable to the one achieved by the full placement strategy. Surprisingly, it may even be lower in some cases, thus providing an additional motivation in favor of the sparse placement strategy. The study also shows that the algorithm used to choose the nodes where to place the 3 R units must be designed carefully. Two placement algorithms are compared, reporting differences in signaling overhead level as high as 6 times (when achieving a desired level of lightpath connectivity) and differences in blocking probabilities as high as two orders of magnitude (when using the same level of signaling overhead) ...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Increase {{in the number}} of users and {{resources}} consumed by modern applications results in an explosive growth in the traffic on the Internet. Optical networks with higher bandwidths offer faster and more reliable transmission of data and allows transmission of more data. Fiber optical cables have these advantages over the traditional copper wires. So it is expected that optical networks will have a wide application area. However, there are some physical impairments and optical layer constraints in optical networks. One of these is signal degradation which limits the range of optical signals. Signals are degraded during transmission and below a threshold the signals become useless. In order to prevent this, regenerators which are capable of re-amplifying optical signals are used. Since regeneration is a costly process, it is important to decrease the number of regenerators used in an optical network. To increase the reliability of the network, two edge-disjoint paths between each terminal on the network are to be constructed. So the second path could be used in case of a failure in transmitting data on an edge of the first path. Considering these requirements, selecting the nodes on which regenerators are to be placed is an important decision. In this thesis, we discuss the problem of placing <b>signal</b> <b>regenerators</b> on optical networks with restoration. An integer linear program is formulated for this problem. Due to the huge size and other problems of the formulation, it is impractical to use it on large networks. For this reason, a fast heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Three methods are proposed to check the feasibility when a fixed set of regenerators are placed on specific nodes. Additionally, a branch and bound algorithm which employs the proposed heuristic is developed to find the optimal solution of our problem. Performance of both the heuristics and the branch and bound method are evaluated in terms of number of regenerators placed and solution times of the algorithms. Özkök, OnurM. S...|$|R

The first such problem is the Regeneration Location Problem (), where the goal is to place the regenerators so as to minimize the total number of nodes containing them. We consider two extreme cases of online regarding the value of d and the number k of regenerators {{that can be used in}} any single node. (1) d is arbitrary and k unbounded.

The potential of the device to perform WDM regeneration is firstly demonstrated through the first pigtailed saturable absorber chip implemented with 8 independent fibres using a cost effective coupling technique. The cascadability and wavelength tunability assessment of this module associated to a power limiter fibre-based function has been experimentally demonstrated at 42. 6 Gbit/s. Because this method of power limiting is not a suitable solution for all-optical multichannel 2 R regeneration, a new SA structure allowing a power limiting function was proposed. We describe and characterize such a structure in this paper. This new SA {{opens the door to}} a complete passive all-optical 2 R regeneration relying upon a single technology, as shown in this paper through the use of two SA: SA. 0 for extinction ratio enhancement and SA. 1 for power level equalization allowing receiver sensitivity (up to 3. 5 dB) and Q factor (up to 1. 4 dB) improvement for a RZ signal at 42. 6 Gbit/s. The limitation of SA. 1 when the regenerator must be cascaded a large number of times is also described, leading to the observation that SA. 1 should be more suitable for phase encoded formats which are more spectrally efficient than OOK formats.
