30|$|Efficiency is a {{systematic}} process that converts a <b>set</b> of <b>inputs</b> into a <b>set</b> of outputs. An input {{is a primary}} resource to produce an output while an output is the expected result. Any process, taking a <b>set</b> of <b>inputs</b> to produce certain outputs, can be viewed this way. In any organization, {{it is imperative to}} consider multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Coelli et al. (2005) suggest that efficiency reflects the ability of an organization to obtain maximum output from a given <b>set</b> of <b>inputs.</b> When an organization is able to maximize its output from a given <b>set</b> of <b>inputs,</b> it is said to be efficient (Rogers 1998).|$|R

50|$|As an {{alternate}} to the long-tail pair, the concertina uses a single triode as a variable resistance within a potential divider formed by Ra and Rk {{either side of}} the valve. The result is that the voltage at the anode swings exactly and opposite to the voltage at the cathode, giving a perfectly balanced phase split. the disadvantage of this stage (cf the differential long-tail pair) {{is that it does not}} give any gain. Using a double triode (typically octal or noval) to form a <b>SET</b> <b>input</b> buffer (giving gain) to then feed a concertina phase splitter is a classic push-pull front end, typically followed by a driver (triode) and (triode or pentode) output stage (in ultra linear in many cases) to form the classic push-pull amplifier circuit.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper; two {{models of the}} input shaft for a Longitudinal Mounted four Speed Automotive Automatic Transmission {{for the first time}} were {{introduced}} to describe the input shaft critical loads. In the first model; the DC (Di rect Clutch) connects two gears together. This gives no change in the set torque (the set output torque equal to the <b>set</b> <b>input</b> torque). In the second model; the ODB (Over Drive Brake) fixes one element of the planetary set. This is resulting, the gear set gives reduction ratio (the set output torque is not equal to the <b>set</b> <b>input</b> torque). So, the transmission input shaft is worked under two different working operating conditions of torque. Also, it is loaded by a two vertical loads which are coming from the turbine and planetary set loads respectively. They are shown that there are three critical combinations of forces (contact force, shear force, and normal force) applied on the input shaft. The critical forces can be possibility exist three types of cracks for the input shaft cross section they are: transverse (torsion stress), longitud i nal (bending stress), and vertical (shear stress). The three cracks are studied in this article. The article considers three stress factors: shearing torsion stress, shear stress, and bending stress. </p...|$|E

The second method estimates the Mutual Information between a <b>set</b> of <b>inputs</b> and the output. The best <b>set</b> of <b>inputs</b> is the one that maximises the Mutual Information. Both methods are applied for the selection of the inputs for function approximation and time series prediction problems. ...|$|R

To determine the distribution function for a particular soil property, more than 40 data points are needed [4].

The model relies on a rich set of features that capture content importance from different perspectives. Our model performs better than the systems that we combined based on manual and automatic evaluations. We also achieve very competitive performance on six DUC/TAC datasets, comparable to the state-of-the-art on most datasets. ...|$|E
