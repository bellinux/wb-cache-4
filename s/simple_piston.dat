The internal structure of many calderas is not exposed; as a result, the calderas frequently are interpreted as <b>simple</b> <b>pistons.</b> The results and examples from this thesis indicate that caldera structure is often more complex than this and that caldera formation consists of several stages controlled by complex interactions of many variables. Internal processes and parameters include rock properties (shear strength, planes of weakness, vertical and horizontal variations), dimensions and internal pressure of the associated magma chamber, styles of tumescence and resurgence, {{and the size of the}} eruption. External processes and parameters are also important, such as the regional stress regime (e. g., extensional and pull-apart basins), pre-existing topography, and pre-existing structures (e. g., regional faults, basement grain).

40|$|A major {{water quality}} issue {{in urban areas}} {{underlain}} by a productive aquifer {{is the impact of}} modern recharge. Using a variety of sample sources including multi-level boreholes, detectable concentrations of CFCs and SF 6 have been found throughout the upper 50 m of the saturated aquifer beneath a suburb of Doncaster, UK, indicating that modern (< 50 -year old) recharge has penetrated to at least this depth. Additional support for this deep penetration is provided by the detection of sulphite-reducing clostridia and faecal streptococci. Despite the upper aquifer being a poorly cemented sandstone, the residence time indicators suggest that some modern recharge is travelling via fracture systems in addition to that moving down by <b>simple</b> <b>piston</b> flow. However, the overall impact of 80 years of steady urbanisation on water quality in the aquifer beneath this suburb has in general been limited.

The beam {{width of the}} calls {{is central to the}} function of the sonar, but directionality of echolocation calls has never been measured from bats flying in the wild. We used a microphone array to record sounds and determine horizontal directionality for echolocation calls of the trawling Daubenton's bat, Myotis daubentonii, flying over a pond in its natural habitat. Myotis daubentonii emitted highly directional calls in the field. Directionality increased with frequency. At 40  kHz half-amplitude angle was 25 °, decreasing to 14 ° at 75  kHz. In the laboratory, M. daubentonii emitted less intense and less directional calls. At 55  kHz half-amplitude angle was 40 ° in the laboratory versus 20 ° in the field. The relationship between frequency and directionality {{can be explained by the}} <b>simple</b> <b>piston</b> model.

40|$|The {{starting}} behaviour of scramjet inlets is {{a widely}} researched area as scramjets {{have the potential to}} reduce the cost and improve efficiencies in applications where rockets are traditionally used. The main advantages of scramjet engines are; they have no moving parts, they do not need to carry oxidizers and they are capable of flying at very high speeds. This project analyses the starting behaviour of a typical axisymmetric scramjet inlet. The inlet consists of a conical forebody with a half angle of 12. 28 degrees and a typical axisymmetric cowl. The inlet was tested in the TUSQ hypersonic wind tunnel facility located at the University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Queensland. The inlet was analyzed under both static cowl conditions and dynamic cowl conditons. To be able to test the inlet a mechanical means of guiding and actuating the cowl was first designed and developed. The design is based on a <b>simple</b> <b>piston</b> and bore concept where pressuised air is used to accelerate the cowl forwards. Once the guidance and actuation system was manufactured it was apparent that some aspects of the system were flawed which meant not all conclusions drawn could be completely validated. The flaw in the system is that the cowl leading edge has a total movement of approximately 1. 7 mm in the vertical direction. This movement meant that the results from the static cowl tests are merely estimates and cannot be taken as exact. The results of the dynamic cowl condition are still valid because the main objective of the dynamic test is to investigate if the actuation of the cowl differs the results from the static tests. The final static results indicate that the Kantrowitz limit is a very good estimate of where the inlet can self start, while the dynamic test results indicate {{that it is possible to}} change the inlet starting behaviour by implementing and actuating cowl. ...|$|E

Figure 1 shows the riser cutter and the steel riser bundle which consists of six individual cables. Due to the highly compressed schedule, initial unavailability of the riser material and the Orion Forward Bay mechanical constraints, JSC primarily relied on a combination of internal ballistics analysis and LS-DYNA simulation for this project. Various one dimensional internal ballistics codes that use standard equation of state and conservation of energy have commonly used in the development of CAD devices for initial first order estimates and as an enhancement to the test program. While these codes are very accurate for propellant performance prediction, they usually lack a fully defined kinematic model for dynamic predictions. A <b>simple</b> <b>piston</b> device can easily and accurately be modeled using an equation of motion. However, the accuracy of analytical models is greatly reduced on more complicated devices with complex external loads, nonlinear trajectories or unique unlocking features. A 3 D finite element model of CAD device with all critical features included can vastly improve the analytical ballistic predictions when it is used as a supplement to the ballistic code. During this project, LS-DYNA structural 3 D model was used to predict the riser resisting load that was needed for the ballistic code. A Lagrangian model with eroding elements shown in Figure 2 was used for the blade, steel riser and the anvil. The riser material failure strain was fine tuned by matching the dent depth on the anvil with the actual test data. LS-DYNA model was also utilized to optimize the blade tip design for the most efficient cut. In parallel, the propellant type and the amount were determined by using CADPROG internal ballistics code. Initial test results showed a good match with LS-DYNA and CADPROG simulations. Final paper will present a detailed roadmap from initial ballistic modeling and LS-DYNA simulation to the performance testing. Blade shape optimization study will also be presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of landfills are associated mainly with the emission of leachate and biogas. Sanitary landfilling aims to stabilize the landfill in a efficient and controlled way, so that the {{environmental impacts}} are minimized. When a sanitary landfill has attained its final storage quality, it can {{be integrated into the}} environment. Both the presence and the flux of water play key roles in the stabilization process. Water redistributes chemicals, microorganisms and nutrients within the landfill. It is also needed for {{the first step in the}} anaerobic degradation process, that is, hydrolysis. In this thesis the generation of leachate and the presence and movement of water in landfilled municipal solid waste (MSW) is investigated. The precipitation-leachate discharge relationship for landfills was found to be dominated by evaporation, accumulation in the soil cover, accumulation in the solid waste and fast gravitational flow in a network of channels. The flow regime is governed by the heterogeneity of the internal geometry of the landfill, which is characterized by a discrete structure, significant horizontal stratification (resulting from the disposal procedure), structural voids, impermeable surfaces, and low capillarity. Also the boundary conditions, that is the water input pattern, has shown to be important for the flow process. Based on this, landfilled waste can be conceptualized as a dual domain medium, consisting of a channel domain and a matrix domain. The matrix flow is slow and diffusive, whereas the channel flow is assumed to be driven solely by gravity and to take place as a thin viscous film on solid surfaces. A kinematic wave model for unsaturated infiltration and internal drainage in the channel domain is presented. The model employs a two-parameter power expression as macroscopic flux law. Solutions were derived for the cases when water enters the channel domain laterally and when water enters from the upper end. The model parameters were determined and interpreted in terms of the internal geometry of the waste medium by fitting the model to one set of infiltration and drainage data derived from a large scale laboratory experiment under transient conditions. The model was validated using another set of data from a sequence of water input events and was shown to perform accurately. A solute transport model was developed by coupling a <b>simple</b> <b>piston</b> flux expression and a mobile-immobile conceptualization of the transport domains with the water flow model. Breakthrough curves derived from steady and transient tracer experiments where interpreted with the model. The transport process was found to be dependent on the boundary conditions...|$|E

However, it is shown here that, for a finite panel, it is possible to find values of transmission coefficient that are greater than unity at certain frequencies due to the normalisation used for the incident power. This occurs at the fundamental resonance of the fluid-loaded panel. Example results are presented for a <b>simple</b> circular <b>piston</b> and then for a flexible rectangular panel and an explanation for this phenomenon is provided. In effect, the panel is excited by a sound field that is much larger than its own surface and attracts sound power from a wide region of the incident field.

The veins formed during periods of {{mountain}} building that occurred as long as 3 billion years ago, and were deposited by very large volumes of water that flowed along deep, seismically active faults. The veins formed under fluctuating pressures during earthquakes, but {{the magnitude of the}} pressure fluctuations and their influence on mineral deposition is not known. Here we use a <b>simple</b> thermo-mechanical <b>piston</b> model to calculate the drop in fluid pressure experienced by a fluid-filled fault cavity during an earthquake. The geometry of the model is constrained using measurements of typical fault jogs, such as those preserved in the Revenge gold deposit in Western Australia, and other gold deposits around the world. We find that cavity expansion generates extreme reductions in pressure that cause the fluid that is trapped in the jog to expand to a very low-density vapour. Such flash vaporization of the fluid results in the rapid co-deposition of silica with a range of trace elements to form gold-enriched quartz veins. Flash vaporization continues as more fluid flows towards the newly expanded cavity, until the pressure in the cavity eventually recovers to ambient conditions. Multiple earthquakes progressively build economic-grade gold deposits...|$|R

While the more advanced parts of the rifle {{were found to be}} independently Mexican produced, Heckler & Koch officials still questioned the DGIM (the manufacturer of the FX-05) regarding the issue of the rifles receiver system which is almost identical to the G36's.

Either way it appears that the newer post lawsuit versions of the FX-05 feature a different newly designed receiver, as the newer FX-05 come with a four position fire selection (safe, single shot, three round burst, full auto) whereas the original FX-05 came with only three firing selections (safe, single shot, full auto). This theory is also reinforced by the fact the new black FX-05 models feature a visible metal protrusion before the magazine ejector and the receiver is noticeably smaller.|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} {{of an active}} control force on a thin-walled acoustic boundary can modify the motional dynamics, and so influence the impedance presented to incident waves. This impedance determines transmission of acoustic energy, reflection of acoustic waves from the boundary and absorption of incident energy. This thesis studies control systems that generate control forces for the active control of surface acoustic impedance. The proposed systems rely on measurement of the acoustic pressure and surface velocity of the boundary. The systems can use adaptive digital signal processing, which offers significant advantages over non-adaptive techniques. The active control of the specific acoustic impedance of a loudspeaker that terminates a waveguide for axially propagating plane waves provides a motivating problem. Theoretical analysis establishes the control of specific acoustic impedance of a <b>simple</b> compliantly-suspended <b>piston</b> by a control force. Operational constraints of a physical piston define theoretical operating limits for controlled specific acoustic impedances. The control systems use either feedback or feed-forward techniques for which theoretical treatment reveals restrictions on the range of controlled specific acoustic impedance. A novel result is that conventional implementations of the control systems can be unstable for certain desired impedances unless feedback cancellation is used. Digital feedback techniques are less effective for broader frequency bandwidth where feed-forward techniques may work. Theoretical analysis produces solutions that confirm the feasibility of these control techniques for the active control of specific acoustic impedance. Potential errors {{in the implementation of}} the systems have predictable effects on the controlled specific acoustic impedance. Experimental results support the theoretical work presented in this thesis, demonstrating active control of specific acoustic impedance for normally incident acoustic plane waves.

The erosion of the articulating surfaces of joints, known as osteoarthritis, currently affects more than 200 million citizens worldwide, and more than 50 % of the patients need or will need a surgical treatment. Articular cartilage is a three dimensional avascular tissue, which covers the ends of all synovial joints. During normal daily function, articular cartilage can be repeatedly subjected to forces up to several time body weight, but it is able to provide articulating joints with a nearly frictionless motion. Despite its tremendously important function, articular cartilage has limited capacity for auto regeneration after degenerative and rheumatic diseases, like arthritis, as well as traumatic injuries. Cartilage problems are a huge and still unsolved medical issue, which therefore represents {{one of the most important}} tissue engineering targets requiring high quality products as fast as possible. For this reason, the possibility to recreate in vitro cartilage substitutes as a real alternative to total joint replacement represents an increasing and hopeful market, in which many research groups are still working. At the moment, one of the main findings in invitro cartilage studies is the importance of the role of mechanical stimuli and dynamic loads for the chondrocytes growth and differentiation. Several studies using cartilage explants or chondrocytes seeded in 3 D scaffolds have shown that mechanical compressive loads affect the cells metabolic activity and their matrix production. In order to simulate the in vivo environment, the use of bioreactors is becoming fundamental: bioreactors can provide the chemical and mechanical signals that optimize tissue development. Furthermore, bioreactors could be an important instrument to reduce the cost of clinical studies, used as in vitro predictors of in vivo performance. In this way,the use of bioreactors can reduce animal studies, helping the scientists to focus their attention in the right direction before starting pre-clinical studies, which are usually more expensive than preliminary research. In the past few years, several systems for the application of different mechanical stimuli to chondrocytes have been developed. Most of these can generate biomechanical-like forces such as the direct compression, tensile and shear forces, or hydrostatic pressure, in order to stimulate the articular chondrocyctes to increase their matrix production. Generally, the most important requirements that a culture system has to satisfy are high reliability and usability, perfect sterility, easy control of all the important culture parameters and low cost. In this work, a new system, inspired by the synovial environment of mobile joints and able to apply an innovative type of stimulation on articular chondrocytes is described and modeled. The SQPR (SQueeze PRessure) bioreactor chamber is designed to impose a cyclic hydrodynamic pressure on cell cultures, constructs or tissues slices. The basic principle of this new system is the generation of a localized contact less overpressure on articular chondrocytes, using a <b>simple</b> vertical <b>piston</b> movement. This kind of stimulation is particularly useful for neo-tissue or fresh-constructs, in which cells require a dynamic environment to maintain their differentiate state, but at the same time do not tolerate direct compression or high shear stress. When the piston moves down, a controlled hydrodynamic overpressure and a shear stress is generated over the cell surface, stimulating the chondrocytes to improve their matrix production. The fluid dynamics inside the SQPR bioreactor is illustrated from an analytical and numerical point of view. We show how these models can predict the pressure, velocity field and wall shear stress generated on the cell surface of the construct.

40|$|The Regenerative medicine, or tissue engineering, is a {{multidisciplinary}} field involving engineering, biochemistry, biology, medicine and physics, {{with the purpose}} to repair, replace or regenerate tissue or organs. The advent of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine introduced a potential revolutionizing treatment for patients. In fact, tissue and organ failure {{is still one of}} the main and more expensive health problems, as yet solved only with organ transplantation or medical devices/implants. Both of those solutions have some problems: organ transplantation demands organs availability, but the number of donors is too low to answer this need. On the other hand, the medical devices or implants could be a good solution for few years, but they often present biocompatibility problems, as well as difficult acceptance from patients. Tissue engineering represents a massive and interesting market which promises radical changes in diagnostic as well as therapeutic applications. For diagnostic purposes, in vitro cell cultures have been developed as alternative methods in the pharmaceutical field to test drug efficacy and toxicity. For therapeutic purposes, the intention is to regenerate damaged tissues and organs through tissue engineering techniques by stimulating previously irreparable organs, so they can heal themselves. In addition, regenerative medicine promises to allow in vitro tissues and organs growth, implanting them if the body cannot be prompted to heal itself. In this context, tissue engineering of cartilage is a growing and promising field to produce cartilage replacement as good as native tissue. Diseases of hyaline cartilage represent one of the major health problems, especially in industrialized countries with high life expectancy.

Starting from the first prototype of this new bioreactor, the aim of this work was to optimize and test a new version of this system, in order to obtain an easy and ready to use bioreactor for long time experiments on chondrocytes cell culture. The basic principle of this new system is the generation of a localized contact less overpressure on articular chondrocytes, using a <b>simple</b> vertical <b>piston</b> movement. When the piston moves down, a controlled hydrodynamic overpressure and a low shear stress is generated over the cell surface, stimulating cell matrix production. Starting from an early version of the SQPR (SQueeze Pressure) system, the geometry of the internal chamber was optimized performing FEM simulations and parametric analysis, in order to increase the area of the culture surface and allow the use of different constructs or tissues. The working zone of the system was identified as compromise between the overpressure and wall shear stress applied on the bottom of the SQPR chamber. For the parametric analysis, an analytic model of squeeze lubrication theory is used, considering the fluidodynamic inside a meatus between a fixed unconfined bottom plate and approaching planar piston. The meatus was also modeled using FEM simulation in Comsol® Multiphysics software, in order to analyze the fluidodynamics conditions in the real confined geometry. Then, the whole chamber was designed and realized respecting mechanical stability and biocompatibility requirements, to improve the bioreactor usability and reduce the total size of the system. During this step, different materials were used, and several versions of the system were realized and tested, in order to satisfy all the sterilizability and usability requirements. Furthermore, the external frame was completely re-designed, in order to obtain a small, portable and easy to use system. Moreover, the affordance and usability problems were analyzed and solved developing a purpose-made UserGuide and a easy to read frontal label which helps the final user during all the experimental work, from the setting phase to the end of experiment. Finally, the SQPR 2. 1 was tested in a collaborating laboratory at the University of Sheffield, during a three months long training. The goal of this training period was to test the hypothesis that this system is able to perform long time contactless stimulation of chondrocytes, seeded in 3 D constructs, promoting their differentiation and increasing their matrix production. For this reason, Bovine Adult Chondrocytes (BAC) were seeded in different constructs and subjected to a controlled, contactless overpressure, using the SQPR 2. 1. An experimental protocol was also identified and validated, in order to test the culture conditions and evaluate the total glycosaminoglycan content, fundamental protein of the cartilage matrix directly correlated with the engineered cartilage strenght. Both the viability and the matrix production results were compared to the static cultures as positive controls. During this works, several constructs like coverslips, PGA scaffolds and Agarose gel are stimulated in 24 h long experiments. All these tests showed that the hydrodynamic environment presents in the SQPR chamber stimulates the development of a better engineered tissue, allowing a high viability and at the same time the increase of the medium content of glycosaminoglycan. The high cell viability demonstrates that the fluid movement and the lateral holes allow the right oxygenation of the construct, and the right concentration of nutrients. Due to its small volume, this system allows a more sensitive analysis on cell metabolic products. During the experimental works, 48 h long experiments using cell-seeded scaffolds were also performed, and a GAG production rate was identified. Comparing the stimulated constructs and the static controls, it is possible to note that after 24 h the matrix production of the static control tends to decrease, indicating that these cultures gradually losed the ability to produce ECM. The curve for the stimulated scaffolds in the bioreactor does not shows this production rate variation, indicating that the contact-less pressure induces the constructs to maintain increased metabolic activity. The SQPR 2. 1 system also shows a high flexibility and usability, adapting to the different laboratory needs and protocols. The high flexibility is demonstrated because it is possible to stimulate different types of 3 D constructs, as Agarose/cell gel or PGA scaffolds, just changing the brace of the bioreactor and the controller parameters. The simplicity to use has been tested during the experimental phase: the bioreactor is portable thanks to its lightness and small size, and the assembling procedure is fast and easy, particularly considering the limited working space in the laminar hood Finally, we can conclude that this work has lead to the development of a patented and reliable product for the stimulation of cartilage tissue engineered constructs, using an easy to use controller. The stimulation can be autonomously maintained for long time with high stability, allowing a easy sample collection during the experiment. Thanks to the low price materials and the simple actuation, the SQPR 2. 1 system is a competitive bioreactor system able to increase the GAG production, particularly in short experiment using fresh scaffolds, on the contrary the other systems that apply a direct compression on scaffolds 3 - 4 weeks post seeding. One of the main limits observed is the impossibility to stimulate more than one 3 D construct per time. For this reason, one of the future works should be oriented to the design of a new SQPR version able to stimulate several scaffolds in parallel. Furthermore, a perfusion system can be added, analyzing the GAG production rate in the time without stopping the experiment, assuring at the same time the right nutrient concentration...|$|R
