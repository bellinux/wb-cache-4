5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear {{prosthetic}} legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the <b>sockets</b> to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the <b>sockets</b> have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} change that {{happened}} during the growth of Limusaurus is {{the complete loss of}} teeth from juveniles to adults. Juveniles began with one tooth in the premaxilla, eight in the maxilla, and eleven in the lower jaw (42 teeth total). At the next stage, the first, sixth, and eighth teeth in the maxilla, as well as the sixth in the lower jaw have all been lost (34 teeth total), although the <b>sockets</b> are still present, and there is a small replacement tooth in the socket of the sixth lower tooth. During this stage, usage of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced, since none of the still-erupted teeth bear any marks of wear or resorption. As the specimens grew, the transformation became more radical. In subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age, all of the teeth are missing. CT scanning shows that only five empty tooth <b>sockets</b> remain in the adult maxilla; all of the <b>sockets</b> in the lower jaw have fused into a single, hollow canal, {{and the rest of the}} tooth <b>sockets</b> have been obliterated.|$|E
5|$|There are 5 premaxillary {{teeth in}} both species, {{the fourth of}} {{which is about a}} third larger {{relative}} to the others. The maxilla has 12 distinct <b>sockets</b> in K. langenbergensis. Excluding the pseudocaniniforms, the maxillary tooth size remains roughly constant but gradually decreases after the pseudocaniniforms in both species; all tooth <b>sockets</b> after the twelfth are replaced by a continuous trough. In total, K. guimarotae had at least 15 maxillary teeth, and K. langenbergensis 17 or 18. Meanwhile, the dentary exhibits 21 teeth in K. langenbergensis and at least 20 in K. guimarotae. Like the maxilla, distinct <b>sockets</b> for dentary teeth are replaced by a groove from the eleventh tooth backwards in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
50|$|The organic pin {{grid array}} was {{originally}} introduced for the AMD Athlon XP processors based on <b>Socket</b> A, also used for AMD processors using <b>Socket</b> 754, <b>Socket</b> 939, <b>Socket</b> 940, <b>Socket</b> FM1, <b>Socket</b> FM2, <b>Socket</b> AM2, <b>Socket</b> AM2+, <b>Socket</b> AM3, <b>Socket</b> AM3+ and <b>Socket</b> AM4.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{manufacturers}} have released several <b>socketed</b> AMD Mini-ITX motherboards, supporting <b>Socket</b> AM2, <b>Socket</b> AM2+, <b>Socket</b> AM3, <b>Socket</b> FM1, <b>Socket</b> FM2, <b>Socket</b> FM2+, <b>Socket</b> AM1 and <b>Socket</b> AM4 CPUs. <b>Socket</b> AM2+ and AM3 ITX motherboards have integrated motherboard graphics, while discrete graphics or processor integrated graphics {{are required for}} other platforms.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Socket</b> 754 was the {{original}} <b>socket</b> for AMD's Athlon 64 desktop processors. Due {{to the introduction of}} newer <b>socket</b> layouts (i.e. <b>Socket</b> 939, <b>Socket</b> 940 and <b>Socket</b> AM2), <b>Socket</b> 754 became the more [...] "budget-minded" [...] <b>socket</b> for use with AMD Athlon 64 or Sempron processors. It differs from <b>Socket</b> 939 in several areas: ...|$|R
5|$|Any DVI-to-HDMI adapter can {{function}} as an HDMI-to-DVI adapter (and vice versa). Typically, the only limitation is {{the gender of the}} adapter's connectors and the gender of the cables and <b>sockets</b> it is used with.|$|E
5|$|Following excavation, several {{stones were}} placed in the {{original}} <b>sockets</b> {{in order to create a}} reconstruction of the original circle. A fence was then erected around the circle to discourage further interference.|$|E
5|$|The Pendolino is {{designed}} as a premium facility train. The seats are fitted with audio <b>sockets</b> for radio and music channels; however the radio service was dropped in 2010 due to low usage. All seats have electricity <b>sockets</b> for laptops and mobile phones. All Sm3 trains offer a free onboard Wi-Fi Internet access since 2010. The passenger information monitors over the aisle in the carriages show a clock and the train's current speed in addition to VR's marketing material and station information. They are also used to convey passenger information for the deaf. The train is accessible for wheelchairs, contains pet spaces and seats for allergic passengers.|$|E
50|$|The AMD <b>Socket</b> C32 is {{the server}} {{processor}} <b>socket</b> for AMD's current single-CPU and dual-CPU Opteron 4000 series CPUs. It is {{the successor to}} <b>Socket</b> AM3 for single-CPU servers and the successor for <b>Socket</b> F for lower-end dual-CPU servers (High-end dual-CPU servers will use <b>Socket</b> G34). <b>Socket</b> C32 supports two DDR3 SDRAM channels. It {{is based on the}} <b>Socket</b> F and uses a similar 1207-land LGA <b>socket</b> but is not physically or electrically compatible with <b>Socket</b> F due to the use of DDR3 SDRAM instead of the DDR2 SDRAM that <b>Socket</b> F platforms use.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socket</b> 939 is a CPU <b>socket</b> {{released}} by AMD in June 2004 to supersede the previous <b>Socket</b> 754 for Athlon 64 processors. <b>Socket</b> 939 was succeeded by <b>Socket</b> AM2 in May 2006. It {{is the second}} <b>socket</b> designed for AMD's AMD64 range of processors.|$|R
50|$|Differences between <b>Socket</b> 5 and <b>Socket</b> 7 {{are that}} <b>Socket</b> 7 has an extra pin and is {{designed}} to provide dual split rail voltage, as opposed to <b>Socket</b> 5's single voltage. (However, not all motherboard manufacturers supported the dual voltage on their boards initially.) <b>Socket</b> 7 is backwards compatible; a <b>Socket</b> 5 CPU can be placed in a <b>Socket</b> 7 motherboard.|$|R
5|$|Another {{removable}} roadblocking {{system used}} mines. The extant remains of such systems superficially {{resemble those of}} hedgehog or hairpin, but the pits are shallow: just deep enough to take an anti-tank mine. When not in use, the <b>sockets</b> were filled with a wooden plug allowing traffic to pass normally.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and <b>sockets</b> (joint replacement) and dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} of different ages, is well studied {{in regards to}} its growth and development. Throughout ontogeny, the skull of Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye <b>sockets</b> became proportionally smaller. This indicates a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E
50|$|<b>Socket</b> 754 is a CPU <b>socket</b> {{originally}} developed by AMD to supersede its Athlon XP platform (<b>socket</b> 462, {{also referred to}} as <b>Socket</b> A). <b>Socket</b> 754 was the first <b>socket</b> developed by AMD to support their new consumer version of the 64 bit microprocessor family known as AMD64.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socket</b> M is pin-compatible with desktop <b>socket</b> mPGA478A {{but it is}} not {{electrically}} compatible. <b>Socket</b> M is not pin-compatible {{with the}} older desktop <b>Socket</b> 478 (mPGA478B) or the newer mobile <b>Socket</b> P (mPGA478MN) by location of one pin; it is also incompatible with most versions of the older mobile <b>Socket</b> 479. Pentium III-M processors designed for the first version of <b>Socket</b> 479 will physically fit into a <b>Socket</b> M, but are electrically incompatible with it. Although conflicting information has been published, no 45 nm Penryn processors have been released for <b>Socket</b> M.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socket</b> 4, {{presented}} in 1993, {{was the first}} CPU <b>socket</b> designed for the early P5 Pentium microprocessors. <b>Socket</b> 4 was the only 5-volt <b>socket</b> for the Pentium. After <b>Socket</b> 4, Intel switched to the 3.3-volt-powered <b>Socket</b> 5. <b>Socket</b> 4 does support a special Pentium OverDrive, which allows running at 120 MHz (for the 60 MHz Pentium) or 133 MHz (for the 66 MHz Pentium).|$|R
5|$|Pterosaurs' hip <b>sockets</b> are {{oriented}} facing slightly upwards, and {{the head}} of the femur (thigh bone) is only moderately inward facing, suggesting that pterosaurs had an erect stance. It would have been possible to lift the thigh into a horizontal position during flight, as gliding lizards do.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to other}} iguanodonts, {{the teeth of}} Eolambia are {{arranged}} in tightly-spaced and interlocking rows. At any given time, each of the 32 maxillary tooth <b>sockets</b> holds three teeth, while each of the 30 dentary tooth <b>sockets</b> holds four teeth. Out of these, two of the teeth in each socket are replacement teeth like those of Probactrosaurus; the others are active teeth. Rvery active tooth has one wear facet. Like Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids, each maxillary tooth crown has only one ridge, which is slightly offset towards the midline of the mouth. Meanwhile, each dentary tooth crown characteristically bears a primary ridge, and an accessory ridge closer to the midline of the mouth, a condition which is also present in Protohadros and other hadrosauroids. All of the crowns also bear small, denticle-like serrations {{on the front and}} rear edges, which is also seen in Probactrosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Pachylemur is {{relatively}} broad, but the orbits (eye <b>sockets)</b> are smaller and oriented more {{towards the front}} than in the ruffed lemurs. In the postcranial skeleton, the most distinctive traits of Pachylemur are found. It had shorter and more robust limbs than the ruffed lemurs, and the fore- and hindlimbs were closer in length (intermembral index of approximately 97).|$|E
50|$|<b>Socket</b> F is a CPU <b>socket</b> {{designed}} by AMD for its Opteron line of CPUs released on August 15, 2006. In 2010 <b>Socket</b> F {{was replaced by}} <b>Socket</b> C32 for entry-level servers and <b>Socket</b> G34 for high-end servers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socket</b> TR4, {{also known}} as <b>Socket</b> SP3r2, is a land grid array (LGA) CPU <b>socket</b> {{designed}} by AMD supporting its Zen-based Ryzen Threadripper desktop processors, launched on August 10, 2017. It is physically identical to, but incompatible with, AMD's server <b>Socket</b> SP3. <b>Socket</b> TR4 is AMD's first LGA <b>socket</b> for a consumer product.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socket</b> AM2+ is a CPU <b>socket,</b> {{which is}} the {{immediate}} successor to <b>Socket</b> AM2 {{that is used by}} several AMD processors such as Athlon 64 X2. <b>Socket</b> AM2+ is a mid-migration from <b>Socket</b> AM2 to <b>Socket</b> AM3 and both AM2+ and AM2 <b>socket</b> CPUs and motherboards have the potential to operate together. Actual interoperability depends upon other factors, especially the availability of compatible BIOS software, and some PC retailers, such as Dell, have not provided compatible BIOS versions that allow use of <b>socket</b> AM2+ CPUs on their products utilizing <b>socket</b> AM2 motherboards, such as the Inspiron 531.|$|R
5|$|The {{skull of}} the dodo {{differed}} much {{from those of}} other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The upper bill was nearly {{twice as long as}} the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated {{along the length of the}} beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the frontal bone formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye <b>sockets.</b> The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye <b>sockets</b> occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty <b>sockets</b> at one end, which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush. The size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E
5|$|World Traveller Plus is {{the premium}} economy {{offering}} provided on all long-haul aircraft except the Airbus A318. This cabin offers wider seats, extended leg-room, additional seat comforts such as larger IFE screen (on most aircraft) a foot rest and power <b>sockets.</b> A complimentary 'World Traveller' bar is offered {{along with an}} upgraded main meal course.|$|E

50|$|<b>Socket</b> 478 was {{launched}} with the Northwood core {{to compete with}} AMD's 462-pin <b>Socket</b> A and their Athlon XP processors. <b>Socket</b> 478 {{was intended to be}} the replacement for <b>Socket</b> 423, a Willamette-based processor <b>socket</b> which was on the market for only a short time. <b>Socket</b> 478 was phased out with the launch of LGA 775.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>socket</b> G3 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} as of March 2008. The <b>socket</b> {{that will be}} the successor to the <b>Socket</b> F is the LGA 1974-pin <b>Socket</b> G34.|$|R
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle {{that can be}} recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall <b>sockets,</b> and the electricity stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of {{electric vehicle}}s that includes all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, {{there are certain}} protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the Secure <b>Sockets</b> Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential. Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as HTTP (web browsing), POP3 (e-mail), FTP (file transfer), IRC (Internet chat), BitTorrent (file sharing) and XMPP (instant messaging).|$|E
5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth <b>sockets,</b> new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
50|$|<b>Socket</b> G34 {{originally}} {{started out}} as <b>Socket</b> G3, which used the G3MX to expand memory capacity. <b>Socket</b> G3 and G3MX were canceled altogether, and replaced with <b>Socket</b> G34.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a 3-way 2-circuit switch is {{incorporated}} {{together with a}} regular <b>socket,</b> {{to be used as}} the main lamp <b>socket</b> in a lamp with a night light. In this configuration, the switched lamp one live terminal for the night light <b>socket</b> is exposed externally on the base of the <b>socket,</b> to be wired to the remote candelabra <b>socket.</b> Hence, this type of <b>socket</b> has a Hot terminal, a Neutral terminal, and a switched Hot terminal. This creates a confusing situation in which a keyed 3-way <b>socket</b> (which has a 3-contact <b>socket</b> at the top of it) has only two terminal screws, while a night-light <b>socket</b> (which does not have a 3-contact <b>socket</b> at the top) has three terminal screws on the base.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socket</b> F (LGA 1207 contacts) is AMD’s second {{generation}} of Opteron <b>socket.</b> This <b>socket</b> supports processors such as the Santa Rosa, Barcelona, Shanghai, and Istanbul codenamed processors. The “Lidded land grid array” <b>socket</b> adds support for DDR2 SDRAM and improved HyperTransport version 3 connectivity. Physically the <b>socket</b> and processor package are nearly identical, although not generally compatible with <b>socket</b> 1207 FX.|$|R
