5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain <b>some</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E

25|$|By November 1972 Genie {{could use}} the word on, {{although}} it was uncertain whether she distinguished between on and in and Curtiss wrote that all of Genie's earliest utterances containing on and in were answers to somebody asking her a question, and could correctly use the suffix -ing to describe events in the present progressive. These were the first grammatical markers in her speech, and both are normally two of the first grammatical markers young children can use. Her use of -ing on exclusively dynamic verbs also indicated to linguists that she categorized dynamic versus stative verbs, although she did not use it with the verb to be until the fall of 1973 and then only when speaking in first or third-person. Even after learning the present progressive she inconsistently gave correct responses to it on tests, {{and use of the}} suffix -ing was the only way Genie modified a sentence without changing any of the base words. Although Genie had gained <b>some</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> number words during her initial stay at Children's Hospital she only began to count in sequential order in late 1972, always in very deliberate and laborious manner, and her progress was extremely slow.|$|E

After 1908 Abd al-Rahman was allowed to live in Omdurman and study under a distinguished Azharite named Muhammad al-Badawi, where he gained <b>some</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> Islamic jurisprudence and the fundamentals of his religion, including the Hadith, or Prophet's tradition. However, he was never to become a well-educated and knowledgeable Islamic scholar as his father had been. The government lent him money to build the family mosque in Omdurman in 1908, and let him farm part of his father's land on Aba Island. He emphasized his peaceful intentions, convincing the colonialist government that his movement was not dangerous. A British official described him in 1909, when he was aged about twenty-four, as [...] "an obsequious, sorry-looking youth in soiled clothes". In 1910 he made a public speech in which he supported the Condominium administration of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.|$|E
