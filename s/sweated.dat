5|$|Much of {{the episode}} {{is based on the}} Watergate scandal, as well as other real-life {{political}} events. The two Republicans who follow Bob around were based on H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, two of Richard Nixon's closest advisors during Watergate. Sideshow Bob's campaign advert was based on the famous Willie Horton and Revolving Door political advertisements used by George H. W. Bush during the 1988 United States presidential election. Birch Barlow's question to Mayor Quimby about whether his stance on crime would differ if it was his family being attacked is a reference to Bernard Shaw's similar question to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential debates. Quimby's appearance during the debate parodies Richard Nixon's appearance during his first televised debate with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election.

40|$|Introduction Human <b>sweat</b> is {{a complex}} biofluid of {{interest}} to diverse scientific fields. Metabolomics analysis of <b>sweat</b> promises to improve screening, diagnosis and self-monitoring of numerous conditions through new applications and greater personalisation of medical interventions. Before these applications can be fully developed, existing methods for the collection, handling, processing and storage of human <b>sweat</b> need to be revised. This review presents a cross-disciplinary overview of the origins, composition, physical characteristics and functional roles of human <b>sweat,</b> and explores the factors involved in standardising <b>sweat</b> collection for metabolomics analysis. Methods A literature review of human <b>sweat</b> analysis over the past 10 years (2006 - 2016) was performed to identify studies with metabolomics or similarly applicable &# 039;omics&# 039; analysis. These studies were reviewed with attention to <b>sweat</b> induction and sampling techniques, timing of <b>sweat</b> collection, <b>sweat</b> storage conditions, laboratory derivation, processing and analytical platforms. Results Comparative analysis of 20 studies revealed numerous factors that can significantly impact the validity, reliability and reproducibility of <b>sweat</b> analysis including: anatomical site of <b>sweat</b> sampling, skin integrity and preparation; temperature and humidity at the <b>sweat</b> collection sites; timing and nature of <b>sweat</b> collection; metabolic quenching; transport and storage; qualitative and quantitative measurements of the skin microbiota at <b>sweat</b> collection sites; and individual variables such as diet, emotional state, metabolic conditions, pharmaceutical, recreational drug and supplement use.

500|$|In {{the absence}} of any sign that James would move to end the {{persecution}} of Catholics, as some had hoped for, several members of the clergy (including two anti-Jesuit priests) decided to take matters into their own hands. [...] In {{what became known as the}} Bye Plot, the priests William Watson and William Clark planned to kidnap James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Cecil received news of the plot from several sources, including the Archpriest George Blackwell, who instructed his priests to have no part in any such schemes. At about the same time, Lord Cobham, Lord Grey de Wilton, Griffin Markham and Walter Raleigh hatched what became known as the Main Plot, which involved removing James and his family and supplanting them with Arbella Stuart. [...] Amongst others, they approached Henry IV of France for funding, but were unsuccessful. [...] All those involved in both plots were arrested in July and tried in autumn 1603; Sir George Brooke was executed, but James, keen not to have too bloody a start to his reign, reprieved Cobham, Grey, and Markham while they were at the scaffold.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Sweat</b> {{from the}} body is {{regulated}} by the surface tension of a <b>sweat</b> droplet at the pores and the pressure within the <b>sweat</b> duct. A <b>sweat</b> droplet grows in size until its surface tension and the pressure within the <b>sweat</b> duct are in equilibrium. When a hand is immersed in water, <b>sweat</b> droplets easily merge within the water, causing the pressure to drop at the pores. This in turn makes the <b>sweat</b> to flow freely into {{the water in the}} absence of counteracting pressure. <b>Sweat</b> glands produce more <b>sweat</b> because of the low pressure within the duct. To prevent loss of water {{from the body}} and to maintain the homeostasis, the body reacts by restricting the blood flow to the hand causing vasoconstriction and eventual wrinkling of the skin...|$|R

500|$|In 1888 Lansbury {{agreed to}} act as {{election}} agent for Jane Cobden, who was contesting the first elections for the newly formed London County Council [...] (LCC) as Liberal candidate for the Bow and Bromley division. [...] Cobden, an early supporter of women's suffrage, was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden. [...] The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors (SPWCC), a new women's rights group, had proposed Cobden as the [...] candidate for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst [...] for Brixton. [...] Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate: housing for the poor, ending of <b>sweated</b> labour, rights of public assembly, {{and control of the}} police. Specific questions of women's rights were largely avoided during the campaign. [...] On 19 January 1889 both women were elected; these triumphs were, however, short-lived. Sandhurst's [...] qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her Conservative Party opponents on the grounds of her sex, and her subsequent appeal was dismissed. Cobden was not immediately challenged, but in April 1891, after a [...] series of legal actions, [...] she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties. [...] Lansbury urged her, during the hearings, [...] to [...] "go to prison and let the Council back you up by refusing to declare your seat vacant". Cobden did not follow this path.

500|$|Neil Pigot, who {{did some}} {{work with the}} group, {{describes}} their style as [...] "a sort of extension of the Python tradition, but very much in an Australian context." [...] He says that DAAS were [...] "crucially important" [...] {{in the development of}} Australian comedy, directly contributing to the styles of successful comedy shows such as The D-Generation, Fast Forward and Wogs Out of Work. At the time DAAS emerged, Pigot says, comedy in Australia was dominated by joke-tellers and impersonators. [...] By contrast, DAAS were belligerent and confrontational, frequently attacking topical issues, invading people's personal space and involving the audience in their act. Mark Trevorrow, who frequently collaborated with the group, described their work as [...] "true genius." [...] "Their great shows were among the greatest evenings I've witnessed in my life and their worst shows were among the worst," [...] he said. [...] "They'd whip up an audience and appeal to people's darker side. [...] It was very Dada, what they were doing.

[...] In addition, ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson says that the group {{played an important role in}} raising the profile of Australian comedy overseas, particularly in Britain where DAAS were very popular. British comedian Al Murray said of seeing the group at the Edinburgh Festival in 1988, [...] "they came onstage with the attitude of feral invaders and left it with no taboo untouched." [...] Murray described the All Stars as [...] "an insanely hot act from Oz who sang, cursed, <b>sweated</b> and insulted each other and their audiences with a level of commitment and polish that seemed exotically charged and almost transgressive in the late 80s." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Final Hours", {{the third}} episode of Son of God, details Jesus's last days alive. Bowen {{claims that the}} Last Supper would have been held {{in the guest room}} of a [...] "well-to-do" [...] house in Jerusalem. Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper took place in a triclinium. As guest of honour, Jesus would have been {{at the end of the}} table with John the Apostle at his side, rather than at the centre, as {{proposed}} by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have <b>sweated</b> blood at Gethsemane. Leaving the Middle East for the first time, he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist at Columbia University. Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis, a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die. He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences. Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County, Vermont, by measuring their blood pressure while they are strapped to crosses with their arms outstretched and level with their shoulders. He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus's crucifixion, with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists, may have been possible if his feet were supported. The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan, a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion, also supports this theory. Next, Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus. William Klassen, an historian at École Biblique in Jerusalem, theorises that the Greek word [...] "paradidomi" [...] was mistranslated, and that Judas simply [...] "handed over" [...] Jesus to the Romans, rather than betrayed him.|$|E
50|$|Most {{people with}} hypohidrotic {{ectodermal}} dysplasia have a reduced ability to <b>sweat</b> (hypohidrosis) {{because they have}} fewer <b>sweat</b> glands than normal or their <b>sweat</b> glands do not function properly. <b>Sweating</b> is a major way that the body controls its temperature; as <b>sweat</b> evaporates from the skin, it cools the body.

In some cases, hyperthermia can cause life-threatening medical problems.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Describe {{and define}} {{limitations}} of early pilocarpine iontophoresis (<b>sweat</b> testing) for cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening (NBS). STUDY DESIGN: Population-based results from follow-up of CF NBS-positive newborns. RESULTS: Insufficient quantity of <b>sweat</b> {{is more likely}} if the <b>sweat</b> test is done too early, but testing is generally successful after 2 weeks of age. <b>Sweat</b> chloride levels drop over the first weeks of life. CF carriers have higher <b>sweat</b> chloride concentrations than non-carriers. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Sweat</b> testing can be performed effectively after 2 weeks of age for CF NBS-positive newborns. Earlier testing has {{a higher risk of}} insufficient <b>sweat</b> for completing testing...|$|R

Recovery of 14 C-labeled lactate in <b>sweat</b> after injection of 14 C-labeled glucose was enhanced ruing starvation, suggesting preferential utilization of circulating glucose for <b>sweat</b> gland glycogen content decreased markedly during <b>sweating</b> in fasted subjects nearly complete recovery of normal glycogen content was observed 6 hr after conclusion of <b>sweating.</b> In the <b>sweat</b> gland, significant dependence upon carbohydrate metabolism persists during the fasted state...|$|R
