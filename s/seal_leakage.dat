Data from annular and labyrinth seals are compared with previous brush and finger seal test results. Data are also compared to literature. Annular and labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>leakage</b> rates are 2 to 3 times greater than brush and finger seal rates. <b>Seal</b> <b>leakage</b> decreases with increasing speed but increases with increasing test temperature due to thermal expansion mismatch.

The generalized solution agrees with the results obtained by using the calculated values of an earlier paper and performing a coordinate transformation. The analysis results coincide with the measured data in showing that the stiffness and damping matrices of seal coefficients are not skew symmetric, and the main diagonal seal coefficients are not equal.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a force induced by the {{labyrinth}} seal on the stability of rotor systems and the factors of the seal which affect the stability are investigated. In the analysis, {{it is assumed that}} the fluid in the seal is steady and that the rotor is set vertically {{in order to avoid the}} effects of gravity force. The force induced by the seal is expressed in terms proportional to the velocity and displacement of the rotor and is deduced to that expression for the oil film force in journal bearings. That force is taken into account in the equations of motion; then the stability of the system is discussed by energy concept. The force induced by the labyrinth seal always makes the rotor system unstable, and the tendency is marked when <b>seal</b> <b>leakages</b> are small. The resonance point of the rotor system is also affected by the labyrinth seal (the resonance point of the rotor system is removed by the <b>seal</b> <b>leakages).</b> The force induced by the labyrinth seal was measured by using a water-tunnel experimental system which was designed to measure the labyrinth seal force by using the similarity between gas and liquid flow theory...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{detailed}} study into the internal aerodynamics of labyrinth seals, with pmic| {{reference to the}} effects of abradable honeycomb stators on labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>leakage.</b> - A extensive experimental programme established tables of friction factor for three different grades of honeycomb used by industry, and examined the effect of both Reynolds number and clearance on these friction factors. The friction factor associated with a aerodynamically smooth surface was also experimentally determined in order to establish the experimental method. The experimental data was used to model the different grades of honeycomb used as stator material in numerical simulations of a number labyrinth seals, and allowed for comparison of the leakage associated with both smooth and abradable stator straight through labyrinth seals. Step-up and step-down seal geometries were also considered, and the effects of pressure ratio, clearance and rotation on labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>leakage</b> was examined on all modelled seal types. This numerically generated leakage data was comprehensive enough to allow {{for the creation of a}} second-generation one-dimensional labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>leakage</b> predictor tool of the type used by design engineers in network models.

Leakage resistance of advanced design, stepped labyrinth seals has been examined based on geometric considerations. Leakage measurements were obtained in an attempt to identify geometric and flow characteristics contributing to a desired seal performance. Experimental tests were conducted using two test rigs. one of these test rigs was a 100 : 1 scale and the other was a 4 : 1 scale of an actual labyrinth seal. Both test rigs operated based on a two-dimensional planar flow concept. Tests were performed by individually varying geometric variables and obtaining corresponding leakage measurements. Dimension variables under investigation were surface roughness, radial clearance, step height, annular groove configuration in stator surface, and annular groove configuration in rotor surface. Results showed that several geometric variables can be used to produce substantial changes in <b>seal</b> <b>leakage</b> resistance.

Significant advancements in seal technology are required to meet the extreme demands placed on the seals, including the simultaneous requirements of low leakage, conformable, high temperature, high pressure, sliding operation. In this investigation, the design, development, analytical and experimental evaluation of a new ceramic wafer seal that shows promise of meeting these demands will be addressed. A high temperature seal test fixture was designed and fabricated to measure static <b>seal</b> <b>leakage</b> performance under engine simulated conditions. Ceramic wafer <b>seal</b> <b>leakage</b> rates are presented for engine-simulated air pressure differentials (up to 100 psi), and temperature (up to 1350 F), sealing both flat and distorted wall conditions, where distortions can be as large as 0. 15 inches in only an 18 inch span. <b>Seal</b> <b>leakage</b> rates are low, meeting an industry-established tentative leakage limit for all combinations of temperature, pressure and wall conditions considered. A <b>seal</b> <b>leakage</b> model developed from externally-pressurized gas film bearing theory is also presented.
