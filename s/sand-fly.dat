During the same period, the field ambulance treated almost {{an equal number of}} patients needing dressings and for minor ailments. Some were kept in hospital for a few days. In five weeks, the field ambulance cared for the equivalent of two regiments or two-thirds of the total brigade. According to Falls, [...] "in general, however, the Force's standard of health was very high." [...] These minor ailments included very painful boils which were inevitable in the dust, heat and sweat of the Jordan Valley. They often started where shirt collars rubbed the backs of necks, then spread {{to the top of the}} head and possibly the arm pits and buttocks. These boils were treated by lancing or hot foments sometimes applied hourly and requiring a day or two in hospital. Foments were made from a wad of lint wrapped in a towel heated in boiling water, wrung as dry as possible then quickly slapped straight on the boil. Other maladies suffered during the occupation included dysentery, a few cases of enteric, relapsing fever, typhus, and smallpox along with <b>sand-fly</b> fever.|$|E

Nevertheless, there was enough there to tell the Christian philosopher that God had made the deserts for the enjoyment of His creatures, for, although not always visible or audible, myriads of living beings were there--from the huge buffalo and grizzly bear to the <b>sand-fly</b> and mosquito--which rejoiced in the green pastures and luxuriated beside the sweet waters of the land.|$|E

A quarter of an hour's walk from the landing-place placed us in the Nánwá village, now popularly known as Walker-Kru. It consists of a few mean little hovels, the usual cage-work, huddled together in most unpicturesque confusion. Prick-eared curs, ducks, and fowls compose the bestial habitants, to which must be added the regiments of rats (and ne'er a cat) which infest all these places. There were no mosquitoes, but the <b>sand-fly</b> bit viciously on mornings and evenings between the dark and sunlit hours, confining one to the dim cage and putting a veto upon the pleasant lounge or seat in the cool open. We found lodgings in the guest-hut of the headman, Kwáko Juma, like most of his brethren, a civil man and a greedy. But the Krumen, boatmen and carriers, were also lodged in the little settlement, and these people always make night hideous with their songs and squabbles, their howling voices, and hyæna-like bursts of laughter.

They were a singular contrast, Mortimer and Scott, {{and it was in}} their differences that the secret of their close friendship lay. Each dovetailed into the other.

Mortimer was the deeper thinker, Scott the brighter talker. By a curious coincidence, though each had seen much of warfare, their campaigns had never coincided. Together they covered all recent military history. Scott had done Plevna, the Shipka, the Zulus, Egypt, Suakim; Mortimer had seen the Boer War, the Chilian, the Bulgaria and Servian, the Gordon relief, the Indian frontier, Brazilian rebellion, and Madagascar.

He served as a doctor with the 2nd Division 2 NZEF during 1941-42 in Greece and North Africa. In 1942 he was transferred to the Pacific to serve with the 3rd Division, 2 NZEF IP. His 1943 handbook on malaria control, Malaria in the South Pacific, became a standard text. As a specialist in tropical diseases (malaria, dengue fever, <b>sand-fly</b> fever and dysentery) his work contributed to minimising deaths in the New Zealand army. The pre-war experience and malaria records of Sayers was also helpful to the United States forces in reducing malaria rates during the Solomon Islands campaign.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to perform an epidemiological survey to determine the areas at risk of visceral leishmaniasis through the detection and quantification of natural infection by Leishmania infantum in Lutzomyia longipalpis. The sandflies were captured between February 2009 and January 2010, at 21 sites in four regions of the Fortaleza municipality. Samples were screened for the presence of Leishmania DNA by Real Time PCR (qPCR), amplification of kDNA minicircle sequence. Out of the 123 pools of analyzed sandflies, 45 were positive for L. infantum, and the minimum infection rate was 3. 7 %. In the north, south, east and west regions, the pool screen assay predicted <b>sand-fly</b> infection prevalence of 3. 4 %, 4. 7 %, 4. 9 % and 8. 4 %, respectively.

40|$|Severe {{damages to}} {{physical}} infrastructures {{as well as}} lifeline facilities have been observed during past earthquakes. Saturated sands as well as sands containing fines liquefied. The effect of fines on liquefaction resistance of sand is not fully understood till today. The basis of comparison and types of fines are reported as important factors affecting effects of fines on liquefaction. The fly ash is non-plastic and finer. Hence, study of liquefaction behavior of <b>sand-fly</b> ash mixtures may be helpful for the understanding of effects of fines on liquefaction resistance. The objective {{of this study were}} (1) to investigate effects of addition of fly ash on pore water pressure generation and deformation characteristics of sand, (2) to study effects of confining pressure on liquefaction resistance of <b>sand-fly</b> ash mixtures, and (3) to study Youngs modulus and damping ratio of <b>sand-fly</b> ash mixtures. Stress controlled cyclic triaxial tests were performed on clean sand, fly ash and <b>sand-fly</b> ash mixtures containing 10, 20 % of fly ash. For the evaluation of effects of confining pressure in liquefaction resistance, three series of tests were conducted at 5, 10 and 15 psi initial effective confining pressures. The reversible shear stress was applied systematically by varying CSR (Cyclic Stress Ratio) from 0. 1 to 0. 5. But, the tests were conducted only in 5 psi effective confining pressure in case of pure fly ash. The results obtained from the tests were used to compare the effects on liquefaction resistance in terms of pore water pressure build up, deformation behavior and effective confining pressure. Based on the results, it was observed that, the liquefaction resistance decreases with an increase in cyclic shear stresses at a given initial confining pressure. Liquefaction resistance also decreases with an increase in confining pressure for any CSR values. Further, the effects of fly ash content on liquefaction resistance was found to depend upon the confining pressure. For all effective confining pressure, liquefaction resistance decreased with an addition of 10 % fly ash. However, when the fly ash content was increased to 20 %, the liquefaction resistance increased. Moreover, the liquefaction resistance of sand containing 20 % fly ash was higher than clean sand at 5 psi effective confining pressure. On the other hand, it was lower than clean sand for the effective confining pressure 10 and 15 psi. The brittleness of the sample was found to increase with an addition of fly ash. Youngs modulus and damping ratio were also determined. The Youngs modulus was found to decrease with an increase in axial strain for clean sand, and for sand containing 10 and 20 % fly ash. It was also noted that, Youngs modulus increases with an increase in confining pressure. The damping ratio increases with an increase in axial strain. No distinct variation of damping ratio with confining pressure was observed...|$|E
