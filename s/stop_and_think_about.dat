In 1955 Johns wrote that Belenggu was a [...] "great advance on any previous work", with which the Indonesian novel came to maturity; he praises the structure, plot, and presentation. Siregar, writing in 1964, praised the novel's diction, noting that Pane handled technical discussions especially well. Jassin wrote in 1967 that, although he found the characters still came across as caricatures, the novel was capable of making readers <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> modern conditions. In 1969, Indonesian writer and literary critic Ajip Rosidi wrote that the novel was more interesting than earlier works because of its multi-interpretable ending. The Indonesian writer and literary critic Muhammad Balfas wrote in 1976 that Belenggu was [...] "in every respect the best novel of pre-war Indonesian literature". In his 1980 book on Indonesian literature, Teeuw wrote that despite several flaws in the psychological portrayal of the main characters, Belenggu was the only novel from before the Indonesian National Revolution in which a Western reader would feel truly involved; he also called the novel Pane's greatest contribution to Indonesia literature. Tham, writing in 1981, described the novel as the best reflection of the then-growing consciousness that Western values, such as individualism and intellectualism, contradicted traditional values.|$|E

500|$|Goldsmith was {{influenced}} by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. [...] "When you <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, space is a very romantic thought. It is, to me, like the Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of Star Trek," [...] he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using [...] "Ilia's Theme" [...] (later re-recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as [...] "A Star Beyond Time" [...] with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the [...] "Director's Edition" [...] DVD release. Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark).|$|E

Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship to have to be about communicating and understanding each other. Andrew does not take the new direction of the relationship well. Novakovic said that Natasha believes the relationship between her neighbours, Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), is something to be inspired by. She added [...] "That's what she wants to look forward to, but she's getting way ahead of herself. Andrew likes her but he isn't as serious as she is." [...] Novakovic opined that Andrew and Natasha [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and that Natasha's relationship with Andrew had been one of her favourite storylines.|$|E
2500|$|Davey Wreden, 22 {{years old}} at the time of the modification's release, was {{inspired}} to create The Stanley Parable about three years prior, after considering the typical storytelling narratives within video games, and thought of what would happen if the player would go against that narration; Wreden also saw this as a means towards his planned career as a game developer. As a video game player, Wreden has found that most major triple-A titles at the time make numerous assumptions about the player's experience and fitting that within the game, and don't provide answers for [...] "what if" [...] questions that the player may consider. Wreden considered that more recent games with more engaging or thought-provoking stories, including the Metal Gear Solid series, Half-Life 2, Portal, Braid, and BioShock, started to approach this void, giving reason for the player to <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the narration instead of simply going through the motions. Though his initial intent was a personal project simply to try to make such a game that asked the questions about why people play video games, he found that there were other gamers that had been considering the same type of questions. He then set out to make a game that would be the subject of discussion for players after they completed it. According to Wreden, his design document for the game was [...] "Mess with the player's head in every way possible, throwing them off-guard, or pretending there's an answer and then kinda whisking it away from in front of them." ...|$|E

40|$|How to Be a ‘Proper’ Women in the Time of AIDS {{is written}} {{as a piece}} of music for {{multiple}} voices. The voices of Katja Jassey and Stella Nyanzi – both professional women, both mothers, both anthropologists, one European, one African – are intertwined with the voices of other women (and men) telling about their lives coping with AIDS and/or struggling against the epidemic.   Personal storylines and interviews are interspersed with analytical reflections and a string of amazing photographs of African HIV/AIDS billboard posters, captured by Suzy Bernstein. Unconventional questions are posed: What kind of sexuality is portrayed in the anti-HIV/AIDS campaigns? Why is there such an absence of messages that would include or make sense to those living with HIV? What {{does it mean to be}} a ‘proper’ woman in the time of AIDS? The authors decided that instead of producing yet another publication citing the number of people infected, they would reflect on their own stories and professional experience, how they had come to <b>think</b> <b>and</b> react to HIV, and how their different positions influenced their understandings.

40|$|In this workshop, I invite {{participants}} to investigate {{different ways of}} performing the real in public spaces and places for activist purposes, including the different effects of more and less metaphoric representations of the real in prompting passersby to <b>stop,</b> look <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the political statement the performer makes, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> in the short, medium or long term. The workshop is offered in parallel with a keynote presentation, It’s A Social Experiment – Pranks, Political Activism, and Performing Marginality for a Politically Correct Mainstream Audience - In this paper, I investigate the phenomenon of so-called ‘social experiments,’ where pranksters perform stigmatised identities in public spaces and places - from breastfeeding mothers, to muslim women wearing burqas, to disabled people using canes, crutches and wheelchairs – to prompt a response from passersby. Though cast as politicised performances of the real designed {{to draw attention to}} the prejudices of the average passerby, the structure of these ‘social experiments,’ frequently focused on candid camera style pranks they film, and upload on social media for all to see, with the hope of going viral and getting a run on morning television, raises performative, political and ethical questions. In this paper, I unpack some of these questions, using examples of social experiments focused on (dis) ability, race, religion, and gender identity. I examine some of the different effects these social experiments can produce, depending on whether they are performed by actors, pranksters or political activists, and whether they are performed by people who really occupy the stigmatised identity they perform or people who are simply wanting to say something about a fraught social topic. I ask whether these social experiments, when they go viral online, produce bonding social capital within communities impacted by current social prejudices, bridging social capital between these and broader communities, both, or neither...|$|R
