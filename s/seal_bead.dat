50|$|The {{people of}} Lothal made {{significant}} and often unique contributions to human civilisation in the Indus era, {{in the fields}} of city planning, art, architecture, science, engineering, pottery and religion. Their work in metallurgy, <b>seals,</b> <b>beads</b> and jewellery was the basis of their prosperity.|$|R
50|$|This period {{represents}} the Gupta and late Gupta phase. The phase yielded {{remains of a}} massive brick structure of a temple called Govinda Bhita, located close to the fort-city, belonging to the late Gupta period, {{as well as other}} brick structures - houses, floors, streets in the city, and huge antiquities, including terracotta plaques of the characteristic style, <b>seals,</b> <b>beads</b> of terracotta, glass and semi-precious stones, terracotta balls, copper and iron objects and stamped wares.|$|R
50|$|Excavation was {{initiated}} in 1989 by the Archaeological Survey of India {{under the direction}} of R. S. Bisht, and there were 13 field excavations between 1990 and 2005. The excavation brought to light the urban planning and architecture, and unearthed large numbers of antiquities such as <b>seals,</b> <b>beads,</b> animal bones, gold, silver, terracotta ornaments, pottery and bronze vessels. Archaeologists believe that Dholavira was an important centre of trade between settlements in south Gujarat, Sindh and Punjab and Western Asia.|$|R

An adaptor, used to secure the receiving jack, extends from the securing point to meet the sleeve, thereby completely encircling the connection. A <b>sealing</b> <b>bead</b> may be provided on the inner surface of the sleeve to engage the adaptor and seal out moisture, dust, and other corrosive contaminants.

50|$|The Liquid Elastomer Molding (LEM) gasket {{consists}} of a metallic core, coated in selected areas {{on both sides with}} a thin layer of silicone with molded-in <b>sealing</b> <b>beads.</b> These beads have differing heights and widths dependent on the clamping load distribution and application requirements. The base elastomer coating provides a good overall micro-seal with the silicone <b>beads</b> ensuring optimum <b>sealing</b> in the critical areas. LEM can also include molding on its edge either for sealing of high pressure fluids or for T joints between mating flanges.|$|R
25|$|Most {{city dwellers}} {{appear to have}} been traders or artisans, who lived with others {{pursuing}} the same occupation in well-defined neighbourhoods. Materials from distant regions were used in the cities for constructing <b>seals,</b> <b>beads</b> and other objects. Among the artefacts discovered were beautiful glazed faïence <b>beads.</b> Steatite <b>seals</b> have images of animals, people (perhaps gods), and other types of inscriptions, including the yet un-deciphered writing system of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Some of the seals were used to stamp clay on trade goods and most probably had other uses as well.|$|R
50|$|The third {{occurrence}} of theft {{was in the}} underground storage rooms, where evidence pointed to an inside job. The thieves attempted to steal the most easily transportable objects, which had been intentionally stored in the most remote location possible. Of the four rooms, the only portion disturbed was a single corner in the furthest room, where cabinets contained 100 small boxes containing cylinder <b>seals,</b> <b>beads,</b> and jewelry. Evidence indicated that the thieves possessed keys to the cabinets but dropped them in the dark. Instead, they stole 10,000 small objects that were lying in plastic boxes on the floor. Of them, nearly 2,500 have been recovered.|$|R
50|$|This complex {{has five}} mounds. Three {{of them are}} large and rest two are small. The small monastery is 49 meters north-south and east-west 46 meters. There are six rooms of the monks in the four-arm of it. Front side of the rooms is {{surrounded}} by a veranda and there is an entrance {{in the middle of the}} east side. The big monastery also looks like the small monastery, but is larger in area and has more rooms. There is an open space among the surroundings of the small rooms of the monks. It seems there was an auditorium in the open space. Nearly 800 antique have been found here. Among them miniature statues, plaques and <b>seals,</b> <b>beads</b> of precious stones, ornamental bricks and tablets, clay lamps, including vessel fragments are notable.|$|R
50|$|The {{term for}} it in the Egyptian {{language}} is ḫsbḏ-ỉrjt, which means artificial lapis lazuli (hsbd). It was used in antiquity as a blue pigment to color a variety of different media such as stone, wood, plaster, papyrus, and canvas, and in the production of numerous objects, including cylinder <b>seals,</b> <b>beads,</b> scarabs, inlays, pots, and statuettes. It is also sometimes referred to in Egyptological literature as blue frit. Some have argued that this is an erroneous term that should be reserved for use to describe the initial phase of glass or glaze production, while others argue that Egyptian blue is a frit in both the fine and coarse form since it is a product of solid state reaction. Its characteristic blue color, resulting from one of its main components—copper—ranges from a light to a dark hue, depending on differential processing and composition.|$|R
50|$|A large {{building}} complex, unicorn <b>seal,</b> shell bangles, <b>beads,</b> copper bangles, needles, antimony rods, steatite micro beads; pottery include {{large and}} medium size jars, beaker, dishes, dish-on-stand, perforated jars etc.; fine red pottery with black painted designs etc. were found during 1980-81 excavations. Animal remains of cattle, buffalo, fish, sheep, wild pig and rabbit were also found.|$|R
40|$|Lay down of {{viscoelastic}} fluids {{is common}} in several manufacturing processes. In the automotive industry, sealing material is sprayed onto the vehicle body to prevent water leakage into cavities and to reduce noise. To predict the deposition and lower the environmental impact by reducing material consumption, a detailed physical understanding of the process is important. In this work the resulting surface multi-phase flow is modeled and simulated in IBOFlow, the in-house multi-phase flow solver at the Fraunhofer-Chalmers Centre. In the solver the two phase flow is modelled by the volume of fluid method and the viscoelastic fluid by a general Carreu rheology model. In the solver the scanned or CAD geometry is handled by the hybrid immersed boundary method and the material interface is resolved by the adaptive anisotropic octree grid. The resulting hanging octree and triangular nodes along the geometry are automatically handled by the immersed boundary method. To boost the computational performance the simulation domain is in a novel way dynamically divided into an active and an inactive part. The governing equations are only assembled and solved for in the active part, which {{is determined by the}} local position of the injection nozzle. The interface between the active and the inactive cells are handled by symmetry boundary conditions and the pressure is always set for a point inside the active domain. The sealing lay down simulation is successfully validated for a number of real <b>sealing</b> <b>beads</b> on a plate and on a Volvo V 40 vehicle. Finally, the importance of resolving the nozzle in the simulation is investigated for a static case...|$|R
25|$|Most modern tubes have glass {{envelope}}s, but metal, {{fused quartz}} (silica) and ceramic {{have also been}} used. A first version of the 6L6 used a metal envelope <b>sealed</b> with glass <b>beads,</b> while a glass disk fused to the metal was used in later versions. Metal and ceramic are used almost exclusively for power tubes above 2kW dissipation. The nuvistor was a modern receiving tube using a very small metal and ceramic package.|$|R
50|$|A huge {{circular}} {{structure on}} the site {{is believed to be}} a grave or memorial, although it contained no skeletons or other human remains. The structure consists of ten radial mud-brick walls built {{in the shape of a}} spoked wheel. A soft sandstone sculpture of a male with phallus erectus but head and feet below ankle truncated was found in the passageway of the eastern gate. Many funerary structures have been found (although all but one were devoid of skeletons), as well as pottery pieces, terra cotta <b>seals,</b> bangles, rings, <b>beads,</b> and intaglio engravings.|$|R
50|$|The Harvard {{excavation}} of Samaria, {{which began in}} 1908, was headed by Egyptologist George Andrew Reisner. The findings included Hebrew, Aramaic, cuneiform and Greek inscriptions, as well as pottery remains, coins, sculpture, figurines, scarabs and <b>seals,</b> faience, amulets, <b>beads</b> and glass. The joint British-American-Hebrew University excavation continued under John Winter Crowfoot in 1931-35, during which some of the chronology issues were resolved. The round towers lining the acropolis {{were found to be}} Hellenistic, the street of columns was dated to the 3-4th century, and 70 inscribed potsherds were dated to the early 8th century.|$|R
50|$|The Itnegs’ {{marriage}} {{are arranged}} {{by the parents}} and are usually between distant relatives {{in order to keep}} the family close knit and the family wealth within the kinship group. The parents select a bride for their son when he is six to eight years old, and the proposal is done to the parents of the girl. If accepted, the engagement is <b>sealed</b> by tying <b>beads</b> around the girl’s waist as a sign of engagement. A bride price is also paid to the bride’s family, half during the pakalon and the rest during the actual wedding. No celebration accompanies the Itneg wedding and the guests leave right after the ceremony.|$|R
50|$|During the excavations, {{traces of}} foundations, brick walls, floors, post-holes, fallen roofs and a ring well were discovered. The {{artifacts}} found {{from the site}} included punch-marked coins, copper coins of the Satavahanas and the Kshatrapas; a few terracotta bullae with legends in Greek; coin moulds and <b>seals.</b> About 2000 <b>beads</b> made of terracotta, glass, shell and semi-precious stones were also found. A large number of terracotta, iron, copper and ivory objects were found from the site.The other important items found at site compromised: scores of human and animal figurines; ivory and shell bangles; terracotta ear ornaments; saddle querns with Buddhist symbols and burnt grains which compromised wheat, Jowar, gram, ber and rice.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{technical}} {{details of a}} broadband microwave spectrometer for mea-suring the complex conductance of thin films covering the range from 50 MHz up to 16 GHz in the temperature range 300 mK to 6 K and at applied magnetic fields up to 8 Tesla. We measure the complex reflection from a sample terminating a coaxial transmission line and calibrate the signals with three standards with known reflection coefficients. Thermal isolation of the heat load from the inner conductor is accomplished by including a section of NbTi superconducting cable (transition temperature around 8 − 9 K) and hermetic <b>seal</b> glass <b>bead</b> adapters. This enables us to stabilize the base temperature of the sample stage at 300 mK. However, the inclusion of this superconducting cable complicates the calibration procedure. We document {{the effects of the}} superconducting cable on our calibration procedure and the effects of applied magnetic fields and how we control the temperature with great repeatability for each measurement. We have successfully extracted reliable data in this frequency, temperature and field range for thin superconducting films and highly resistive graphene samples. PACS numbers: 07. 57. Pt, 78. 70.

40|$|We {{have used}} optical {{tweezers}} {{to identify the}} elementary events underlying force generation in neuronal lamellipodia. When an optically trapped <b>bead</b> <b>seals</b> on the lamellipodium membrane, Brownian fluctuations decrease revealing the underlying elementary events. The distribution of bead velocities has long tails with frequent large positive and negative values associated to forward and backward jumps occurring in 0. 1 – 0. 2  ms with varying amplitudes up to 20  nm. Jump frequency and amplitude are reduced when actin turnover is slowed down {{by the addition of}} 25  nM Jasplakinolide. When myosin II is inhibited by the addition of 20 μM Blebbistatin, jump frequency is reduced but to a lesser extent than by Jasplainolide. These jumps constitute the elementary events underlying force generation...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of a novel, flexible, photocatalytic, oxygen-scavenging polymer film is described. The film incorporates nanocrystalline titania particles in an ethyl cellulose polymer film, {{with or without}} an added sacrificial electron donor of triethanolamine. When coated {{on the inside of}} a glass vessel its UV-driven light-scavenging action is demonstrated by platinum octaethyl porphyrin coated glass <b>beads</b> <b>sealed</b> inside, since their luminescence increases with increasing UV-irradiation time. When used as a flexible film, work with an oxygen electrode shows that the film is able to scavenge oxygen at an average rate of 0. 017 cm 3 O 2 h− 1 cm− 2 over a 24 h period, which compares favourably to other, well-established oxygen-scavenger systems. The potential of using such as system for oxygen scavenging in packaging is discussed briefly...|$|R
50|$|Activity of {{masters in}} artistic {{handling}} of metal in Caucasian Albania and in creation of samples of jewelry art, archaeological materials, consisting of rich variety of creations of jewelry art, makes to characterize {{such kind of}} arts {{as one of the}} most developed kinds of arts of that period. Different earrings, diadems, necklaces, beads, pendants, fibulas, buttons, clasps, bracelets, seal rings, belt buckles, belt sets and others gives a good presentation about a large diapason of creativity of jewelers of Caucasian Albania. Two periods can be distinguished in development of jewelry art in Caucasian Albania: the first from the 4th century BC - 1st century AD and the second from the 1st - 7th centuries AD. Production of such kinds of jewelry art as pendants, plaques, buttons, earrings, diadems, necklaces, bracelets and others are typical for the first period. The second period is considered the most developed because of richness of artistic and plastic forms and for use of different technology. For example, 22 burials were opened on the left shore of the Kura River, in Sudagylan (near Mingachevir), in during 1949-1950, in log cabins. Jewelry items made of gold and silver, golden <b>beads,</b> <b>seal</b> rings with mounting seals are also enumerated in report.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} the nature of {{interactions}} and trade between the greater Indus Valley and eastern Arabia during the third millennium BC. The role of Indus trade in eastern Arabia has often been discussed in the general picture of local cultural and economic developments during the Bronze Age, but the organization and mechanism of this important phenomenon are not yet precisely decoded. New evidence from the stone tower ST 1 excavated at Salut, Sultanate of Oman, by the Italian Mission to Oman in collaboration with the Office of the Adviser to His Majesty the Sultan for Cultural Affairs, provided solid information for proposing updated models of transcultural economic interaction. The collection of Indus and Indus-related artefacts from ST 1 testifies to an early integration of sites located in the interior of central Oman, within the network of long-distance connections that directly linked the Indus regions with the western shores of the Arabian Sea. The presence {{of a wide range of}} Indus pottery types, including utilitarian pottery and specific forms used for food production and presentation, suggests that some degree of cultural interaction occurred along with the expansion of trade. The discovery of Indus <b>seals</b> and carnelian <b>beads</b> possibly manufactured with non-Indus raw materials further supports the hypothesis that merchants and craftsmen from the Indus Valley were living and working in interior Oman during the second half of the third millennium BC. The evidence from ST 1 also provides support for similar discoveries from other excavations in Oman and the UAE, suggesting that the interaction between Indus communities and eastern Arabia was much more extensive than previously thought...|$|R
5000|$|The Neolithic {{people in}} the Nile Valley likely came from Sudan, {{as well as the}} Sahara, and there was shared culture with the two areas and with that of Egypt during this period. By the 5th {{millennium}} BC, the people who inhabited what is now called Nubia participated in the Neolithic revolution. Saharan rock reliefs depict scenes that have been thought to be suggestive of a cattle cult, typical of those seen throughout parts of Eastern Africa and the Nile Valley even to this day. Megaliths discovered at Nabta Playa are early examples of what seems {{to be one of the}} world's first astronomical devices, predating Stonehenge by almost 2,000 years. This complexity as observed at Nabta Playa, and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Around 3500 BC, the second [...] "Nubian" [...] culture, termed the A-Group, arose. It was a contemporary of, and ethnically and culturally very similar to, the polities in predynastic Naqada of Upper Egypt. The A-Group people were engaged in trade with the Egyptians. This trade is testified archaeologically by large amounts of Egyptian commodities deposited in the graves of the A-Group people. The imports consisted of gold objects, copper tools, faience amulets and <b>beads,</b> <b>seals,</b> slate palettes, stone vessels, and a variety of pots. Around 3300 BC, there is evidence of a unified kingdom, as shown by the finds at Qustul, that maintained substantial interactions (both cultural and genetic) with the culture of Naqadan Upper Egypt. The Nubian culture may have even contributed to the unification of the Nile Valley.|$|R
40|$|The Endoblend device {{concept was}} {{developed}} by a 2. 75 design team,of which I was a member; {{the purpose of the}} device is to remove tissue laparoscopically. The detailed design of one of its modules, the enclosure module, {{is the subject of this}} paper. The Endoblend has the potential to reduce morcellation surgery time from upwards of half an hour to minutes, with reduced risk of the most common complications of nicking the abdomen wall and leaving tissue behind. There are three primary functional requirements of the enclosure module. First, for ease of use, simplicity, and safety the bag and guard in combination must passively feed the tissue into the blades. This was accomplished using, a cone shape to make the bottom of the bag act as an equilibrium state through a gravity feed. Second, the bag must remain intact to prevent tissue from being left behind. To accomplish this it will be shaped with a flat region near the blades so that inflating the bag keeps it away from the blades, and the Ziploc type seal through which the tissue enters will be a double <b>seal</b> with micro <b>beads</b> of cyanocrolate to make a strong permanent seal. (cont.) Third, since the main benefit of the Endoblend is shorter surgery time, it is vital that the extra steps incurred from use of the enclosure module do not take up a significant portion of the time saved by its rapid tissue processing capabilities. The prototype bag met these functional requirements, and was used to successfully process tissue in a bench-top experiment. The successful design and integration of the enclosure module will allow this project to continue moving forward. This thesis along with the thesis on the guard answered the remaining critical questions that preceded putting together a next iteration prototype to use in order to perform animal tests. by Daniel Hernandez-Stewart.
