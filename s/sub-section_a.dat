To overcome this issue, one can add forward error correction (FEC). In this work, we focus on FEC schemes enabling iterative decoding (e.g., LDPC, turbo codes) due to their good performance at an affordable computational complexity.|$|E

In order to understand the context for local initiatives – and the limits in which they must operate – this section also briefly describes the main elements of the Italian immigration policy. It is followed by an overview of local labour market in Italy (sub-section 1. 3), and a description of the labour market and social situation of migrants’ integration into the Italian local labour market. The main problems to the integration of migrants, Roma people, and national minorities are mentioned in sub-section 1. 4...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{proliferation}} {{in recent years}} of literature and scholarship which explore yet another 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 facet of the Vietnam war, women veterans remain largely invisible in academic research. With a few recent exceptions, if mentioned at all they are relegated to a chapter, a <b>sub-section,</b> <b>a</b> paragraph, or even a sentence or two. Unfortunately, this neglect {{is not limited to}} academia: veterans 2 ̆ 7 administrations, counseling centers, the courts, the general public, and the military organizations in which they served are just beginning {{to address the needs of}} women veterans. ^ This dissertation undertakes a tripartite research agenda: to obtain missing information about the experiences of U. S. women in the Vietnam war; to examine the epistemological causes of their invisibility in research and its consequences in their lives; and to explore several hypotheses concerning relationships between gender-specific aspects of women veterans experiences and the development and manifestation of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other war-related problems. Primary focus is given to the first area in this dissertation. The second and third areas are explored here on a preliminary basis and constitute the groundwork for the research I plan to pursue in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of pavement performance models {{is a critical}} component of a multi-year analysis within a pavement management system (PMS). The paper describes an empirical-mechanistic roughness progression model, as function of loads, climate conditions, structural layout, overall construction quality and material properties that has been implemented in a computer program. The analysis is performed by dividing the road section into 0. 30 m long sub-sections. Material properties and layers thickness’ variations are described through a second order autoregressive process and assigned to each <b>sub-section.</b> <b>A</b> starting profile is randomly assigned to road section basing on construction specifications. The computer simulation is performed through an step-by-step process; during each time step the program calculates the dynamic loads, the stress and the permanent deformation induced by 16 types of heavy vehicles in each sub-section, according to 8 daily climatic conditions (every three hours). At the end of the step, the total rutting and the degradation of asphalt modulus due to fatigue cracking is calculated for each sub-section, the profile is updated and the IRI index of the road section is evaluated. Roughness deterioration curves derived in such manner highlight that daily temperature variations seems to {{play a critical role in}} the evaluation of roughness and rutting progression. Furthermore, a comparison with curves developed through empirical models proposed by world bank has shown a fairly good agreement...|$|E
