5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. <b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about {{the constitutionality of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
25|$|In {{the face}} of budget pressure, hiring {{challenges}} and some high-profile lapses in its protective service role in 2014, the Brookings Institution and <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> are asking whether the agency's focus should shift more to the protective mission, leaving more of its original mission to other agencies.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{accused the}} FBI of {{misleading}} Justice officials about Presser's {{role as a}} criminal informant, FBI Director William H. Webster revealed that he had informed Attorney General William French Smith about Presser's role in May 1983, and that {{on at least two}} other occasions that year DOL and DOJ investigators in Cleveland were told Presser was an FBI source.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Congress</b> have {{proposed}} prohibiting certain child modeling sites. Some states are considering similar legislation.

50|$|Yates did {{not rule}} the Smith Act unconstitutional, but limited its {{application}} {{to such a degree}} that it became nearly unenforceable. The Yates decision outraged <b>some</b> conservative <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> who introduced legislation to limit judicial review of certain sentences related to sedition and treason, which did not pass.|$|R
50|$|Hilaria Supa {{was elected}} to the Peruvian Congress in 2006, taking the oath in Quechua, {{followed}} by her fellow Congresswoman María Sumire.

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{have tried}} to create a federal usury statute that would limit the maximum {{allowable}} interest rate, but the measures have not progressed. In July 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, {{was signed into law}} by President Obama. The act provides for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate some credit practices but has no interest rate limit.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{is split}} into two chambers—House and Senate—and manages the task of writing {{national}} legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas. <b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary {{organizations such as the}} Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{were taking}} action to {{reschedule}} the drug legislatively. In 1981, the late Rep. Stuart McKinney {{introduced a bill}} to transfer cannabis to Schedule II. It was co-sponsored by a bipartisan coalition of 84 House members, including prominent Republicans Newt Gingrich (GA), Bill McCollum (FL), John Porter (IL), and Frank Wolf (VA). After the bill died in committee, Rep. Barney Frank began annually introducing nearly identical legislation. All of Frank's bills have suffered the same fate, though, without attracting {{more than a handful}} of co-sponsors.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s and through the 1960s, Congress reacted to {{increasing}} public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment. Senator James E. Murray introduced a bill, the Resources and Conservation Act of 1959, in the 86th Congress. The 1962 publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson alerted {{the public about the}} detrimental effects on the environment of the indiscriminate use of pesticides. In the years following, similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and Congress's potential responses. In 1968, a joint House-Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Senator Henry M. Jackson, and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Representative George Miller, to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy. In the colloquium, <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalyst}} for the USA PATRIOT Act occurred on September 11, 2001 when terrorists attacked and destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City and {{the western side of}} the Pentagon near Washington D.C. Within a few weeks of the September 11 attacks, a number of bills attempting to make changes to anti-terrorism laws were introduced into Congress. After the USA PATRIOT Act was passed it remained controversial, and began to be questioned by <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> A number of sections were struck by the courts. Some provisions were challenged by the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit on April 9, 2004. In April 2005, a Senate Judicial Hearing on the Patriot Act was held. The Act was as controversial as ever, {{and more than a few}} groups were campaigning against it. Aside from the EFF, the ACLU, the CDT and the EPIC, the Act had raised the ire of the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Booksellers Foundation for Freedom of Expression, who were all extremely concerned about the provisions of the Patriot Act.|$|E
50|$|Bush {{explains}} {{how he had}} to have long conversations with <b>some</b> Republican <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> during the financial crisis of 2008, who were reluctant to support the bailout. Bush expressed to them his anger that the government had to take such a drastic measure but reminded them that he is supporting the bailout because he felt a risk of an economic depression was not worth taking.|$|R
50|$|The {{documentary}} {{included a}} segment featuring {{the introduction of}} an HIV-positive character on the South African version of Sesame Street, noting the short-lived negative reaction <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. <b>Congress</b> to the character.|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} as to whether an individual is disabled is made by the various state Disability Determination Services (DDS), which contract with the federal government to make such determinations. Although the DDS's are state agencies, they follow federal rules. This arrangement arose from the inception of OASDI, when <b>some</b> key <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> considered the Social Security Disability program should be administered employing federalism, fearing expansion of the federal government.|$|R
25|$|In the US, Huawei {{has been}} {{challenged}} by various entities of the American government and security officials that Huawei-made telecommunications equipment is designed to allow unauthorized access by the Chinese government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, given that Ren Zhengfei, {{the founder of the}} company, served as an engineer in the army in the early 1980s. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party raised concerns about security over Huawei’s bid for Marconi in 2005, and the company's equipment was mentioned as an alleged potential threat in a 2009 government briefing by Alex Allan, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. In December 2010, Huawei opened a Cyber Security Evaluation Centre to test its hardware and software to ensure they can withstand growing cyber security threats. In the U.S., <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> raised questions about the company's proposed merger with communications company 3Com in 2008, and its bid for a Sprint contract in 2010. In addition, Huawei withdrew its purchase of 3Leaf systems in 2010, following a review by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS).|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Oak Ridge {{was still}} part of [...] "an island of {{socialism}} {{in the midst of}} a free enterprise economy". The AEC pressed forward with plans to withdraw from running the community, but it could never be too fast for <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> AEC officials repeatedly explained how Roane-Anderson provided far more than regular municipal services. For the residents, the benefits of a free enterprise economy were slight. They enjoyed low rents and no property taxes, but high standards of services and an excellent school system. Oak Ridge City Historian William J. Wilcox, Jr. noted that the townspeople [...] "thoroughly enjoyed their much protected existence and the benevolence the Army had provided". A straw poll of the residents on opening the gates showed them opposed, 10 to 1.|$|E
500|$|Washington's loss at Philadelphia {{prompted}} <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{to consider}} removing Washington from command. This movement termed the Conway Cabal, failed after Washington's supporters rallied behind him. Biographer Alden relates, [...] "it {{was inevitable that}} the defeats of Washington's forces and the concurrent victory of the forces in upper New York should be compared." [...] The zealous admiration of Washington indeed inevitably waned. John Adams was never {{a fan of the}} southern delegation to the Continental Congress, and he wrote that [...] "Congress will appoint a thanksgiving; and one cause of it ought to be that the glory of turning the tide of arms is not immediately due to the commander-in-chief nor to southern troops. If it had been, idolatry and adulation would have been unbounded.... Now we can allow a certain citizen to be wise, virtuous, and good, without thinking him a deity or a savior." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2003, one of Sesame Street's {{international}} co-productions, Takalani Sesame, {{caused some}} {{controversy in the}} US when the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, was created in response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic. It {{marked the first time}} AIDS and the goal of confronting the disease's stigma was included in a preschool curriculum. According to the documentary, The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. <b>Some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop, and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, [...] "The reaction we got in the US blew me away. I didn't expect people to be so horrible... and hateful and mean". The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and prominent minister and conservative political commentator Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts. Kami went on to be named UNICEF's Champion for Children in November 2003.|$|E
500|$|As World War II engulfed Europe, Congress {{authorized}} {{an increase}} to 2,496 cadets in 1942 and began graduating classes early. The class of 1943 graduated six months early in January 1943, {{and the next}} four classes graduated after only three years. To accommodate this accelerated schedule, summer training was formally moved to a recently acquired piece of land southwest of main post. The site would later become Camp Buckner. The academy had its last serious brush with abolition or major reform during the war, when <b>some</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> charged that even the accelerated curriculum allowed young men to [...] "hide out" [...] at West Point and avoid combat duty. A proposal was put forth to convert the academy to an officer's training school with a six-month schedule, {{but this was not}} adopted. West Point played a prominent role in WWII; four out of five of the five-star generals were alumni and nearly 500graduates died. Immediately following the war in 1945, Maxwell Taylor (class of 1922) became superintendent. He expanded and modernized the academic program and abolished antiquated courses in fencing and horsemanship.|$|E
500|$|In 2001 the Workshop {{introduced}} Sesame English, {{a series}} focused on teaching {{children and their}} families the basics of the English language and on familiarizing them with some aspects of American culture. As of 2009 it aired in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Italy. In 2003, in response to the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, the co-producers of Takalani Sesame included the first preschool AIDS/HIV curriculum. They created the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, to confront the stigma of HIV and AIDS in South Africa.
