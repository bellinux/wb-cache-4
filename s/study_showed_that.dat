5|$|Growling: Often {{accompanied}} by hissing and spitting, the cheetah growls {{to show its}} annoyance, or when faced with danger. A <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> growls consist of numerous short pulses with a combined duration of up to five seconds.|$|E
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that,</b> in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> 16% of Armenians born in Lebanon, 29% in Armenia (including Soviet Armenia), 31% in Iran and 36% in Turkey are not {{proficient}} in English. Many foreign-born Armenians are multilingual, speaking {{at least one}} language other than Armenian and English. For instance, Armenians from Armenia might know Russian, those from Lebanon and Syria may know Arabic and French, almost all Iranian Armenians speak Persian and Istanbul Armenians speak Turkish.|$|E

5|$|A Scottish <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> {{mortality}} in common house martins occurred mostly outside the breeding season and averaged 57%. Females that had raised two clutches {{in a season}} had a higher mortality than those that were single-brooded, {{but there was no}} such correlation for the males.|$|E
5|$|Broods {{that fail}} {{tend to do}} so during incubation. One English <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> only 14.5% of eggs survived to hatching, but once that stage was reached the chances of {{fledging}} successfully were high. European nightjars breed when aged one year, and typically live for four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12years.|$|E
5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this sound {{is similar to that}} of the chirp. It may {{resemble}} a growl. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 and 1986, {{legislation}} was proposed to restore commuter service between New Haven and New London, {{as well as}} between New Haven and Hartford. A 1986 ConnDOT study analyzed congestion on Interstate 95, which runs parallel to the line. The <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Old Saybrook was a better terminus for initial service, with an expected ridership of 420 riders in each direction daily.|$|E
5|$|Spiders often attach {{highly visible}} silk bands, called decorations or stabilimenta, to their webs. Field {{research}} suggests that webs with more decorative bands captured more prey per hour. However, a laboratory <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> spiders reduce the building of these decorations if they sense the presence of predators.|$|E

5|$|The {{eruption}} {{was used}} as an example for psychiatric recuperation after natural disasters by Robert Desjarlais and Leon Eisenberg in their work World Mental Health: Problems and Priorities in Low-Income Countries. The authors were concerned that only initial treatment for the survivors' psychological trauma was conducted. One <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the victims of the eruption suffered from anxiety and depression, which can lead to alcohol abuse, marital problems and other social issues.|$|E

5|$|When {{dispersed}} on conductive materials, palladium is {{an excellent}} electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media. In 2010, palladium-catalysed organic reactions were recognised by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis, used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations. A 2008 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> palladium is an effective catalyst for carbon-fluoride bonds.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 genetic <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> {{some of the}} woolly mammoths {{that entered}} North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia {{migrated}} back about 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 genetic <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> two {{examined}} {{specimens of}} the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This {{suggests that the}} two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It also suggested that Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii, in areas where their range overlapped.|$|E
5|$|A <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> {{high levels}} of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.|$|E

5|$|Across {{most of its}} European range, {{the most}} {{important}} predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the sparrowhawk. Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the northern goshawk, hobby, tawny owl, pygmy owl and least weasel. A Swedish <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E
5|$|Common ixodid ticks {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus {{has proved to}} be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E
