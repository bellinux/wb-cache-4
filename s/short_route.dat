The following month they were sent north to Mersing, which, situated {{on the east coast}} of the Malay Peninsula, was considered a likely place for a Japanese landing as it offered a <b>short</b> <b>route</b> of advance towards Singapore. At Mersing, the battalion was set to work digging defensive positions and constructing wire obstacles, punctuated by familiarisation patrols and anti-aircraft, anti-gas and mortar training.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The shortest-route problem determines <b>shortest</b> <b>routes</b> {{from one}} node to another. In this paper Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Floyd’s {{algorithm}} to determine <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> between two nodes {{in the network}} are discussed. Some extensions in Floyd’s algorithm have done. We have formulated a <b>shortest</b> <b>route</b> problem as a linear programming problem and solved it as a 0 - 1 integer programming problem. The dual of the formulated linear programming problem {{is also used to}} determine the <b>shortest</b> <b>routes.</b> Complementary Slackness Theorem is used to solve the primal problem from the solution of the dual problem and to determine the shortest distance as well as the <b>shortest</b> <b>routes...</b>|$|R

5|$|The route {{remains on}} a northeast–southwest {{alignment}} to the hamlet of Mecklenburg, where the highway passes some residences ahead of intersections with CR6 and NY79. NY79 and NY228 overlap for one block before NY228 splits {{to the northeast}} at {{the northern edge of}} the community. The overlap with NY79 is the busiest section of NY228, serving an average of 2,556 vehicles per day as of 2009. Outside of Mecklenburg, the road crosses more rural areas in the town of Hector as it heads generally northeastward along Taughannock Creek and approaches the Tompkins County line. The route pulls to within a tenth-mile (0.2km) of the line at the hamlet of Perry City, where NY228 ends at an intersection with NY227. Also present at the junction is CR3, a <b>short</b> <b>route</b> leading east to CR142 at the Tompkins County line.
