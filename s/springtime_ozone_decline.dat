CMAQ/REAS generally reproduced the observed interannual variability of <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan, showing year-to-year variations larger than the annual rate of increase of the long-term trend. We then analyzed {{the influence of the}} interannual variation of meteorology in simulated results by using the fixed emissions for 2000 and meteorological fields for each year. As a reference parameter, we calculated the area-weighted surface pressure anomaly over the Pacific Ocean east of Japan. When the anomaly has a large negative value, polluted air masses from continental Asia tend to be transported directly to Japan by westerly winds. In contrast, when the anomaly has a large positive value, influence of the outflow from continental Asia tends to be small because the westerly components of wind fields around Japan are comparatively weak. Instead, southerly winds are relatively strong and transport clean air masses from the Pacific Ocean to Japan. Consequently, <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan is higher (lower) than in ordinary years when the anomaly has a large negative (positive) value. In general, the interannual variation of <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan is sensitive to the outflow from continental Asia. We also found some correlation between <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, indicating that higher and lower <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan are related to La Niña and El Niño, respectively. Differences in the meridional displacement and diversity of cyclone tracks near Japan between El Niño and La Niña years may be responsible for interannual variations in the <b>springtime</b> boundary layer <b>ozone</b> over Japan...|$|R

Multi-variate regression methods {{are widely used}} for studying the variability and detection of ozone trends. Based on multi-variate regression analysis of total Antarctic <b>springtime</b> vortex <b>ozone</b> {{it has been suggested}} that the observed increase of ozone since the late 1990 s is statistically significant and can be attributed to decreasing stratospheric halogens (Salby et al., 2011, 2012; Kuttippurath et al., 2013). We find that, when considering uncertainties that have not been addressed in these studies, this conclusion on ozone recovery is not warranted. An ensemble of regressions is constructed based on the analysis of uncertainties in the applied ozone record as well as of uncertainties in the various applied regressors. The presented combination of ensemble members spans up the uncertainty range with about 35 million different regressions. The poleward heat flux (Eliassen–Palm Flux) and the effective chlorine loading explain, respectively, most of the short-term and long-term variability in different Antarctic <b>springtime</b> total <b>ozone</b> records. The inclusion in the regression of stratospheric volcanic aerosols, solar variability, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode is shown to increase rather than to decrease the overall uncertainty in the attribution of Antarctic <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> because of large uncertainties in their respective records. Calculating the trend significance for the ozone record from the late 1990 s onwards solely based on the fit of the effective chlorine loading should be avoided, as this does not take fit residuals into account and thereby results in too narrow uncertainty intervals. When taking fit residuals into account, we find that less than 30 % of the regressions in the full ensemble result in a statistically significant positive <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> trend over Antarctica from the late 1990 s to either 2010 or 2012.

The final warming and <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> are each found to depend strongly upon planetary wave activity during the disturbed season. The integrations reproduce their observed dependence, which enters through anomalous upward Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux from the troposphere and equatorial wind associated with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). Of those major influences, changes of upward EP flux are predominant. Changes representative {{of those in the}} observed record alter the timing of the final warming by as much as 1 – 2 months. Much the same lag distinguishes warm and cold winters in the observed record. Accompanying the shift in the final warming is a change of ozone at spring equinox.

40|$|Interannual {{changes of}} <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over the Arctic follow from {{anomalous}} transport and chemical depletion, two mechanisms {{that control the}} wintertime increase of ozone. Attempts to disentangle these contributions to anomalous ozone rest upon the isolation of air over the Arctic. To elucidate changes of Arctic ozone between warm and cold winters, their latitude-height structure is investigated in the solar backscatterd ultraviolet record and then related to contemporaneous changes of dynamical structure in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction record. Structural differences between warm and cold winters imply a major contribution to anomalous Arctic ozone from horizontal transport. Anomalous isentropic mixing by planetary waves appears conspicuously {{in the structure of}} March ozone, which has been driven into coincidence with θ surfaces following warm winters but remains deflected across them following cold winters. In concert with anomalous downwelling of ozone-rich air, this mechanism accounts for at least two thirds of the observed deficit of <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over the Arctic following cold winters. About half of the observed deficit during March is erased during April, when weakening of the vortex following cold winters eventually opens the Arctic to isentropic mixing by planetary waves. Delayed relative to warm winters, isentropic mixing during cold winters ultimately leads to much the same ozone structure. This significantly reduces the anomaly between warm and cold winters from that found a month earlier.

The Arctic mean March total column ozone increases throughout the 21 st century {{at a rate}} of ~ 11. 5 DU decade- 1, and is projected to return to the 1980 level in the late 2030 s. However, the integrations show that even past 2060 <b>springtime</b> Arctic <b>ozone</b> can episodically drop by ~ 50 - 100 DU below the corresponding long-term ensemble mean for that period, reaching values characteristic of the near present day average level. Consistent with the global decline in inorganic chlorine (Cly) over the century, the estimated mean halogen induced chemical ozone loss in the Arctic lower atmosphere in spring decreases by around a factor of two between 1981 - 2000 and 2061 - 2080. However, {{in the presence of a}} cold and strong polar vortex elevated halogen induced ozone losses well above the corresponding long-term mean continue to occur in the simulations into the second part of the century. The ensemble shows a significant cooling trend in the Arctic winter mid- and upper stratosphere, but there is less confidence in the projected temperature trends in the lower stratosphere (100 - 50 hPa). This is partly due to an increase in downwelling over the Arctic polar cap in winter, which increases transport of ozone into the polar region as well as drives adiabatic warming that partly offsets the radiatively-driven stratospheric cooling. However, individual winters characterised by significantly suppressed downwelling, reduced transport and anomalously low temperatures continue to occur in the future. We conclude that despite the projected long-term recovery of Arctic ozone, the large interannual dynamical variability is expected to continue in the future, thereby facilitating episodic reductions in <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> columns.

Long-term trend detection is still a problem, with little historical data available for baseline estimations. Enhanced UV levels are clearly associated with the Antarctic <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> reductions. Measurements show that maximum UV levels at the South Pole are reached well before the summer solstice, and DNA-damaging radiation at Palmer Station, Antarctica (64 degrees S) during the <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion can exceed maximum summer values at San Diego, USA (32 degrees N). UV increases at mid-latitudes are smaller. However, increases associated with the record low ozone column of 1992 / 93 in the Northern Hemisphere are evident when examined on a wavelength-specific basis. Measurements in Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and Australia show relatively high UV levels compared to corresponding Northern Hemispheric latitudes, with differences in both stratospheric ozone and tropospheric pollutants likely to be playing a role. Tropospheric ozone and aerosols can reduce global UV-B irradiances appreciably. At some locations, tropospheric pollution has increased since pre-industrial times, leading to decreases in surface UV radiation. However, recent trends in tropospheric pollution probably had only minor effects on UV trends relative to the effect of stratospheric ozone reductions. Global ozone measurements from satellites over the period 1979 - 1993 imply significant UV-B increases at high and mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, but only small changes in the tropics. Such estimates however assume that cloud cover and tropospheric pollution have remained constant over this time period. Under the current CFC phase-out schedules, global UV levels are predicted to peak {{around the turn of the}} century in association with peak loading of chlorine in the stratosphere and the concomitant ozone reductions.

40|$|The {{ozone hole}} changes {{considerably}} from {{one year to}} the next. It varies between conditions in which <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> is strongly depleted to others in which ozone is only weakly depleted. Those changes are shown to closely track anomalous planetary wave forcing of the residual circulation. The strong coherence with planetary wave forcing is consistent with similar coherence of springtime temperature, which modulates Polar Stratospheric Cloud (PSC). By controlling the lifetime of PSC, anomalous wave forcing determines the net activation of chlorine and bromine and, hence, <b>springtime</b> depletion of <b>ozone</b> during individual years. The strong coherence with planetary wave forcing affords long-range predictability. It supports a seasonal forecast of springtime depletion, which, through the ozone mass deficit, perturbs ozone across much of the Southern Hemisphere during subsequent months of summer. Conditioned upon wintertime wave structure, a hindcast of springtime depletion faithfully predicts the anomalous ozone observed. A reliable forecast of tropospheric planetary waves would thus enable springtime depletion to be predicted. The current evolution of Antarctic ozone is dominated by dynamically-induced changes. Representing its climate variability, those large changes obscure the more gradual evolution of springtime depletion, like that associated with the decline of chlorine. The strong dependence on planetary wave forcing, however, enables dynamically-induced changes of ozone to be identified accurately. Removing them unmasks the secular variation of Antarctic ozone, the part coherent over a decade and longer. Independent of dynamically-induced changes, that component discriminates to changes associated with stratospheric composition. It reveals a gradual but systematic rebound over the last decade. The upward trend is shown to be robust, significant at the 99. 5 % level. Uncertainty in this trend is thus small enough to make the probability of it arising through chance alignment of error less than 0. 5 %.

Mean ozone at the Northern Hemisphere (NH) stations (excluding Summit) is 5 ppbv higher than in Antarctica. Statistical analysis yielded best estimates for the projected year 2005 median annual ozone mixing ratios, which for the Arctic stations were 33. 5 ppbv at Alert, 28. 6 ppbv at Barrow, 46. 3 ppbv ppb at Summit and 33. 7 ppbv at Zeppelinfjellet.

In contrast, at Barrow, <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> has been <b>declining.</b> All coastal stations experience springtime episodes with rapid depletion of ozone in the boundary layer, attributable to photochemically catalyzed ozone depletion from halogen chemistry. This effect is most obvious at Barrow, followed by Alert. Springtime depletion episodes are less pronounced at Antarctic stations. At South Pole, during the Antarctic spring and summer, photochemical ozone production yields frequent episodes with enhanced surface ozone. Other Antarctic stations show similar, though less frequent spring and summertime periods with enhanced ozone. The Antarctic data provide evidence that austral spring and summertime ozone production in Antarctica is widespread, respectively, affects all stations at least through transport events. This ozone production contributes to a several ppbv enhancement in the annual mean ozone over the Antarctic plateau; however, it is not the determining process in the Antarctic seasonal ozone cycle. Although Summit and South Pole have many similarities in their environmental conditions, this ozone production {{does not appear to be}} of equal importance at Summit. Amplitudes of diurnal, summertime ozone cycles at these polar sites are weaker than at lower latitude locations.

However, the Antarctic troposphere is not currently in a “natural” state, being subject nowadays to greatly increased incidences of ultraviolet (UV) radiation each spring. Here we analyze the long-term record of surface ozone at the South Pole (1975 – 2001), to look for evidence of a changing oxidation potential.

40|$|An {{enhanced}} sulfate aerosol layer {{has been}} observed near 25 km accompanying <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion in the Antarctic stratosphere. We use a one-dimensional aerosol model that includes photochemistry, particle nucleation, condensational growth, coagulation, and sedimentation to study {{the origin of the}} layer. Annual cycles of sunlight, temperature, and ozone are incorporated into the model. Our results indicate that binary homogeneous nucleation leads to the formation of very small droplets of sulfuric acid and water under conditions of low temperature and production of H 2 SO 4 following polar sunrise. Photodissociation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) alone, however, cannot provide sufficient SO 2 to create the observed condensation nuclei (CN) layer. When subsidence of SO 2 from very high altitudes in the polar night vortex is incorporated into the model, the CN layer is reasonably reproduced. The model predictions, based on the subsidence in polar vortex, agree with in situ measurements of particle concentration, vertical distribution, and persistence during polar spring...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} MASH {{project is}} to study the {{dynamics}} of the middle atmosphere in the Southern Hemisphere, emphasizing inter-hemispheric differences. Both observational data and data from simulations with numerical models are being used. It is intended that MASH will be complemented by parallel studies on the transport and photochemistry of trace species in the Southern Hemisphere. Impetus for such studies has come from the unexpected finding of a <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> hole over Antarctica. A summary of recent progress with the MASH project is given. Data from polar orbiting satellites are used to discuss the large scale circulation found in the Southern Hemisphere at extratropical latitudes. Comparisons are made with that of the Northern Hemisphere. Particular attention is paid to the springtime final warming, the most spectacular large scale phenomenon in the statosphere of the Southern Hemisphere. The circulation before and after this event has {{to be taken into account}} in theories for the formation and subsequent disappearance of the ozone hole...|$|R
40|$|Temporal autocorrelations of monthly mean {{total ozone}} {{anomalies}} over the 35 – 60 °S and 35 – 60 °N latitude bands reveal that anomalies established in the wintertime midlatitude ozone buildup persist (with photochemical decay) {{until the end of}} the following autumn, and then are rapidly erased once the next winter's buildup begins. The photochemical decay rate is found to be identical between the two hemispheres. High predictability of ozone through late summer exists based on the late-spring values. In the northern hemisphere, extending the 1979 – 2001 <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> trend to other months through regression based on the seasonal persistence of anomalies captures the seasonality of the ozone trends remarkably well. In the southern hemisphere, the springtime trend only accounts for part of the summertime trends. There is a strong correlation between the ozone anomalies in northern hemisphere spring and those in the subsequent southern hemisphere spring, but not the converse...|$|R

40|$|In 1985, {{there was}} a report of a large, sudden, and unanticipated {{decrease}} in the abundance of <b>springtime</b> Antarctic <b>ozone</b> over the last decade. By 1987, ozone decreases of more than 50 percent in the total column, and 95 percent locally between 15 and 20 km, had been observed. The scientific community quickly rose to the challenge of explaining this remarkable discovery; theoreticians soon developed a series of chemical and dynamical hypotheses to explain the ozone loss. Three basic theories were proposed to explain the <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> hole. (1) The ozone hole is caused by the increasing atmospheric loadings of manmade chemicals containing chlorine (chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) and bromine (halons)). These chemicals efficiently destroy ozone in the lower stratosphere in the Antarctic because of the special geophysical conditions, of an isolated air mass (polar vortex) with very cold temperatures, that exist there. (2) The circulation of the atmosphere in spring has changed from being predominantly downward over Antarctica to upward. This would mean that ozone poor air from the troposphere, instead of ozone rich air from the upper stratosphere, would be transported into the lower Antarctic stratosphere. (3) The abundance of the oxides of nitrogen in the lower Antarctic stratosphere is periodically enhanced by solar activity. Nitrogen oxides are produced in the upper mesosphere and thermosphere and then transported downward into the lower stratosphere in Antarctica, resulting in the chemical destruction of ozone. The climatology and trends of ozone, temperature, and polar stratospheric clouds are discussed. Also, the transport and chemical theories for the Antarctic ozone hole are presented...|$|R
40|$|In the Arctic stratosphere, total column ozone in {{the spring}} can vary, from year to year, {{by as much as}} 30 %. This large interannual variability, however, is absent from many present-generation climate models, in which the {{prescribed}} seasonal cycle of stratospheric ozone includes, at best, smooth multi-decadal trends. We here investigate the extent to which interannual variability in Arctic stratospheric ozone is able to affect the surface climate of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. We do this by contrasting pairs of model integrations with positive and negative <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> anomalies, using a simple yet widely used climate model. For ozone anomaly amplitudes somewhat larger than the recent observed variability, we find a significant influence on the tropospheric circulation, and the surface temperatures and precipitation patterns. More interestingly, these impacts have very clear regional patterns—they are largest over the North Atlantic sector—even though the prescribed ozone anomalies are zonally symmetric. However, confirming other studies, for ozone anomaly amplitudes within the observed range of the last three decades, our model experiments do not show statistically significant impacts at the surface...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{measurements}} of reaction probabilities for heterogeneous reaction of N 2 O 5 with H 2 O and HCl on ice surfaces at 195 K, using a fast-flow reactor coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The reaction probability for N 2 O 5 on pure-water ice {{was found to be}} 0. 028 + or - 0. 011, with nitric acid in the solid phase as the sole product. In the presence of HCl in ice, the probability of N 2 O 5 reaction was enhanced (to 0. 037); the reaction produced, besides solid-phase nitric acid, ClNO 2 and ClONO which were released into the gas phase within a few milliseconds. The latter two compounds can be readily photolyzed in the austral spring to form active chlorine which would remove stratospheric ozone. It is suggested that, since the polar stratospheric clouds are believed to contain HCl-ice mixture on the surface, the reactions of N 2 O 5 on H 2 O/HCl particles is {{a major factor in the}} Antarctic <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion...|$|R
