50|$|Direct {{methods of}} {{creating}} a <b>site</b> <b>index</b> include estimation from historical yield records, stand volume data, growth intercepts, or height-age relationships (<b>site</b> <b>index).</b> <b>Site</b> <b>index</b> {{has been the most}} widely used means of estimating site productivity in North America, despite some shortcomings. Indirect methods include estimations based on relationships among dominant species, lesser vegetation characteristics or site indicators, as well as topographic, climatic, and edaphic factors. A generalized model using both direct and indirect variables for developing composite <b>site</b> <b>index</b> equations was presented by Payandeh and Wang (1997). The generalized model described 2 data sets better than did either a composite <b>site</b> <b>index</b> model (Payandeh 1991) or a logistic <b>site</b> <b>index</b> model, Model 3 (Monserud 1984).|$|E

To find <b>site</b> <b>index</b> from a <b>site</b> <b>index</b> curve, one would find age 50 along the x-axis and then find 60 ft along the y-axis.

5000|$|<b>Site</b> <b>index</b> is a {{term used}} in {{forestry}} to describe the potential for forest trees to grow at a particular location or [...] "site." [...] Site is defined as “The average age of dominate and/or codominate trees of a even-aged, undisturbed site of intolerant trees at a base age”; furthermore, the word site is used in forestry {{to refer to a}} distinct area where trees are found. <b>Site</b> <b>index</b> is used to measure the productivity of the site and the management options for that site and reports the height of dominant and co-dominant trees in a stand at a base age such as 25, 50 and 100 years. [...] For example, a red oak with an age of 50 years and a height of 70 ft will have a <b>site</b> <b>index</b> of 70. <b>Site</b> <b>index</b> is species specific. Common methods used to determine <b>site</b> <b>index</b> are based on tree height, plant composition and the use of soil maps.|$|E
50|$|Determining <b>site</b> <b>index</b> from plant {{composition}} {{is often referred}} to as the indicator-plant approach. <b>Site</b> <b>index</b> is determined from plant composition by the presence, abundance, and size of understory plants.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{of the methods}} used to {{determine}} <b>site</b> <b>index</b> is tree height. Determining <b>site</b> <b>index</b> is achieved by measuring and averaging the total height and age of trees found on that site. Height is obtained from dominant or co-dominant trees (referred to as canopy position) in a stand and is estimated using an instrument called a clinometer, or measured using a laser or releskope. Tree height is also commonly estimated by measuring DBH*statement is inaccurate as DBH stands for diameter at breast height (4.5 feet above bare mineral soil) and does not correlate to height, as both DBH and height {{are affected by the}} canopy position of tree, such as, is it suppressed, domminant, co-dominant, or released. A tree first focuses on gaining height, and then growing diameter. Age is calculated using an instrument called an increment borer or from planting records for even aged stands. These values are then used on a graph or an equation called a <b>site</b> <b>index</b> curve.|$|E

50|$|Site tree {{refers to}} a type of tree used in forestry, {{which is used to}} {{classify}} the quality of growing conditions trees at a particular forest location. A site tree, is a single tree in a stand (group of growing trees) that gives a good representation of the average dominant or co-dominant tree in the stand. Site trees are used to calculate the <b>site</b> <b>index</b> of the site in reference to a particular tree species. A site tree should belong to the dominant or co-dominant overstory class. The total height of the tree and age measured at Diameter at breast height of a sample of site trees will be used to determine a <b>site</b> <b>index,</b> which will show how tall trees of different species can grow on that site in a set amount of time. Sometimes several years are added to the breast-height age to account for time grown below 4.5 ft.|$|E
