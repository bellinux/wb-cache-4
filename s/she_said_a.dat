500|$|Regarding the new {{job as a}} whole, Solis said, [...] "It's {{fascinating}} {{how many}} people work for the county – over 100,000. At the Department of Labor it was like 15,000. The budget here is $26 billion, much more than what I was used to in D.C." [...] In December 2015 Solis took over as Chair of the Supervisors, a position which is rotated on a yearly basis. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> priority for 2016 would be [...] "to reaffirm our commitment to our diverse county family – to make this family, our family, inclusive for everybody, no matter their background, {{no matter where they}} come from, no matter how far down the scale they have been." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 1, 1923, the Taylors' {{neighbor}} {{reported that}} she heard a scream {{while it was still}} dark, grabbed her revolver and ran next door to find Fannie bruised and beaten, with scuff marks across the white floor. Taylor was screaming that someone needed to get her baby. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> black man was in her house; he had come through the back door and assaulted her. The neighbor found the baby, but no one else. Taylor's initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not rape her. Rumors circulated—widely believed by whites in Sumner—that she was both raped and robbed. [...] The charge of rape of a white woman by a black was inflammatory in the South: the day before, the Klan had held a parade and rally of over 100 hooded Klansmen [...] away in [...] Gainesville under a burning cross and a banner reading, [...] "First and Always Protect Womanhood".|$|E
500|$|United States President George W. Bush {{gave his}} support to Musharraf as [...] "a strong {{ally in the}} war against these extremists." [...] State Department deputy {{spokesman}} Tom Casey noted that the militants had been given many warnings before the commandos moved on the Red Mosque. He said, [...] "The government of Pakistan has proceeded in a responsible way. All governments have a responsibility to preserve order." [...] Bryan D. Hunt, of the United States' consulate in Lahore, was quoted as saying that the American government supported the Pakistani government and that [...] "the militants were given many warnings but instead of surrendering they decided to fight and challenge the writ of government." [...] Hunt also said that the US fully supports Pakistan in their War on Terror and considers Pakistan [...] "their closest ally in South Asia." [...] Religious parties and figures criticised the support extended by the US consular official and demanded that the government expel him for interfering in Pakistan's internal affairs. A Pakistani Foreign Office spokesperson Tasneem Aslam characterised the US consulate official's statement as contrary to diplomatic norms, and open interference in the country's internal affairs. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> protest would be lodged.|$|E

500|$|... "When I Look at You" [...] {{was written}} by Hillary Lindsey and John Shanks. It was used to promote the 2010 coming-of-age romantic drama film The Last Song based on Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, in which Cyrus stars as Veronica [...] "Ronnie" [...] Miller, an angry, rebellious seventeen-year-old forced to spend a summer with her estranged father, Steve (Greg Kinnear). The song was first {{included}} on Cyrus's 2009 extended play The Time of Our Lives {{and then on the}} film and its corresponding soundtrack. The song was initially to be included on Cyrus's 2010 album Can't Be Tamed; however, it was decided to include it on The Time of Our Lives as well as The Last Song because it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings [...] "When I Look at You", she thinks of family and love. [...] "It's kind of what this movie is all about", <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>A</b> remix version titled [...] "Te Miro a Ti", featuring Spanish singer David Bisbal was released later; in it, Cyrus sings her lines in English, while Bisbal's are mingled in both English and Spanish.|$|E
500|$|Several later {{commentators}} have interpreted the {{play as a}} reflection of Rand's early interest in the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Literature professor Shoshana Milgram saw elements of Nietzsche's morality in the descriptions of Bjorn Faulkner, who [...] "never thought of things as right or wrong". Others found significance in Rand's admiration of the play's criminal characters. Historian Jennifer Burns said Rand [...] "found criminality an irresistible metaphor for individualism" [...] because of the influence on her of [...] "Nietzsche's transvaluation of values [...] changed criminals into heroes". Rand maintained criminality was not the important attribute of the characters; <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> criminal could serve as [...] "an eloquent symbol" [...] of independence and rebellion against conformity, but stated, [...] "I do not think, nor did I think when I wrote this play, that a swindler is a heroic character or that a respectable banker is a villain". Rand biographer Ronald Merrill dismissed this explanation as a cover-up for the play's promotion of Nietzschean ideas that Rand later rejected. He called the play [...] "a powerful and eloquent plea for the Nietzschean worldview" [...] of the superiority of the [...] "superman"; this is represented by Faulkner, whom Merrill interprets as rejecting external moral authority and the [...] "slave morality" [...] of ordinary people. Biographer Anne Heller said Rand [...] "later renounced her romantic fascination with criminals", making the characters' criminality an embarrassment for her.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, {{commentator}} {{and social}} critic Camille Paglia criticized the [...] "blathering, fanatical overkill" [...] of the topic, but also questioned Obama's response: [...] "Obama could have ended the entire matter months ago by publicly requesting Hawaii {{to issue a}} fresh, long-form, stamped certificate and inviting a few high-profile reporters in to examine the document and photograph it", <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>A</b> parenthetical in the same article noted that [...] "(The campaign did make the [...] "short-form" [...] certificate available to Factcheck.org)".|$|E

[...] She said that Heeringa [...] "sort of shook her head and started shivering ... like a chill went up her spine or something."

2500|$|Debnam-Carey said {{figuring}} out how to portray all these aspects of the character was the most challenging part. [...] "For me, it was about finding that mix between vulnerability and tension and a wiseness beyond her years," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>A</b> director advised her that less is more, and she adapted to the character, and learned more about her, via portrayal. [...] "I realized that I was slowly developing all of these things. Someone was like, 'Is it a thing you've chosen to do, to not blink all the time?' I was like, 'Wow!' When it comes to Lexa, she's very steely-gazed, all the time. There's a presence about her and a knowingness, and she's always observant."

[...] "But even Hopkins knows when to tone down the panto villain act". LBC announced Hopkins' departure on 26 May 2017, 'effective immediately', following her comments on Twitter soon after the Manchester Arena bombing.

2500|$|Moskowitz {{grew up in}} the Columbia University {{neighborhood}} of Morningside Heights, Manhattan. She graduated from Stuyvesant High School, where [...] "she thought half of the teachers were incompetent", according to Steven Brill and claimed to the New Yorker she [...] "didn't learn anything". She found widespread student cheating and a coverup by the principal, according to New York magazine, and began to consider that teachers' ability to choose where they would teach based on their seniority meant that they chose Stuyvesant, where, according to Brill, [...] "the students could teach themselves." [...] Moskowitz went to the University of Pennsylvania, where, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>a</b> professor criticized her writing ability, and she studied writing, getting a B.A. with honors in history and influencing her prioritizing writing by her students at Success Academy Charter Schools.

2500|$|... "We {{will fight}} {{corruption}} with strong resolve wherever it occurs, {{and ask the}} same of our international partners," [...] Karzai told the donors. [...] "Together we must stop the practices that feed corruption or undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of national institutions." [...] The international aid is tied to a mechanism that will regularly review how it is being spent, and to guarantees from Kabul that it will seriously take on its deep-rooted corruption problems – what the conference called a roadmap of accountability. Kabul must also demonstrate efforts to improve governance and finance management, and safeguard the democratic process, {{rule of law and}} human rights – especially those of women. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed the need for reform to safeguard changes achieved in Afghanistan. [...] "That must include fighting corruption, improving governance, strengthening the rule of law, increasing access to economic opportunity for all Afghans, especially for women," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>A</b> follow-up conference will be hold in Britain in 2014. The meeting in Britain in 2014 will check progress toward [...] "mutual accountability" [...] and a review and monitoring process to assure that development aid is not diverted by corrupt officials or mismanaged – both of which have been major hurdles in putting aid projects into practice thus far.|$|E
2500|$|Yarra Council {{claimed the}} tunnel would {{exacerbate}} congestion on Hoddle Street, Flemington Road and surrounding streets. Mayor Jackie Fristacky {{said more than}} 80 percent of all inbound vehicles on the Eastern Freeway would still seek to exit at Hoddle Street and other inner roads to reach their inner-city destinations. [...] "The East West Link will not help them. It will actually make congestion on Hoddle Street worse because it will get more cars on that road faster. It will ultimately cause major social, health and environmental damage," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>A</b> Victorian Department of Transport briefing prepared for Mulder said only {{a small proportion of}} vehicles now using Hoddle Street were likely to use the tunnel as an alternative if there were no off-ramps to the city, while a report for the government by consulting firm Veitch Lister in July 2013 found that while traffic on parts of Hoddle Street closer to the city would drop by up to 9 percent, the project could cause congestion on Hoddle Street closer to the Eastern Freeway to rise by up to 35 percent by 2021. Melbourne Airport chief executive Chris Woodruff warned that congestion between the city and airport could worsen once the East West Link was built unless the Tullamarine Freeway was widened. In its submission to the state government panel on the project, the City of Boroondara also raised concerns that traffic on some streets, including Princess and Asquith Streets and Burke Road, could rise by up to 30 percent.|$|E
