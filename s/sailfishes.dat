40|$|Although <b>sailfishes,</b> {{predominantly}} {{represented by}} the Indo-Pacific sailfish Istiophorus platypterus constitute a prominent by-catch component of the tuna fishery of the Indian Ocean, very little effort is expended to estimate status of the stock, their biological characteristics {{and the impact of}} this by-catch fishery on the target species, if any. In India the <b>sailfishes</b> are exclusively the by-catches of tuna fishery as there is no exploitation of the species on commer cial line. The tuna long line survey results in the Indian EEZ shows that tunas, billfishes and sharks are the three major groups of fishes caught on the longline gears. Among billfishes, the sailfish, I platypterus form the major constituent. The information on the abundance indices indicates that the average catch rate obtained from the North West sector of the EEZ is 39. 42 kg/ 1000 hooks representing 15. 58 % of the total longline catches. From the seasonal variation of the catch rates it is observed that the second quarter (April-June) recorded the highest catch rate of 91. 97 kg/ 1000 hooks from this sector. The spawning season of the species is estimated to be protractive one from March-September in the Arabian Sea with peaks in March-April and August- September. The size of the specimens caught ranged from 100 cm to 260 cm (FL) majority being in the length group of 145 - 240 cm. The average weight of individual specimen was 27 kg.

40|$|Billfishes are not {{targeted}} by tuna purse seiners, {{but they can}} be taken incidentally during the setting operation. Because by-catch information is not recorded in the commercial logbooks, it is important to quantify by-catches taken by the purse seine fishery in the Atlantic Ocean. In this paper, we attempted to estimate the total by-catch of billfishes generated by the European tropical tuna purse seine fishery in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from 1991 to 2000. Information on the by-catch of billfish was collected by scientific observers at sea during the European Union Bigeye Program.

40|$|Billfishes are a {{component}} of offshore ecosystems; thus {{it is important to}} quantify the impact of the tuna fishery on these species in the world’s ocean. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the bycatch of billfishes generated by the tropical tuna purse-seine fishery in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Information on bycatch was collected by observers at sea during the European Union Bigeye Program. With a total of 62 observers’ trips, conducted on Spanish and French vessels between June 1997 and May 1999, this project is the biggest observer program ever carried out in the European tuna purse-seine fishery. This study showed that billfish bycatch by the purse seiners is very low (less than 0. 021 % of the total tuna catches and less than 10 % of the total billfish catches currently reported). A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to account for some uncertainties in the fishing strategies of purse seiners operating in this ocean. One of the findings of this study indicated that the temporary moratorium on fishing with FADs (fish aggregating devices), adopted by the European purse-seine fishery in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, produced a decrease in incidental catches of marlins from 600 – 700 metric tons (t) to less than 300 t. In contrast, this trend was reversed for <b>sailfishes,</b> for which the bycatch increased from 25 t to 45 t. The difficulty of defining indices that express the conservation status in marine fishes and that gauge key ecosystem parameters and the need to promote an ecosystem approach for large-pelagic-resource management which takes into account biologic and socioeconomic criteria are briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|Chiefly {{arising from}} their {{sporting}} potentialities in big game angling, the large “Bill-fishes”, or Marlin, and Sword-fishes have attracted considerable attention in recent times. Commercial fishermen of Japan and anglers of the United States {{have been most}} ardent {{in the pursuit of}} these peculiar creatures. While a good deal has been learnt about them, there still remains much to discover. In the case of the Marlins, for example, hardly anything is known of their reproduction, of the larval or postlarval early forms, and even those who have studied these fishes from ample material over a wide area are as yet uncertain of the absolute identity of the species, and are often unable to identify with any certainty the rare occasional reasonably small specimens that are encountered. In South Africa shore angling is so good throughout virtually the entire year that there has been little incentive to explore the possibilities further out, especially as quiet seas are a rare condition. Quite recently, however, big game angling at sea has developed almost explosively and increasingly large fishes are being captured. During our extensive travels in the tropical Western Indian Ocean it became obvious that great numbers of the larger angling fishes were present, including those treated here. Although that area is windy and storm-lashed for much of the year, remote from facilities, and barren, its potentialities are relatively unexplored, but are clearly so great that it will not be long before it becomes recognised as one of the chief big game angling areas of the world. These fishes are at present placed in the families Xiphiidae and Istiophoridae. The latter embraces the <b>Sailfishes,</b> the Marlins and the Spearfishes, usually granted distinction by only generic rank. In my opinion, however, they merit at least sub-family rankABBYY FineReader 12 Rhodes University Libraries (Digitisation) The main funds for this work were provided by the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, who also made a special grant in February 1956 to cover considerable travelling that numerous Marlin catches rendered necessary...|$|E
40|$|Billfishes (marlins, spearfishes, <b>sailfishes</b> and swordfish) {{are one of}} {{the fastest}} and largest marine apex predators, and perhaps their most {{recognizable}} attribute is their bill or rostrum. The proposed function for this novel structure has ranged from hydrodynamic enhancement to defensive weaponry. However, the most supported hypothesis for its function has been linked to feeding. Billfishes have been observed to subdue their prey with their rostrum, either stunning or cutting them into pieces before ingestion. Due to their large body sizes and pelagic lifestyles a thorough investigation of the function of this structure has been logistically challenging. The goal of my dissertation is to investigate the role of the rostrum during feeding from a functional, mechanical and morphological standpoint. By the use of interdisciplinary approaches that blend engineering with biology, the function of the rostrum and billfish putative feeding behavior was investigated. By the use of different approaches that involve morphological characterizations, histology, estimation of performance measurements such as bite force and the investigation architectural tradeoffs from geometric morphometrics analysis, my dissertation aims to characterized the role of the rostrum in billfishes as a possible adaptation for feeding. Results showed that the rostrum in billfishes is mechanically capable of acting as a feeding weapon; continuous stress distribution along its length suggest no particular point that could lead to breakage during feeding. Finite element analysis, as well as bending experiments suggest feeding behavior may be species specific and strictly associated with rostrum morphology. While istiophorids may be morphologically suited to strike their prey {{with a wide range of}} motions, swordfish appear to be specialized from a mechanical and hydrodynamic standpoint to hit their prey with lateral strikes. Biting performance is relatively low in these top predators compared to other non-billfish species suggesting the rostrum may facilitate prey processing reducing the need for powerful biting. However contrary to my expectations rostrum length was not a predictor of bite force. Skull variation was evident among billfish species. Swordfish, the species with the longest rostrum, had the smallest head and the lowest relative bite force whereas blue marlin, the species with the stiffer, most compact rostrum, had the largest head and one of the greatest relative bite forces. The shortbill spearfish showed a relatively low bite force indicating predatory success in this species may be linked to an extended lower jaw that may facilitate a speed efficient jaw during prey capture. Whether the rostrum in billfishes has evolved as an adaptation for feeding, remains uncertain. However results from this study demonstrate that rostrum material properties, morphology and head architecture, in addition to relatively low biting performance in billfishes, favor a role of prey capture for the rostrum...|$|E
40|$|Through the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), Congress has {{delegated}} to the Secretary of Commerce the 2 ̆ 2 broad authority {{to manage and}} conserve coastal fisheries. 2 ̆ 2 The Magnuson-Stevens Act creates eight independent regional fishery management councils to prepare fishery management plans for each region. However, the regional councils do not have authority over all species because the Magnuson-Stevens Act assigns responsibility to the Secretary of Commerce for non-Pacific Ocean highly migratory species. Highly migratory species are defined under the Magnuson-Stevens Act to include tuna species, marlin, ocean sharks, <b>sailfishes,</b> and swordfish. In preparing and implementing all fishery management plans under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Secretary must consider factors that are aimed at conserving and protecting the fishing industry, including minimizing the disadvantage to domestic fishermen. Further, the Secretary must comply with ten national standards, applicable to all fishery management plans under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, that require consideration of competing environmental and economic concerns. The Secretary must also comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), which was enacted to prevent the inequitable impact of agency rules on small businesses. Small businesses tend to incur regulatory compliance costs that are disproportionately higher than {{the costs associated with}} larger businesses for the same regulatory compliance. Under the RFA, agencies are required to analyze their proposed rules and attempt to reduce their impact on small businesses prior to passage of the rules. The RFA requires agencies to prepare and publish in the Federal Register an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) describing the effect of a proposed rule on small businesses and discussing significant alternatives that might minimize adverse economic consequences. Publication of the IRFA provides small businesses with an opportunity to publicly comment on the analysis. If an agency decides that a significant impact on small businesses likely exists, then the agency must explore alternatives to the rule that would lessen the potential economic severity. However, if a significant impact is not foreseeable, then the agency may issue the rule, prepare a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA), and publish it in the Federal Register. The agency may exempt itself from this process by certifying that the final rule will not 2 ̆ 2 have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 2 ̆ 2 Both the RFA and the Magnuson-Stevens Act provide for judicial review of the Secretary 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory actions pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Agency actions under both the RFA and the Magnuson-Stevens Act are to be reviewed for compliance in accordance with the 2 ̆ 2 arbitrary and capricious 2 ̆ 2 standard under the APA. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has held, under the RFA, that judicial review should be a determination of whether the S 6 cretary employed a 2 ̆ 2 reasonable, good-faith effort 2 ̆ 2 in his consideration of alternative regulation. Essentially, a court reviewing an agency action under the 2 ̆ 2 arbitrary and capricious 2 ̆ 2 standard must determine whether the agency has examined the pertinent evidence, considered the relevant factors, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made by the agency...|$|E
