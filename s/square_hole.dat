25|$|Ancient Chinese coins are {{markedly}} different from coins {{produced in the}} west. Chinese coins were manufactured by being cast in molds, whereas western coins were typically cut and hammered or, in later times, milled. Chinese coins were usually made from mixtures of metals such copper, tin and lead, from bronze, brass or iron: precious metals like gold and silver were uncommonly used. The ratios and purity of the coin metals varied considerably. Most Chinese coins were produced with a <b>square</b> <b>hole</b> in the middle. This was used to allow collections of coins to be threaded on a square rod so that the rough edges could be filed smooth, and then threaded on strings for ease of handling.|$|E
25|$|A pump drill is {{a simple}} tool used to make holes in light {{materials}} by hand {{and has been in}} use for centuries. The drill itself is composed of: the drill shaft, a narrow board with a hole through the center, a weight (usually a heavy disc) acting as a flywheel, and a length of cord. The weight is attached {{near the bottom of the}} shaft and the hole board is slipped over the top. The cordage is run through a hole near the top of the shaft and affixed to either end of the hole board so that it hangs just above the weight. The end of the shaft usually has a <b>square</b> <b>hole</b> made to fit certain sized auger bits or a simple triangular bit made to cut while rotating in both directions.|$|E

25|$|In the Jin dynasty, copper-block {{prints were}} slotted with two square holes for {{embedding}} bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money {{had a different}} combination of markers.

Another sample of Song dynasty money of the same period in the collection of Shanghai Museum has two empty square holes above Ziliao as well as Zihou, due to the loss of two copper movable types.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Chinese coinage {{includes}} {{some of the}} earliest known coins. These coins, used as early as the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE), took the form of imitations of the cowrie shells that were used in ceremonial exchanges. The Spring and Autumn period also saw the introduction of the first metal coins; however, they were not initially round, instead being either knife shaped or spade shaped. Round metal coins with a round, and then later <b>square</b> <b>hole</b> in the center were first introduced around 350 BCE. The beginning of the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BCE), the first dynasty to unify China, saw the introduction of a standardised coinage for the whole Empire. Subsequent dynasties produced variations on these round coins throughout the imperial period. At first the distribution of the coinage was limited to use around the capital city district, but {{by the beginning of the}} Han Dynasty, coins were widely used for such things as paying taxes, salaries and fines.|$|E
25|$|Taxes {{and fines}} were paid in cash. Javanese economy had been partly monetised {{since the late}} 8th century, using gold and silver coins. Previously, the 9th-century Wonoboyo hoard {{discovered}} in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in Sidoarjo in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era. The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume {{it was due to}} the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a currency system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited. These kepeng Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a <b>square</b> <b>hole</b> in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes—the imported Chinese copper coins—enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped celengan (piggy bank).|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{one-dimensional}} (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) periodic {{structures of}} hundreds of nanometers had been fabricated on III–V GaAs substrate utilizing the LDW technique with a nanosecond pulse laser source. Ti, GST, and GSBT films were chosen as photoresists to obtain small feature sizes. Wet-chemical etching processes were applied for development and patterns transfer to semiconductors. 1 D nanolines with feature size of about 50 to 400  nm were obtained, and 2 D nanoscaled <b>square</b> <b>holes</b> were prepared as well. However, the <b>square</b> <b>holes</b> could only be acquired by using Ti thin film as the photoresist, and the designed <b>square</b> <b>holes</b> changed into rectangle shape by using GST and GSBT as the photoresists mainly due to {{the interaction of the}} scanning laser beams. The effects on different photoresists of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and HF, acting as developing solution, and KOH and NH 4 OH as the solution for patterns transfer to semiconductors had also been widely studied and developed.|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{novel and}} {{straightforward}} {{technology for the}} fabrication of two-dimensional (2 D) photoluminescent light source arrays by selective infiltration of conjugated luminescent polymers into three-dimensional (3 D) silicon microstructures is presented. Poly(9, 9 -di-n-octylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F 8 BT) integration into 3 D silicon microstructures is investigated by means of three different deposition techniques, namely, spin-coating, dip-coating and drop-casting/ slow solvent evaporation. The microstructure is fabricated by electrochemical micromachining (ECM) technology and integrates 2 D arrays of <b>square</b> <b>holes</b> with different sizes (about 40 and 4 μm), spatial periods (about 70 and 10 μm), and aspect ratios (ARs) (about one and ten). Notably, <b>square</b> <b>holes</b> with higher AR can be selectively filled with polymer using spin-coating and drop-casting techniques, whereas dip-coating technique allows selective polymer filling of <b>square</b> <b>holes</b> with lower AR. Independently of size, period and AR, each polymer-infiltrated hole behaves as a single light source, thus enabling the effective synthesis of 2 D photoluminescent light source arrays...|$|R

500|$|Even before 1848, record {{amounts of}} gold were flowing to American mints {{to be struck}} into coin, but the California Gold Rush vastly {{increased}} these quantities.

In January 1849, McKay introduced a bill for a gold dollar, which was referred to his committee. There was much discussion in the press about the proposed coin; one newspaper published a proposal for an [...] gold dollar; that is, with a hole in the middle to increase its small diameter. McKay amended his legislation to provide for a double eagle ($20 gold coin) and wrote to Patterson, who replied stating that the annular gold dollar would not work, and neither would another proposal to have dollar piece consisting of a gold plug in a silver coin.

40|$|International audienceIntersecting {{corners and}} checkerboards of {{negative}} refractive index materials (NRIM) represent highly singular electromagnetic systems that involve very highly enhanced local {{fields and the}} local density of modes. It {{is well known that}} plasmonic metallic systems can mimic the behavior of NRIM in the near-field limit at optical frequencies. Opaque gold films have been structured by focused ion-beam technologies at submicrometer scales in a checkerboard fashion and their optical properties measured. Subwavelength <b>square</b> <b>holes</b> in thick gold films placed in checkerboard fashion show a broadband extraordinary transmission of light at visible wavelengths. We find that the smaller the <b>square</b> <b>holes,</b> the larger is the transmission over a band of wavelengths from 650 to 950 nm suggesting that such structured surfaces have very unusual effective medium properties, which is confirmed by the band-structure diagrams computed with finite elements. Theoretical results also confirm the experimental transmission measured to be well over 80 % from 750 to 950 nm for a checkerboard with 150 nm× 150 nm <b>square</b> <b>holes.</b> This unusual broadband nature of checkerboard structured films is confirmed by the dark-field reflection spectra. Microscopic studies reveal that these structures have enhanced interaction of light at the edges and corners.
