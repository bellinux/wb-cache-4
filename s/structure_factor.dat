40|$|International audienceAccurate <b>structure</b> <b>factors</b> are {{extracted}} from synchrotron powder diffraction data measured on crystalline diamond {{based on a}} novel multipole model division of overlapping reflection intensities. The approach limits the spherical-atom bias in <b>structure</b> <b>factors</b> {{extracted from}} overlapping powder data using conventional spherical-atom Rietveld refinement. The <b>structure</b> <b>factors</b> are subsequently used for multipole electron-density modelling, and both the <b>structure</b> <b>factors</b> and the derived density are compared with results from ab initio theoretical calculations. Overall, excellent agreement is obtained between experiment and theory, and the study therefore demonstrates that synchrotron powder diffraction can indeed provide accurate structure-factor values based on data measured in minutes with limited sample preparation. Thus, potential systematic errors such as extinction and twinning commonly encountered in single-crystal studies of small-unit-cell inorganic structures can be overcome with synchrotron powder diffraction. It is shown that the standard Hansen-Coppens multipole model is not flexible enough to fit the static theoretical <b>structure</b> <b>factors,</b> whereas fitting of thermally smeared <b>structure</b> <b>factors</b> has much lower residuals. If thermally smeared <b>structure</b> <b>factors</b> (experimental or theoretical) are fitted with a slightly wrong radial model (s 2 p 2 instead of sp 3) the radial scaling parameters ('[kappa]' parameters) {{are found to be}} inadequate and the 'error' is absorbed into the atomic displacement parameter.
