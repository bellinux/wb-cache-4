50|$|At this juncture, it is {{important}} to distinguish between how ownership passes in cash and credit sales respectively. In a cash sale, ownership passes once there has been (in addition to delivery) due payment of the purchase price. In a <b>sale</b> <b>on</b> <b>credit,</b> the fact that credit has been given is an indication that ownership merely passed on delivery. In an ordinary credit sale, the seller cannot claim that he did not intend ownership to pass until the full price had been paid. (This does not cover the situation where the sale is one subject to a pactum reservati dominii).|$|R

5000|$|... “Unsecured credit transactions” are {{agreements}} {{for which}} there is no security for the debt at all (like loans or <b>sales</b> <b>on</b> <b>credit).</b> There is no limit on the amount or repayment period. Unsecured agreements for more than R8,000 and/or repayable over more than six months fall into this category. The maximum interest rate is linked to the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Repurchase Rate ((Repurchase Rate x 2.2) + 20% per year), and is currently 39,8 per cent per year (based on the current repo rate of nine per cent). This maximum rate is nearly double the maximum permissible rate in terms of the Usury Act that applied until May 31, 2007 (20 per cent per year). Sales of furniture, for example, could now cost twice as much to service.|$|E
50|$|A {{sales journal}} is a {{specialized}} accounting journal {{and it is}} also a prime entry book used in an accounting system {{to keep track of the}} sales of items that customers(debtors) have purchased on account by charging a receivable on the debit side of an accounts receivable account and crediting revenue on the credit side. It differs from the cash receipts journal in that the latter will serve to book sales when cash is received.The sales journal is used to record all of the company <b>sales</b> <b>on</b> <b>credit.</b> Most often these sales are made up of inventory sales or other merchandise sales. Notice that only credit sales of inventory and merchandise items are recorded in the sales journal. Cash sales of inventory are recorded in the cash receipts journal.

50|$|After {{an initial}} success in retail, {{the costs of}} retail {{operations}} began to outweigh the benefits.

The following year, Spiegel unveiled its Budget Power Plan, a liberal policy under which customers were offered a line of credit sometimes as high as $1,000, with very low monthly payments. The idea was to add as many names as possible to the Spiegel customer list. The company also began to include a widening range of products in its catalogs; by 1960 Spiegel was selling pets. By that time, sales were considerably more than $200 million and nearly two million people had Spiegel credit accounts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{accounting}} {{the term}} Debtor Collection Period indicates {{the average time}} taken to collect trade debts. In other words, a reducing period of time is an indicator of increasing efficiency. It enables the enterprise to compare the real collection period with the granted/theoretical credit period.

50|$|For example, {{consider}} {{a company that}} has a net income of $100 this year, and its A/R increased by $25 {{since the beginning of the}} year. If the balances of all other current assets, long term assets and current liabilities did not change over the year, the cash flows could be determined by the rules above as $100 - $25 = Cash Flows from Operating Activities = $75. The logic is that, if the company made $100 that year (net income), and they are using the accrual accounting system (not cash based) then any income they generated that year which has not yet been paid for in cash should be subtracted from the net income figure in order to find cash flows from operating activities. And the increase in A/R meant that $25 of <b>sales</b> occurred <b>on</b> <b>credit</b> and have not yet been paid for in cash.|$|R

50|$|Day’s {{technically}} savvy production methods {{as well as}} his excellent {{customer service}} and skilled craftsmanship and designs, scholars like Patricia Phillips Marshall argue, made Day’s cabinet workshop in Milton the premier and most capitally successful furniture business in the state of North Carolina. Day was a major contributor to the state economy; scholarly estimates show that he held 20-25% of state capital investment in furniture production within his business, and that his workshop put out 10% of the state’s total furniture production. By 1840, that Day held incredible economic influence on the Milton region and that his business held $1500 worth of capital resources and products; in 1850, the Union Tavern business boasted a net worth of $5800 and held around $8000 worth of crafted pieces, tools, and machinery. Day maintained a high personal credit rating and net worth, estimated to be about $40,000 in 1855. Day often made <b>sales</b> <b>on</b> <b>credit</b> but could not always collect payments; this combined with the economic panic of 1857 caused Day’s business to decline in worth and production in the late 1850s; Day declared bankruptcy and his shop was placed in trust with a business partner. After Day’s death, his son Thomas Day, Jr., bought the workshop back and kept it running for another decade; the Union Tavern workshop closed for good in 1871.|$|E

40|$|Statistics {{show that}} the <b>sale</b> of goods <b>on</b> <b>credit</b> is {{widespread}} among firms {{even when they are}} capital constrained and thus face relatively high costs in providing trade credit. This study provides an explanation for this by arguing that customers that possess strong market power are able to increase their customer surplus by demanding to purchase the goods <b>on</b> <b>credit.</b> This gain in customer surplus increases with the degree of asymmetric information between buyer and seller with respect to product quality. Therefore, firms that are perceived as risky are especially subject to the market power of the customer and have to sell their goods <b>on</b> <b>credit.</b> Using detailed firm-level data from a large number of firms in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, this paper finds evidence consistent with this hypothesis. We find a strong positive correlation between customer market power and trade credit provision. Furthermore, this relationship is especially strong when the supplier is more risky and in countries with limited financial sector development or weak legal system. ...|$|R

A possible explanation for this is the use of trade credit as a competitiveness tool. By analyzing both the impact of customer as well as producer market power on a firm’s decision to provide trade credit, we examine whether trade credit is indeed used as a way to lock in customers by firms in developing countries. Using a new dataset containing a large number of firms in 42 developing countries, we find strong evidence that an important driving force behind the decision to provide trade credit is the urge to be competitive. This especially holds for those firms that still have to establish a solid market reputation and for firms located in countries with an underdeveloped banking sector. ...|$|R

40|$|Dairy {{production}} {{is a key}} small farm strategy for generating income in the Nairobi milk shed. The high perishability of milk under Kenyan conditions appears {{to be associated with}} a high frequency of small individual transactions, the terms of which are subject to forced “fire” sales, delayed payments or default. Reliability of outlets in the wet (milk glut) season is also a consideration, and credit sales typically are matched with a commitment to be a steady customer. Two salient phenomena are observed: reported unit milk prices differ widely within the same location and time period, and spot sales for cash tend to be at a higher unit price than sales on monthly credit. We hypothesize that dairy farmers in the Nairobi milk shed choose market outlets and levels of cash sales that reduce transactions costs and help assure reliable future outlets, at the expense of current income. A decomposition of producer milk prices across time, space, and market outlet suggests that reliability of outlet is worth up to 17 % of the spot price, in addition to waiting a month to be paid. Risks of credit default are illustrated by predicted weekly credit prices that are 5 % lower than monthly credit prices. Data from 21 smallholder farms monitored daily over one year are used to estimate a two-limit Tobit model {{of the role of the}} characteristics of market outlets and producers in explaining the share of producer output sold for cash rather than credit. Younger, more educated producers, receiving a regular off-farm salary, and near market centres are shown to be more likely to accept <b>sales</b> <b>on</b> <b>credit.</b> Older producers with more experience but less formal education are more likely to sell for cash rather than credit. The power of the model to explain different prices for milk in the same location and week suggests that such price differences viewed unidimensionally are not evidence of lack of market integration as conventionally defined, but an outcome of differential transactions costs and perceptions of risk by different producers.

40|$|I {{examine whether}} a benevolent {{government}} can improve {{on the free}} market allocation by setting capital requirements for private borrowers in a stochastic model with collateral constraints. Previous theoretical {{studies have found that}} when asset prices enter into bor- rowing constraints, pecuniary externalities between atomistic agents can make the laissez faire equilibrium constrained ine¢ cient. For reasonable parameter values, I find that, quan- titatively, the answer is 'no', private and government leverage choices coincide. Limiting private leverage by imposing capital requirements has the beneficial e¤ect of dampening the effects of the collateral amplification mechanism. This reduces fire sales in recessions and limits the negative externality that individual asset <b>sales</b> have <b>on</b> other <b>credit</b> constrained borrowers. However, we find that capital requirements are a blunt tool. They tax the activities of highly productive entrepreneurs and reduce the amount they produce in equilibrium. This reduces total factor productivity and steady state consumption. In the end, society faces a choice between high but unstable consumption in the free borrowing world and low but stable consumption in the regulated world. The government chooses the former. ...|$|R
