5|$|Michael Schumacher {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard. Barrichello began from third, alongside Coulthard's teammate Mika Häkkinen. The front two of Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled {{for first place}} until Coulthard served a ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty on lap 14 as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began. Just before half distance, Michael Schumacher made an early pit stop allowing Barrichello {{to take the lead}} until his own pit stop on lap 43. By this time rain began to fall causing drivers to make the switch to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher retained his lead throughout and took the victory 0.1 seconds ahead of Barrichello.|$|E
5|$|By lap 13, Häkkinen's gap to Coulthard was two seconds, who in {{turn was}} a further ten seconds in front of de la Rosa. Barrichello, who had damage to his car, was a further six seconds behind de la Rosa, but was drawing ahead of Salo in fifth. Verstappen {{suffered}} an gearbox failure and became the fifth retirement of the race on lap 14. On lap 17, Diniz and Zonta were given ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalties, both for their roles in the lap one accidents. They took their penalties immediately. Ralf Schumacher emerged from his garage to rejoin the race on the same lap. Häkkinen had extended his already comfortable lead over Coulthard to 10 seconds by lap 24. Alesi, who was on a two-stop strategy, became the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and exited in thirteenth place. On lap 25, Zonta was involved in another collision when he attempted to overtake Minardi driver Gastón Mazzacane at turn 1 which allowed Diniz to move into fourteenth position.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard set a fastest lap of the race, a 1:21.335 on lap two as {{he gained}} on Michael Schumacher's early start advantage. De la Rosa claimed sixth {{position}} from Frentzen {{on the same}} lap. Michael Schumacher started to trade fastest laps with Coulthard on lap four as Villeneuve maintained third position but was holding up the drivers {{in the next four}} positions who were behind him. Button's engine began to develop problems as Fisichella was passed by Verstappen for tenth on the same lap. As Michael Schumacher and Coulthard continued their battle up front, the stewards informed the McLaren team on lap ten that Coulthard would serve a ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the formation lap begun. On the 13th lap, Ralf Schumacher overtook Herbert to take 12th position. Coulthard took his penalty on lap 14 and rejoined in tenth place. Herbert made a pit stop with an gearbox issue on the same lap and became the first retirement of the race. Häkkinen attempted to pass Barrichello on lap 16 although he overshot the manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{took his}} first pit stop on lap 28, {{emerging}} in seventh position. Barrichello pitted one lap later. Race leader Häkkinen took his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind teammate Coulthard. Häkkinen regained the lead after Coulthard made his pit stop on lap 32, who came out in third position. Fisichella retired with further brake problems on lap 32. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:20.028 on lap 33, {{as he continued to}} stretch his lead over Michael Schumacher. Coulthard, who was on fresh tyres, gradually began to close the gap to Michael Schumacher by lap 39. Michael Schumacher increased the gap when Coulthard lost two seconds; the result of being held up by Genè who was later issued a 10-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty. Barrichello pitted for the second time on lap 47. Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher made their pit stops on lap 50, one lap ahead of Coulthard.|$|E
5|$|The safety car was {{withdrawn}} {{at the end}} of lap 31 and the race got underway again with Häkkinen in the lead. Wurz, meanwhile, immediately pulled off the circuit with a gearbox failure with Salo almost colliding with the Benetton. Light rain began to fall on lap 33. Button pitted on the following lap and his Williams pit crew changed his dry tyres to wets. Gené became the race's seventh retirement with a failed engine. All drivers, apart from Barrichello, Coulthard, Frentzen and Zonta, pitted for wet tyres. Villeneuve spun after minor contact with teammate Zonta but managed to continue. Trulli was issued with a ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty on lap 37 because he was observed overtaking Barrichello under yellow flags. He took the penalty immediately and rejoined in 11th. Zonta was also issued with a penalty but spun into the tyre wall at turn 12 and retired. Coulthard became the final driver to have pitted on the 38th lap and rejoined in fifth. Button then passed de la Rosa for sixth place.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran afoul of the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when he slid off at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{dominant}} run was derailed in Abu Dhabi {{when his}} car {{was found to have}} insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved {{to the back of the}} grid. As Lewis Hamilton led the race away from the start, Vettel started from pit lane and took advantage of a chaotic opening corner that saw Nico Hülkenberg, Paul di Resta, Romain Grosjean and Bruno Senna tangle; Hülkenberg was forced out, while di Resta and Grosjean pitted with damage. Vettel began to round up the HRTs, Marussias and Caterhams, but his early progress came at the expense of his front wing endplate when he made contact with Senna at Turn 8 switchback. He chose not to pit for the time being, as the race was interrupted by the intervention of the safety car. Nico Rosberg, who had been forced to pit with damage to his front wing, was in the process of overtaking Narain Karthikeyan as Karthikeyan's car began to fail and the Indian quickly slowed. Rosberg, caught unawares by Karthikeyan's troubles, was launched over the back of the HRT and into the barrier. During the safety car period, Vettel was forced to pit when he swerved to avoid Daniel Ricciardo and crashed into the polystyrene bollard marking the start of the DRS zone, further damaging his wing. Red Bull Racing took the opportunity to pit him early, with the downside being that Vettel would have to do 42 laps on the soft tyre when supplier Pirelli predicted they could only do 36. Meanwhile, Hamilton suffered another mechanical failure while leading the race, and was once again forced out, handing the lead to Kimi Räikkönen while Fernando Alonso inherited second. Vettel began to work his way through the field again, but was forced to make a second stop when his tyres started losing grip. He was saved by the second appearance of the safety car moments later, brought about when di Resta forced Sergio Pérez wide; as Pérez rejoined the circuit, he cut back across the front of Grosjean and the two made contact, which in turn forced Grosjean into the path of Mark Webber. Grosjean and Webber retired, whilst Pérez was given a <b>stop-go</b> penalty. When racing resumed, Räikkönen began to rebuild his lead over Alonso, who was being harried by Jenson Button; Button himself was being harried by Vettel in fourth. Button and Vettel's duel allowed Alonso to break free, and he started chasing down Räikkönen in the last five laps. Räikkönen held on to secure his – and Lotus F1's – first victory of the season. Alonso was second, while Vettel caught and passed Button to complete the podium, keeping a ten-point championship lead in the process. With both Alonso and Vettel finishing on the podium with him, Räikkönen's win was not enough to keep him in contention for the World Drivers' Championship, leaving the title to be fought out between Alonso and Vettel over the final two races of the season.|$|E
25|$|McLaren driver David Coulthard started second, {{alongside}} Michael Schumacher. However, Coulthard {{was forced}} to serve a ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty on lap eight because he moved forward into the lead before the start. Michael Schumacher's main rival in the championship, Mika Häkkinen, started from fourth but retired with an blown engine on lap 26. Michael Schumacher thus had an unchallenged lead {{and was able to}} clinch his seventh win of the season, despite a spin {{in the final stages of}} the race.|$|E
25|$|Diniz {{started off}} the season by {{retiring}} with transmission problems in Australia. He, along with Salo, {{were forced to}} withdraw from the Brazilian Grand Prix due to potentially dangerous wing failures during the weekend. He managed to finish in the next two races—eighth in San Marino and eleventh at the British Grand Prix—which was followed by a retirement at the Spanish Grand Prix due to a spin on the first lap. He was involved in a collision with Giancarlo Fisichella's Benetton in Austria for which he received a <b>stop-go</b> penalty, and in Germany, Diniz collided with Prost driver Jean Alesi forcing both drivers to retire. Diniz finished the year scoring no points and was unclassified in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
25|$|The {{first race}} {{of the season in}} Australia saw Irvine {{involved}} in a race ending first lap crash with Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve. At the next race in Brazil, he could only manage sixteenth place, having found his car difficult to drive. Two weeks later he finished a career high second place in Argentina, where Irvine challenged Villeneuve for the lead, who was suffering with a stomach ailment, and his car with brake problems. The result ended demands in the Italian press for Irvine to be sacked. A third place at the next race in San Marino, and another in Monaco two weeks later, gave Irvine his best string of finishes to date. At the Spanish Grand Prix Irvine finished only twelfth and was given a 10-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty, after he held up Olivier Panis and Jean Alesi when running a lap down.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the third}} event to take place with {{electronic}} sensors monitoring every car for jump-starts, and {{at this stage of}} the race, six drivers (Barrichello, Brundle, Montermini, Frentzen, Morbidelli and Panis) were issued with ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalties for this offence. All except Montermini came in promptly to serve their penaltiessome even having to form a queue in the penalty areabut the Pacific driver failed to pit within the stipulated three laps of receiving it, whereupon he was disqualified from the race, having climbed to 17thplace before belatedly serving his penalty. The penalised drivers dropped back through the field as a result of losing time, with the result that after 16laps completed, the race order was: Hill, Schumacher, Coulthard, Alesi, Berger, Herbert, Irvine, Blundell, Badoer, Katayama, Brundle, Martini, Barrichello, Panis, Frentzen, Boullion, Salo, Montermini (yet to serve his penalty), Gachot, Inoue, Diniz and Morbidelli.|$|E
500|$|While most jumping spiders walk quickly, in a <b>stop-go</b> gait {{and jumping}} over obstacles, the {{movements}} of Phaeacius are very unusual. Phaeacius usually uses a [...] "flattened posture" [...] head-down on a vertical surface, with the body, legs and palps pressed against the surface, the hindmost legs upwards and the other legs downwards, and its markings and flattened body make it easily hidden against the bark of a tree trunk. Its habit of walking with its body and legs flattened against a surface helps Phaeacius to be unobtrusive.|$|E
500|$|After a poor race in Canada, {{where he}} stalled {{on the grid}} before the {{formation}} lap before receiving a ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race started, Coulthard said that Ferrari could still {{be caught in the}} season's nine remaining races: [...] "We have to look towards Magny-Cours and put this (Montreal) race behind us. The championship is not over yet and although we cannot change what happened in Canada, we can try to close the gap." [...] Former World Champion and President of the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) Jackie Stewart backed Coulthard to clinch the title after Häkkinen's continuing run of poor results. Michael Schumacher came into the race confident that his car would perform well at the circuit. Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore played down his team's chances saying, [...] "We need a miracle to finish on the podium." ...|$|E
500|$|After Ferrari's {{victory at}} the {{previous}} race, their team's technical director Ross Brawn said that [...] "Our pitstops and our race strategy went well, but we just weren't quick enough.", while di Montezemolo urged the mechanics and engineers of Ferrari to concentrate on rectifying the issue of wheel-spin and also praised Häkkinen for his recent trend of good starts. Barrichello said that he blamed his poor qualifying performance for his fourth-place finish. Ralf Schumacher and Frentzen were pleased to finish in fifth and sixth places respectively. Fisichella, who retired from the race from an brake problem, said that the reoccurring problem caused damage to his car and forced his later retirement. Gené placed blame upon faulty radio communication to his team {{as the reason for}} his <b>stop-go</b> penalty and said that he did not receive the blue flag until the last moment. Jaguar's technical director Gary Anderson was angry with Gené after the race as he believed the Spaniard's driving cost Irvine the chance to take a points-scoring position. [...] "I don't understand why the blue flags weren't waved because it was plain for all to see." [...] said Anderson.|$|E
500|$|The race {{began at}} 14:00 local time, with air and track {{temperatures}} at clouds, but no rain, were predicted for the race. Standing {{water on the}} track, causing heavy spray and impairing visibility, meant that the race would start behind the safety car; all cars except Pedro Diniz' had wet tyres. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane started from the pit lane, since he changed to his team's spare car after his engine failed during the warm-up. The race began without a formation lap. During the safety-car period, Diniz spun off; he was passed by Pedro de la Rosa, who received a ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty which he served on lap 13. The safety car entered the pit lane after one lap, and the cars were allowed to overtake after crossing the start-finish line. Häkkinen maintained his lead going into the first corner, followed by Trulli, Button, Michael Schumacher and Coulthard. Herbert ran wide at the first turn, losing ninth place to Barrichello. At {{the end of the}} first racing lap, Diniz dropped to the rear of the field. De la Rosa lost 16th position on lap three after running wide at turn 18, losing two places to Alesi and Verstappen.|$|E
500|$|Ralf Schumacher {{spun off}} the track because of brake failure and retired on lap 50. His {{teammate}} Button ran wide while challenging Villeneuve for fourth position on lap 51 but remained in front of Salo. Zonta became the final retirement of the race when his engine failed on lap 59. On the same lap, Mazzacane was issued with a 10-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty. He took his penalty on lap 61. Coulthard set the fastest lap of the race a 1:11.783 on lap 66, as he closed a nine-second gap to Häkkinen who was running slower on the same lap, although {{it appeared that the}} Finn would win the race comfortably. Diniz overtook Wurz to take ninth position four laps later. Häkkinen crossed the finish line on lap 71 to take his second win of the season in a time of 1'28:15.818, at an average speed of [...] Coulthard finished second 12.5 seconds behind, ahead of Barrichello in third, Villeneuve in fourth, Button in fifth and Salo rounded out the points scoring positions in sixth. Herbert, Gené, Diniz and Wurz filled the next four positions, abeit one lap behind the winner, with Burti and Mazzacane the last of the classified drivers.|$|E
2500|$|Hill and Schumacher stayed together, {{separated}} by two seconds until lap 14, when Schumacher {{was given a}} five-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty for passing Hill on the parade lap. The team told him to ignore this as they were appealing the decision. [...] Schumacher stayed out beyond the three laps required {{to adhere to the}} penalty, and was then shown the black flag meaning he was excluded from the race and from that point would have to return to the pits and retire. Benetton, however, continued to negotiate and appeal the decision with race officials. [...] Schumacher did return to the pits on lap 26, but only for the five-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty. He re-joined the race in third behind Berger and Hill.|$|E
2500|$|The race {{started at}} 14:00 local time. The {{conditions}} on the grid were dry and damp before the race; the air temperature was [...] and the track temperature [...] Approximately 250,000 people attended the race, breaking the record attendance figure set at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. Every driver except for Herbert started on the intermediate compound tyre. Coulthard, who started alongside Michael Schumacher, jumped the start and moved into the lead. Coulthard was later issued with a ten-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty. Going into the first corner, Häkkinen withstood Barrichello attempts to pass him for third place. Herbert made a poor start, dropping from 19th to 22nd {{at the end of}} the first lap. Frentzen lost seventh place mid-lap after running wide, losing two positions to Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher. At the end of the first lap, Coulthard led from Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Trulli, Button, Villeneuve, Ralf Schumacher, Frentzen, Diniz, Zonta, Wurz, Irvine, Verstappen, Heidfeld, Salo, de la Rosa, Alesi, Fisichella, Gene, Mazzacane and Herbert. Coulthard had built an 1.7-second lead over Michael Schumacher by the start of lap two. On the back straight, Button attempted to overtake Trulli for fifth, but the two drivers collided. Both drivers made pit stops for repairs and emerged at the back of the field. Frentzen passed Ralf Schumacher for sixth position, while Zonta overtook Diniz for eighth and Verstappen moved up two positions to tenth after overtaking Irvine and Wurz.|$|E
2500|$|Ferrari's first 1–2 finish since 2010 {{came at the}} , where Vettel {{became the}} first Ferrari driver to win in Monaco since Michael Schumacher had done so 16 years earlier, in 2001. The event also marked Kimi Räikkönen's first pole {{position}} since the 2008 French Grand Prix, almost nine years earlier, after beating Vettel by 0.043 seconds in qualifying. Controversy folllowed at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. On lap 19 of the Grand Prix, immediately prior to the Safety Car restart, Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton collided after the former hit the latter in the rear. Vettel, having judged Hamilton, the leader, to have brake-tested him at the exit of Turn 15 of the Baku City Circuit, then drove alongside him and turned into him. Vettel was awarded a 10-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty for his actions, losing a win after Hamilton had issues of his own. [...] Vettel, however, still re-emerged ahead of Hamilton after the former served his penalty and extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship. The FIA, the sport's governing body, summoned Vettel to an extraordinary meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council for his actions at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, but ruled that no further action was necessary after Vettel issued a full apology. After four races without a win, Ferrari returned to success at the Hungarian Grand Prix with a victory by Sebastian Vettel and their second 1–2 of the season.|$|E
50|$|A penalty box will {{be added}} for this season. In case of a false start, the driver must endure a <b>stop-go</b> penalty in this zone {{avoiding}} the need to restart the race. <b>Stop-go</b> penalty can be also given for too aggressive car-to-car contact, such causing a competing driver to spin out by pushing their car.|$|E
50|$|Examples include elevators, washing {{machines}} and other systems with interrelated <b>stop-go</b> operations.|$|E
50|$|On lap 14, Michael Schumacher {{was handed}} a five-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty for {{overtaking}} Hill {{on the first}} formation lap. He failed to serve the penalty by lap 21, {{and as a result}} was shown the black flag twice, requiring him to stop immediately at the pits. Schumacher did not acknowledge the black flag, and later claimed that he had not seen it. Benetton told the race officials {{that there had been a}} misunderstanding over the 5-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty, and after discussing the issue with the team the officials withdrew the black flag and Schumacher finally served the <b>stop-go</b> penalty at the end of lap 27.|$|E
50|$|During the race, Michael Schumacher and Minardi's Esteban Tuero {{were given}} 10 second <b>stop-go</b> {{penalties}} for pit lane speeding.|$|E
5000|$|The ten-second (or [...] "stop-go") penalty {{requires}} {{the driver to}} enter the pitlane, stop at his pit for ten seconds, and exit again. As the stop is designed to punish the driver for an offence, team mechanics are forbidden {{to work on the}} offending car at any time while the driver is serving the penalty. <b>Stop-go</b> penalties are generally imposed for more serious offences, such as jump starts, pit lane speeding, ignoring blue flags, or unfair blocking. The ten second halt makes a <b>stop-go</b> penalty much more costly to a driver's race time than a drive-through penalty.|$|E
50|$|As Michael Schumacher {{extended}} his lead, the stewards informed the Williams team that Ralf Schumacher would be {{served with a}} 10-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty. Ralf Schumacher took his penalty on Lap 39 and dropped from 2nd to 4th position.|$|E
50|$|Michael Schumacher ran {{as high as}} 3rd, but {{received}} a <b>stop-go</b> penalty for overtaking Heinz-Harald Frentzen under yellow flags. Schumacher claimed {{he had not seen}} them, and that they were not visible {{on the inside of the}} corner.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} <b>stop-go</b> {{motion is}} a temporal form of jaggies; formally, {{a form of}} aliasing. This effect may be the intention, but to reduce the frame rate without introducing this effect, one may use temporal anti-aliasing, which yields motion blur.|$|E
50|$|For the drive-through and <b>stop-go</b> penalties, {{a driver}} has two laps {{from the time}} his team hears of the penalty to enter the pits; {{if he does not}} pit within two laps, he will be black-flagged. The {{exception}} to this rule is if the Safety Car is deployed before a driver serves his penalty, in which case he is not allowed to serve his penalty until after the Safety Car comes back in. If he incurs a penalty within the last five laps of the race, he need not pit at all; instead, twenty seconds will be added to his total race time in case of a drive-through penalty, and thirty seconds in case of <b>stop-go</b> penalty.|$|E
50|$|Hill and Schumacher stayed together, {{separated}} by two seconds until lap 14, when Schumacher {{was given a}} five-second <b>stop-go</b> penalty for passing Hill on the parade lap.

He re-joined the race in third behind Berger and Hill.|$|E
50|$|However under Thatcherite {{management}} the macro-economy was unstable, even by {{the standards}} of the Keynesian era of <b>stop-go.</b> The amplitude of fluctuations in gross domestic product and real gross private non-residential fixed capital formation was greater in the United Kingdom than for the OECD.|$|E
50|$|This race {{is notable}} for {{featuring}} the longest <b>stop-go</b> penalties {{in the history}} of the V8 Supercars. A five-minute penalty was awarded to Greg Murphy due to a pit-lane infringement and a similar penalty was imposed on the Team Brock car (No. 05) for a similar offence.|$|E
