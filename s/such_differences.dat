5|$|The common {{phenomenon}} amongst {{birds in}} which {{males and females}} {{of the same species}} exhibit different characteristics beyond the differences in their sexual organs. It can manifest in size or plumage differences. Sexual size dimorphism varies among taxa with males typically being larger, though this is not always the case i.e. in birds of prey, hummingbirds, and some species of flightless birds. Plumage dimorphism, in the form of ornamentation or colouration, also varies, though males are typically the more ornamented or brightly coloured sex. <b>Such</b> <b>differences</b> have been attributed to the unequal reproductive contributions of the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of <b>such</b> <b>differences</b> include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} with non-linguistic experiments in languages with different grammatical properties (e.g., languages {{with and without}} numeral classifiers or with different gender grammar systems) showed that language differences in human categorization are due to <b>such</b> <b>differences.</b> Experimental research suggests that this linguistic influence on thought diminishes over time, as when speakers of one language are exposed to another.|$|E
25|$|British English often prefers {{hyphenated}} compounds, such as anti-smoking, whereas American English discourages {{the use of}} hyphens in compounds {{where there}} is no compelling reason, so antismoking is much more common. Many dictionaries do not point out <b>such</b> <b>differences.</b> Canadian and Australian usage is mixed, although Commonwealth writers generally hyphenate compounds of the form noun plus phrase (such as editor-in-chief). Commander-in-chief prevails in all forms of English.|$|E
25|$|There {{is clear}} {{empirical}} evidence for structural and functional {{differences in the}} brains of people who stutter.

25|$|Early Modern Cornish was {{the subject}} of a study {{published}} by Lhuyd in 1707, and differs from the medieval language in having a considerably simpler structure and grammar. <b>Such</b> <b>differences</b> included the wide use of certain modal affixes that, although out of use by Lhuyd's time, had a considerable effect on the word-order of medieval Cornish. The medieval language also possessed two additional tenses for expressing past events and an extended set of possessive suffixes.|$|E
25|$|Many theologians note {{by way of}} {{comparison}} that in the Catholic Church, the Assumption is dogmatically defined, while in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, the Dormition is less dogmatically than liturgically and mystically defined. <b>Such</b> <b>differences</b> spring from a larger pattern in the two traditions, wherein Catholic teachings are often dogmatically and authoritatively defined – {{in part because of}} the more centralized structure of the Catholic Church – while in Eastern Orthodoxy, many doctrines are less authoritative.|$|E

25|$|Another {{consideration}} in the configuration of a projection is its compatibility with data sets to be used on the map. Data sets are geographic information; their collection depends on the chosen datum (model) of the Earth. Different datums assign slightly different coordinates to the same location, so in large scale maps, such as those from national mapping systems, {{it is important to}} match the datum to the projection. The slight differences in coordinate assignation between different datums is not a concern for world maps or other vast territories, where <b>such</b> <b>differences</b> get shrunk to imperceptibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{changes in}} the royal style in the 20th century took into account the {{emergence}} of independence for the dominions from the Imperial Parliament of the United Kingdom. The kings successively and their advisers and governments in the United Kingdom were fully aware that the republican intent of {{the representatives of the}} Irish Free State was in marked contrast to the intent of the governments of certain other dominions, such as Canada. and <b>such</b> <b>differences</b> were manifested in this period in the design and use of flags and other national symbols for the Irish Free State and other dominions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} notable differences. The Heaðobards Ingeld and Froda also appear in Scandinavian tradition, but their tribe, the Heaðobards, {{had long been}} forgotten, and instead the tribal feud was {{rendered}} as a family feud. Their relationship as father and son had also been reversed in some sources, and so either Ingeld or Froda is given as the brother of Healfdene. Ingeld or Froda murdered Healfdene, but was himself killed in revenge by Hrothgar and Halga. Moreover, in Scandinavian tradition, Hrothgar is a minor character in comparison to his nephew Hroðulf. <b>Such</b> <b>differences</b> indicate that Beowulf and Scandinavian sources represent separate traditions.|$|E

25|$|Some contemporaries of Couturat, notably Edward Sapir saw the {{challenge}} of an auxiliary language {{not so much as}} that of identifying a particular linguistic answer (of grammar and vocabulary) to pressing pragmatic problems of communication, but rather as one of promoting the principle of a linguistic platform for lasting international understanding. Though scholarly interest waned greatly throughout the 20th century, <b>such</b> <b>differences</b> of approach persist today. Some scholars and interested laymen make concrete language proposals. By contrast, Pei and others place the broader societal issue first. Yet others argue in favor of a particular language while seeking to establish its social integration.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{frequencies}} {{are often}} assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign Concert A (the A above middle C on the piano) {{to the frequency}} of 440Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435Hz. <b>Such</b> <b>differences</b> can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in historically informed performance of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering {{that it should be}} allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.|$|E
25|$|Relative {{risks are}} {{affected}} by the prevalence of the condition in the reference group (in contrast to likelihood ratios, which are not), and this issue results in that the validity of post-test probabilities become less valid with increasing difference between the prevalence in the reference group and the pre-test probability for any individual. Any known risk factor or previous test of an individual almost always confers such a difference, decreasing the validity of using relative risks in estimating the total effect of multiple risk factors or tests. Most physicians do not appropriately take <b>such</b> <b>differences</b> in prevalence into account when interpreting test results, which may cause unnecessary testing and diagnostic errors.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} {{preceding}} {{the war and}} after the attack on Fort Sumter, Jesse's leather store became a hotbed of Republican discussion and agitation. Jesse and his sons Simpson and Orvil, were all staunch Republicans, while Ulysses had Democrat leanings and originally favored Douglas over Lincoln. The looming war would soon diminish <b>such</b> <b>differences</b> for all. Various speakers, including Jesse's lawyer, John Rawlins, engaged {{in a number of}} passionate public discussions over secession and other politics. Ulysses Grant was still working at the store when on April 15, the day after the battle, news of the attack on Fort Sumter reached Galena, where he promptly re-enlisted into the Army, answering President Lincoln's call for seventy five thousand volunteers.|$|E
25|$|There is less sexual {{dimorphism}} in plumage, however, {{with only}} 25 species showing <b>such</b> <b>differences</b> {{between the two}} sexes. The plumage of the starling is often brightly coloured due to iridescence; this colour {{is derived from the}} structure of the feathers, not from any pigment. Some species of Asian starling have crests or erectile feathers on the crest. Other ornamentation includes elongated tail feathers and brightly coloured bare areas on the face. These colours can be derived from pigments, or, as in the Bali starling, structural colour, caused by light scattering off parallel collagen fibres. The irises of many species are red and yellow, although those of younger birds are much darker.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the theory}} of the actual Fowler-Nordheim {{tunneling}} process is much the same for all materials (though details of barrier shape may vary, and modified theory has to be developed for initial states that are localized rather than are travelling-wave-like). However, notwithstanding <b>such</b> <b>differences,</b> one expects (for thermodynamic equilibrium situations) that all CFE equations will have exponents that behave in a generally similar manner. This is why applying Fowler-Nordheim-type equations to materials outside the scope of the derivations given here often works. If interest is only in parameters (such as field enhancement factor) that relate to the slope of Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plots and to the exponent of the CFE equation, then Fowler-Nordheim-type theory will often give sensible estimates. However, attempts to derive meaningful current density values will usually or always fail.|$|E
