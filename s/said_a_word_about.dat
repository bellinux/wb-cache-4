50|$|His son Louis was {{friends with}} painter Paul Cézanne (1839-1906). As a result, Victor Leydet {{attended}} Cézanne's funeral and <b>said</b> <b>a</b> few <b>words</b> <b>about</b> him.|$|R
60|$|What amazed Larry {{more than}} {{anything}} was the quietness of the Japanese sailors. Now that the bombardment was ended they <b>said</b> scarcely <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it, but went on exactly as before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, now, Charlie," [...] said Shank, in his {{ordinary}} tones, [...] "let me {{hear something}} about yourself. You have not <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> yet <b>about</b> {{what you have}} been doing these three years past." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “What?” screamed Bertie, {{jumping up}} from his sea, “a brown horse! Miserable woman, you never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it’s being a brown horse.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> her {{not meeting}} him. Of course I {{do not wish}} that any meeting should be {{contrived}} between them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> you," [...] replied Michael. [...] "I {{spoke of}} Ezra Thomas; and do please {{remember}} that there's no such party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did he {{say where}} he was going to? We were {{shooting}} together all yesterday afternoon, and he <b>said</b> not <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> going away. On the contrary, he arranged to go to Norwich on Thursday to look at some horses." ...|$|R
60|$|To Frank I had <b>said</b> not <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> Betty; {{when he came}} to The Maples I {{took him}} over to Glenby and, coming upon Betty {{wandering}} about among the beeches in the sunset, I introduced him without any warning.|$|R
2500|$|For a long time, she {{has been}} {{reluctant}} to endorse Donald Trump, while other European populists had already embraced his candidacy, and only supported him by saying: [...] "For France, anything is better than Hillary Clinton". However, on 8 November 2016 she posted a tweet congratulating Trump on his presidential victory. Nevertheless, her strategy has difficulties as her image seems to remain controversial: Germany's Angela Merkel has said she [...] "will contribute to make other political forces stronger than the National Front" [...] and Israel still holds a bad opinion of her party. Nigel Farage has said: [...] "I've never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>word</b> <b>about</b> Marine Le Pen; I've never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> good <b>word</b> <b>about</b> her party".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} they have," [...] said Gregory. [...] "Ralph does change his mind sometimes. He hasn't <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> her to me lately." ...|$|E

6000|$|ELDER DANIELS. Why should I? We never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> {{the horse}} at all. How was I {{to know what}} it was in your mind to do? ...|$|E
60|$|He saw Easton {{only once}} during a {{week-end}} at Chexington. The young man displayed no further disposition to be confidentially sentimental. But {{he seemed to}} have something on his mind. And Amanda <b>said</b> not <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> him. He was a young man above suspicion, Benham felt....|$|R
6000|$|He stared a moment, taken aback. [...] "Good God! Ye don't say so, child! Her brother! O'Moy's brother-in-law! And O'Moy never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to me <b>about</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{the first}} man who had ever <b>said</b> <b>a</b> kind <b>word</b> <b>about</b> the spirit, and Whibley loved him for it. The Count seemed as though he could never see enough of Whibley after that evening, {{and the three of}} them--Whibley, the Count, and [...] "Maria"--would sit up half the night talking together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Kirk," [...] she said, [...] "have {{you come}} back with your trunk crammed with nuggets? You haven't <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> the mine yet, and I'm dying to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{has told}} me to go;--and I'll go. I've worked for him as no other man would work, and have never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> {{a share in the}} business;--and never would.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you've got {{anything}} {{to tell me}} about my father, go right ahead. You'll be the only man I've ever met who has <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> him. Who the deuce was he, anyway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Loveday peeped out, {{and raised}} her hands with delight. 'And he has not <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to us <b>about</b> it! What a lovely epaulette! I must call his father.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When the tarts were done, Miss Crane {{put them}} away in the best parlor closet, and <b>said</b> not <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> them, for she wanted to {{surprise}} the boys at tea-time. When the minute came and all were seated at table, she went to get her tarts, but came back looking much troubled, for {{what do you think}} had happened?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{awfully good}} of him," [...] Wilfrid said, [...] "and he never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to me <b>about</b> it. Where is he?" [...] {{and he looked}} round. But Mr. Atherton had disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{had nothing}} in the world to do with it. He never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it till he {{threatened}} to kill me--the great brute!' This was learning something indeed! She went on in the same voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{had only}} known, I {{would rather have}} cut my tongue out than have <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it. What {{do you think she}} did? She burst out crying, and ordered me to leave the room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The army!" [...] Harry exclaimed {{in a tone}} of {{astonished}} delight. [...] "Oh, sir, do {{you really}} think of my going into the army? You never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> that before. I should like that immensely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Robinson is {{certainly}} {{right not to}} break his engagement with Miss Walker," [...] said Sophonisba. Now I had <b>said</b> not <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> engagement with Miss Walker, having only mentioned incidentally {{that she would be}} one of the party at Innspruck. [...] "But," [...] continued she, [...] "I think he should not have misled us." [...] And in this way we enjoyed our evening meal.|$|R
60|$|My {{excellent}} innocent father! Not {{the faintest}} {{idea of what}} I had been thinking of was in his mind. Little did he suspect how welcome was the relief that he had afforded to his daughter's wicked doubts of him. But he had not <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> yet <b>about</b> his cousin's personal appearance. There might be remains of good looks which the housemaid was too stupid to discover.|$|R
60|$|Relieved of the attentions of the Prentice family, {{he walked}} the streets a free man; and it was counted to him for righteousness that he never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> hard <b>word</b> <b>about</b> his wife. She had her faults, he said, but they were many {{thousand}} miles away, and he preferred to forget them. And he added, with some truth, that he owed her a good deal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord only knows. Thet {{worries me}} some. Because he never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> how {{he come to}} lose his clothes or why he had the 'dobe on him. An' sure I never told. Nobody knows but us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{exceedingly}} sorry, then, that I <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it: but {{the whole}} parish talks of it," [...] answered Tom, who was surprised at this fresh proof of the little confidence which Aberalva put in their parson.|$|E
6000|$|... "Joseph never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] said Mr. Tredgold, {{with an air}} {{of great}} frankness. [...] "He merely said that you were in the garden, and, not being able to find you, I thought that he was mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, then, why didn't you BOY one?" [...] Mrs. O'Dowd said; {{and both}} Amelia and William Dobbin thanked her for this timely observation. But beyond this {{neither of the}} ladies rallied. Amelia was {{overpowered}} by the flash and the dazzle and the fashionable talk of her worldly rival. Even the O'Dowd was silent and subdued after Becky's brilliant apparition, and scarcely <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> more <b>about</b> Glenmalony all the evening.|$|R
60|$|He also {{remembered that}} he had not <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to Freda <b>about</b> the Ideal. And he never did say much more--perhaps because he could not get the chance. Tim was always there before him and {{generally}} outstayed him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tell him so,' {{retorted}} Peggotty, {{looking out}} of her apron. 'He has never <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to me <b>about</b> it. He knows better. If he was to make so bold as say <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to me, I should slap his face.' ...|$|R
