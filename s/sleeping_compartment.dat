25|$|At the time, the Armagnac {{was one of}} {{the largest}} civil {{aircraft}} ever built with a wingspan of almost 50 meters and weight over 77 tonnes. The capacious pressurized cabin (with a near-circular fuselage section with 4.7 m/ 15ft width and height) was intended for a three tier <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartment</b> configuration which ultimately was not fitted to any of the S.E.2010 versions. The fuselage was left with a good deal of unusable space with only open luggage shelves mounted in the upper fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|Warren Freer {{became an}} Auckland Labour member of {{parliament}} in 1947, and recalled the Friday night comradeship in a <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartment</b> of the train to Auckland after a week in Parliament, when a bottle of whisky would be produced and incidents in the house or caucus recalled. Freer and Charles Petrie lived near the Otahuhu Station, and Petrie arranged via a sympathetic guard for the driver to slow the train after Middlemore Station {{so that they could}} save time by alighting there; the younger Freer first so Petrie could pass their bags to him and then alight; the train then speeded up towards Auckland. In 1949 air travel to Wellington was introduced for backbench MPs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to its wooden wings, {{the hull of}} the CAMS 110 was all metal. [...] It was built from transverse and longitudinal light alloy frames and covered with védal, duralumin with an outer layer of aluminium for protection from sea-water. The planing bottom had two steps, one under {{the trailing edge of}} the wing and the other further aft. Longitudinal stability was assured by wing floats of similar construction to the hull. [...] The CAMS 110 was intended for long flights and carried five or six crew, all in enclosed accommodation. The commander, who was navigator, observer and bomb-aimer was housed in the nose in a cabin with three windows on each side and provided with a chart table. He could also operate one of the two machine guns on mounts just aft of the windows or use a position in the roof from which, behind a folding glass windscreen, he could observe in the open air. On top of the fuselage, offset to port, was a long glazed cabin which seated two pilots in tandem, provided with dual control. Below, {{on the other side of}} the fuselage was the flight engineer's position and behind him the radio operator's post. Machine gun mounts allowed a gunner to cover either side. Further aft there was a <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartment,</b> a kitchen and a toilet.|$|E

5000|$|Use of a <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartment</b> on {{overnight}} trains is {{not covered}} by the Rail Pass and requires payment of the limited express fare and the accommodation charge. Overnight trains that run over non-JR tracks (i.e. Cassiopeia [...] ) require additional charges.|$|E

50|$|The {{continuing}} Sud Express runs as a {{night train}} from Irun at the French/Spanish border to Lisbon and from Lisbon to Hendaye. Until April 2010, facilities existed for 2nd class seated accommodation, 2nd class couchette cars (6-bunk compartments), and 1st class private <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartments</b> for 1, 2 or 3 passengers.|$|R
50|$|The six-wheeler was {{originally}} procured for maintenance duties on the branch lines around Passau {{and is therefore}} converted today into a departmental wagon.

50|$|Once {{they are}} set up, {{the room is}} divided into a <b>sleeping</b> <b>{{compartment}},</b> and another compartment where calabashes and guards of all sizes are intricately arranged in a stack according to their sizes and functions. Spoons made from gourda are hung from the rooftop, with others meant for grain storage.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{whatever}} happened {{that should not}} have happened; everything was orderly and well managed; the courier and the maid saw to tickets and to luggage, to hotel rooms and <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartments.</b> It was obviously their mission in life to see that nothing untoward or unexpected happened, but only the obvious.|$|R
50|$|First-class {{travel on}} TrainLink comes in two forms. On Xplorer and XPT trains, {{first-class}} seating is offered which include an increased legroom and seating recline over economy-class seating. On some XPT trains, first-class <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartments</b> {{can also be}} found. On day services these accommodate three people per compartment, and by night they carry two people with bunk-style accommodation.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the closest}} station to Saltwood Castle (where Alan Clark lived until his death) and it is {{frequently}} mentioned in the Alan Clark Diaries.

5000|$|... 1st, 2nd and 3rd class sleeper {{services}} were offered, {{as well as}} 1st/3rd class compartments. Trains were typically about 12 cars long, of which not more than three would have contained standard seating. The fare surcharge for a 2nd class sleeper berth was 22/6! The <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartment</b> accommodations themselves appear not to have substantially changed in design until 2012 ...|$|E
50|$|A Traveller {{estate car}} {{version of the}} Series V Farina body was {{announced}} 28 September 1960. The new body now provided a double bed size <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartment</b> about 6 ft long and 4 ft wide. The {{back of the car}} had a tail-board hinged at the bottom and an upper panel hinged at the top. The Morris version had a single bench front seat and cost £10 more than the equivalent Austin Countryman.|$|E
5000|$|Each car had a side hallway, serving an attendant's {{compartment}} at pone end plus ten individual compartments. Each {{of these}} could seat three passengers in day mode, but were only fitted with two berths (in a bunk arrangement) for night travel. The berths {{were set up}} while passengers were {{in the dining room}} for dinner, and restored to seating format following breakfast each day. The name [...] "twinette" [...] indicates two people per <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Currently, several trains {{cross the}} nearby Polish–Ukrainian border (mostly via Przemyśl in Poland). There are good {{connections}} to Slovakia (Košice) and Hungary (Budapest). Many routes have overnight trains with <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartments.</b> Lviv railway {{is often called}} the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the [...] "Schengen" [...] countries.|$|R
50|$|To {{provide for}} the upgrade, a new design of steel {{carriages}} was developed, to replace {{the worst of the}} E type sleeping carriages. The first car, Allambi, entered service in 1949 as a roomette sleeper with a central corridor and ten <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartments</b> either side, with room for 20 passengers. The car was fitted with airconditioning and electric lighting, powered by axle-driven generators.|$|R

50|$|The Norwegian Royal Train {{is a set}} of train {{carriages}} used by the Norwegian {{royal family}} and maintained by Norges Statsbaner (Norwegian State Railways). The current set was introduced in 1994 in connection with the Lillehammer Olympics and replaced a set from 1962, that had consisted of B3 carriages named A1. The set contains a main <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartment</b> with dressing room and adjoining bathroom, two guest compartments, guest bathroom, kitchen, guard compartments and a combined dining and conference room.|$|E
50|$|The cabin {{interior}} can {{be converted}} to several different configurations to allow for cargo and medevacs. Due to the ease of converting the cabin the Learjet 25 has found a niche as a medevac aircraft. This is achieved by removing the starboard seating to allow for a stretcher, mounting oxygen bottles and intravenous drip equipment. The two flight crew are then supplemented by either a doctor or flight nurse or both. The Model 25C also has an optional two bed <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E

50|$|Long-distance trains {{running at}} night usually have <b>sleeping</b> <b>{{compartments}}</b> with <b>sleeping</b> berths. In {{the case of}} compartments with two berths, one {{is on top of}} the other in a double-bunk arrangement. These beds (the lower bed in a double-bunk arrangement) are usually designed in conjunction with seats which occupy the same space, and each can be folded away when the other is in use.|$|R
50|$|Shore {{power or}} shore supply is the {{provision}} of shoreside electrical power to a ship at berth while its main and auxiliary engines are shut down. While the term denotes shore as opposed to off-shore, it is sometimes applied to aircraft or land-based vehicles (such as campers, heavy trucks with <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartments</b> and tour buses), which may plug into grid power when parked for idle reduction.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by {{industrial}} designer Brooks Stevens, the Olympian Hiawatha included the Milwaukee Road's signature Skytop solarium observation car. Similar to those {{built for the}} Twin Cities Hiawathas, the Olympian Hiawatha's Skytops had more glass area from the rear forward and <b>sleeping</b> <b>compartments</b> in the forward two-thirds of the car. The Milwaukee Road billed the Skytops as [...] "the perfect ending for a perfect train".|$|R
