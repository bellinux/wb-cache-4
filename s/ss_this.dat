5|$|Schreck, a {{founding}} member of the SA and a close confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925. On 15 April 1926, Joseph Berchtold succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to Reichsführer-SS (Reich Leader-SS). Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over the <b>SS.</b> <b>This</b> led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, Erhard Heiden, on 1 March 1927. Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.|$|E

500|$|In early 1944, the SS {{directed}} {{the governments of}} Hungary and the Slovak State to transfer to the Waffen-SS all the Volksdeutsche serving in their armed forces. This amounted to another 50,000 troops. During 1944, Berger gave a speech in which he advocated a [...] "Germanic Reich" [...] that included all the countries that had Germanic or Nordic populations. He said, [...] "Since the Schutzstaffel {{was taken over by}} the Reichsführer-SS in 1929, its long-term goal has been the Germanic Reich. This long-term goal inevitably forms part of the SS claim to be a formation of Nordic men. It cannot be stopped by artificially drawn boundaries". He was also concerned that the SS was losing its previous dominance in ideological matters, as the Wehrmacht had largely adopted the ideological maxims of the <b>SS.</b> <b>This</b> narrowing of the ideological gap between the Waffen-SS and the Army was of considerable concern to SS leaders such as Berger, as it undermined the legitimacy of the SS as the leaders of the Nazi project.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} Tree-structured Expectation Propagation (TEP) {{algorithm}} to decode finite-length Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. The TEP decoder {{is able to}} continue decoding once the standard Belief Propagation (BP) decoder fails, presenting the same computational complexity as the BP decoder. The BP algorithm {{is dominated by the}} presence of stopping sets (SSs) in the code graph. We show that the TEP decoder, without previous knowledge of the graph, naturally avoids some fairly common <b>SSs.</b> <b>This</b> results in a significant improvement in the system performance.

2500|$|In January 1929, Heinrich Himmler was {{appointed}} {{the leader of}} the fledgling Schutzstaffel (SS). He launched a massive recruitment campaign that expanded the SS from fewer than 300 members in 1929 to 10,000 in 1931. Once the SS had grown, Himmler began its transformation into a [...] "racial elite" [...] of young Nordic males. This was to be accomplished by a new bureaucracy, the Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt-SS (Race and Settlement Office of the SS), [...] known as RuSHA. Himmler appointed SS-Obergruppenführer Richard Walther Darré to lead the organisation, which determined if applicants were racially fit to be in the <b>SS.</b> <b>This</b> brought about a campaign meant to educate new applicants about their Nordic past through weekly classes taught by senior RuSHA graduates using the periodical SS-Leitheft.|$|E

40|$|The cerebellum’s role in sensory-motor {{control and}} {{adaptation}} is undisputed. However, a key hypothesis {{pertaining to the}} function of cerebellar circuitry lacks experimental support. It is universally assumed that the discharge of mossy fibers accounts for modulation of Purkinje cell “simple spikes ” (<b>SSs).</b> <b>This</b> assumption acts as a prism through which all other functions of cerebellar circuitry are viewed. The vestibulo-cerebellum (nodulus and uvula) receives a large, unilateral, vestibular primary afferent mossy fiber projection. We can test its role in modulating Purkinje cell SSs by recording the modulated activity of both mossy fiber terminals and Purkinje cell SSs evoked by identical natural vestibular stimulation. Sinusoidal rotation about the longitudinal axis (roll) modulates the activity of vestibular primary afferent mossy and climbing fibers as well as Purkinje cell SSs and complex spikes (CSs). Remarkably, vestibular primary afferent mossy fibers discharge 180 degrees out of phase with <b>SSs.</b> <b>This</b> indicates that mossy fibers cannot account for SS modulation unless an inhibitory synapse is interposed between mossy fibers or vestibular climbing fibers and Purkinje cells. The authors review several experiments that address the relative contributions of mossy and climbing fiber afferents to the modulation of SSs. They conclude that climbing fibers, not mossy fibers, are primarily responsible for the modulation of SSs as well as CSs and they propose revised functions for these two afferent systems...|$|R

30|$|Bandwidth {{request and}} grant manager first computes {{the amount of}} overdemanded {{bandwidth}} by all the SSs in the current cycle. Bandwidth request and grant manager will not activate the three microengines if the total requested bandwidth {{is less than the}} total available bandwidth. In this case, it means that the demand is less than the supply, so every request can be fulfilled and no special arrangement is needed. However, when the total requested bandwidth is more than the total available bandwidth, a mechanism is needed to distribute the bandwidth fairly among all the <b>SSs.</b> <b>This</b> mechanism also helps to prevent overassigning bandwidth to any SSs. Hence, bandwidth request and grant manager activates the three components to undertake the bandwidth granting process.|$|R
