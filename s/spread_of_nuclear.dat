40|$|The {{controlled}} transfer <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> state population {{using two}} x-ray laser pulses is investigated theoretically. The laser pulses drive two nuclear transitions {{in a nuclear}} three-level system facilitating coherent population transfer via the quantum optics technique of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. To overcome present limitations of the x-ray laser frequency, we envisage accelerated nuclei interacting with two copropagating or crossed x-ray laser pulses in a three-beam setup. We present a systematic study of this setup providing both pulse temporal sequence and laser pulse intensity for optimized control <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> state population.

40|$|We study {{electron}} transfer between two separated nuclei using local control theory. By conditioning the algorithm in a symmetric system formed by two protons, one can favored slow transfer processes, where tunneling {{is the main}} mechanism, achieving transfer efficiencies close to unity assuming fixed nuclei. The solution can be parametrized using sequences of pump and dump pi pulses, where the pump pulse is used to excite the electron to a highly excited state where the time for tunneling to the target nuclei is {{on the order of}} femtoseconds. The time delay must be chosen to allow for full population transfer via tunneling, and the dump pulse is chosen to remove energy from the state to avoid tunneling back to the original proton. Finally, we study the effect <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> kinetic energy on the transfer efficiency.

40|$|Global {{appetite}} for fission power {{is projected to}} grow dramatically this century, and for good reason. Despite considerable research to identify new sources of energy, fission remains the most plentiful and practical alternative to fossil fuels. The environmental challenges of fossil fuel have made the fission power option increasingly attractive, particularly as {{we are forced to}} rely on reserves in ecologically fragile or politically unstable corners of the globe. Caught between a globally eroding fossil fuel reserve as well as the uncertainty and considerable costs in the development of fusion power, most of the world will most likely come to rely on fission power for at least the remainder of the 21 st century. Despite inevitable growth, fission power faces enduring challenges in sustainability and security. One of fission power's greatest hurdles to universal acceptance is the risk of potential misuse for nefarious purposes of fissionable byproducts in spent fuel, such as plutonium. With this issue in mind, we have discussed intrinsic concepts in this report that are motivated by the premise that the utility, desirability, and applicability <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> materials can be reduced. In a general sense, the intrinsic solutions aim to reduce or eliminate the quantity of existing weapons usable material; avoid production of new weapons-usable material through enrichment, breeding, extraction; or employ engineering solutions to make the fuel cycle less useful or more difficult for producing weapons-usable material. By their nature, these schemes require modifications to existing fuel cycles. As such, the concomitants of these modifications require engagement from the nuclear reactor and fuel-design community to fully assess their effects. Unfortunately, active pursuit of any scheme that could further complicate the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>nuclear</b> power will probably be understandably unpopular. Nevertheless, the nonproliferation and counterterrorism issues are paramount, and we posit that the exploration, development, and implementation of intrinsic mechanisms such as discussed here are part of a balanced approach aimed at preventing the misuse <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> material for nuclear-energy applications...|$|R
40|$|Established in 1952, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{is one of}} the world's premier applied-science {{national}} security laboratories. The primary mission of the Laboratory is to assure through the design, development, and stewardship <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons, that the nation's stockpile remains safe, secure, and reliable and to prevent the <b>spread</b> and use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons worldwide. National security is a principal integrating theme at LLNL [...] with stockpile stewardship, nonproliferation and arms control, and Department of Defense projects its major elements. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, the primary Laboratory program, is a science-based versus testing-based approach to maintaining stockpile safety and reliability. The idea is to replace weapons development and nuclear testing with weapons life extension and intensive computational and experimental research to provide the fundamental understanding necessary to ensure nuclear weapons safety, performance, and maintenance. Stockpile stewardship is enhanced and complimented by a second pillar of {{national security}} at the Laboratory: countering the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> weapons of mass destruction. In the broad areas comprising nonproliferation, arms control, and international assessments, the growth of new technologies has been exponential at LLNL.
