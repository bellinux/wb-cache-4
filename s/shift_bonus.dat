40|$|Amongst {{the varied}} work schedules, {{shiftwork}} {{is the one}} which enables organizations to extend operating hours. Shiftwork, particularly shift systems involving night work in a fixed or alternate work schedule, is associated with several disorders which, in a generic way, can be classified in three interconnected domains: i) health (e. g. circadian and sleep disturbance), ii) family and social life (e. g. conflict between parental and/or conjugal roles); iii) occupational/organizational (e. g. disturbance in performance and safety). The present study examines the possible differences between three work shifts – morning, afternoon and night – in dimensions related to health, social and family life, social support and evaluation of one's work schedule, in a particular sector of activity (textile industry). 903 workers from five textile companies participated in this study. 66 % were male workers and they were predominant in the night shift. The mean age was 39. 7 (SD= 10. 62) and the mean time working in the shift was 14. 15 years (SD= 11. 84). Besides the gender distribution, {{no differences were found}} among the three shifts. These shifts were compared according to the following variables: health (digestive and sleep problems), evaluation of shift schedule (satisfaction and intention to leave), social support (supervisor, co-workers and family) and satisfaction in the interface between the shift schedule and family or social activities. Data were collected by means of published questionnaires (e. g. Standard Shiftwork Index) and especially designed ones. When compared with the morning and the afternoon shifts, the night shift was significantly associated with higher sleep disturbance and less satisfaction with shift schedule. In its turn, the morning shift was significantly associated with less intention to leave it and with a greater satisfaction with the interface between the shift schedule and extra-organizational life. Finally, the morning shift was significantly associated to a higher perception of family support in managing the work schedule, when compared with the night shift. Results show that the night shift is the most negatively evaluated work schedule. Moreover, the payment of a <b>shift</b> <b>bonus</b> to night shift workers represents in some way that the legislator recognizes the hardship of working this shift. The bonus in that sector of activity consists of 40 % of the monthly salary. In spite of this compensation (frequently the only form of compensation offered), workers evaluated more negatively their shift schedule as they also presented greater sleep problems. Results also suggest that the night work, even if it is a fixed one (and therefore more regular from a social point of view) and it involves experienced shiftworkers, would hardly be positively evaluated when compared with other work schedules. In spite of this conclusion, the implementation of other intervention strategies (e. g. educational programmes, longer holidays) may {{have an impact on the}} work schedule evaluation...|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to the regulators’ intention to reduce corporate risk-taking {{by means of a}} bonus tax, von Ehrlich and Radulescu (2012) find evidence that the implementation of such a bonus tax actually increases corporate risk-taking. The authors argue that bonus taxes induce a <b>shift</b> from cash <b>bonuses</b> to equity compensation, and therefore foster risky decision making. It appears that bonus taxes motivate managers to engage in risky activities as they reduce the volatility of their variable compensation. Subsequently, the reduced compensation risk is substituted by other forms of risk such as investment risk. Further analytical research could contribute to strengthening the argument of von Ehrlich and Radulescu (2012).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Whereas {{the short}} time {{behaviour}} of an unstable quantum mechanical system is well understood from its theoretical as well as experimental side, the long time tail of the very same systems has neither been measured experimentally nor is there a theoretical agreement {{on how to handle}} it. We suggest a possible way out of this unsatisfactory state of art. Theoretically we suggest that the correct spectral function entering the Fock-Krylov method to calculate the survival amplitude is proportional to the density of states of a resonance. The latter is essentially the energy derivative of a phase <b>shift.</b> As a <b>bonus,</b> we can connect the survival probability to scattering data via the phase shift. The method then not only establishes the spectral function, but is per se a semiempirical method to extract the large time behaviour from scattering data...|$|R

40|$|The Memorandum of Understanding {{negotiated}} with the EU/IMF in 2010 committed the government to reform the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system covering low pay workers. A significant rationale for the proposed reform was the claim that JLC regulations unduly added {{to the cost of}} labour regarding overtime rates and particularly premiums for Sunday working.  Using the 2007 National Employment Survey this paper examines the structure of earnings of workers likely to be covered by the JLC system {{and the extent to which}} low pay workers benefit from overtime earnings, <b>shift</b> allowances and <b>bonuses</b> in the private sector. The evidence does not support the argument that over-time payments including Sunday premiums in sectors covered by JLCs represent a major cost to employers in general. Few workers actually benefit from the JLC overtime rates. We argue that the removal of a floor on conditions of employment provided by the JLCs may not always be in the interests of the employer but may create a race to the bottom in low pay sectors of the economy.   PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 48) Shift differentials are {{a form of}} bonus typically paid {{to employees}} who work "premium" shifts such as evenings (3 PM- 11 PM) and nights (11 PM- 7 AM). This practice was introduced in hospitals when individual organizations began to {{find it difficult to}} recruit and place prospective employees for night and evening coverage, and now payment of shift differential is commonplace in hospitals in the San Fernando Valley. An inflationary economy, rapid changes in technology, spiraling costs, and shortages in many allied health resources, have forced many hospitals to compete for declining employee resources by providing more attractive benefits, employment bonuses, and even larger shift differentials for employees working night and evening shifts in an attempt to attract and retain qualified personnel. Consequently, increased demand for allied health professionals has led to a gradual escalation of salary and incentive programs directed at employee recruitment and placement. Concern over the increasing use of <b>shift</b> differentials and <b>bonuses</b> inspired one local hospital to more closely review the uses and effects of shift differentials in an attempt to gain greater insight into the need for shift differentials and the effectiveness of dollar oriented bonuses in the placement and retention of night duty personnel. A study was implemented to survey prevailing administrative attitudes in area hospitals relative to the need for shift differentials, and a second survey of registered nurses in a local hospital was conducted to identify the effect shift differentials have on the recruitment, placement and longevity of night nursing personnel. Study results, although not conclusive, seem to indicate that payment of shift differential is necessary due to the reduced supply of and increasing demand for qualified personnel in the labor market, as well as increased inter-institutional competition for available resources. This was observed even though night nurses ranked dollar oriented incentives secondary to job oriented motivators in the selection of night duty. Based on preliminary study, it was concluded that hospitals should not discontinue use of shift differentials, but should explore alternative incentives that will improve the quality of the job...|$|R
