5|$|Lyrically, “Between You and Me” <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> {{of seeking}} {{forgiveness}} from a friend. In addition, {{the bridge of}} the song addresses the need for confessing one's sins to God. DC Talk member Toby McKeehan, co-writer of the song, said that the lyrics simply describe the way relationships work. McKeehan later elaborated in an interview that the song came from his relationship with fellow band members Michael Tait and Kevin Max.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E

25|$|Since the Jules Ferry laws of 1881-2, {{named after}} the then Minister of Public Instruction, all state-funded schools, {{including}} universities, are independent from the (Roman Catholic) Church. Education in these institutions is free. Non-secular institutions are allowed to organize education as well.

25|$|Overall, {{test results}} {{support the view that}} {{congenital}} amusia is hereditary. It is likely to be influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development. However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital amusia shows that it can be less prevalent when the musical environment is enriched. This <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Bavinck, deeply {{concerned}} {{with the problem of}} objectivism and subjectivism in the doctrine of revelation, employs Schleiermacher’s doctrine of revelation in his own way and regards the Bible as the objective standard for his theological work. Bavinck also <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the church, which forms the Christian consciousness and experience. In so doing, he attempts to overcome the latent weakness of Schleiermacher’s doctrine of revelation through his emphasis on the ecclesiological doctrine of revelation.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte Lucas – Charlotte is Elizabeth's friend who, at 27 {{years old}} (and thus past prime {{marriage}} age), fears becoming {{a burden to}} her family and therefore agrees to marry Mr. Collins to gain financial security. Though the novel <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of love and understanding in marriage, Austen never seems to condemn Charlotte's decision to marry for money. She uses Charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society's expectation for women to marry {{even if it is}} not out of love, but convenience. Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and Lady Lucas, friends of Mrs. Bennet.|$|E

25|$|Easterly and Levine further {{observe that}} studies {{of how the}} {{environment}} directly influences land and labor were tarred by racist theories of underdevelopment, {{but that does not}} mean that such theories can be automatically discredited. They argue that Diamond correctly <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of germs and crops in the very long-run of societal technological development. They find that regression results support the findings of Jared Diamond and David Landes that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine's findings most support the view that long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.|$|E

She and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark are escorted to the Capitol by chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, an alcoholic past victor. Haymitch <b>stresses</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of gaining sponsors, as they can provide gifts during the Games. During a televised interview, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially takes as an attempt to attract sponsors, but later learns his admission was genuine.
