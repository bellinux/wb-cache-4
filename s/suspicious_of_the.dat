Burnet was <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direction in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude {{was a factor in}} his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E

5|$|Many educated Sudanese were <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council {{and drifted}} towards the Khatmiyya {{side in the}} 1944 elections, not for {{religious}} reasons but because they were hostile to the government, wanted to retain links with Egypt as a counterpoise to British influence {{and did not want}} a monarchy under Sayyid Abd al-Rahman.|$|E
5|$|<b>Suspicious</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Irish Catholic establishment, {{embodied}} by the Labor Party, Weaver joined the Protestant Federation in 1921 {{and became a}} sympathiser of the right-wing New Guard.

5|$|The Academy's benefactress, Catherine I, who had {{continued}} the progressive policies {{of her late}} husband, died {{on the day of}} Euler's arrival.

5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was deeply <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UN, and was loath {{to do anything}} that would benefit the country's Shia Muslims. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz {{for the establishment of a}} UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Fr. Antonio Mateo, the Vicar of Tayabas, became <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cofradías monthly {{masses and}} fees, thus Fr.

Due to religious persecution {{and the increasing}} number of its members, Pule decided to have the cofradía recognized by the colonial government and the Roman Catholic Church. He first sought recognition and authorization from the Bishop of Camarines but his request was denied. Not discouraged, he then sought the approval of the Real Audiencia but he was also ignored.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 the Treaties of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E
5|$|In July 1952, Kesselring was {{diagnosed}} with a cancerous growth in the throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty cigars per day but he quit smoking in 1925.

Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.|$|E

50|$|Curve25519 {{was first}} {{released}} by Daniel J.

5|$|In early 1926, {{the general}} was again named Premier, and {{approached}} the PNR and its close ally, the Peasants' Party, proposing a merger around his leadership.

5|$|Abdül Kadir was to {{have been}} the Ottoman Navy's first pre-dreadnought battleship. She {{followed}} a series of ironclad warships built in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1876, Sultan Murad V was deposed; the Ottoman Navy had {{played a role in the}} coup, which installed Abdul Hamid II on the throne. The new sultan was as a result <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navy, and attempted to reduce its power by withholding funding and ordering no new capital ships over the course of the following decade. By the late 1880s, however, the ships built by his predecessors were rapidly becoming obsolescent, especially compared to foreign designs like the British s.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Leon {{travels to}} a nearby island {{research}} facility, where he continues the search for Ashley.

5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of}} the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with his father's wishes, Luther enrolled {{in law school}} at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law represented uncertainty. Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> even <b>the</b> greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience.|$|R
