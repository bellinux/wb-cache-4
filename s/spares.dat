5|$|At {{the onset}} of war in Korea, No.77 Squadron was self-supporting, the largest flying unit in the RAAF. It {{comprised}} 299 officers and men, 40 Mustangs, 3 CAC Wirraways, 2 Douglas C-47 Dakotas and 2 Austers. The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea, leading {{to the formation of}} No.391 (Base) Squadron at Iwakuni, {{at the same time as}} No.91 Wing headquarters. RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions. Staffed mainly by former No.77 Squadron members, in the first year of its existence No.391 Squadron had to try to overcome severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment. Further problems arose when No.77 Squadron converted to Gloster Meteors between April and July 1951, as <b>spares</b> for the British-made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang. No longer could No.391 Squadron source parts from the US Fifth Air Force as it had up till this point. Disposal of the Mustangs and their <b>spares</b> also caused headaches; the process took two years, causing storage issues. The base squadron faced another challenge in January 1952, following a controversial change in role for the Meteors, from air-to-air combat to ground attack, which necessitated obtaining supplies of rockets and modification of the aircraft to carry them.|$|E

40|$|Estimates which {{indicate}} {{a large share}} of the world’s undiscovered oil and gas resources {{is to be found in}} the Arctic areas and the increasing demand for energy are important reasons for the growing interest in the High North region. As the offshore industry expands into the High North, system failures associated with these projects is expected to increase significantly. Hence, the quest for effective maintenance and maintenance support services are increased. However, the demanding physical conditions of the Arctic, the remote location, and the uncertainty from various sources are expected to increase the challenges related to the <b>spare</b> part planning, especially the transportation of <b>spare</b> parts. The aim of this thesis is to study, review, and propose a model for risk-based <b>spare</b> part planning, especially for <b>spare</b> part transportation, considering the effect of operational conditions. Furthermore, the concept of both static and dynamic transportation networks is used to calculate the mean <b>spare</b> part transportation time and <b>spare</b> part deliverability. The application of the static model is demonstrated by a case study. In this thesis, the theoretical framework chapter covers a brief survey of <b>spare</b> part planning, risk-based approaches, risk assessment methods, and application of risk analysis to <b>spare</b> parts planning. Then, types and sources of uncertainties, factors affecting <b>spare</b> part planning and <b>spare</b> part forecasting methods are reviewed. Afterward, a static model is developed for <b>spare</b> part transportation by considering the operating conditions of the Arctic region. The model is based on the concept of the transportation block diagram. A case study for the oil & gas (O & G) industry is presented to demonstrate how the proposed model can be applied. Furthermore, a dynamic model for <b>spare</b> part transportation is also developed. In this model, the factors which provide dynamic behavior of a <b>spare</b> part transportation network such as season (months) of the year (i. e. to transport the <b>spare</b> part), and criticality of the <b>spare</b> part are modeled. The results obtained from data analysis showed that operational conditions of the Arctic region leads to approximately 20 % extended delay’s during the winter season, when we transport the <b>spare</b> part from the southwestern Norway to the northern Norway. Hence, any decision about the <b>spare</b> parts planning, especially the transportation of <b>spare</b> parts in the Arctic region must consider the effects of the operational conditions of the region.

40|$|Reconfigurable {{chips are}} {{fabricated}} with redundant elements {{that can be}} used to replace the faulty elements. The fault cover problem consists of finding an assignment of redundant elements to the faulty elements such that all of the faults are repaired. In reconfigurable chips that consist of arrays of elements, redundant elements are configured as <b>spare</b> rows and <b>spare</b> columns. This paper considers the problem in which a chip contains several replicates of a heterogeneous array, one or more sets of <b>spare</b> rows, and one or more sets of <b>spare</b> columns. Each set of <b>spare</b> rows is identical to the set of rows in the array, and each set of <b>spare</b> columns is identical to the set of columns in the array. Specifically, an ith <b>spare</b> row can only be used to replace an ith row of an array, and similarly with <b>spare</b> columns. Repairing the chip reduces to finding a cover for the faults in each of the arrays.
