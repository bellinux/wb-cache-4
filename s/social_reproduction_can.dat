40|$|This paper {{explores the}} literal spaces of {{transnational}} social reproduction for Latinos and Latinas in central North Carolina and the US South. Examining these spaces and circuits of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>can</b> enhance {{our understanding of}} globalization by making globalization processes at once less abstract and less indisputable. Attention to social reproduction is important for understanding and theorizing globalization and, more significantly, for imagining and constructing alternative forms of globalization. Inspired to pursue certain freedoms and immediate goals, transnational migrants live and breath alternative models of globalization in their everyday activities. Responding less to neo-liberal and more to human-centered values, transnational migrants demonstrate that different principles can guide the construction of contemporary globalizations. Ethnographic evidence from Mexican transnational migrants suggests that the intimate and distant social connections that constitute Latinos ’ translocal way of living help to facilitate the very same globalizing labor markets that entice and propel migrants to seek “greener pastures ” in the US South. On a Sunday morning a few weeks ago, some Mexican friends invited me to go along when they were buying carnitas (cooked pork). W...|$|E
40|$|This {{article will}} {{approach}} the optic of 'reproduction' in feminist theory and politics from two sides: (a) {{the discussion of}} social reproduction currently {{at the top of}} the agenda of materialist feminisms, that is as a specific modality of gendered, racialised and often unwaged labour; and (b) the sense in which <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>can</b> be taken as the 'reproduction of the conditions of production', as in Louis Althusser’s analysis. In this second instance, the perpetuation of capitalist society and the individuals in it makes reproduction continuous with social production. These two approaches to the question of reproduction will be used to open a path to a sample of historical and contemporary art practices, readable either in terms of a feminist notion of reproduction as a spectrum of gendered tasks, or in terms of performing the impasses of a kind of social 'non-reproduction' that belongs to the second type, with the social reproduction perspective assuming the function of institutional or, perhaps, ‘infrastructural’ critique.

40|$|We {{start from}} the {{hypothesis}} that Goodwin's (1967) distributive cycle does not represent a process of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> that <b>can</b> be considered as adequate and sustainable in the long-run, due to the degradation of {{a part of the}} workforce it implies during periods of mass unemployment. Against this background, the paper then formulates an unemployment benefit system and a minimum (and maximum) wage rule for the employed where this form of economic reproduction of capitalism is overcome, at least to a certain extent. There is perfect mobility on the labor market (concerning 'hiring' and 'firing'), with fluctuations of the employment rate made socially acceptable by guaranteeing minimum levels of income to all members of the workforce. We can show in this framework that minimum (and maximum) real wages provide increased stability to the economy by reducing the amount of overshooting in income distribution as well as the employment rate.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 In 2011, Governor John Kitzhaber, {{along with}} the Oregon legislature, affirmed a clear and ambitious goal for the State. The 40 - 40 - 20 goal states that by 2025, 40 % of adult Oregonians will have an Associates degree or a {{meaningful}} postsecondary certificate, 40 % will hold a Bachelors degree or advance degree and 20 % percent will hold at least {{a high school diploma}} or its equivalent credential. These ambitious goals include underserved students –low income, first-generation, students of color, and rural students–whom the educational system has not served well in the past and whose college-going and completion rates fall below the average. However, there is little research about the experiences, expectations or perceptions of underserved students in Oregon’s higher education system. This project used qualitative methods to understand the barriers that underserved students face once they begin their postsecondary career. Twenty-five interviews were conducted with Oregon community leaders who work with “college-going” underserved students and another 21 interviews were conducted with underserved students. Consistent with predictions of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> theory, both community leaders and students described barriers related to cultural and social capital. This research proposes that <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> theory <b>can</b> explain how the experiences of underserved students may hinder the effectiveness of policies intended to increase access to and retention in higher education in Oregon. Successful implementation of these policies will need to heavily invest time and funding to educate families and students as they make the transition to higher education in Oregon...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{research}} from the UNRISD inquiry into the social dimensions of green economy, this paper outlines a conceptual and policy approach to bring social concerns more centrally into green economy and sustainable development debates. The paper first examines {{a wide range of}} social problems and other issues associated with green economy, reasserting that any development transformation must be both green and fair-leading to a "green society", not just a green economy. But different transition pathways exist, each with different configurations of state, market and society relations, as well as social and developmental implications. The remainder of the paper addresses the key role of social policy, agency and participation in crafting transition paths that are green and fair. The paper argues that comprehensive or transformative social policy, which goes beyond social protection, human capital formation or green jobs by also focusing on redistribution and <b>social</b> <b>reproduction,</b> <b>can</b> {{play a key role in}} mitigating unfair consequences, influencing behaviour and transforming patterns of inequality. Achieving a shift towards such policies will depend crucially on addressing the politics of governance itself; specifically, the ways different actors-particularly social movements and those most disadvantaged-contest ideas and policies, participate in governance (that is, in project design and implementation, public policy making and "civil regulation"), and organize and mobilize to resist and influence change. Such arenas of policy and action are crucial both from the perspective of distributional and procedural justice, and for driving deeper structural transformations. The paper concludes by highlighting issues of fragmentation associated with knowledge, institutional arrangements and social agency, and suggests the need for "joined-up analysis, policy and action"...|$|E
40|$|The {{central theme}} {{of this study is}} an {{examination}} of the processes of change in Iron Age social organisation and identity on a regional scale using the Severn-Cotswolds area in England as a case study. It aims to provide a coherent narrative of the period in the region based on the wealth of current data now available, providing a basic storyboard against which future studies can react. This study focuses not just on the landscape, in which human actions were worked out, but recognises that neither the elements (the material culture, settlements, landscape) nor the processes (production, exchange, deposition and <b>social</b> <b>reproduction)</b> <b>can</b> be divorced from one another but need to be combined to form a coherent picture of community identities, organisation and relationships. This broad research theme is an attempt to move beyond a recent emphasis on ‘deconstruction’ in Iron Age studies and move towards the creation of basic narratives to explain the burgeoning archaeological record. The study discusses in detail the settlement and material culture of the region, and provides a synthesis of a range of new and unpublished data, identifying the diversity and complexity in this material. Through this a narrative emerges of wider, long-term processes of cultural change. In particular, this study asks how different areas of the region developed {{and the extent to which}} the archaeological evidence suggests different social organisations. Further, it questions what their impact was on the chronologies and processes of landscape and social change. The Severn-Cotswolds is ripe for regional synthesis for a variety of reasons. Principal in these is the relative neglect of the region in Iron Age studies in recent years with no synthetic studies since brief county surveys in the 1980 s. This trend has continued with the Severn-Cotswolds examined as part of other regions, such as Wessex or the Welsh Marches rather than independently. The region is geographically diverse whilst focused around a significant geographical feature - the Severn Estuary. This makes its ideal to assess varying patterns of identity and social organisation and their relation to varying landscapes and/or social, cultural and economic influences. The region is also unusual in having a wealth of evidence for later Iron Age regional production and exchange systems in pottery, briquetage and glass beads to which can now be added quern stones, making it ideal to examine more closely the relationships between production, exchange, settlement patterns and social organisation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{articulate}} {{a notion of}} ‘social dispossession,’ an optic that extends current theorizing on agrarian dispossession {{into the realm of}} <b>social</b> <b>reproduction,</b> by examining the testimonies of microcredit borrowers in rural Bangladesh. In recent years, research on microcredit has highlighted new forms of subject-making employed by microcredit and other NGO entrepreneurship development programs. These developments have received insufficient attention in scholarship on agrarian change, both globally and in specific places. I correct this by arguing that microcredit drives social dispossession through three specific mechanisms: the confiscation of assets necessary to <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> (as well as to production); the construction of debt relations within a community which reshape what <b>reproduction</b> <b>can</b> look like; and the re-configuration of women’s social status and subjectivities in relation to their communities...|$|R
40|$|This article uses Pierre Bourdieu’s {{theory to}} analyze the {{relation}} between the Lebanese state and the reproduction of unequal power relations, in particular through the phenomenon of wasta (an Arabic word referring to the use of connections to obtain scarce goods or services). We attempt to demonstrate how <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> in Lebanon has come to rely on the clandestine exchange of certain symbolic and material resources, exemplified in practice by the ways in which different social agents make use of wasta. We further attempt to show how such exchange, rather than any negation of the state, in fact is connected intimately to effects produced by the state in the organization of these resources. We achieve this by analyzing the particular configuration of resources and reproduction mechanisms produced by the Lebanese state and demonstrating how these objective structures lead to determinate effects in the habitus of agents. These effects are expressed through variance in agents’ (<b>social)</b> <b>reproduction</b> strategies, which <b>can</b> be demonstrated most vividly by comparing the habitus of agents firmly embedded within the Lebanese social space to the ‘destabilized’ (or ‘tormented’) habitus of agents less adjusted to it. In this way, we show how Bourdieu’s analysis can reveal the means by which even supposedly ‘weak’ states such as Lebanon nonetheless may produce strong social effects. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|Please note: {{this article}} is in Greek. Dietary habits and {{symbolism}} during the transitional stage {{of death in the}} Cyclades from the 20 th century to today: For the living, death is a nexus of rituals accompanying the whole procedure from the moment of the onset of death until the period of remembrance by the relatives of the deceased, which lasts for ca two family or community generations, is over. Kollyva (boiled wheat) is the symbolic food par excellence which is consumed during memorial services and, more generally, in rituals of remembrance of the dead {{over a long period of}} time. If one studies how these rituals develop, both the manner in which they are transformed and the socio-economic conditions that influence this transformation cannot fail to strike one. In particular, in the case of the Cyclades and especially of Santorini, the development of tourism has resulted in a change in the economic circumstances of the inhabitants from an agricultural to an urban way of life. This change becomes even more obvious in the daily choices made by the inhabitants. The result of this economic development is the commercialisation of death rituals whereby they cease to be representations of religious values and become representations of commercial values. From the moment when the evaluation of social relations in terms of money becomes a criterion for <b>social</b> <b>reproduction,</b> death <b>can</b> no longer be symbolically represented in the form in which it was in the past.

To apply the gender perspective {{at the level of}} strategic planning, instead of at a detailed level, is stressed. To start, concepts such as equal opportunities and gender perspective are elaborated in relation to the field of planning. Through applying gender theory it is shown how conventional planning may contribute to gender inequality by neglecting and disregarding women’s traditional experiences. By using concepts such as everyday life and <b>social</b> <b>reproduction,</b> strategic planning <b>can</b> improve the possibilities for women and men to live “equal” lives. The book illustrates different ways to theoretically and practically – such as through the use of time geography, gender segregated statistics and public participation – develop the knowledge base for gender aware planning. Planning areas where the gender perspective is of special importance are social infrastructure (location of day care centres, schools etc), location of shopping facilities, transport facilities as well as safety and security.

40|$|The post-apartheid South African {{state has}} formulated, {{introduced}} and implemented nationwide policies and programmes pertaining to urban housing {{in order to}} address and tackle the challenges of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> in and for poor urban black communities. This however has been undermined for a number of reasons, such as state incapacities and the state’s neo-liberal overreliance on the market to remedy past injustices. At the same time households, as critical sites of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> in poor urban black communities and under conditions of extreme vulnerability, engage in a range of productive and non-productive activities often in a desperate bid to construct and maintain a semblance of livelihood sustainability. The thesis seeks to critically understand the relationship between state housing programmes and the diverse livelihood activities of poor urban black households in South Africa {{in the context of an}} ongoing systemic crisis of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> which exists in these urban communities. This is pursued with specific reference to eZamokuhle Township in Amersfoort, Mpumalanga Province. The thesis is framed conceptually in terms of the notion of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction.</b> In doing so, it brings together two sets of literature which are often disconnected. On the one hand, there is South African literature which critically analyses the post-apartheid state’s housing programmes including the many challenges which exist in this regard. On the other hand, there is literature which considers the urban livelihoods of poor black communities in contemporary South Africa and often from within some kind of livelihoods perspective. The thesis is innovative in bringing these two sets of literature together in terms of the overarching notion of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> and providing, therefore, a more holistic and integrated understanding of the multi-dimensional character of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The depth of the crisis of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> in eZamokuhle is explicated and examined in this way but in a manner which articulates the lived experiences and agency of eZamokhule households despite vulnerability constraints and challenges...|$|R

They represent {{a unique opportunity to}} analyze a largely extant archaeological record of human activity, which contrasts with the traditional {{landscape of}} tells characteristic of the Middle East. With this in mind, this thesis aims to investigate such structures and their role within processes of <b>social</b> <b>reproduction</b> in what <b>can</b> be termed 'non-optimal' zones. The timing of their construction, when societies in lowland zones were undergoing a significant augmentation of political and economic complexity,concomitant with the rise of states, is pivotal. Despite assumptions regarding the association between these monuments and nomadic groups, preliminary research within the Homs area suggests that such an association is not necessarily straightforward. As such, the long-term interplay between mobile and sedentary populations within sub-optimal zones is crucial for the consideration of these monuments. Preliminary analysis of data from the Homs area, as well as other areas within the Levant, has also suggested that a sole 4 th/ 3 rd millennia BC attribution for these monuments cannot be supported. Accordingly, my research is also concerned with the re-incorporation of these monuments within changing landscape and settlement structures during later periods. It draws upon concepts such as experiential landscapes, previously under utilized by researchers in the Middle East, to reconsider the notion that such monuments represented a unified phenomenon.
