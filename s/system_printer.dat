40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 04 - 07, 1991 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaWhite Sands Missile Range (WSMR) has {{developed}} an Advanced Transportable Telemetry Acquisition System (TTAS-A) which utilizes a dedicated computer system for antenna control. The Automated Testing System (ATS), {{an integral part of}} this system, {{is the subject of this}} paper. The ATS consists of hardware and software designed to provide fully automated testing of the radio frequency (RF) and servo subsystems for validation purposes. The RF subsystem tests are designed to evaluate, measure, and display RF performance parameters such as receiving system Figure of Merit and RF system sensitivity. The servo subsystem tests are designed to evaluate and display the stability and response characteristics of the servo subsystem. Tests are accessed via a keyboard, and extensive use of menus makes the software easy to learn and use. The test equipment is controlled entirely by the computer, and hard copies of all test results are available on the <b>system</b> <b>printer...</b>|$|E

The CDAS manages several climate-related data sets, such as the First Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) Global Experiment (FGGE) Level 2 -b and Level 3 -a data tapes. CDAS data management support consists of three basic functions: (1) an inventory capability which allows users to search or update a disk-resident inventory describing the contents of each tape in a data set, (2) a capability to depict graphically the spatial coverage of a tape in a data set, and (3) a data set selection capability which allows users to extract portions of a data set using criteria such as time, location, and data source/parameter and output the data to tape, user terminal, or <b>system</b> <b>printer.</b> This report includes figures that illustrate menu displays and output listings for each CDAS function...|$|E

The National Association for Printing Leadership (NAPL) reports that the industry is lagging when compared to the average productivity growth of 4 % from the non-durable manufacturing industries (2004). Many possible reasons for this lag are presented, but the main causes are the inefficiencies of the print production system when analyzed as a whole.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new overconstrained {{mechanism}} is presented {{that can be}} used in many practical applications. It is a 5 link 4 R 1 P spatial mechanism with two pairs of revolute joints with parallel axes. Its kinematic properties are such that it can transfer rotational motion to linear and vice versa when the revolute joint axis and the linear axis are any two lines in space. It can also be used to transfer revolute motion from one input shaft to another revolute joint whose axis is any line in space arbitrarily located with respect to the input shaft. A prototype set-up has been built to verify the mechanism kinematic properties. 1. INTRODUCTION Mechanisms are mechanical devices composed of links connected by joints, forming open or closed mobile chains. Mechanisms are used in almost every machine to transfer motion or force.
