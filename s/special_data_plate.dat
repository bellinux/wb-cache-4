40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel gateway (GW) {{selection}} protocol in hybrid Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). We {{focus on the}} situation that occurs when specialized, sensitive data {{is sent to the}} Internet from MANET nodes. These <b>special</b> <b>data</b> types are especially susceptible to security risks such as information leak and data falsification. Therefore, it is necessary for such <b>special</b> <b>data</b> to be forwarded by a secure/trusted GW which is controlled by a trusted network administrator. However, there should be multiple GWs deployed in a MANET, where the cost ineffectiveness makes it difficult for a network administrator to simultaneously manage every GW. Because of the risk of forwarding <b>special</b> <b>data</b> through an unmaintained GW, we propose a routing protocol which allows a source node to have sensitive data forwarded to the Internet through a trusted GW. To achieve this desirable performance, we improve upon one of the newest routing protocols, Dynamic MANET Ondemand (DYMO), which works in consideration of application data. Through simulations, we evaluate our protocol in comparison with the conventional DYM...|$|R
