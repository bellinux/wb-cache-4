25|$|The dealer {{is chosen}} by various means, either by {{throwing}} dice (the highest total takes the east wind), by placing {{one of each}} wind face down and having each player randomly select one of these tiles or other house rule variations. Each player <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> their respective position (called the wind position) {{at the table in}} positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South, across is West and the left is North. The order essentially is counter-clockwise.|$|E
25|$|After confronting his wife, Gavrik {{locks the}} door and {{strangles}} Elena to death. Sasha is unable to stop it. Meanwhile, Ruth joins Harry outside the bunker, and they both decide to leave the intelligence service and live together. However Sasha, armed with {{a large piece of}} broken glass and blaming Harry for his mother's death, tries to stab him. Ruth intervenes and is stabbed instead. She dies from her injuries before help can arrive, leaving Harry to mourn the loss of his love. In a telephone conversation with Towers sometime later, it is evident that Harry is considering leaving the service. It also becomes clear that Harry has engaged an outside agency to assassinate Mikhail Levrov (Jeffry Wickham) and his co-conspirators. Towers requests he not be informed of the details of these actions. Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) is shown walking into Levrov's house for an appointment with him. Harry is then seen entering the memorial area of Thames House with the names of all the MI5 officers who died in service, some of whom were characters who were killed during the series (Danny Hunter, Fiona Carter, Colin Wells, Zafar Younis, Ben Kaplan, Adam Carter, Jo Portman, Ros Myers, Ruth). He then walks onto the Grid, <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his desk and answers the phone, indicating he intends to continue working in the service.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, at age 22, Schuur {{auditioned for}} drummer/bandleader Ed Shaughnessy. Escorted by her twin brother, she went {{backstage}} {{to seek out}} Shaughnessy after he had finished a concert in Seattle with bandleader Doc Severinsen. Shaughnessy said, [...] "Doc's concert was over and this young blind girl comes in and <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Fender Rhodes keyboard and starts singing the blues. Well, my hair stood on end!" [...] He hired her to be the vocalist in his orchestra, [...] "Energy Force". Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie heard her and, in 1979, invited her to sit in on a set at the Monterey Jazz Festival. According to Dave Gelly in his 2002 book, Stan Getz: Nobody Else But Me, Schuur's performance created [...] "a minor sensation".|$|E

500|$|At a diner in Brooklyn, New York, a {{bald man}} with no eyebrows <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a table and orders a raw roast beef {{sandwich}} with eleven jalapeño peppers {{and a glass of}} room temperature water. When the sandwich arrives, he drowns it in Tabasco sauce and black pepper and wolfs it down in large, quick bites, to the bemusement of the diner staff. During this time he is also watching the construction site across the street through high-tech binoculars and taking notes from right to left in unrecognizable characters. The ground shakes and a gas main explodes at the site, toppling a crane. The bald man—the Observer—calmly pays for his sandwich and wanders to the gaping hole where the construction site was. On a wireless phone, he says [...] "It has arrived." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Peterotica" [...] {{was written}} by Patrick Meighan and {{directed}} by Kurt Dumas. The episode ran into multiple objections from broadcasting standards and the show's producers. For instance, the original title of the episode was [...] "A Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Butt", but broadcasting standards objected. A sequence showing all of the different erotic novels written by Peter was edited for the television version; one entitled Catcher in the Eye {{was removed from the}} television version as broadcasting standards disliked the cover, which implied her eye was a target for semen during ejaculation. The scene of Peter reading his new erotic novel to Lois was never cut from airing, although the producers of Family Guy had some trouble with it, as it is the second semen joke of the episode. When Lois' father, Carter, <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the breakfast table, Lois states: [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean up?" [...] Originally, she was meant to say, [...] "Daddy, did you remember to wipe yourself?", but broadcasting standards objected, so it was modified to [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean yourself?" [...] However, standards still objected, so it was changed to its current version.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Inndia" [...] {{was shot by}} Edward Aninaru, and was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel on 19 September 2012. It was preceded by a lyrics video released on 28 June 2012 on the same platform. The visual begins with shots of a woman smoking and female strippers pole dancing in a club. Inna enterers the building and <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the bar starting {{a conversation with the}} female bartender. Subsequently, the singer is seen pole dancing for a gentleman. Later in the video, she cares for a female stripper named [...] "Inndia" [...] with a scar on her face, who sits in a bathtub next to her. Inna also secretly watches how Inndia is beaten by her boss in another scene. Both manage to escape the respective room after Inna breaks a glass over the man's head. Subsequently, they enter the club where the singer pole dances in front of a huge crowd along with other females. [...] "Inndia" [...] is shortly seen sitting on a couch with two other women, who write the words [...] "rock" [...] and [...] "party" [...] on her skin with eyeliner. Cut scenes show Inna wearing black lingerie on a bed with a female dressed similarly.|$|E
5000|$|Tomáš Halík, a {{close friend}} of Havel, told Czech Radio on 5 October 2013 that [...] "the bench with the two chairs symbolises the {{willingness}} to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a table and talk. That is, in my opinion, another important message left by Václav Havel: Even as people of different opinions, different political beliefs and different religions, it is still immensely important to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a table and talk to one another in search for the truth." ...|$|R

2500|$|Pascal Rémy, {{a veteran}} France-based Michelin inspector, {{and also a}} former Gault Millau employee, wrote a tell-all book {{published}} in 2004 entitled L'Inspecteur se met à table (literally, [...] "The Inspector <b>Sits</b> <b>Down</b> <b>at</b> the Table"; idiomatically, [...] "The Inspector Spills the Beans", or [...] "The Inspector Puts It All on the Table"). Rémy's employment was terminated in December 2003 when he informed Michelin of his plans to publish his book. He brought a court case for unfair dismissal, which was unsuccessful.|$|E

On April 20, 2011, Ashba said in an interview at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards that Guns N' Roses have been [...] "working on new songs every day". In an interview with reporter Nui Te Koha on Triple M Melbourne's The Hot Breakfast, Ashba talked about songs Rose has written, stating: [...] "Axl has a lot of great songs up his sleeve. He probably has three albums worth of stuff recorded. The stuff I've heard... I've been up in his hotel room many nights and he just <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the piano and plays.
