Within each of these lists a unique <b>sequential</b> <b>number</b> was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade. Once the four lists of the Knight's Cross recipients were merged into one listing, the chronological order was abandoned and the list was converted to an alphabetical list of recipients. Foreign recipients were never integrated into this list. The Wehrmacht also refrained from assigning a numbering scheme to the different lists of foreign recipients. Two principles were retained: the foreign Knights Cross recipients were ordered alphabetically and the recipients of the higher grades were ordered chronologically.|$|E
5000|$|District of Columbia - Historically, {{the only}} exit numbers posted in the District {{consisted}} of <b>sequential</b> <b>numbers</b> on I-295. The other freeways within the District of Columbia {{did not have}} exit numbers, but in 2008 the District began posting <b>sequential</b> <b>numbers</b> on I-395. , not all interchanges had received numbers. The close proximity of the interchanges on this short freeway, coupled {{with the lack of}} space for new interchanges, renders the sequential system more practical than the mileage-based.|$|R
50|$|Exit {{numbering}} on non-Interstate highways is less consistent. For example, Texas, {{which normally}} uses mile-based exit <b>numbering,</b> uses <b>sequential</b> <b>numbering</b> on U.S. Route 75 between downtown Dallas and the Oklahoma border.

500|$|Author Clemens Range dates Hans Lehmann's Knight's Cross on 8 June 1945, thus {{after the}} {{effectiveness}} of the Dönitz-decree. Walther-Peer Fellgiebel, author of Die Träger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939-1945, indicates that Lehmann received the Knight's Cross on 11 May 1945, before the Dönitz-decree prohibited the awarding of the Knight's Cross. The <b>sequential</b> <b>number</b> 317 within the Kriegsmarine, 144 within the U-boat service, associated to Lehmann's Knight's Cross is based on author Clemens Range's work Die Ritterkreuzträger der Kriegsmarine and Busch and Röll's book Der U-Boot-Krieg 1939-1945 - Die Ritterkreuzträger der U-Boot-Waffe von September 1939 bis Mai 1945. Historian Veit Scherzer, whose work Die Ritterkreuzträger Die Inhaber des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939 von Heer, Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, Waffen-SS, Volkssturm sowie mit Deutschland verbündeter Streitkräfte nach den Unterlagen des Bundesarchives is based on the primary data from the German Federal Archives, indicates that the 7 May 1945 is the correct date.|$|E

25|$|Many northeastern states label exit numbers sequentially, {{regardless}} of how many miles have passed between exits. States in which Interstate exits are still numbered sequentially are Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont; as such, five of the main Interstate highways that remain completely within these states (87, 88, 89, 91, and 93) have interchanges numbered sequentially along their entire routes. Maine, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, and Florida followed this system {{for a number of}} years, but since converted to mileage-based exit numbers. Georgia renumbered in 2000, while Maine did so in 2004. The Pennsylvania Turnpike uses both mile marker <b>numbers</b> and <b>sequential</b> <b>numbers.</b> Mile marker numbers are used for signage, while <b>sequential</b> <b>numbers</b> are used for numbering interchanges internally. The New Jersey Turnpike, including the portions that are signed as I‑95 and I‑78, also has <b>sequential</b> <b>numbering,</b> but other Interstates within New Jersey use mile markers.|$|R
