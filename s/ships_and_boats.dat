5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Arthur's arrival, Nova Scotia Power prepared and collected resources {{in case of}} power outages and other impacts in the region. Numerous weekend events were called off throughout the Canadian Maritimes, including the Stan Rogers Folk Festival. Multiple boat-owners and fisherman took extra precautions by battening down hatches and tying extra lines to wharves to keep <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> from coming loose in the storm. Environment Canada officials issued high wind warnings in addition to earlier tropical storm warnings for the Maritimes and considered imposing rainfall warnings for western portions of Prince Edward Island as well. Province-managed parks in Nova Scotia, including beaches and camping grounds, were shut down prior to Arthur's arrival, and several airlines waived transfer fees. Officials in Moncton stated that city personnel {{would be prepared to}} respond to potential issues caused by Arthur, such as flooding or fallen trees, while the Canadian Red Cross readied volunteers in case of the need for emergency assistance. The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station took precautionary measures against the storm, with Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission employees deployed to the site.|$|E

25|$|During the war, new {{techniques}} like huff-duff began to replace radiogoniometers {{in the intelligence}} gathering role, reducing {{the time needed to}} take an accurate fix from minutes to seconds. The ability to inexpensively process radio signals using microcontrollers allowed pseudo-doppler direction finders to take over most of the radiogoniometer's remaining roles from the 1980s. In spite of seeing little use today, the original antennae of BTDF systems can still be seen on many <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|E

25|$|Early on September 14, {{a fighter}} sweep was made against Aparri, Luzon, {{following}} which she steamed {{to the east}} of Luzon to neutralize installations to the east prior to invasion landings on Leyte. On the 15th, Franklin was attacked by three enemy planes, one of which scored with a bomb that hit the after outboard corner of the deck edge elevator, killing three men and wounding 22. The carrier's aircraft hit Manila Bay on 19 October when her planes sank and damaged <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats,</b> destroyed a floating drydock, and claimed 11 Japanese aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Echo {{sounding}} is {{a process}} {{used to determine the}} depth of water beneath <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats.</b> A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.|$|E
25|$|The nearest {{airports}} to {{the city}} are the Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport (SJC) and Reid-Hillview Airport in East San Jose, the latter which is for small private airplanes. Although Milpitas is bordered by the San Francisco Bay in the extreme northwest, that area is not accessible to <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats.</b> But, someday if the un-incorporated city of Alviso becomes part of Milpitas, one {{would be able to}} access Alviso marina and it can be made as a boat launching spot. Being landlocked, the city depends on the Port of Oakland for oceangoing freight and on the Union Pacific Railroad for cargo transport.|$|E

The parade, then the biggest in the city's history, was more than seven miles long and consisted of hundreds of <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> of all types, including both naval and private vessels. McClellan was one of three vessels in the parade representing the Army Transport Service (A.T.S.). More than a million people watched from the shore, after which a land parade of five to six hours duration—received by Dewey himself—took place through the streets of New York.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{defense was}} {{provided}} by several <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> that were grouped into three separate organizations, with no common command. The largest of these (by firepower) was a contingent of the Confederate States Navy: three ironclads, CSS Manassas, Louisiana, and Mississippi; two more traditional warships, converted from merchantmen, CSS McRae and Jackson, and several unarmed support craft. The state of Louisiana furnished two ships of the Louisiana Provisional Navy, General Quitman and Governor Moore. Last were six cottonclad rams of the River Defense Fleet, nominally {{a part of the}} Confederate States Army but commanded by civilian captains and with mostly civilian crews: Warrior, Stonewall Jackson, Defiance, Resolute, General Lovell, and General Breckinridge (also known as R. J. Breckinridge). Also present were several tugs and unarmored harbor craft, of which two, Belle Algerine and Mosher, must be mentioned for the parts they played in the battle.|$|E
25|$|Once on His {{visit to}} the Panchavati Hills near Shirali, the weather became very cyclonic. He noticed 2 {{fishermen}} trying to battle the cyclonic conditions in the Arabian Sea but they failed after their boat capsized and they drowned. This incident deeply hurt Swamiji as He was helpless and could not help the fishermen. Thus came the idea of starting a wireless station at Pachavati {{that could be used}} for communication in times of emergency. A Wireless transmitter-receiver station was established with the help of people like Badakere Dutt, Kallianpur Ramanand etc. An Observatory post was also established which was manned all throughout the day and night, to guide <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> through the jagged rocks that adorn the coastline of Shirali, especially at night. Swamiji also studied and obtained a first grade amateur radio license within a period of 3 months of applying for it, a task that is difficult by normal standards. He was probably the first sanyasi to obtain such a license. He was also an active user of the amateur radio.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Navy has {{periodically}} {{monitored the}} environmental {{conditions of the}} site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. nuclear-powered <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats.</b> The reports provide specifics on the environmental sampling of sediment, water, and marine life that is done to ascertain whether the submarine has significantly affected the deep-ocean environment. The reports also explain the methodology for conducting this deep sea monitoring from both surface vessels and submersibles. The monitoring data confirm {{that there has been}} no significant effect on the environment. The nuclear fuel aboard the submarine remains intact and no uranium in excess of levels expected from the fallout from past atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons has been detected by the Navy's inspections. In addition, Scorpion carried two nuclear-tipped Mark 45 anti-submarine torpedoes (ASTOR) when she was lost. The warheads of these torpedoes are part of the environmental concern. The most likely scenario is that the plutonium and uranium cores of these weapons corroded to a heavy, insoluble material soon after the sinking, and they remain at or close to their original location inside the torpedo room of the boat. If the corroded materials were released outside the submarine, their density and insolubility would cause them to settle into the sediment.|$|E

500|$|The United States Weather Bureau issued {{tropical}} cyclone watches and warnings for Venezuela, Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba. In Jamaica, meteorologists forecast that the storm would bypass {{the island to}} the south without causing any effects. As Anna continued westward, it was predicted to make landfall in either northern Nicaragua or southeastern Honduras. Residents in those countries were advised to take precautions ahead of the storm. Central Americans residing along Gulf of Honduras were also warned about [...] tides and strong winds. As the storm neared Honduras, small boats and other water craft were advised to remain in port. Additionally, a hurricane watch was posted for the Swan Islands. In Belize, {{the threat of the}} storm forced 100 residents to evacuate their homes, while numerous businesses were closed down. At Belize Harbor, many <b>ships</b> <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> were moved upstream inland. The hurricane was also forecast to bring heavy rainfall to the mountainous areas of Belize, causing a concern for flash flooding. Additionally, Belize's Church Welfare Service began to ship clothing and other materials in anticipation of the hurricane.|$|E
