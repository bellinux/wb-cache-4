5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> {{is often}} used to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the <b>skin</b> <b>test,</b> but may be less sensitive than the <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> when used alone.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the most}} widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all {{children}} being vaccinated. The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years. As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk. Part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> falsely positive, reducing the test's use in screening. A number of new vaccines are currently in development.|$|E

5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background: <b>Skin</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{mainstay}} in allergology, and its importance is increasing in several fields. The ability {{to choose the}} most suitable technique according to the clinical setting is an advantage for the medical team. Objectives: To describe in detail an alternative technique of the coetaneous allergy <b>test</b> (<b>skin</b> scrape <b>test)</b> conceived as {{a variation of the}} former skin scratch test; to evaluate its value as a tool for diagnosis of immune sensitization; and to com-pare its accuracy with the <b>skin</b> prick <b>test.</b> Methods: The <b>skin</b> scrape <b>test</b> and <b>skin</b> prick <b>test</b> were performed {{side by side with the}} same allergen extracts in 162 hu-man subjects classified in two groups according to the known presence or absence of serum specific-IgE to these aller-gens. Results: The sensitivity of the <b>skin</b> scrape <b>test</b> to detect immediate reactions was 85. 0 %. The sensitivity of the <b>skin</b> prick <b>test</b> was 86. 5 %. The sensitivity of both techniques analyzed together as a unique procedure was 94. 2 %. The specificity of the <b>skin</b> scrape <b>test</b> was 90. 1 %. The specificity of the <b>skin</b> prick <b>test</b> was 72. 9 %. The specificity of both tests analyzed to-gether as a unique procedure was 70. 5 %. Conclusions: The <b>skin</b> scrape <b>test</b> is an alternative and complementary technique for allergic <b>skin</b> <b>testing,</b> and it is able to detect IgE-specific immune sensitization without the disadvantages of the <b>skin</b> scratch <b>test.</b> The <b>skin</b> scrape <b>test</b> has simi...|$|R

50|$|People {{who have}} severe, {{generalized}} skin disease or an acute skin infection should not undergo <b>skin</b> <b>testing,</b> as one needs uninvolved <b>skin</b> for <b>testing.</b> Also, <b>skin</b> <b>testing</b> {{should be avoided}} for people at a heightened risk of anaphylactic shock, including people who {{are known to be}} highly sensitive to even the smallest amount of allergen.|$|R

40|$|The {{reliability}} of <b>skin</b> <b>testing</b> {{in the diagnosis}} of penicillin allergy was studied in 86 adults and 167 children {{with a history of}} possible hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin. <b>Skin</b> <b>testing</b> was done with the major antigenic determinant of benzylpenicillin and minor determinants of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, methicillin and cephalothin. The overall frequency of positive skin reactions was 11. 5 %. Among the patients with positive skin reactions about half had a history of immediate or accelerated reactions to penicillins, but 2 of 11 adults and 50 % of the children in this group had a history of maculopapular rash of delayed onset. There was a low frequency of positive skin reactions when there was a long interval between the times of clinical reaction and <b>skin</b> <b>testing.</b> Of 169 patients reacting negatively to <b>skin</b> <b>testing</b> who received a specific drug challenge only 2 manifested mild urticaria; this indicates the {{reliability of}} the <b>skin</b> <b>tests</b> in predicting penicillin allergy. The major and minor determinants of benzylpenicillin were the most useful reagents. One fifth of the patients with penicillin hypersensitivity would have been missed if the major determinant of benzylpenicillin alone had been used for <b>skin</b> <b>testing.</b> The additional use of the minor determinants of other penicillin derivatives, however, did not increase substantially the clinical reliability of the <b>skin</b> <b>testing</b> procedure...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: Antibiotic <b>skin</b> <b>testing</b> is {{a useful}} {{procedure}} for identifying patients with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to antibiotics. The procedures, however, have not been standardized, and the testing is performed with diverse protocols in Korean hospitals wards. Thus, we examined the current practice of antibiotic <b>skin</b> <b>testing</b> in Korea. Methods: We sent questionnaires to 12 allergists working in secondary or tertiary referral hospitals and collected them by e-mail or fax. The questionnaire included items such as the types and concentrations of the tested antibiotics, the methods of antibiotic <b>skin</b> <b>testing,</b> and {{the interpretation of the}} results. Results: All hospitals responded to the questionnaire. The antibiotic <b>skin</b> <b>testing</b> protocols were variable, inconsistent, and differed with regard to the type and concentrations of antibiotics, the volume injected, and the interpretation of the results.

Stage 0 would represent an asymptomatic form of ABPA, with controlled asthma but still fulfilling the fundamental diagnostic requirements of a positive <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> with elevated total IgE (>1000 IU/mL). Stage 6 is an advanced ABPA, with the presence of type II respiratory failure or pulmonary heart disease, with radiological evidence of severe fibrosis consistent with ABPA on a high-resolution CT scan.

25|$|Response to {{infection}} by Leishmania donovani varies a great deal, {{not only by}} the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause visceral leishmaniasis show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (<b>skin</b> <b>test</b> positive) without ever having visceral leishmaniasis have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity. Because visceral leishmaniasis patients lack these responses to leishmania and other antigens, they usually die of secondary infections if left untreated. In addition, increased interleukin-10 secretion is characteristic of the disease. Addition of interleukin-12, anti-interleukin-10, or anti-interleukin-4 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute patients sometimes increases interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation. Acute patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells include CD8+ T regulatory cells that decrease interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation responses to leishmania and other antigens and increase interleukin-10 secretion when added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested after successful treatment. Thus, the CD8+ T regulatory cells reproduce the immune response characteristic of visceral leishmaniasis. CD8+ T regulatory cells are also associated with post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis. Addition of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma does not prevent CD8+ T regulatory activity. The dominance of type 1 CD4+ T cells in <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> positive adults maybe explained by their secretion of factors that inhibit and kill CD8+ T regulatory cells. Successfully treated patients rarely develop visceral leishmaniasis a second time. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells show a mixed T1/T2 CD4+ and CD8+ T suppressor response but do have the ability to kill intracellular leishmania.|$|E
2500|$|The BCG vaccine {{can make}} cattle {{sensitive}} to the tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> after vaccination.

In parallel with developing the vaccine, Defra are developing a test to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals (so-called [...] "DIVA" [...] test). This test is based on gamma interferon blood test technology. [...] The intention is that when necessary, it can be used alongside the tuberculin <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> to confirm whether a positive <b>skin</b> <b>test</b> is caused by infection or vaccination. This is critical because without this differentiation, the UK could not be declared officially free of bTB, which is required by a 1964 European Economic Community directive for international trade.
