40|$|The {{draining}} of {{the thin}} water film that is formed between a two dimensional, infinite, initially flat oil-water interface and a smooth, symmetric probe, as the interface is advected by a steady and uniform flow {{parallel to the}} probe axis, is modelled using classical fluid dynamics. The governing equations are nondimensionalised using values appropriate to the oil extraction industry. The bulk flow is driven by inertia and, in some extremes, surface tension while the viscous effects are initially confined to thin boundary layers on the probe and the interface. The flow in the thin water film is dominated by surface tension, and passes {{through a series of}} asymptotic regimes in which inertial forces are gradually overtaken by viscous forces. For each of these regimes, and for those concerning the earlier stages of approach, possible solution strategies are discussed and relevant literature reviewed. Consideration is given to the drainage mechanism around a probe which protrudes a fixed specified distance into the oil. A lubrication analysis of the thin water film may be matched into a capillary-static solution for the outer geometry using a <b>slender</b> <b>transition</b> region if, and only if, the pressure gradient in the film is negative as it meets the static meniscus. The remarkable result is that, in practice, there is a race between rupture in the transition region and rupture at the tip. The analysis is applicable to the case of a very slow far field flow and offers significant insight into the non-static case. Finally, a similar approach is applied to study the motion of the thin water film in the fully inviscid approximation, with surface tension and a density contrast between the fluids...|$|E
40|$|At {{supersonic}} speeds {{the wake}} of a blunt body may be divided into an inner viscous wake stemming from the body boundary layers and an outer “inviscid” wake produced by the bow shock. In such wakes, as in {{the wake of}} a cylinder, at low Reynolds numbers the onset of transition occurs thousands of diameters downstream of the body in the outer, shock-induced wake. As the Reynolds number is increased, transition occurs in the inner wake. For the same Mach number and at high Reynolds numbers transition on {{the wake of a}} wedge occurs further downstream than in the case of a cylinder, but the <b>slender</b> body <b>transition</b> curve crosses the blunt body transition curve. The question arises, where does <b>transition</b> occur in <b>slender</b> body wakes as the Reynolds number is decreased further? What effect does the much weaker outer shock-induced wake have on transition and, is the outer wake unstable enough to become turbulent...|$|R
40|$|At {{the point}} of {{pinch-off}} of an underwater air bubble, the speed of water rushing in diverges. Previous studies that assumed radial flow throughout showed that the local axial shape is two smoothly connected, <b>slender</b> cones that <b>transition</b> very slowly (logarithmically) to a cylindrical segment. Our simulations show that even with initially radial flow, a transient vertical flow develops with comparable speeds. Bernoulli pressure draws water into the singularity region while incompressibility forces {{it away from the}} neck minimum, generating significant vertical flows that rapidly slenderize and symmetrize the collapse region. This transition is due to a different mechanism, occurring much faster than previously expected. Vertical flows dictate the neck shape evolution. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|During the {{bloodstream}} {{stage of the}} Trypanosoma brucei lifecycle, the parasite exists in two different states: the proliferative slender form and the non-proliferative, transmissible, stumpy form. The <b>transition</b> from the <b>slender</b> to stumpy form is stimulated by a density-dependent mechanism and is important in infection dynamics, ordered antigenic variation and disease transmissibility. The <b>slender</b> to stumpy <b>transition</b> and the contribution of stumpy formation to within-host dynamics {{have been difficult to}} analyse, however, because cell-type specific markers have been restricted to imprecise morphological criteria. PAD 1 is a recently identified stumpy-specific protein which acts as a molecular marker for stumpy formation and a functional marker for transmission. Here, the control of stumpy-specific gene expression via the 3 ’UTR has been analysed, identifying that there are repressive elements in the 3 ’UTR preventing inappropriate expression during the slender life stage. Further, both pleomorphic and monomorphic transgenic reporter cell lines utilising the PAD 1 3 ’UTR have been created that report on stumpy formation in vitro and these have been used for the analysis of stumpyinducing chemical compounds. Finally, a sensitive and accurate qRT-PCR assay has been developed and optimised that faithfully reports both parasitaemia and stumpy formation throughout host infection. Using a chronic infection rodent model, stumpy levels have been monitored on the basis of conventional morphological and cell cycle assays, as well as by qRT-PCR for PAD 1 expression. The results define the temporal order of events that result in the generation of stumpy forms early in a parasite infection and thereafter describe the dynamics of slender and stumpy forms in chronic infections extending over several weeks. This quantitative data has allowed the mathematical modelling of transmission competence in trypanosome infections, suggesting dominance of transmission stages throughout infection.

40|$|In the {{mammalian}} bloodstream, the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei undergoes differentiation from proliferative slender {{forms to}} arrested, transmissible, stumpy forms. This transition {{is associated with}} extensive cytological and metabolic changes that promote survival in the tsetse midgut, and also influences infection dynamics within the mammalian host. A number of genes involved in this transformation were recently identified using an RNAi library screen for resistance to pCPTcAMP, a membrane-permeable cyclic AMP analogue that induces differentiation. These molecules, referred to here as posST (positive mediators of STumpy formation), were thereafter validated to regulate the <b>slender</b> to stumpy <b>transition,</b> with many of them apparently comprising part of a signal transduction and effector pathway. However, it is unknown how these proteins act in relation to one another or are ordered within the pathway. To this end, null mutants were created for several posST components in differentiation-competent pleomorphic trypanosomes and, in this genetic background, {{other members of the}} predicted pathway expressed to test their ability to restore stumpy formation. Analysis of distinct combinations has been used to build a preliminary pathway structure model for the signalling events underlying trypanosome quorum sensing. In addition, phosphoproteomic analysis of two null mutants has revealed downstream signalling effects of two posST kinases, MEKK 1 and YAK. A similar extragenic suppression approach was also applied to explore the interaction between the identified drivers of stumpy formation and the target of rapamycin kinase, TOR 4, which has previously been shown to act as a negative regulator of stumpy formation in monomorphs. Dual ablation of TOR 4 and posST components revealed insight into the intersection of stumpy-promoting and stumpy-inhibiting pathways. Finally, a chemical-genetic approach was used to investigate the posST pathway using two differentiation-inducing compounds: the previously studied E 667, and GKI 7, newly identified from a kinase inhibitor set. RNAi lines for different posST components were tested for their ability to undergo development in the presence of these compounds. An RNAi library screen using GKI 7 identified putative new mediators of stumpy formation...|$|R
