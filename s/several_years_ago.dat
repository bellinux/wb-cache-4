5|$|Poland {{signed a}} treaty with Czechoslovakia in Warsaw on 13 June 1958 {{confirming}} the border as it existed on 1 January 1938. After the Communist takeover of power, the industrial boom continued and many immigrants {{arrived in the}} area (mostly {{from other parts of}} Czechoslovakia, mainly from Slovakia). The arrival of Slovaks significantly changed the ethnic structure of the area, as almost all the Slovak immigrants assimilated into the Czech majority in the course of time. The number of self-declared Slovaks is rapidly declining. The last Slovak elementary school was closed in Karvin√° <b>several</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Zaolzie {{has been part of the}} independent Czech Republic. However a significant Polish minority still remains there.|$|E
5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> the {{government}} built sluice gates for the silt fertilization method, though many people {{disagreed with the}} plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not as thick as what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally {{the government}} got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which {{he says that he}} once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the sluice gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the sluice gates, it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period there were government fields and sluice gates {{on both sides of the}} river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.|$|E
