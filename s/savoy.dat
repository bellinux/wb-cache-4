5|$|Boniface and his {{elder brother}} Amadeus IV, Count of <b>Savoy,</b> were sons of Thomas I, Count of <b>Savoy,</b> and Margaret of Geneva. He is thus {{not to be}} {{confused}} with his nephew, and fellow member of the House of <b>Savoy,</b> Count Boniface of <b>Savoy,</b> the son of Amadeus IV. The elder Boniface was born about 1207 in <b>Savoy.</b> He was the eleventh child of his parents. Some sources state that at a young age he joined the Carthusian Order. However, there is no evidence of this, and it would have been very unusual for a nobleman to enter that order with its very strict discipline. He also had a brother Peter of <b>Savoy</b> who was named Earl of Richmond in 1240 and yet another brother William of <b>Savoy,</b> who was Bishop of Valence and a candidate to be Bishop of Winchester in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Conwy has close to links to {{that found in}} the kingdom of <b>Savoy</b> in the same period. These include window styles, the type of crenellation used on the towers and positioning of putlog holes, and are usually ascribed to the influence of the <b>Savoy</b> architect Master James. The links between Conwy and <b>Savoy</b> are not straightforward, however, as in some cases the relevant <b>Savoy</b> structures were built after James had left the region. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by <b>Savoy</b> craftsmen and engineers on the Conwy project.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{left the}} theatre, opera company, hotels {{and his other}} {{business}} interests to Helen. Her London and touring companies continued to present the <b>Savoy</b> Operas in Britain and overseas. In 1901 she leased the <b>Savoy</b> Theatre to William Greet, overseeing his management of a revival of Iolanthe and several new comic operas. Rupert became chairman of the <b>Savoy</b> Hotel by 1903, which Helen continued to own. In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the <b>Savoy</b> Theatre. The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909, however, the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 18th century during the Napoleonic wars France tried to conquer Cagliari {{because of its}} {{strategic}} role in the Mediterranean Sea. A French army landed on Poetto Beach and advanced towards Cagliari, but was defeated by Sardinians who defended themselves against the revolutionary army. People from Cagliari hoped to receive some concession from the <b>Savoys</b> {{in return for their}} defense of the town. For example, aristocrats from Cagliari asked for a Sardinian representative in the parliament of the kingdom. When the <b>Savoys</b> refused any concession to the Sardinians, inhabitants of Cagliari rose up against the <b>Savoys</b> and expelled all representatives of the kingdom and people from Piedmont. This insurgence is celebrated in Cagliari during the [...] "Die de sa Sardigna" [...] (Sardinian Day) on the last weekend of April. However, the <b>Savoys</b> regained control of the town after a brief period of autonomous rule.|$|R

In the 14th century the <b>Savoy</b> {{was the most}} magnificent nobleman's mansion in England. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, rebels, led by Wat Tyler, inflamed by opposition to the poll tax promoted by John of Gaunt, systematically demolished the <b>Savoy</b> and everything in it. In 1512 it was rebuilt as the <b>Savoy</b> Hospital for the poor. It gradually fell into dereliction and was divided into multiple tenancies. It was demolished in 1816–20 to build the approach road to Waterloo Bridge. eventually being demolished in the 19th century. The <b>Savoy</b> Hotel now occupies this site.|$|E

During preproduction, however, Stiller had a falling out with <b>Savoy</b> over budget disputes—among them was how the studio's reported $4 million offer to Nicolas Cage would affect the film’s budget. Unable to secure financing from another studio, Stiller left the production.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the carpet}} quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no {{more for the}} <b>Savoy.</b> When The Gondoliers closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the <b>Savoy</b> Theatre. He turned to old friends George Dance, Frank Desprez and Edward Solomon for his next piece, The Nautch Girl, which ran for a {{satisfying}} 200 performances in 1891–92. Carte then revived Solomon and Sydney Grundy's The Vicar of Bray, which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's Haddon Hall, which held the stage until April 1893. While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the <b>Savoy,</b> his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{had been}} {{planning}} {{to build a new}} theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the <b>Savoy</b> Theatre in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the <b>Savoy</b> Palace, which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by Peter, Count of <b>Savoy.</b> It later passed to John of Gaunt but was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The <b>Savoy</b> Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).|$|E

5|$|Richard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, and his widow, Helen, {{continued}} {{to direct the}} activities of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the <b>Savoy</b> and on tour. Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he {{continued to}} direct revivals of the <b>Savoy</b> Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. Between 1906 and 1909, he assisted Mrs. Carte in staging two repertory seasons at the <b>Savoy</b> Theatre. These were very popular and revived interest in the works. Gilbert was knighted during the first repertory season. After Sullivan's death, Gilbert wrote only one more comic opera, Fallen Fairies (1909; music by Edward German), which was not a success.|$|E

5|$|The Edwardian {{sites have}} strong {{architectural}} links to castles and town walls {{built in the}} kingdom of <b>Savoy</b> in North Italy during the same period. The resemblance between the two sets of buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of putlog holes, tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in <b>Savoy</b> these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La Bâtiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered {{to be the result of}} the influence of the <b>Savoy</b> architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other Savoyard architects with him to North Wales.|$|E

Rather than serve a menu similar to the French driven Pétrus, Wareing chose to continue to serve the British cuisine that the Grill Room was known for, including his take on previous menu items such as steak and kidney pudding and potted shrimps.
