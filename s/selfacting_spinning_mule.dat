The <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> has a fixed frame with a creel of bobbins to hold the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage with the spindles. On the outward motion, the rovings are paid out through attenuating rollers and twisted. On the return, the roving is clamped and the spindles reversed to take up the newly spun thread.|$|R

The <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> has a fixed frame with a creel of cylindrical bobbins to hold the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage with the spindles.

50|$|He {{moved to}} Manchester, and was {{employed}} at Satterfield's Drapery in St Ann's Square (a plaque currently marks the site). With money borrowed {{from his brother}} {{he set up a}} workshop making <b>spinning</b> <b>mules</b> but exchanged the business for 6 <b>spinning</b> <b>mules,</b> which he operated in a rented space. In 1792 he was made manager of the Piccadilly Mill at Bank Top by the mill-owner Peter Drinkwater at the age of 21, but after two years he voluntarily gave up a contracted promise of partnership in the company and left to go into partnership instead with other entrepreneurs to establish and manage the Chorlton Twist Mills in Chorlton-on-Medlock.|$|R
50|$|In 1856 Joseph Porritt {{established}} Sunnybank Mill, {{an enormous}} mill which once housed the world's largest <b>spinning</b> <b>mules.</b> The other main Helmshore mill dynasty were the Whittakers, one of whose mills makes {{up part of}} the Textile Museum.|$|R

2500|$|In 1779, Samuel Crompton {{combined}} {{elements of}} the spinning jenny and water frame to create the <b>spinning</b> <b>mule.</b> This produced a stronger thread, and was suitable for mechanisation on a grand scale. [...] A later development, from 1828/29, was Ring spinning.|$|R
50|$|A spindle is {{also part}} of {{traditional}} spinning wheels where it is horizontal, such as the Indian charkha and the great or walking wheel. In industrial yarn production, spindles are used as well; see <b>spinning</b> jenny, <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> and ring <b>spinning.</b>|$|R

50|$|Lieven Bauwens (14 June 1769, in Ghent - 17 March 1822, in Paris) was a Belgian {{entrepreneur}} {{and industrial}} spy who {{was sent to}} Great Britain {{at a young age}} and brought a <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> and skilled workers to the European continent.|$|R
5000|$|Samuel Crompton (3 December 1753 [...] - [...] 26 June 1827) was an English {{inventor}} and {{pioneer of}} the spinning industry. Building {{on the work}} of James Hargreaves and Richard Arkwright he invented the <b>spinning</b> <b>mule,</b> a machine that revolutionised the industry worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first phase}} of mills in Manchester such as Garratt Mill (1760), Holt's Mills, Meredith's Factory (1760), Gaythorn Mill (1788), Wood Mill (1788) and Knott Mill (1792) were water-powered, taking their power from the River Medlock. Salvin's ran a room and power mill (1780) on the Shooters Brook in Ancoats, and here the {{partnership}} of Sandford, McConnel and Kennedy was formed. Salvin's factory failed to get enough power from Shooters Brook, so he improved the head of water with a Savery type steam-powered pump. In 1793 John Kennedy directly connected a <b>spinning</b> <b>mule</b> to a steam engine. On 2 March 1795 the partnership was terminated, McConnel and Kennedy moved to other premises in Derby Street. Kennedy manufactured and sold <b>spinning</b> <b>mules</b> until 1801.|$|R
2500|$|Some early {{spinning}} and weaving machinery, {{such as a}} 40 spindle jenny for about six pounds in 1792, [...] was affordable for cottagers. [...] Later machinery such as <b>spinning</b> frames, <b>spinning</b> <b>mules</b> and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.|$|R
5000|$|Cotton mills {{were driven}} by water. The power {{was used to}} card the raw cotton, and then to drive the <b>spinning</b> <b>mules</b> and ring frames. Steam engines were {{initially}} used to increase the water flow to the wheel, then as the industrial revolution progressed, to directly drive the shafts.|$|R
50|$|From the 1950s <b>mule</b> <b>spinning</b> was {{gradually}} replaced in the British cotton industry with ring spinning as improvements in technology {{allowed it to}} process finer grades of cotton. The size of the British textile industry also declined dramatically during this period due {{to a decline in}} demand and competition from foreign industry. This process was accelerated dramatically by the Cotton Industry Act 1959 which encouraged Lancashire cotton producers to rationalise by replacing or retiring older machines, primarily <b>spinning</b> <b>mules.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a <b>spinning</b> <b>mule,</b> the roving {{is pulled}} off bobbins and {{sequentially}} fed through rollers operating at several different speeds, thinning the roving at a consistent rate. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cop as the carriage returns. <b>Mule</b> <b>spinning</b> produces a finer thread than ring spinning. <b>Spinning</b> by the <b>mule</b> machine is an intermittent process as the frame advances and returns. It is the descendant of a device invented in 1779 by Samuel Crompton, and produces a softer, less twisted thread that is favored for fines and for weft.|$|R
25|$|In 1799, he {{was joined}} by his brother John Slater from England. John was a wheelwright who had spent time {{studying}} the latest English developments and might well have gained experience of the <b>spinning</b> <b>mule.</b> Samuel put John Slater {{in charge of a}} large mill which he called the White Mill.|$|R
5000|$|Factories arose {{with the}} {{introduction}} of machinery during the Industrial Revolution when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industryor workshops. Early factories that contained small amounts of machinery, such as one or two <b>spinning</b> <b>mules,</b> and fewer than a dozen workers have been called [...] "glorified workshops".|$|R

The mule was built by Platt Brothers, of Oldham in 1927 for Elk, the last spinning mill built.|$|R
50|$|A 36 ft {{diameter}} {{overshot wheel}} powered <b>spinning</b> <b>mules</b> and jennies.The yarn was then woven into cloth on hand looms.A smaller 7 ft wheel powered a fulling mill, which washed the cloth and kneeded it with wooden hammers to thicken and strengthen it.The water wheels were dismantled around 1900 {{when the first}} hydroelectric turbine was installed.|$|R
