Tighter sustainability criteria {{for the production of}} vehicle biofuels and an increasing interest in combined heat and power (CHP) production from biomass have led to a demand for high-yielding energy crops with good conversion efficiencies. Industrial hemp was studied as an energy crop for production of biogas and <b>solid</b> <b>biofuel.</b> Based on field trials, the development of biomass and energy yield, the specific methane yield and elemental composition of the biomass were studied over the growing and senescence period of the crop, i. e. from autumn to the following spring. The energy yield of hemp for both <b>solid</b> <b>biofuel</b> and biogas production proved similar or superior to that of most energy crops common in northern Europe. The high energy yield of biogas from hemp is based on a high biomass yield per hectare and good specific methane yield with large potential for increases by pretreatment of the biomass. The methane energy yield per hectare is highest in autumn when hemp biomass yield is highest. The energy yield per hectare of hemp for use as a <b>solid</b> <b>biofuel</b> is highest in autumn when the biomass yield is highest. However, important combustion-related fuel properties, such as moisture, alkali, chlorine and ash content and ash melting temperature, are significantly improved when industrial hemp is harvested in spring instead of in autumn. Major fuel properties of hemp are not significantly influenced by annual cultivation conditions, latitude or choice of cultivar. Net energy yields per hectare and energy output-to-input ratios of hemp are above-average in most applications, and are highest for use of hemp as <b>solid</b> <b>biofuel.</b> Use of hemp as a biogas substrate suffers from higher energy inputs and lower conversion efficiencies, but produces a high-quality vehicle fuel. Advantages over other energy crops are also found outside the energy balance, e. g. low pesticide requirements, good weed competition and suitability as break crop in cereal-oriented crop rotations.

Analyses performed on softwood pellets and straw pellets concluded that wet disintegration in water at ambient temperature is insufficient for a determination of the internal particle size distribution of wood- and straw pellets. When the wet disintegration was performed with water heated to the boiling point and coupled with mechanical disintegration in terms of stirring a more complete disintegration of the pellets was obtained. Based on the results obtained in the initial study a round robin was set up including six European laboratories where the selected method was tested. In the round robin test the method combining heated water and stirring of the slurry was tested on <b>solid</b> <b>biofuel</b> pellets produced of comminute straw, deciduous wood and coniferous wood respectively.

Overall the wet disintegration combined with mechanical impact was found to be the most suitable method for disintegration of <b>solid</b> <b>biofuel</b> pellets.

Modern bioenergy technologies aim for high efficiency and low pollution levels, which increases the need for methods for the on-line characterization of biofuels. Dielectric methods {{have been identified as}} useful for the sensing of <b>solid</b> <b>biofuels</b> because they allow for rapid, nonhazardous, nondestructive, and bulk determination of material properties. The dielectric properties describe the interaction between the material and the electromagnetic waves. Dielectric properties are intrinsic of the materials and can therefore be used for the development of prediction models that can be applied regardless of the measurement technique. The study of the dielectric properties is also important as it improves the understanding of the dielectric behavior of the materials. This thesis focuses on the dielectric properties of <b>solid</b> <b>biofuels</b> and their use in the characterization of these materials. The work presented includes the development of new methods permitting the determination of the dielectric properties of <b>solid</b> <b>biofuels</b> with large particle size (waveguide method), broadband measurement of the dielectric properties (coaxial-line probe), and the use of a previously developed method for the accurate determination of the dielectric properties (free-space method).

Torrefaction {{as a form of}} pyrolysis converts biomass into biofuels with according improved properties such as energy density, grindability and hydrophobicity. Several initiatives advanced this development. The first pilot-scale and demonstration plants displayed the maturity and potential of the technology. The European research project SECTOR intended to shorten the time-to-market. Within the project 158  Mg of biomass were torrefied through different technologies (rotary drum, toroidal reactor, moving bed). Their production led to process optimization of combined torrefaction-densification steps for various feedstocks through analysing changes in structure and composition. The torrefied pellets and briquettes were subjected to logistic tests (handling and storage) as well as to tests in small- and large-scale end-uses. This led to further improvement of the torrefied product meeting logistics/end-use requirements, e. g. durability, grindability, hydrophobicity, biodegradation and energy density. Durability exceeds now 95 %.
