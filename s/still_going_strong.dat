5|$|Though Colbert's real-life presidential {{campaign}} had ended, Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada established {{in an interview}} on The Colbert Report that Colbert's campaign was <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>strong</b> in the fictional Marvel Universe, citing the cover art of a then-recent issue of The Amazing Spider-Man which featured a Colbert campaign billboard in the background. Background appearances of Colbert campaign ads continued to appear in Marvel Comics publications, as late as August 2008's Secret Invasion No. 5 (which also features a cameo of an alien Skrull posing as Colbert). In October 2008, Colbert made an extended 8-page appearance webslinging with Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man issue No. 573. Colbert voiced the president of the U.S. in the 2009 film Monsters vs. Aliens.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservatism}} of the Liberal and Country League did {{not keep}} up with the expectations of a modern-day society. There was dissatisfaction with the restrictive drinking laws; environmentalists campaigned for more natural parks and more 'green' practices; police powers stood strong, 'no loitering' legislation remained in place; gambling was almost completely restricted. The constituents who loudly demanded changes were mostly immigrants and their offspring, used to more libertine conditions in their countries of origin. Their homes, usually built by the Housing Trust, sprawled into 'rural' electoral districts that were controlled by the League. Labor pledged to introduce social legislation to meet their demands; Playford, who did not drink, smoke or gamble, had no interest in doing so. His own candidates knew that the 1965 election would be unwinnable if Playford did not budge. The economy was <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>strong</b> and incomes were still increasing, so the Premier did not change his position on social reform.|$|E

The Red army, using a giant fire hydrant, coats the whole area with red paint, and when it mixes with the other paints on the field, they discover orange and purple, and the soldiers from all sides again are entranced and overjoyed over these new ideas.|$|R
40|$|When IBM's John Backus first {{developed}} the Fortran programming language, back in 1957, he certainly never dreamt {{that it would}} become a world-wide success and <b>still</b> be <b>going</b> <b>strong</b> many years later. Given the oft-repeated predictions of its imminent demise, starting around 1968, it is a surprise, even to {{some of its most}} devoted users, that this much-maligned language is not only still with us, but is being further developed for the demanding applications of the future. What has made this programming language succeed where most slip into oblivion? One reason is certainly that the language has been regularly standardized. In this paper we will trace the evolution of the language from its first version and though six cycles of formal revision, and speculate on how this might continue. Now, modern Fortran is a procedural, imperative, compiled language with a syntax well suited to a direct representation of mathematical formulas. Individual procedures may be compiled separately or grouped into modules, either way allowing the convenient construction of very large programs and procedure libraries. Procedures communicate via global data areas or by argument association. The language now contains features for array processing, abstract data types, dynamic data structures, objectoriented programming and parallel processing. Facultad de Informátic...|$|R

40|$|My talk {{today will}} be about {{taxonomy}} and {{about the way we}} classify things. More precisely, I will discuss, on the one hand, about the way we elaborate our taxonomies in what we used to call (despite Plato’s warning), “the real world”, which is {{the world in which we}} breath and walk, and, on the other hand, in the virtual world of the Internet. Now, usually, taxonomy is a boring subject, it’s all about classes, types, hierarchies and so on. But sometimes, we come to realize that as boring as it is, it plays a crucial role in shaping the way we see the world around us. This was more obvious than ever with the debate that took place last summer (and it’s <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on <b>strong)</b> between the leading astronomers of the world concerning the definition of a planet. That was indeed a very busy and exciting summer for astronomers!

Only 428 of the IAU’s nearly 10, 000 members were involved in the vote, the news says 1. The participants proposed a new definition for a planet.

Luna Sea and Glay, who went on to sell millions of records, with Glay being one of Japan's best-selling musical acts, had their first albums released by Extasy in 1991 and 1994. Free-Will was founded by Color vocalist and leader Dynamite Tommy, while at the time not as popular as Extasy, it had many moderately successful acts, such as By-Sexual and Kamaitachi. Currently Free-Will is <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>strong</b> and has been a major contributor in spreading modern visual kei inside and outside Japan, whereas Extasy followed its owner and became based out of the US, signing and producing American acts, and has since faded away.|$|E

25|$|Charangas supplanted the típica as the {{standard}} instrumental line-up for the danzón. Initially called charangas francesas (though {{they have nothing to}} do with France), they were 'invented' at the start of the 20th century. The formulation is <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>strong,</b> with appropriate adjustments to the instrumentation. The basic idea is to pitch the tone of the orchestra higher and brighter than the típica, by removing the brass, replacing the clarinet with a flute and replacing the kettle drums with a new invention, the pailas criollas, now called timbales. This metal-cased drum, hit with timbales sticks, and not timpani sticks, produces a distinctive effect. The two timbales drums are pitched differently, and may be supplemented with two timbalitos, pitched even higher, and one or two cencerros (cowbells). Also noteworthy is the use of the sticks on the metal casing to produce a rhythm known as the cascara. From early on these bands also included a piano. The overall effect is to produce a lighter, brighter flavor to the music; who actually originated the idea is not known.|$|E

500|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Clifton Down {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways, and there remained a strong staff presence in 1958, with a station master, chief booking clerk, four other clerks, six porters, a shunter, a checker and a weighbridge assistant. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers, and saw the withdrawal of a special schoolchildren's service. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested that all services along the Severn Beach Line be withdrawn. Following meetings with staff, it was decided to keep the line open to Severn Beach, but to close the section to Pilning, and also end services via Henbury. These services duly ended, and in July 1965 the goods yard at Clifton Down also closed. The line however was still threatened, and on 10 February 1967 it was announced that all services between [...] and Severn Beach would be discontinued. An enquiry followed, and in June that year the decision was reversed, on the condition that tickets be issued on the trains. Thus, on 17 July 1967, all stations along the line, including Clifton Down, had their staff withdrawn. The decrease of costs allowed a reduction of ticket prices, but the line was still under threat until in June 1969 it was decided that the line's closure would result in significant hardship, and so a grant was allocated to ensure continued services. Service levels however still declined: though the [...] "Monkey Specials" [...] were <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>strong</b> into the 1960s, with 340,000 excursion passengers arriving between 1958 and 1966, the closure of many of the Welsh Valley Lines and the construction of the Severn Bridge led to their demise in the early 1970s. Most of the Severn Beach Line was reduced to single track in late 1970, leaving Clifton Down as one of the few passing places. The glass platform canopies were completely removed in May 1971, and the glass-covered footbridge was also removed, leaving a set of steps from Whiteladies road as the only access to the southern platform. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, the Clifton Down Shopping Centre was built over most of the goods yard, the rest covered by a housing development.|$|E
