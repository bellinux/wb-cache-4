40|$|Abstract. <b>Screw</b> <b>conveyors</b> are {{continuously}} operating transport mechanisms {{designated for}} conveying bulk materials that involve {{the use of}} a spiral screw rotating inside a stable trough moving the material along the trough. They are used for specific needs of transportation of bulk materials for shorter distances with lower transportation power output. These are conveyors without traction components. The present paper is concerned with the use of <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors</b> in practice and the risks associated with their operation...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} options for moving grain from one {{location}} to another. Some of these options include conveyors such as belt <b>conveyors,</b> drag <b>conveyors,</b> <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> and pneumatic conveyors. Belt conveyors cause the least damage to grain {{due to the}} lack of contact forces, however, they cannot be used for steep inclines. Another commonly used <b>conveyor</b> is <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors.</b> <b>Screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> also known as augers, are conveyors made from a helical blade with rotational motion to move grain. They are on many types of farm equipment, including combines and grain carts for example. Augers generally have a high power requirements, but are portable and low cost. In addition, augers tend to cause high levels of mechanical damage to the grain. Much research has been completed to quantify the amount of grain damage caused by various <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors.</b> The percentage of grain damage is decreased when the auger is operated at capacity because the grain cannot bounce around and strike surfaces as easily. In addition, grain damage increases with increased rotational speed. For this research with <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> the angle of the incline was found to have no significant effect on the grain damage.Pneumatic conveyors use a moving air-stream to propel grain, and are used in situations when the path of the grain is complex. Grain damage can occur especially at any changes in the tube path, but can be minimized when air speeds are kept below 25 meters per second. [...] It is shown that grain damage increases exponentially above air velociities of 20 meters per second. [...] In research by Baker et al. breakage levels of maize in pneumatic conveyors were found to be similar to those of bucket or drag conveyors.|$|R

50|$|A {{meat grinder}} or meat mincer is a kitchen {{appliance}} for fine chopping ('mincing') and/or mixing of raw or cooked meat, fish, vegetables or similar food. It replaces tools like the mincing knife, for example, {{which is also}} used to produce minced meat, filling, etc. The producer puts the minced food into a funnel, which is placed {{on the top of the}} grinder. From there the material goes on a horizontal <b>screw</b> <b>conveyor.</b> This <b>screw</b> <b>conveyor,</b> which can be powered by a hand wheel or an electric motor, squashes and partially mixes the food.

Washing fermented mucilage requires, in the best case, 5.0 L/kg of DPC. Scientists at Cenicafé developed a machine to remove the mucilage covering the coffee seeds. This machine, called Deslim (the initial letters of the Spanish demucilager, the mechanical washer and cleaner) removes more than 98% of the total mucilage (same as a well conducted fermentation) by exerting stress and generating collisions among beans, using only 0.7 L/kg of DPC.

The results revealed that for both the conveyors tested, with increasing the screw rotational speed, the conveyor capacity increased and reached to a maximum point and after the point, the volumetric capacity decreased. Increasing the screw speed caused the volumetric efficiency and power requirements of the conveyors to be decreased and increased, respectively.

40|$|AbstractVertical screw {{conveying}} {{bulk and}} powdered materials {{are an integral}} part of many production processes in various industries and agriculture. With a wide range of applications in various industries, vertical <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> along with such qualities as the ease of construction, the continuity of transportation, integrity, the ability to transport and dusty badly smelling goods, have a significant drawback - the material, in addition to the translational motion in the direction of the axis of the conveyor, makes a rotary movement towards the peripheral speed of the screw, which reduces the productivity and increases the power consumption of the conveyor. The use of a simplified model of the movement of the material leads to the creation of inefficient machines, the structure and parameters of working bodies of which differ significantly from optimal.
