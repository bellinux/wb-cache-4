5|$|DraftKings and FanDuel {{also became}} {{known for their}} use of direct {{response}} advertising on television, especially during sports telecasts. Capitalizing on the start of football season, iSpot.tv estimated that DraftKings and FanDuel collectively spent over $107 million on television advertising in September 2015 alone—with nearly half being spent on advertising during National Football League telecasts ($23.6 million by DraftKings, and $26.7 million <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> FanDuel). Of the total, $60.1 million was <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> DraftKings, with $7.95 million spent during college football games, $2.05 million during ESPN's sports news program SportsCenter, and $1.36 million during South Park episodes. The marketing push was met with a negative reaction from viewers on social networks such as Twitter, who considered the repetitive airplay of DFS commercials during football games to be an annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> the NRA and the Koch brothers made it impossible for Democrats to win.|$|E

The club's highest attendance in the Premier League is 52,389, in a match against Manchester City on 6 May 2012. Newcastle lost the game 2–0. The highest transfer fee received for a Newcastle player is £35million, from Liverpool for Andy Carroll in January 2011, while the most <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> the club on a player was £16million for striker Michael Owen from Real Madrid in August 2005.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} earnest on 18 April 2013 after {{completion}} of remedial and preparatory works such as land acquisition, removal of vegetation, demolition of certain structures and remedial works on old mines in Midlothian, for which over £54 million was <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> Network Rail. The first task was the excavation of the track alignment through Monktonhall and the clearing of the site for Shawfair station. Construction of the line's first bridge, Rye Haugh Bridge at Millerhall, were underway on 6 August 2013 as part of works to deviate the line out of Edinburgh from Newcraighall before it returns to the original alignment. The 23-arch Newbattle Viaduct (or Lothianbridge Viaduct) was used by lorries removing spoil from the construction site which eased traffic on local roads.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. The keep {{remained}} in good condition, but by 1884 {{it was apparent}} that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended urgent work to repair the stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark's colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely {{climbed to the top of}} the keep had not been funded. A reported £500 was <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> the trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.|$|E
5|$|Much of this wealth was <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> Henry on {{maintaining}} his court and household, including {{many of the}} building works he undertook on royal palaces. Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland hung just 200. Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 handguns. Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government {{out of their own}} income. This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like tonnage and poundage, granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around £100,000), but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, between 1974 and 1997 no marked change {{took place}} in the average amount of time <b>spent</b> at work <b>by</b> Australians of [...] "prime working age" [...] (that is, between 25 and 54 years of age). Throughout this period, the average time <b>spent</b> at work <b>by</b> prime working-age Australians (including those who did not spend any time at work) {{remained}} stable at between 27 and 28 hours per week. This unchanging average, however, masks a significant redistribution of work from men to women. Between 1974 and 1997, the average time <b>spent</b> at work <b>by</b> prime working-age Australian men fell from 45 to 36 hours per week, while the average time <b>spent</b> at work <b>by</b> prime working-age Australian women rose from 12 to 19 hours per week. In the period leading up to 1997, the amount of time Australian workers spent at work outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays also increased.|$|R

5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportional}} representation {{system for the}} House of Councillors, introduced in 1982, {{was the first major}} electoral reform under the post-war constitution. Instead of choosing national constituency candidates as individuals, as had previously been the case, voters cast ballots for parties. Individual councillors, listed officially by the parties before the election, are {{selected on the basis of}} the parties' proportions of the total national constituency vote. The system was introduced to reduce the excessive money <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> candidates for the national constituencies. Critics charged, however, that this new system benefited the two largest parties, the LDP and the Japan Socialist Party (now Social Democratic Party), which in fact had sponsored the reform.|$|E
5|$|The surface {{interval}} (SI) or surface interval time (SIT) is {{the time}} <b>spent</b> <b>by</b> a diver at surface pressure after a dive during which inert gas which was still present {{at the end of}} the dive is further eliminated from the tissues. This continues until the tissues are at equilibrium with the surface pressures. This may take several hours. In the case of the US Navy 1956 Air tables, it is considered complete after 12 hours, The US Navy 2008 Air tables specify up to 16 hours for normal exposure. but other algorithms may require more than 24 hours to assume full equilibrium.|$|E
