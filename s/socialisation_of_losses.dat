He stated that [...] "legacy (bank) assets should be kept apart from any {{sovereign}} bail-out...to mix them up would be a <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> of an unimaginable scale". He believed that Germany stimulating demand and raising wages would be [...] "disastrous for the Euro-zone viz-a-viz {{the rest of the}} world". In relation to austerity programmes introduced since the crisis, he believed that [...] "it has been a tremendous propaganda victory of governments to make us believe that austerity has reached its limits". He further added that [...] "While we maintain that the Euro-zone will not break up, we are less optimistic on the pace of crisis resolution. Reform efforts are likely to be slow given the challenging economic backdrop and 'austerity fatigue'. As a result, we expect a continuation of the 'muddle-through' approach to crisis resolution, with growth in Europe remaining subdued for several years". He argued that Spanish youth unemployment was not due to austerity and instead could be solved by [...] "changing trade union laws" [...] as they were keeping labour markets closed.|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} in reports of undesirable professional behaviour {{in the nursing}} profession has prompted the question: How could the internalisation of skills, knowledge, values and beliefs be guided in student nurses to help them become effectively socialised as professional nurses? Using a sequential exploratory mixed-methods approach, the study addressed the above question. The researcher used focus-group interviews and field notes to explore and describe the perceptions of professional nurses and experiences of student nurses regarding the professional <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> students. The data generated from these findings were further used to determine and describe educators’ (N= 128) perceptions on their teaching and facilitation <b>of</b> professional <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> students, using a self-administered questionnaire. The findings of both the qualitative and quantitative data were integrated to develop and validate guidelines to support educators and professional nurses in the professional <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> students. To establish rigour, the researcher applied measures of trustworthiness and performed validity and reliability tests. The qualitative data were analysed by utilising Tesch’s method of data analysis. The themes that emerged as influential in the professional <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> students {{were related to the}} professional nurse as role model, clinical supervisor, the educator, clinical learning environment, values and beliefs of the nursing profession and cultural and gender orientations. The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Educators’ teaching and facilitation strategies revealed that the educator as a role model, the clinical environment, teaching approaches and cultural awareness were important social determinants in the professional <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> students. The qualitative and quantitative data were integrated to develop guidelines that were validated by field and guideline experts. The guidelines for educators and professional nurses addressed issues such as the professional nurse as role model and clinical supervisor, the creation of a positive clinical learning environment, the educator as role model, the teaching and support of students, the work ethic of the professional nurse and educator, the students’ behaviour and cultural awareness. These guidelines propose recommendations for educators and professional nurses to support the professional <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> students. Health StudiesD. Litt. et Phil.

40|$|The {{principal}} idea of {{this paper}} is that the European <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> domestic political actors {{as a result of the}} growing involvement in European policy-making settings is not as self evident as early and current neofunctionalists often assume. Rather we suggest that the European <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> national actors is mediated by factors that relate to the actors’ domestic embeddedness. It seems that <b>socialisation</b> power <b>of</b> the European institutions is inferior to the mechanism or scope conditions that are situated at the domestic level. Therefore we believe that future studies on European socialisation should control more explicitly for preexisting dispositions as key determinants of potential attitude change. Related to this, we argue that socialisation studies should focus more extensively on (domestic) recruitment that may affect pre-socialisation and international socialisation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis expands on Gellner 2 ̆ 7 s {{theory of}} nationalism. Gellner {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the 2 ̆ 7 why 2 ̆ 7 of nationalism, i. e. why nations and nationalism develop, but, neglects to elaborate on the detail of how this takes place or by what method the nation is reproduced. This is the 2 ̆ 7 missing ink 2 ̆ 7 in the title of the thesis, or the 2 ̆ 7 how 2 ̆ 7 of nationalism. To focus the analysis the concept <b>of</b> the <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> nationalism has been employed. This is an application of a theory <b>of</b> <b>socialisation</b> to nationalism as a social construct. By taking Gellner 2 ̆ 7 s modernist approach to the study of nations I will examine how the nation is reproduced through a complex process <b>of</b> <b>socialisation</b> that crosses between a centralised state education system and social learning. This will be synthesised with Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s theory <b>of</b> <b>socialisation,</b> adapted by shifting the focus of analysis from social class to what is presented as 2 ̆ 7 national doxa 2 ̆ 7. The theoretical fusion is applied to the study of observable manifestations of national doxa, habitus, and hexis, which concern the mundane and banal ways in which the nation is enacted and reproduced in the context of everyday social life. Importantly this also underscores the importance <b>of</b> <b>socialisation</b> as a process which is far more encompassing than state-run education, which is what Gellner tends to suggest in his concept of the 2 ̆ 7 educational machine 2 ̆ 7. This {{is not to say that}} Gellner was entirely wrong in prioritising mass-compulsory education however, and the thesis examines this aspect <b>of</b> <b>socialisation</b> through a textual analysis of history text books, using Ireland as a case study. The findings are used to modify Gellner 2 ̆ 7 s theory by emphasising the mutable nature of nationalism, i. e. in contrast to the linear development process found in Gellner 2 ̆ 7 s work; nationalism is a more complex process whereby the past is reconstructed in accordance with present concerns. This shows how education acts as a tool <b>of</b> the <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> nationalism; this is only possible due to a centralised state education system maintained by a national government.

Interactions between the development of the productive forces and the <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> capital ownership jointly impact on these signatures, such that profit calculations are historically contingent. Aspects of feudalism, particularly restrictions on usury impacted upon accounting calculation, retarding their development. In the industrial revolution calculations reflected the scale and scope of specialised investment in plant, whilst the progressive <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> capital prompted a separate set of calculative practices. It was only in the 20 th century, with the unification of large scale industry and finance capital that the modern notion of profitability as return on capital employed finally developed.

50|$|Maximalists were {{so called}} because they demanded the full {{implementation}} of the 'maximum programme' in the expected revolution: full <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> the land, factories and all other means of production. The orthodox Socialist-Revolutionaries wanted to start with land reform but defer <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> other means of production. The Maximalists also rejected the PSR's version of a 'two-stage' revolution, a theory associated with V.M. Chernov. According to Chernov, the coming revolution in Russia would not be purely 'bourgeois-democratic' as the Social-Democrats claimed, but would include social and economic {{as well as political}} reforms. It would be a 'popular-democratic' revolution, and would transition into a full-blown 'labour-socialist' revolution later on. The Maximalists rejected this as Social-Democratic 'attentism' and argued that the coming Russian revolution {{would not be able to}} stop half-way; it was the two-stage theory, not Maximalism, that was unrealistic if it thought the toiling masses, once liberated, would content themselves with a bourgeois republic and gradual reforms.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{occupational}} <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> Filipino merchant marine officer cadets through their experiences of maritime {{education and training}} (MET). The <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> the cadets is contextualised within the broad aim of the global and national regulations of MET to develop competent seafarers. In the international seafaring labour market, there is an increasing trend of labour participation of seafarers coming from the ‘new labour supplying countries’ (NLSCs). The Philippines is seen by industry insiders {{to be one of}} the top NLSCs for officers. However, the academic literature is silent about the experiences of officer cadets of their education and training especially those coming from NLSCs. Using multi-modal data collection tools such as in-depth interviews, field notes and document analysis, this qualitative study examines the experiences of the current and former cadets under the sponsored cadetship programs (SCPs) in the Philippines in order to analyse first-hand experiences of MET. The key findings of this thesis are: (a) SCPs are officer training platforms developed mainly by shipping companies to meet their sea-based labour needs and intended to comply with the Philippine standards of MET; (b) there are a variety of SCPs from which four models are described in this study; (c) SCPs utilise a ritualistic <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> cadets in college campus as key mechanism of training; and (d) there is a diversity of shipboard training experiences of cadets ranging from well-planned training programs to the complete absence of programs. The thesis concludes the following: (a) the quality of training experienced by the cadets is characterised as a highly regulated and reinforced professionalization process intent on producing certificated officers; (b) the SCPs are routes for migrant work for mainly male Filipinos being guaranteed a post-collegiate sea-based employment by their shipping patrons; (c) the <b>socialisation</b> <b>of</b> the cadets is influenced by processes of globalisation embodied in the global standards of MET enforced locally, and the role of international shipping companies in funding the recruitment and training of cadets as well as offering them post-training employment; and (d) in spite of global and local standards of MET, there is no common or shared understanding of the notion of seafaring competence among the trainers, which have affected the way competencies were taught and assessed...|$|R

It is possible that early years professionals {{in the absence of}} knowledge draw on ‘common sense’ and ‘universal norms of language development’ associated with monolingual notions <b>of</b> language <b>socialisation.</b> “Socialization, broadly defined, is the process through which a child or other novice acquires the knowledge, orientations, and practices that enable him or her to participate effectively and appropriately in the social life of a particular community.

For several decades, {{government}} policy {{for people with}} long-term impairments {{has been dominated by}} efforts to enable them to live independently and participate in society.

This report describes a survey carried out in five municipalities to determine the factors that foster and impede <b>socialisation.</b> A series <b>of</b> interviews was conducted for the survey, in which representatives of local authorities, organisations active in the fields of care, housing, work and welfare and client organisations were asked about their activities, their experiences and their expectations with regard to socialisation.
