5|$|With the {{publication}} of the accreditation procedures for organisations to access ContactPoint, {{it became clear that the}} vast majority of voluntary organisations would not have been able to access ContactPoint. This meant that the majority of organisations that work with children or young people e.g. sports groups, uniformed groups and faith groups, would not be able to register their involvement, representing a real challenge for practitioners who wanted to <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> working with a particular child or young person.|$|E
25|$|Due to the doping scandal {{a number}} of riders did not start in the tour, among those riders were the biggest {{favorites}} to win the tour, Jan Ullrich, Ivan Basso and Alexander Vinokourov. With those riders not starting, the 2006 Tour de France did not have real favorites and opinions were hugely divided over {{who was going to}} win the tour.

25|$|In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen {{called to}} the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was {{carrying}} a baby at the time, went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening the door by stating {{that they were looking}} for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow hallway to <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later.|$|E

25|$|Hours {{later as}} the police conduct an {{investigation}} at the crime scene, the investigation seems futile since the brothers covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with ammonia. However, Smecker happens upon {{the part of the}} finger lost by Rocco and decides to do an independent investigation to <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> behind the gun battle. Smecker is able to track the evidence down to Rocco and his two allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult scenario, and struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men, or join them in their cause, as Smecker had become sympathetic towards the brothers' actions. After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently getting advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} morning of May 14, 1912, Gregovich was at the Tonopah and Goldfield train depot to collect a grocery bill and had engaged a Doctor J. R. Masterson in conversation. [...] Mircovich {{had come to the}} depot from the {{cemetery}} to <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> arriving on the morning train. When he saw Gregovich on the station platform, Mircovich said, [...] "I will get you, you old son-of-a-bitch!" [...] He then stabbed Gregovich with a knife in the chest and groin, puncturing his lung and severing his femoral artery. Doctor Masterson was able to clamp the artery with a hemostat from his medical bag. Deputy Sheriff William Walker immediately apprehended Mircovich, who told him that the murder weapon was his and that Gregovich had taken his money. Despite the efforts of a team of doctors, Gregovich died of shock at 1:00p.m. at Miner's Hospital. At the Nye County Jail, Mircovich told Sheriff Ed Malley that he [...] "wanted to make John Gregovich die", although Malley did not advise him that such statements could be used against him in court.|$|E

Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, {{in an interview in}} 2000,"So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody I was taking the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when we crossed the first class, people were shouting but I didn't <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me 'go forward I protect your back.' So I went and then he found a hostess {{and she was going to}} catch me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. [...] So I was screaming 'open the door.' Then the hostess came; she said 'she has two hand grenades,' but they did not open (the cockpit door) and suddenly I was threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying 'I will count and if you don't open I will blow up the plane.'" ...|$|E
