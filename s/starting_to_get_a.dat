5000|$|Having been {{expected}} to take a lead off his pacemaker in the race, Queally made all on Frankel to win by six lengths, the widest margin of victory since Tudor Minstrel in 1947. Speaking after his first Classic win, Queally said, [...] ""He’s {{made a show of}} them. The one thing this horse does is gallop - I didn't want to disappoint him, I wanted him to do what he enjoys and he showed them. The first thing you think is what speed are we going, because to him it feels like a cruising canter. He quickened up and went away."However, the plaudits for his tactics at Newmarket turned to criticism after Frankel’s next start at Ascot, in the St James's Palace Stakes, where despite initially settling behind a strong pace set by his stablemate Rerouted, Queally sent Frankel to the lead well before the home turn and only just hung on to win. Both trainer and jockey professed their surprise publicly at the criticism, with Queally dismissing claims the horse was tiring due to the unusual race tactics. [...] "He was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little fed up as he just does it so easily. He's growing up all the time." [...] Cecil confirmed he was satisfied with the ride given by Queally, stating, [...] "The plan was to go before the bend and he sprinted away, but now he's getting wiser and when he thought he had the race won, he thought he'd done enough".After the controversial tactics that led to the narrow victory at Ascot, Frankel was ridden to victory from the front in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, though Queally played down his role in the win, saying, [...] "He was amazing and I’m just very fortunate to be playing a small part in it."Further Group 1 victories for Queally and Cecil followed (Timepiece in the Falmouth Stakes and the evergreen Midday winning a third Nassau at Goodwood); but in the aftermath of Frankel’s easy win in the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (British Champion Mile), in which the horse lived up to his billing as the star attraction of the inaugural QIPCO British Champions Day, Queally was in no doubt about what had made his year, saying, [...] "This is the people´s horse now. If someone asked me to sum up my season, it would be one word, Frankel." [...] Queally finished 2011 with 100 winners and over £2,500,000 in prize-money.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{obstacles}} that child marriage poses to development {{and to the}} achievement of the Millennium Development Goals have been widely recognized.

We are <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sense of what works and the general areas in which investing in research could make a difference. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify gaps in the research on child marriage in which additional investment could catalyze change.

By mapping out current knowledge of child marriage and the programs designed to address it, and by highlighting questions to which we do not yet know the answers, the paper is intended to generate discussion in the field and clarify what we need to know to bring an end to this deeply harmful practice. The paper also moves us closer to the development of a shared theory of change for this field: given that many organizations are now working in this area, how can their programs and related research be understood [...] aligned [...] in such a way that their work feeds into a single theory of change? The research gaps on their own should not drive investments in child marriage. A worthy research mandate must also be driven by programmatic and advocacy needs. The recommended areas for research are not meant to provide a definitive menu, but rather to describe the general contours of what we know and what we need to understand better...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} has been to analyse {{unconventional}} natural gas (UNG) resources and identify possible alternatives for monetizing them. What's found is that global UNG reserves are vast and many. However only a few have been established as commercial industries. The US has established a highly developed industry based on their large shale gas (SG) resources, while Australia is <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sizeable production of coal bed methane (CBM). Estimates for the future natural gas (NG) market shows {{that there will be}} an increased price and demand development for both NG and liquefied NG (LNG) in European and Asian. This has triggered LNG project based UNG both in Australia and the US, aiming to supply these markets. NG components found in UNG reservoirs are the same as what's found in reservoirs classified as conventional (COG). However on a general basis there are some difference is component amount and composition. This creates some differences when comparing layout of LNG plants based on UNG against plants based on COG. Some of these differences are reduces need for fractionation and reception unit due to general lower content of heavy hydrocarbons (HHC). The absence of H$_ 2 $S in most CBM reservoirs reduces the need for complex installations as the Claus process. However a general higher content of N$_ 2 $ might require treatment by cryogenic distillation, adsorption or absorption-processes. This is a few point among others. UNG reservoirs with its low permeability requires high drilling activity and a high degree of hydraulic fracturing (HF). This brings with it environmental issues that has created public concerns. Governments and commercial operators needs to addresses these issues for UNG development to continue. Gaining the public trust could be established by a greater transparency of the industry and by creating regulatory framework and policies that minimizes the environmental potential. The monetization of UNG through a gas to liquid (GTL) process show potential. Cost estimates on GTL in early stages of the industry implied similar production cost between LNG and GTL. However large scale GTL plants recently built show a much high costs than what's estimated. GTL has a potential in regions with high price difference between crud oil and NG, but the current high cost leaves the technology with small profit margins. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{billboard}} {{that nearly}} caused John Woods to swerve off the coastal road stood {{much higher than}} existing legislation permitted. He knew this because he had recently taken a position as a community reporter on a local rag, and he was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hang of municipal legalese, whether he liked it or not. A hundred yards on he contemplated its mysterious message, identically phrased in the reverse view, and set against the same blue background that had Woods thinking, for a subliminal moment, that the Billboard {{was part of the}} ocean beyond, the white letters nothing more than gently ruffled caps of water. The Wait is Almost Over. He looked around at the green mountainside and the gently waving forest of kelp, which flanked the ocean road. Not an impatient scene, exactly. Not a single soul waiting for a god-damned thing. He read the slogan again, and as its meaning dawned (an understanding that it must mean some development was imminent: that almost over portended the very worst for a perfectly beautiful section of mountainside, untouched for all time) he became aware of an increasing tightness in his chest, as if he were taking on pressurised air. He felt the desire to shout something back at the slogan, something equally presumptuous, equally menacing. He picked up a rock, a nice blade of Cape sandstone, and hurled it. (The missile struck with a clang, and dropped to the ground.) Next he tried to pull the billboard over, but since it was not a supple birch, the thing would not begin to lean, no matter how high he climbed. When Inspector Claude Grey rounded the corner on a routine patrol he intercepted Woods at that point of his destructive endeavours where he had attached a tow-line to the structure's left leg, and was proceeding to push the engine of his car through higher and higher revolutions as white sand spurted out from beneath his balding tyres. On the charge sheet the following information was recorded: Name: Jonathan Woods Occupation: Community Reporter, Environmental Affairs. Offence: Destruction of property Mason Construction PTY (Ltd), to whom the billboard belonged, went ahead with the prosecution.
