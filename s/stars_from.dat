Forte was interested if White could transfer the Michelin <b>stars</b> <b>from</b> Harveys; White was open to this since Raymond Blanc had previously transferred two stars to Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons when he moved his restaurant from Summertown, Oxford. Following the agreement of Michelin, White left Harveys in July 1993; The Restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel less than two months later, on 14 September. The interior was decorated with paintings from White's own collection.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, calypso and Trinidadian steelpan became the most popular styles of music on Dominica, replacing traditional Carnival music like chanté mas and lapo kabwit. Early recording <b>stars</b> <b>from</b> this era included Swinging Busters, The Gaylords, De Boys an Dem and Los Caballeros, while chorale groups also gained fans, especially Lajenne Etwal, Siflé Montan'y and the Dominica Folk singers. These early popular musicians were aided by the spread of radio broadcasting, beginning with WIDBS and later Radio Dominica.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Djajakusuma {{released}} his first film based on traditional wayang stories, Lahirnja Gatotkatja; the traditional puppetry had fascinated {{him as a}} child, and he greatly enjoyed the character Gatotkaca. Shot in Yogyakarta, the film featured a cast of <b>stars</b> <b>from</b> Jakarta and local talent in backing roles. It was, however, controversial: dhalang and others versed in wayang argued that the director had ignored too many traditional aspects of the puppetry. That year Djajakusuma also served as production manager for Ismail's Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom) and directed Mak Tjomblang (Mrs. Tjomblang), a comedy adapted from Nikolai Gogol's 1842 drama Marriage.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness {{can be interpreted}} as planets whose orbits move in front of their <b>stars</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of Earth. Kepler-11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets.|$|E

5|$|Maureen O'Hara (born Maureen FitzSimons; 17 August 192024 October 2015) was an Irish-born American {{actress and}} singer. The famously {{red-headed}} O'Hara {{was known for}} her beauty and playing fiercely passionate but sensible heroines, often in westerns and adventure films.

5|$|The {{stars that}} {{correspond}} to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China. In Chinese astronomy, Gamma and Lambda Gruis may {{have been included in}} the tub-shaped asterism Bàijiù, along with <b>stars</b> <b>from</b> Piscis Austrinus. In Central Australia, the Arrernte and Luritja people living on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. Alpha and Beta Gruis, along with Fomalhaut, Alpha Pavonis and the stars of Musca, were all claimed by the Arrernte.|$|E
5|$|After Cassini {{became the}} first {{director}} of the Paris Observatory in 1671, he tackled {{the problem of the}} physical scale of the Solar System. The relative size of the planetary orbits was known from Kepler's third law, so what was needed was the actual size of one of the planet's orbits. For this purpose, the position of Mars was measured against the background <b>stars</b> <b>from</b> different points on the Earth, thereby measuring the diurnal parallax of the planet. During this year, the planet was moving past the point along its orbit where it was nearest to the Sun (a perihelic opposition), which made this a particularly close approach to the Earth. Cassini and Jean Picard determined the position of Mars from Paris, while the French astronomer Jean Richer made measurements from Cayenne, South America. Although these observations were hampered by the quality of the instruments, the parallax computed by Cassini came within 10% of the correct value. The English astronomer John Flamsteed made comparable measurement attempts and had similar results.|$|E
