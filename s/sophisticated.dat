40|$|Event {{studies on}} {{quarterly}} (interim) financial reports have {{found evidence that}} contradicts the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. Normative studies and regulatory body statements on interim reporting have emphasized the predictive function; estimating annual earnings, making forward projections and identifying turning points. With the growth in sophistication of financial markets many investors have abrogated their investment analysis to surrogates, investment <b>sophisticates</b> such as analysts and brokers. There is compelling evidence that <b>sophisticates</b> estimate annual earnings {{on the basis of}} interim disclosures and that individual investors, receiving investment advisory services, bring the results of professional analysis to bear on the investment decisions. ^ This study surveyed New Zealand <b>sophisticates</b> to identify the interim accounting stimuli which <b>sophisticates</b> used in their investment analysis. ^ This study was designed to make a significant contribution to a theory for interim reporting which will make subsequent event studies more meaningful. ^ New Zealand <b>sophisticates</b> manifest an awareness of the predictive function of interim financial reports. The respondents preferred more timely, credible and frequent interim reports prepared on a basis consistent with annual reports and with disclosure of seasonal factors. These preferences should be accorded the urgency they deserve if accounting information is to continue to be considered reliable by investors. The anachronism is that the glossy annual reports, having little significant information content, continue to draw the attention of standard setting bodies while the financial report replete with information of value [...] the interim [...] generally escapes the attention of standard setting bodies. This is alarming because analysts and brokers use interim data to re-cast projected annual earnings and perhaps this interim data has not been prepared on a consistent and comparable basis between periods and between firms. ^ The accounting profession has a duty, perhaps a fiduciary responsibility, to ensure interim reports are reliable, as the impact of investors making investment decisions based upon projections of earnings which in turn were calculated using possibly unreliable interim reports is extremely serious. ...|$|R

40|$|In two {{experimental}} studies (conducted in Britain and Italy), participants {{read about a}} politician answering to leadership- versus morality-related allegations using either downward counterfactuals (“things could have been worse, if…”) or upward counterfactuals (“things could have been better, if…”). Downward messages increased {{the perception of the}} politician’s leadership, while both downward and upward messages increased morality perception. Political sophistication moderated the effect of message direction, with downward messages increasing perceived morality in low <b>sophisticates</b> and upward messages increasing perceived morality in high <b>sophisticates.</b> In the latter group, the acknowledgement of a responsibility-taking intent mediated morality judgment. Results were consistent across different countries, highlighting previously unexplored effects of communication on the perception of the “Big Two” dimensions...|$|R

40|$|Competence {{ratings are}} clearly a {{significant}} element of candidate evaluations and vote support. However, Political Science studies have not paid significant {{attention to the}} components of competence evaluations. This analysis attempts to identify the type of cues the public relies on to form competence judgments of candidates. The premise under examination is that candidate competence assessments are based on similar determinants for all candidates. Analysis of the competence profiles of Reagan and Clinton from the 1984 and 1996 NES Surveys does not support this hypothesis. Among <b>sophisticates,</b> the competence evaluations of Clinton in 1996 were determined by evaluations of performance on major issues. On the other hand, the competence evaluations of <b>sophisticates</b> for Reagan in the 1984 election were little related to the candidate’s abilities, but were driven mainly by feelings toward the candidate...|$|R
