5000|$|As Sutton {{recalled}} his breaking into Marvel, editor-in-chief Stan Lee ...looked at {{the stuff that}} I had brought in, was stuff that I had done in the service for Stars and Stripes in Tokyo. I think he was rather impressed {{by the fact that}} I had actually done a daily comic strip for two years. He didn't get many people who had done that. ... He just reached over and he pulled off this huge pile of blank paper. And he said, 'OK, do me a couple of Westerns and I'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> Have fun.'

50|$|The series {{ended on}} May 30, 1954 and its ending {{was a little}} confusing. There were 39 shows in the first season for General Electric but only the 36 in the second. The usual ‘discussion’ between Crosby and Ken Carpenter, implied that they were summing up all the {{previous}} items of this nature but astonishingly, {{at the close of}} the program, Crosby is heard to say, “I hope to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> all again, <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> when our guest will be Miss Rosemary Clooney.” This information was re-iterated by Ken Carpenter in the closing announcements. In fact, it was planned that Gary Crosby would take over with his own show on the following Sunday. The confusion may have been due to Gary Crosby having a motor accident on May 24 and being treated for a lacerated nose and an injured knee. Gary Crosby’s debut had to be postponed until June 13 and his radio program replaced his father’s on CBS for the summer period of thirteen weeks before Gary began his third year at Stanford.|$|R
