500|$|San Miguel has {{admitted}} to being offended by criticism of her response. In {{an interview with}} entertainment commentator Ricky Lo {{a week after the}} event, she explained that she did not comprehend the question clearly when she was on stage at the pageant, due to the softness of the questioner's voice. When given another opportunity to answer the same question, she <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "My family is my inspiration".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written under [...] "extreme pressure" [...] during the show's brief Christmas hiatus. Many critics have noted {{similarities}} between [...] "Monday" [...] and the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day. Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, {{the writers of}} the episode, however, credit an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled [...] "Shadow Play" [...] (1961). Gilligan later noted: [...] "The funny thing about 'Monday' is people seemed to really like it a lot, but people always sorta [...] <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> you're sort of ripping off Groundhog Day aren't you? [...] And I'd say, we're not ripping off Groundhog Day, we're ripping off The Twilight Zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Watson also observes, [...] "Similarly, the Dutch Defence looks {{particularly}} sterile when White achieves the reversed positions a tempo up (it {{turns out}} that he has nothing useful to do!); and indeed, many standard Black openings are not very inspiring when one gets them as White, tempo in hand." [...] GM Alex Yermolinsky likewise notes that GM Vladimir Malaniuk, a successful exponent of the Leningrad Dutch (1.d4 f5 2.g3 g6) at the highest levels, [...] "once made a deep impression on me by casually dismissing someone's suggestion that he should try 1.f4 as White. He <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'That extra move's gonna hurt me.|$|E

500|$|Johnny Kerr of the Syracuse Nationals marveled, [...] "How about this: He's the world's worst free-throw shooter and he's 28 out of 32!" [...] Cousy {{figured the}} game {{must have gone}} out of control, just as when Cousy had 29assists when the Celtics scored 173points against Minneapolis. Boston coach Red Auerbach laughed, [...] "He's playing against nobody." [...] Bill Russell <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The Big Fella finally did it." [...] In a {{conversation}} with Naulls after the game, Chamberlain predicted he would win his NBA championships but still be known for his individualism, versus Russell who was credited for making his team—the Boston Celtics—great. Two days after the historic feat, Chamberlain made a guest appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.|$|E
500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed she <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched out her arms. Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E
2500|$|During {{his last}} days, {{some of his}} new disciples began to preach him as God Almighty. I was afraid my meeting with such men would give rise to {{unpleasant}} discussions. So, I kept away. At last, when the news of his fast declining health was brought to me one day, I left all work and went to Dakshineswar. I found him very low. That was before his removal to a more commodious house on the riverside for treatment. Ramkrishna took me to task for neglecting him. I pleaded guilty to the charge and made a clean breast of it by letting him know the exact causes, I <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> “As there are many editions of a book so {{there have been many}} editions of God Almighty and your disciples are about to make you a new one.” He too <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> “Just fancy, God Almighty dying of cancer in the throat. What great fools these fellows must be!” ...|$|E
6000|$|We told {{these facts}} to MacShaughnassy. He smiled, a very grim <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{in a low}} tone, full of meaning, [...] "Let them eat!" ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{incident}} followed on from Ifans's playful {{request to}} buy Tubridy a drink. Tubridy said, [...] "Uh absolutely" [...] {{then tried to}} ask Ifans about his latest film. Ifans said, [...] "It's called Neverland and uh, it's a prequel to Peter Pan. Yeah? OK? Are you familiar with that?" [...] "I sure am" [...] said Tubridy. Because you've got very Peter Panny feet" [...] Ifans continued. Tubridy thanked him for the compliment then Ifans <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Dainty little bugger" [...] to laughter from the studio audience.|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 2010, Shahzad {{was convicted}} and sentenced by federal judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of the Southern District of New York to life {{imprisonment}} {{without the possibility of}} parole. When asked by the judge, [...] "Didn't you swear allegiance to this country?" [...] Shahzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen, replied, [...] "I sweared, but I didn't mean it." [...] Shahzad, wearing a white prayer cap, <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Allahu Akbar" [...] after hearing his sentence. He said he would [...] "sacrifice a thousand lives for Allah." [...] He predicted that [...] "War with Muslims has just begun," [...] and that [...] "the defeat of the US is imminent, inshallah [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the last}} cannon shots fired that day hit Paget in the right leg, necessitating its {{amputation}}. According to anecdote, {{he was close to}} Wellington when his leg was hit, and exclaimed, [...] "By God, sir, I've lost my leg!" [...] — to which Wellington replied, [...] "By God, sir, so you have!" [...] According to his aide-de-camp, Thomas Wildman, during the amputation Paget <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I have had a pretty long run. I have been a beau these 47 years and it would not be fair to cut the young men out any longer." [...] While Paget had an articulated artificial limb fitted, his amputated leg meanwhile had a somewhat macabre after-life as a tourist attraction in the village of Waterloo in Belgium, to which it had been removed and where it was later interred.|$|E
6000|$|But when Gwendolen rose up {{promptly}} <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> a glad <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> with thankfulness <b>and</b> blessing, [...] "Must you go?" [...] {{it seemed}} cruel to desert, {{and he sat}} down again.|$|R

2500|$|Jarrett was a {{television}} broadcaster on CBS, {{first as a}} pit reporter from 1979 to 1984, and later as color analyst from 1984 to 2000; he was also color analyst on ESPN from 1989 to 2000. He called several of NASCAR's more memorable television moments. He called his son Dale's first victory (in his 129th race) in the 1991 Champion Spark Plug 400 at the Michigan International Speedway. Dale banged Davey Allison's fender {{at the finish line}} in what was then the closest finish in NASCAR history. Another famous moment was when he called Dale's victory at the 1993 Daytona 500, breaking impartiality and openly siding with his son on the last lap and coaching him home to victory over Dale Earnhardt. Embarrassed by his loss of objectivity, he tried to apologize to Earnhardt after the race, but Earnhardt merely <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'm a father, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|After school Evans would {{entertain}} {{customers at}} his various jobs, including Fresh Farm Poultry in the Italian Market on Ninth Street {{and at the}} Produce Market, with songs and jokes. It was his boss at the Produce Market, Tony A., who gave Evans the nickname [...] "Chubby". The store owner of Fresh Farm Poultry, Henry Colt, was so impressed by Ernest's performances for the customers that he, along with his colleague and friend Kal Mann, {{who worked as a}} songwriter for Cameo-Parkway Records, arranged for young Chubby to do a private recording for American Bandstand host Dick Clark. It was at this recording session that Evans got his stage name from Clark's wife, who asked Evans what his name was. [...] "Well", he replied, [...] "my friends call me 'Chubby'". As he had just completed a Fats Domino impression, she <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "As in Checker?" [...] That little play on words ("chubby" [...] describing a degree of fatness and [...] "checkers" [...] being, like [...] "dominoes", a game) got an instant laugh, and stuck: from then on, Evans would use the name [...] "Chubby Checker".|$|E
2500|$|One anecdote, {{taken from}} the Purana, narrates that the {{treasurer}} of Svarga (paradise) and god of wealth, Kubera, went one day to Mount Kailash {{in order to receive}} the darshan (vision) of Shiva. Since he was extremely vain, he invited Shiva to a feast in his fabulous city, Alakapuri, so that he could show off to him all of his wealth. Shiva <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to him: [...] "I cannot come, but you can invite my son Ganesha. But I warn you that he is a voracious eater." [...] Unperturbed, Kubera felt confident that he could satisfy even the most insatiable appetite, like that of Ganesha, with his opulence. He took the little son of Shiva with him into his great city. There, he offered him a ceremonial bath and dressed him in sumptuous clothing. After these initial rites, the great banquet began. While the servants of Kubera were working themselves to the bone in order to bring the portions, the little Ganesha just continued to eat and eat and eat. His appetite did not decrease even after he had devoured the servings which were destined for the other guests. There was not even time to substitute one plate with another because Ganesha had already devoured everything, and with gestures of impatience, continued waiting for more food. Having devoured everything which had been prepared, Ganesha began eating the decorations, the tableware, the furniture, the chandelier. Terrified, Kubera prostrated himself in front of the little omnivorous one and supplicated him to spare him, at least, the rest of the palace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good, gallant heart!" [...] thought I to myself; but I {{shook my}} head, <b>smiling,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Never think of it: impose on {{yourself}} no such task. You write to me!--you'll not have time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Those {{were exactly}} my own foolish words, for which I could have beaten myself afterwards; but Mr. Castleford only gave a slight grave <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You mean that your brother's real defect is in courage, moral and physical.' ...|$|R
60|$|After {{sitting for}} {{about half an hour}} after supper, he rose, with an {{uncertain}} sort of <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he supposed he must be moving on,--asking, at the same time, how far it was to the tavern over the ridge.|$|R
60|$|Fogg {{said they}} thought it rather probable. Dodson <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> they'd try.|$|E
60|$|The Scots {{looked at}} each other, nodded, <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> they thought they could.|$|E
60|$|He <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> I {{might make}} myself easy; {{he had told}} us the worst.|$|E
60|$|As this retort {{appeared}} to convey rather a personal allusion to Mr. Tuckle's crimson livery, that gentleman looked majestic {{for a few}} seconds, but gradually edging away from the fire, broke into a forced <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it wasn't bad.|$|R
60|$|This was a {{question}} of mockery. It was like asking whether the Life Guards could take Windsor. I therefore only returned the <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that I did not doubt the enemy would agree to settle affairs upon that condition.|$|R
5000|$|She {{extended}} {{her hand to}} them with a <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Maikai! — [...] "Good," [...] — and added, [...] "Great is my love to God." [...] In the morning {{she was a little}} better, and conversed with her husband Hoapili.|$|R
60|$|Hopkins frowned, but, being a good-natured man, he {{immediately}} <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{he would walk}} in.|$|E
60|$|He <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> no more, {{but that}} night as we were making camp I saw him {{unfasten}} Dejah Thoris' fetters himself.|$|E
6000|$|Is {{not that}} it, Mrs. Betty?' I <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing. 'Nay,' says he, 'I think the effect has proved {{it to be}} love, for it seems the doctor {{has been able to}} do you but little service; you mend very slowly, they say. I doubt there's {{somewhat}} in it, Mrs. Betty; I doubt you are sick of the incurables, and that is love.' I <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, indeed, sir, that's none of my distemper.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The Guru rebuked {{her with}} a <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> “What do you mean the buffalo has died? It is hale and hearty and can give enough milk for your family and also for all of us. Don’t waste time, go quickly and fetch the milk.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bhaer {{looked up}} then, tried to <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in a {{grateful}} tone {{that made the}} lads feel like saints, [...] "I thank you very much, my boys. It was a beautiful way to help and comfort me. I shall not forget it, I assure you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Brown {{he smiled}} a bitter <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{he was at}} fault, [...] It seemed he had been {{trespassing}} on Jones's family vault; [...] He was a most sarcastic man, this quiet Mr. Brown, [...] And on several occasions he had cleaned out the town.|$|R
