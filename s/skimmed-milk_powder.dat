40|$|A nontargeted protein {{identification}} method {{was developed to}} screen for adulterations in <b>skimmed-milk</b> <b>powder</b> (SMP). There are indications of falsified SMP content due to the addition of plant proteins. To demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the developed comparative LC-MS method using a quadrupole TOF MS instrument, adulterated SMP samples were prepared {{by the addition of}} protein isolates of soy and pea to skimmed-milk before pasteurisation and evaporation. The comparative LC-MS approach enabled unequivocal discrimination of those SMP samples containing soy and pea protein from nonadulterated SMP. To identify the source of (plant) proteins present in the adulterated SMP, data-dependent LC-MS/MS was used in combination with an include list of differential peptides. Numerous peptides originating from the major seed proteins of soy (glycinin, beta-conglycin) and pea (legumin, vicilin) could be identified in this wa...|$|E
40|$|The EU subsidises {{the use of}} <b>skimmed-milk</b> <b>powder</b> (SMP) in {{compound}} feeding stuffs. There {{are indications}} of falsified SMP content due to the addition of plant proteins. These proteins are not allowed in SMP and cannot be identified by the official reference method. Since soy and pea proteins {{are most likely to}} be added to SMP, manufactured SMP containing 1 and 5 % of these plant proteins was used to develop a sensitive protein identification method based on mass spectrometry (MS). The method included a pre-fractionation step to enrich for plant proteins by using a borate buffer. A very fast perfusion liquid chromatography method including sensitive and selective intrinsic fluorescence detection was developed for monitoring and quantifying the efficiency of the pre-fractionation and screening for plant proteins. After tryptic digestion of the enriched fraction from manufactured adulterated SMP, numerous peptides originating from the major seed proteins of soy (glycinin, ÃŸ-conglycin) and pea (legumin, vicilin) could be identified by MS/MS analysis on a quadrupole time-of-flight MS instrument...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} {{to determine the}} amount of whey powder in a binary mixture containing whey and <b>skimmed-milk</b> <b>powders.</b> This new approach is based on measurement of the amplitude of the photoacoustic (PA) signal obtained when the mixture is exposed to a controlled thermal treatment; the latter was shown to affect the colour of the powder. The limit of detection for the whey powder adulterant was 2 % by weight. The PA and reflectance spectra (in the visible region) of the mixtures were also compared...|$|R
40|$|Another USDA paper {{identifies}} {{three important}} effects of EU export subsidies: they lower {{prices in the}} importing country resulting in a 'decrease in local production, meaning the artificially low price pushes domestic producers out of the market, leaving them unemployed'; they reduce the income of those who continue to produce 'which can be devastating to their livelihoods'; they can 'inhibit market development of infant industries, particularly in developing countries'. The paper reviews {{the situation in the}} dairy sector and notes that <b>skimmed-milk</b> <b>powder</b> is the EU's largest export product to developing and least developed countries. Some 95 % of subsidised skimmed milk powder exports from the EU went to developing countries and some 11 % to LDCs. The paper notes that 'many developing and least developed countries have become dependent on low-priced SMP and other dairy imports from the EU as a primary protein source'. The low cost of imports has displaced local dairy farmers in countries as diverse as South Africa and Sri Lanka. In the rice sector, some 50 % of EU milled-rice exports goes to developing countries, with around 14 % going to LDCs. The report also briefly looks at the impact of export subsidies in the cereals and sugar sectors. Comment: While criticising the export subsidies paid by the EU this USDA paper makes no reference to the impact that CAP reform is having on the need for export subsidies. In the cereals sector, where reform is most advanced, the need for export subsidies had been reduced by around 95 % until the recent increase {{in the value of the}} euro against the US dollar (which saw a fivefold increase in cereals-sector export refunds in the 2004 EU budget). It is this long-term trend which is of growing importance in EU trade flows with developing countries, rather than the provision of export refunds. Another USDA paper identifies three important effects of EU export [...] ...|$|E
