In fact an opaque band runs transversely across the corner of the eye, and the iris, or coloured portion, sends out two processes, which meet each other under the transverse band of the cornea, so that the fish appears to possess even a double pupil. Still, on closer investigation, the connection, between the divisions of the pupil are apparent, and can readily be seen in the young fish.

The accident had happened, according to the statements of Captain Poke, in lat. 78 degrees 13' 26"--although I never knew in what manner he ascertained the important particular of our precise situation. Thinking it might be well to get some more accurate ideas on this subject, after so long and ticklish a run, I procured the quadrant from Bob Ape, and brought it down upon the ice, where I made it a point, as an especial favor, the weather being favorable and the proper hour near, that our commander would correct his instinct by a solar observation. Noah protested that your old seaman, especially if a sealer and a Stunin'tunner, had no occasion for such geometry operations, as he termed them; that it might be well enough, perhaps necessary, for your counting-house, silk-gloved captains, who run between New York and Liverpool, to be rubbing up their glasses and polishing their sextants, for they hardly ever knew where they were, except at such times; but as for himself, he had little need of turning <b>star-gazer</b> at his time of life, and that as he had already told me, he was getting to be near-sighted, and had some doubts whether he could discern an object like the sun, that was known to be so many thousands of millions of miles from the earth.

60|$|The {{discovery}} of this strange society was a curiously refreshing thing; {{to realize that}} there were ten new trades in the world was like looking at the first ship or the first plough. It made a man feel what he should feel, that he was still in the childhood of the world. That I should have come at last upon so singular a body was, I may say without vanity, not altogether singular, for I have a mania for belonging to as many societies as possible: I may be said to collect clubs, and I have accumulated a vast and fantastic variety of specimens ever since, in my audacious youth, I collected the Athenaeum. At some future day, perhaps, I may tell tales of some of the other bodies to which I have belonged. I will recount the doings of the Dead Man's Shoes Society (that superficially immoral, but darkly justifiable communion); I will explain the curious origin of the Cat and Christian, the name of which has been so shamefully misinterpreted; and the world shall know at last why the Institute of Typewriters coalesced with the Red Tulip League. Of the Ten Teacups, of course I dare not say a word. The first of my revelations, at any rate, shall be concerned with the Club of Queer Trades, which, as I have said, was one of this class, one which I was almost bound to come across sooner or later, because of my singular hobby. The wild youth of the metropolis call me facetiously 'The King of Clubs'. They also call me 'The Cherub', in allusion to the roseate and youthful appearance I have presented in my declining years. I only hope the spirits in the better world have as good dinners as I have. But the finding of the Club of Queer Trades has one very curious thing about it. The most curious thing about it is that it was not discovered by me; it was discovered by my friend Basil Grant, a <b>star-gazer,</b> a mystic, and a man who scarcely stirred out of his attic.|$|E

Thus every one in Berlin wondered at the intimate [...] companionship of the profound Hegel with the late Heinrich Beer, a [...] brother of Giacomo Meyerbeer, who is universally known by his [...] reputation, and who has been celebrated by the cleverest journalists. [...] This Beer, namely Heinrich, was a thoroughly stupid fellow, and [...] indeed was afterward actually declared imbecile by his family, and [...] placed under guardianship, because instead of making a name for [...] himself in art or in science by means of his great fortune, he [...] squandered his money on childish trifles; and, for example, one day [...] bought six thousand thalers’ worth of walking-sticks.

The equally witty and [...] gifted Felix Mendelssohn once sought to explain this phenomenon, by [...] maintaining that Hegel did not understand Heinrich Beer. I now [...] believe, however, that the real ground of that intimacy consisted in [...] this—Hegel was convinced that no word of what he said was understood [...] by Heinrich Beer; and he could therefore, in his presence, give [...] himself up to all the intellectual outpourings of the moment. In [...] general, Hegel’s conversation was a sort of monologue, sighed forth [...] by starts in a noiseless voice; the odd roughness of his expressions [...] often struck me, and many of them have remained in my memory. One [...] beautiful starlight evening we stood together at the window, and I, a [...] young man of one-and-twenty, having just had a good dinner and [...] finished my coffee, spoke with enthusiasm of the stars, and called [...] them the habitations of the departed.

However, beginning astronomers are often unable to participate successfully in such events due to still-developing skills in telescope usage and celestial observing. I developed Messier Marathon Scheduler (MMS), an interactive computer program for scheduling an observing session to locate a subset of these celestial objects. MMS implements long-established algorithms to determine the locations of celestial bodies {{at any one time}} and from any location on Earth. Although there are other tools that schedule these observing sessions, none of those tools are easy for a novice astronomer to use, with features that also help advanced users. MMS provides users the option to select their level of participation, from beginner (10 naked-eye objects) to intermediate (beginner level plus 46 binocular objects) to advanced (intermediate level plus 54 telescope objects, totaling 110). With the sorting and rating choices that MMS provides, users can successfully participate in a Messier Marathon at a level appropriate to their observing skills, thereby providing the impetus to strive for a higher level of participation during the next observing attempt...|$|R
40|$|Tens {{of billions}} of dollars are spent on manned and {{unmanned}} missions probing deeper into space, while 95 % of Earth's oceans remain unexplored. The more intensive focus on space exploration is a historically recent phenomenon. For millennia until the mid- 20 th century, space and ocean exploration proceeded roughly at the same pace, driven by military and commercial interests as well as simple curiosity. Both date back to early civilization when <b>star-gazers</b> scanned the skies, and sailors and free-divers scoured the seas. Since the 1960 s, however, the trajectories of exploration diverged dramatically. Cold War-inspired geopolitical-military imperatives propelled government funding of space research to an extraordinary level, while ocean exploration stagnated in comparison. Moreover, although the Cold War ended more than 20 years ago, the disparity in research efforts remains vast despite evidence that accelerating changes in our marine ecosystems directly threatens our wellbeing. This thesis reviews the history of space and ocean exploration through the Cold War to the present. It also dispels persistent misconceptions that led to the disparity in resources allocated between space and ocean exploration and argues for prioritizing ocean research. by Grace Calvert Young.

And though to-day I am only a man of letters, either tradition errs or I was present when there landed at St. Andrews a French barber-surgeon, to tend the health and the beard of the great Cardinal Beaton; I have shaken a spear in the Debateable Land and shouted the slogan of the Elliots; I was present when a skipper, plying from Dundee, smuggled Jacobites to France after the '15; I was in a West India merchant's office, perhaps next door to Bailie Nicol Jarvie's, and managed the business of a plantation in St. Kitt's; I was with my engineer-grandfather (the son-in-law of the lamp and oil man) when he sailed north about Scotland on the famous cruise that gave us [...] "The Pirate" [...] and [...] "The Lord of the Isles"; I was with him, too, on the Bell Rock, in the fog, when the Smeaton had drifted from her moorings, and the Aberdeen men, pick in hand, had seized upon the only boats, and he must stoop and lap sea-water before his tongue could utter audible words; and once more with him when the Bell Rock beacon took a [...] "thrawe," [...] and his workmen fled into the tower, then nearly finished, and he sat unmoved reading in his Bible--or affecting to read--till one after another slunk back with confusion of countenance to their engineer.

Maeterlinck, and the poetry of Verlaine, in our own day, but differ from the religious art of Giotto and his disciples in having accepted all symbolisms, {{the symbolism of the}} ancient shepherds and <b>star-gazers,</b> that symbolism of bodily beauty which seemed a wicked thing to Fra Angelico, the symbolism in day and night, and winter and summer, spring and autumn, once so great a part of an older religion than Christianity; and in having accepted all the Divine Intellect, its anger and its pity, its waking and its sleep, its love and its lust, for the substance of their art. A Keats or a Calvert is as much a symbolist as a Blake or a Wagner; but he is a fragmentary symbolist, for while he evokes in his persons and his landscapes an infinite emotion, a perfected emotion, a part of the Divine Essence, he does not set his symbols in the great procession as Blake would have him, 'in a certain order, suited' to his 'imaginative energy.' If you paint a beautiful woman and fill her face, as Rossetti filled so many faces, with an infinite love, a perfected love, 'one's eyes meet no mortal thing when they meet the light of her peaceful eyes,' as Michael Angelo said of Vittoria Colonna; but one's thoughts stray to mortal things, and ask, maybe, 'Has her lover gone from her, or is he coming?' or 'What pre-destinated unhappiness has made the shadow in her eyes?' If you paint the same face, and set a winged rose or a rose of gold somewhere about her, one's thoughts are of her immortal sisters, Pity and Jealousy, and of her mother, Ancestral Beauty, and of her high kinsmen, the Holy Orders, whose swords make a continual music before her face. The systematic mystic is not the greatest of artists, because his imagination is too great to be bounded by a picture or a song, and because only imperfection in a mirror of perfection, or perfection in a mirror of imperfection, delight our frailty. There is indeed a systematic mystic in every poet or painter who, like Rossetti, delights in a traditional Symbolism, or, like Wagner, delights in a personal Symbolism; and such men often fall into trances, or have waking dreams. Their thought wanders from the woman who is Love herself, to her sisters and her forebears, and to all the great procession; and so august a beauty moves before the mind, that they forget the things which move before the eyes. William Blake, who was the chanticleer of the new dawn, has written: 'If the spectator could enter into one of these images of his imagination, approaching them on the fiery chariot of his contemplative thought, if ... he could make a friend and companion of one of these images of wonder, which always entreat him to leave mortal things (as he must know), then would he arise from the grave, then would he meet the Lord in the air, and then he would be happy.' And again, 'The world of imagination is the world of Eternity. It is the Divine bosom into which we shall all go after the death of the vegetated body. The world of imagination is infinite and eternal, whereas the world of generation or vegetation is finite and temporal. There exist in that eternal world the eternal realities of everything which we see reflected in the vegetable glass of nature.' ...|$|R

They throng about the captain, begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them overboard, and having first chained up the noble captain's senses with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking, they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the captain's hands into their own whether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor, pilot, able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people like or not--the possibility of this union of authority with the steerer's art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling. Now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded? Will he not be called by them a prater, a <b>star-gazer,</b> a good-for-nothing? ...|$|E
50|$|When Caspian first meets Glenstorm {{in chapter}} 6 he {{is seen as}} a powerful, serious and noble warrior. The valley trembles at the sound of his {{galloping}} hoofs. He has a broad chest and a full, flowing, golden beard. “He was a prophet and <b>star-gazer</b> and knew what they had come about,” showing his wisdom and foresight. His first words to Caspian, who has just fled from his uncle Miraz and is in no way established as king, are, “Long live the King! I and my sons are ready for war. When is the battle to be joined?” Caspian had not been intending on going to war, but the gravity and urgency of his tone sets the course of events. Although the others had no intention of going to war, Glenstorm shows his wisdom in saying, “The time is ripe. I watch the skies, for it is mine to watch. Tarva and Alambil have met in the high halls of heaven and Alambil are Narnian planets representing victory and peace and on earth a son of Adam has once more arisen to rule and name the creatures. The hour has struck. Our council at the Dancing Lawn must be a council of War.” In this speech, Glenstorm demonstrates several of the noblest features of centaurs. Firstly, he is wise and has an understanding of events and of {{what needs to be done}} in response. Secondly, he has a sense of order and propriety: he is not advocating war just because he wants to go to war or because of injustice in the land; the injustice has long been there, but Glenstorm has been waiting patiently for the time to be right. He also sees that each creature and person has his place: Glenstorm has no thought of trying to rule or lead the campaign himself (although he would clearly be well capable of it); rather he is loyal to Caspian and seeks to appoint him as the true King, because that is his place, and Glenstorm sees himself as prophet and servant. Thirdly, he shows courage and determination and an ability to motivate others. At this point in the story, Caspian’s followers are disorganized and in no way resemble an army, let alone a victorious one. Most observers would not even suggest moving towards war, but Glenstorm knows that the time for war is right and therefore moves to organize the campaign accordingly. Glenstorm’s thinking is that the time is right and therefore we must organize for war, whereas the thinking of others would be that once we are organized then the time would be right.|$|E
40|$|The {{stargazer}} mutant mouse {{is characterized}} by its ataxic gait, head tossing, and absence seizures. The mutation was identified in the gamma 2 subunit gene of the high voltage-dependent calcium channel, Cacng 2. Subsequently, two allelic variants of <b>star-gazer</b> have arisen, waggler and stargazer 3 J. In this study, we have compared these new alleles to the original stargazer allele. All three mutations affect the Cacng 2 mRNA levels as they all arise from dis-ruptions within the introns of this gene. Our {{results show that the}} mutations cause reduced Cacng 2 mRNA and protein levels. Stargazer and waggler mice have the least amount of mRNA and unde-tectable protein, whereas stargazer 3 J appears to b...|$|E
