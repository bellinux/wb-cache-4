Pedro 44 entered a left-hand climbing turn over the airfield when it crashed and burned, killing all 5 crewmembers.|$|E
40|$|Activating {{mutations}} in the {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} KIT, most notably KIT D 816 V, are commonly observed in patients with systemic mastocytosis. Thus, inhibition of KIT {{has been a major}} focus for treatment of this disorder. Here we investigated a novel approach to such inhibition. Utilizing rational drug design, we targeted the switch pocket (SP) of KIT, which regulates its catalytic conformation. Two SP inhibitors thus identified, DP- 2976 and DP- 4851, were examined for effects on neoplastic mast cell proliferation and mast cell activation. Autophosphorylation of both wild-type and, where also examined, KIT D 816 V activation was blocked by these compounds in transfected 293 T cells, HMC 1. 1 and 1. 2 human mast cell lines, and in CD 34 (+) -derived human mast cells activated by stem cell factor (SCF). Both inhibitors induced apoptosis in the neoplastic mast cell lines and reduced survival of primary bone marrow mast cells from patients with mastocytosis. Moreover, the SP inhibitors more selectively blocked SCF potentiation of Fc 92 Ì† 03 aRI-mediated degranulation. Overall, SP inhibitors represent an innovative mechanism of KIT inhibition whose dual <b>suppression</b> of <b>KIT</b> D 816 V neoplastic mast cell proliferation and SCF-enhanced mast cell activation may provide significant therapeutic benefits.
