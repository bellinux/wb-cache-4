25|$|Post-production {{took place}} in Munich and {{required}} nine months to complete, concluding {{in the third quarter}} of 2006. Film editor Alex Berner was present at all the shooting locations and was on set with Tykwer. Berner also cut dailies as filming progressed which, according to Tykwer, <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time later. Tykwer said they had to work this way due to the film's tight schedule (the European release dates had already been locked). On every night of filming, Tykwer and Griebe would take screenshots from the dailies and make notes for the film laboratory on what sort of tone and palette they wanted, and the level of brightness and contrast they wanted for the prints. A digital intermediate was used for the film. About three months was spent grading the film. Digital grading tools were used to improve the color of the lavender fields because the film crew had arrived a week early and the flowers were not in full bloom. In the scene where Grenouille murders the plum girl, selective coloring was used to take the tone of the dead body's flesh from its natural color to a pale white color.|$|E

The settings break was only valid until the end of June and therefore had an extremely limited outcome on the eventual cracking of the Enigma code, but having the weather and short signal codebooks and bigram tables made the work easier.|$|E

2500|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{powered by a}} 7-cylinder radial engine Continental R-670, {{producing}} 250 horsepower. The four rear wheels were powered and were equipped with brakes. [...] The two front wheels were steerable when driving without tracks. [...] Since the vehicle weighted only 11 tons, it could go as fast as 56km/h on its tracks and 85km/h on its wheels. Another advantage was that the external suspension components <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> space inside this small vehicle. [...] The crew consisted of the tank commander, driver, and gunner. [...] The rear wheels were attached to bogies and the construction was generally similar to commercial 3-axle trucks of the period. As a tank, it was not ideal. However, its simple and more promising design was much better received than Christie’s designs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{signing of}} Andre Rison by Green Bay {{late in the}} season had been a {{surprise}} to the league. [...] Rison had been released by two different teams {{over the past two years}} and was known as a serious disciplinary problem for skipping team meetings. [...] The previous year, the Packers had tried to sign Rison and Favre had spoken positively when a deal was not reached, stating [...] "We <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money, and a lot of heartache because he was a problem internally." [...] Rison later replied that if he were a defensive player, [...] "I'd try to break his face." [...] He also added [...] "maybe a couple of years ago, I would have said he's a hillbilly jealous of a black man making money. But now I'm at this age. No comment." ...|$|E
2500|$|DJ Kool Herc's house parties gained {{popularity}} and later moved to outdoor venues {{in order to}} accommodate more people. Hosted in parks, these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers, where [...] "instead of getting into trouble on the streets, teens now had a place to expend their pent-up energy." [...] Tony Tone, a member of the Cold Crush Brothers, stated that [...] "hip hop <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> lives". For inner-city youth, participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within America, and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture. MC Kid Lucky mentions that [...] "people used to break-dance against each other instead of fighting". Inspired by DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa created a street organization called Universal Zulu Nation, centered around hip hop, as a means to draw teenagers out of gang life, drugs and violence.|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, Bambaataa and his followers, a {{group of}} dancers, artists, and DJs, went outside the United States on the first hip hop tour. He saw that the hip hop tours would {{be the key to}} help expand hip hop and his Universal Zulu Nation. In {{addition}} it would help promote the values of hip hop that he believed are based on peace, unity, love, and having fun. [...] He brought peace to the gangs; many artists and gang members say that [...] "hip hop <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> lives." [...] His influence inspired many overseas artists like the French rapper MC Solaar. He was a popular DJ in The South Bronx rap scene and became known not only as Afrika Bambaataa but also as the [...] "Master of Records." [...] He established two rap crews: the Jazzy 5 including MCs Master Ice, Mr. Freeze, Master Bee, Master D.E.E, and AJ Les, and the second crew referred to as Soulsonic Force including Mr. Biggs, Pow Wow and Emcee G.L.O.B.E.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for Nils Ericsons sluss ("Lock of Nils Ericson") he made detailed studies and minute calculations in 1845–1846. He concluded there were insufficient stonemasons in the Stockholm area, and therefore had limestone and granite {{brought in from}} other parts of Sweden, quarries Ericson knew well from his earlier projects. He constructed a circular saw turned inwards to cut the head each stock at equal level for the bottom of the caisson, an instrument which was, like virtually all heavy tasks during the project, hand operated by several men. [...] Empty barrels were used as rafts. Ericson gave directions for all sorts of tasks, including dredging, securing the rabbeting of planks, earth fillings, and determining the inclination of the caisson walls {{in order for them to}} withstand the pressure from the levees. [...] He had to use an expensive steam dredger, but could avoid a machine for the drainage which <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money. He also made great efforts to make the extensive piling for the foundation more efficient; the drop forge of the pile driver should hit the pile with a constant effect, why Ericson had the labourers lower the device as the pile sunk. The timbered caisson was built as a huge box on Djurgården, just north-east of the bridge Lilla Sjötullsbron, slightly more than 79 meters long, 16,5 meters wide and 6,2 meters high (266½×56×21 feet), subsequently towed into place before the ends were removed. [...] The temporary drydock on Djurgården is still discernible as a depression in the landscape. The construction work on the caisson began in May 1847 with the construction of barracks for 60 men and a smithy. [...] In the drydock keel blocks [...] tall were then placed and the bottom of the caisson was built upon them [...] a bed consisting of [...] deal, [...] beams, and 1inches of boards. The caisson was completed in August, water was let in and the building berth and the barrage were removed. [...] The floating was done in two hours 2-4 a.m., and its dimensions produced enthusiastic comparisons: [...] "larger than the Stockholm Cathedral!", [...] "...could house the entire Swedish Army and its paraphernalia." ...|$|E

60|$|Sipping weak {{tea with}} lemon in it, Jolyon gazed {{through the leaves}} of the old oak-tree at that view which had {{appeared}} to him desirable for thirty-two years. The tree beneath which he sat seemed not a day older! So young, the little leaves of brownish gold; so old, the whitey-grey-green of its thick rough trunk, A tree of memories, which would live on hundreds of years yet, unless some barbarian cut it down--would see old England out at the pace things were going! He remembered a night three years before, when, looking from his window, with his arm close round Irene, he had watched a German aeroplane hovering, it seemed, right over the old tree. Next day they had found a bomb hole in a field on Gage's farm. That was before {{he knew that he was}} under sentence of death. He could almost have wished the bomb had finished him. It would have <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hanging about, many hours of cold fear in the pit of his stomach. He had counted on living to the normal Forsyte age of eighty-five or more, when Irene would be seventy. As it was, she would miss him. Still there was Jon, more important in her life than himself; Jon, who adored his mother.|$|E

Her mind is so wrapped up in this confounded fad of hers that there is no room in it for anything else. I might have been a cousin, instead of a man she had refused, for any embarrassment or awkwardness she felt at our sudden meeting. It clearly made no impression at all upon her. She remembers, of course, that she met me at Newquay. I don't suppose she has really forgotten that I asked her to be my wife, but it was a mere incident, and affected her no more than if I had asked her to buy a picture and she had refused. I wish to goodness I had not met her again. I had got fairly over it, and was even beginning to wonder how I ever could have wanted to marry anyone so different in every way from the sort of woman I fancied I should have fallen in love with. How foolish of her coming over to Paris at this time. Well, I daresay it has all <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trouble. I suppose at that time Brander would have been delighted at the prospect, {{but it would have been}} a very different thing after the failure of the bank. I don't think he would have made a pleasant father-in-law under the present circumstances. He is an old fox. I always thought so, and I think so more than ever now. It has been a queer affair altogether. I wonder what Mary thinks of it all. I suppose she will talk to me about it to-morrow afternoon. By the way, I have to go this evening with René and the others to be sworn in or attested, or whatever they call it, at the Mairie. Their report as to the officers is satisfactory. I have heard that Longfranc was an excellent officer before he came into some money, cut the army and took up art. I have no doubt he will make a good major, and he understands the men better than most army men would do. They say the Colonel is a good man, too, and was very popular with his regiment before he retired from the service." ...|$|E
