Rawmix {{in the form}} of lumps and fuel were continuously added at the top, and clinker was continually withdrawn at the bottom. Air was blown through under pressure from the base to combust the fuel. The <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln</b> had a brief period of use before it was eclipsed by the rotary kiln, but it had a limited renaissance from 1970 onward in China and elsewhere, when it was used for small-scale, low-tech plants in rural areas away from transport routes. Several thousand such kilns were constructed in China. A typical <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln</b> produces 100-200 tonnes per day.|$|E

50|$|The {{theoretical}} heat (the standard enthalpy) {{of reaction}} {{required to make}} high-calcium lime is around 3.15 MJ per kg of lime, so the batch kilns were only around 20% efficient. The key to development in efficiency was the invention of continuous kilns, avoiding the wasteful heat-up and cool-down cycles of the batch kilns. The first were simple <b>shaft</b> <b>kilns,</b> similar in construction to blast furnaces. These are counter-current <b>shaft</b> <b>kilns.</b> Modern variants include regenerative and annular kilns. Output is usually in the range 100-500 tonnes per day.|$|R

5000|$|There was a kiln in Zevenaar when it {{received}} its charter in 1487 [...] The region has large natural supplies of clay. Nijmegen had used tiles from Zevenaar since 1583.

It started with a single <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln</b> then expanded embracing new technology. In 1901 De Panoven began supplying the first machine-made roof tiles and bricks and 20 years later the first drying sheds were built. The last innovation was the zigzag kiln erected in 1926. This basically operated like a ring kiln, but could be continually fired, saving on fuel. This kiln is the sole remaining intact model in Western Europe. The business was closed in 1982.|$|E

50|$|The fuel is {{injected}} part-way up the shaft, producing maximum temperature at this point. The fresh feed fed {{in at the}} top is first dried then heated to 800 °C, where de-carbonation begins, and proceeds progressively faster as the temperature rises. Below the burner, the hot lime transfers heat to, and is cooled by, the combustion air. A mechanical grate withdraws the lime at the bottom. A fan draws the gases through the kiln, and the level in the kiln is kept constant by adding feed through an airlock. As with batch kilns, only large, graded stone can be used, {{in order to ensure}} uniform gas-flows through the charge. The degree of burning can be adjusted by changing the rate of withdrawal of lime. Heat consumption as low as 4 MJ/kg is possible, but 4.5 to 5 MJ/kg is more typical. Due to temperature peak at the burners up to 1200 °C in a <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln</b> conditions are ideal to produce medium and hard burned lime.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary kilns {{started to}} be used for lime {{manufacture}} {{at the start of the}} 20th century and now account for a large proportion of new installations if energy costs are less important. The early use of simple rotary kilns had the advantages that a much wider range of limestone size could be used, from fines upwards, and undesirable elements such as sulfur can be removed. On the other hand, fuel consumption was relatively high because of poor heat exchange compared with shaft kilns, leading to excessive heat loss in exhaust gases. Old fashioned [...] "long" [...] rotary kilns operate at 7 to 10 MJ/kg. Modern installations partially overcome this disadvantage by adding a preheater, which has the same good solids/gas contact as a <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln,</b> but fuel consumption is still somewhat higher, typically in range of 4.5 to 6 MJ/kg. In the design shown, a circle of shafts (typically 8-15) is arranged around the kiln riser duct. Hot limestone is discharged from the shafts in sequence, by the action of a hydraulic [...] "pusher plate". Kilns of 1000 tonnes per day output are typical. The rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft, medium, or hard burned as well as dead-burned lime or dolime.|$|E

An increase in the thickness of the calcinated layer affect the conditions of heat inflow into the sphere. The equilibrium calcination radius is defined, which delimits the calcination process into two zonesČ one in which the supply of heat to the reaction front limits the heat transfer from kiln gases to the stones, and another, which is limited by heat conduction through the already calcinated layer. The phenomenon of the critical sphere radius is also discussed.

40|$|As one of {{the primary}} raw {{materials}} in the construction industry, cement production consumes a great deal of resources and has various environmental effects. During the production phase in particular, different procedures play a decisive role in determining the input and output. China has become both the largest producer and the largest consumer of cement worldwide. Together, the two most common production processes in China, the <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln</b> and the NSP (New Suspension Preheater) kiln, account for more than 95 % of total production capacity. Although the proportion of NSP kilns continues to increase each year, shaft kilns are still adopted innumerous small and medium-sized enterprises due to their lower costs and quick yields. During the period of technical transformation and the emergence of continuous environmental issues, it is of great importance to quantify the metabolic processes of typical construction materials, particularly in order to conduct a comparative analysis with different production techniques. However, due to the limited availability of data, relevant studies are rare. In this paper, two typical cement enterprises with different production processes were selected in order to investigate material and energy use as well as pollutant emissions. Metabolic processes were then compared and a use efficiency analysis for different procedural phases was conducted using material flow analysis (MFA). The results are as follows: the <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln</b> requires more raw materials, such as limestone, clay, and coal, per unit product The efficiency of energy consumption (including electric power consumption and overall energy consumption) is also lower for the <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln</b> than for the NSP kiln. As for environmental emissions, the <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln</b> emits more SO 2, CO 2, NOX, and dust per unit product than the NSP kiln and has higher eco-environmental impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|In {{the second}} major phase of mining in the Upper Harz from 1524, {{smelting}} was gradually moved into fixed sites. The transportation of logs as rafts {{and the use of}} water power led to the selection of advantageous sites on the rivers in the Harz - such as the Innerste, Grane and Oker. At one location that had already been used in medieval times (1180), the Frankenscharrn Hut emerged, which later became the Clausthal Lead Smelting Works (Bleihütte Clausthal), the most famous one in the Upper Harz. It was worked until 31 December 1967. Other important smelters were the silver works (Silberhütte) in Lautenthal (later merged with the Bleihütte Clausthal), the silver works in Altenau (to 1911) and the Andreasberg Silver Works (Silberhütte Andreasberg, to 1912). After the Upper Harz metal works were closed the ores of the remaining Grund Ore Mine were reduced in the Upper Harz works (to 1981) and finally in the Binsfeldhammer Lead Works near Aachen. The various metalworks, especially the Clausthal Works left behind considerable environmental damage. By contrast, the buildings and facilities in the Upper Harz have completely disappeared. From the first mining period until just before the industrial age the so-called precipitation method (Niederschlagsarbeit) was used in the Upper Harz. Instead of the usual roasting (desulphurising) of the ore, the slag was melted using charcoal with granulated iron (Eisengranalien) as a reduction medium using the roast-reaction process (Röst-Reaktions-Verfahren) (direct conversion from metal sulphide to metal) in arched kilns (Krummofen). The comparatively low kiln temperatures of around 1000 °C produced no liquid slag, the residue (gangue) remained in solid form. Not until the development of more powerful fan <b>shaft</b> <b>kilns</b> around 1850 were the concentrates roasted in double-deck ovens (Etagenöfen) and sintering pans and then melted in crucible <b>shaft</b> <b>kilns</b> (Tiegelschaftofen) on silver-containing argentiferous lead (Werkblei) and molten slag. The argentiferous lead was initially worked immediately in the German tests on lightened silver. At the start of the 20th century a multi-stage refining process was carried out in Kesselherden and silver extracted using the Parkes process.|$|R

40|$|During the {{operation}} of certain older types of annular shaft kilns used for lime burning, one may encounter the dilemma of how to operate the kiln at an optimal air excess ratio. Due to excessively high temperatures in the combustion chambers at optimal air excess ratio, the flame must be cooled witha greater amount of relatively cold secondary air. This results in greaterheat loss with the exhaust kiln gas (stack losses), greater fuel consumption and lower kiln efficiency. The effects of increasing air excess ratio {{during the process of}} lime burning in an annular <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln</b> are specifically analysed. The paper presents a case of a remodelled annular shaftkiln, in which the air excess ratio can be reduced to its optimal level by recirculation of recuperator waste gas and its injection into the combustion chambers. This also reduces stack losses, while the temperatures inthe combustion chambers remain within the permissible range, which means that the specific energy consumption for lime burning is reduced...|$|E

Vertical Shaft kilns such as those operating at the reference magnesia plant are known to be efficient. However, the knowledge of thermal processes and physical behaviours inside the operating kiln has not yet been studied in detailed.

40|$|Annular shaft kilns with {{opposite}} burners (OBASK) {{has been}} widely adopted due to the advantages of cost saving and easy controlling. Nonetheless, compared with the traditional annular <b>shaft</b> <b>kiln,</b> the OBASK is not favorable in terms of thermal performance and energy efficiency. Aiming to improve the thermal performance, a comprehensive energy and exergy analysis of an OBASK has been conducted based on the actual operational data obtained from on-site measurements. For making a thorough thermal analysis of the OBASK, special attentions have been focused in considering magnesium decomposition reaction and moisture in limestone in the methodology. The energy and exergy efficiencies are determined to be 63. 6 % and 35. 7 %, respectively. The exergy destruction is 44. 0 % of total exergy input of which fuel combustion causes 56. 6 % of the exergy destruction. Furthermore, the effects of CaO and moisture contents in limestone on energy and exergy efficiencies are analyzed. The results have demonstrated the potential energy saving of the OBASK and identified three proposed energy conservation measures. Improvement and effect of the three proposed measures on the thermal performance are verified via further analysis...|$|E
50|$|The {{beginnings}} of smelting {{go back to}} the start of mining in the Upper Harz in the Early Middle Ages. In medieval metallurgy, so-called nomadic smelting (Wanderverhüttung) predominated. The smelting sites were only used for a few weeks and followed the logging of the requisite wood. For the charcoal that was needed for the reduction of the ore, oak and beech wood were especially well-suited. The billets of wood were located near the smelting sites. The low <b>shaft</b> <b>kilns</b> (Schachtöfen) were built of natural rock and earth from the vicinity, and were by no means simple in their construction. They could only be used for a few days of continuous furnace campaign. Fixed buildings were not erected. Over 200 slag sites and smelting sites have been archaeologically recorded from this smelting period. Since the 1980s the mining archaeology team of Lothar Klappauf and Friedrich-Albert Linke have carried out excavations and undertaken a considerable amount of archeological and archaeometallurgical research. The high medieval smelting technology of the 10th to 12th centuries at the Rammelsberg was well established and complex. The wood dweller (Silvani), i.e. those who were doing the smelting in the woodlands, were able to produce copper, lead and silver from the poly-metallic ores of the Rammelsberg.|$|R

The most important of these branching off to the south are a street leading to the former railway station and another leading to the former mill. In the area around the mill, nowadays known as Medardusquelle (“Saint Medardus’s Spring”), a bridge crosses the river Glan, which leads to the few houses that stand on the river’s right bank, and also to the sporting ground and to lands used for agriculture and forestry. Here on the right bank, two <b>shaft</b> <b>kilns</b> for making quicklime, in operation between 1820 and 1900, are preserved.
