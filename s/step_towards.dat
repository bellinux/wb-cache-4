Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E

5|$|On July 8, 1862 Wilson {{drafted a}} measure that {{authorized}} the President to enlist African Americans who had been held in slavery and were deemed competent for military service, and employ them to construct fortifications and carry out other military-related manual labor, the first <b>step</b> <b>towards</b> allowing African Americans to serve as soldiers. President Lincoln signed the amendment into law on July 17. Wilson's law paid African Americans in the military $10 monthly, which was effectively $7 a month after deductions for food and clothing, while white soldiers were paid effectively $14 monthly.|$|E

5|$|Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first <b>step</b> <b>towards</b> NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opinion in}} Texas was divided. Editorials in the United States began advocating {{complete}} independence for Texas. After several men staged a minor revolt against customs duties in Anahuac in June, local leaders began {{calling for a}} public meeting {{to determine whether a}} majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a <b>step</b> <b>towards</b> revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15.|$|E
5|$|The Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia (now the Eurasian Customs Union) {{came into}} {{existence}} on 1 January 2010.

It was launched as a first <b>step</b> <b>towards</b> forming a broader single market inspired by the European Union, with the objective of forming an alliance between former Soviet states. The member states planned to continue with economic integration and were set to remove all customs borders between each other after July 2011.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinction}} between coast-assault battleship and cruising battleship became blurred with the , ordered in 1880. These ships reflected developments in ironclad design, being protected by iron-and-steel compound armour rather than wrought iron. Equipped with breech-loading guns of between 12-inch and 16 ¼-inch (305mm and 413mm) calibre, the Admirals continued {{the trend of}} ironclad warships towards gigantic weapons. The guns were mounted in open barbettes to save weight. Some historians see these ships as a vital <b>step</b> <b>towards</b> pre-dreadnoughts; others view them as a confused and unsuccessful design.|$|E
5|$|With its {{capacity}} for aggressive action greatly diminished {{as a result}} of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua.

5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first <b>step</b> <b>towards</b> recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E

5|$|By 1835 {{the idea}} of {{building}} a railway from Glasgow into Ayrshire gained sufficient support for a survey to be commissioned from John Miller, {{a partner in the}} firm of Grainger and Miller, which had been heavily involved in the earlier railways in the west of Scotland. Miller proposed a route from Tradeston, in Glasgow {{at the south end of}} Glasgow Bridge, through Paisley and the Garnock Valley to Kilwinning and Ayr, with a branch from Dalry to Kilmarnock. The cost was to be £550,000 and a 10% return could be expected; notwithstanding the south-westerly course of the line, it was foreseen as a first <b>step</b> <b>towards</b> linking with railways in England.|$|E
5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of Chancery was the first <b>step</b> <b>towards</b> becoming a barrister.

He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{with the}} United Kingdom were tense, as American {{fishermen}} felt menaced by the British navy's increasing enforcement of Canadian waters. Marcy completed a trade reciprocity agreement with British minister to Washington, John Crampton, which {{would reduce the}} need for aggressive coastline enforcement. Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first <b>step</b> <b>towards</b> the American annexation of Canada. While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada–US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence. Gaining the advantage over Britain in the region was a key part of Pierce's expansionist goals.|$|E
