Also according to the Smith papyrus (1700 BC) it was used in wound healing: “Thou shouldst bind [the wound] with fresh meat the first day [and] treat afterwards with grease, honey [and] lint every day until he recovers. ” HONEY FOR WOUND HEALING UNDER HOME CONDITIONS Besides scientifically based use of honey in wound care in hospitals (see next <b>section),</b> <b>honey</b> {{can also be used}} under home conditions, as it was used for many centuries. Although sterilised honey is only used in hospitals, raw honey can also be used under home conditions without any risk, as no adverse effects have been reported. Indeed, Prof. Descotte lectured in several Apitherapy conferences that his team has used raw honey routinely for wound care in hundreds of cases in the hospital of Limoge, France. Application of honey for wound healing under home conditions, after 5 It is not necessary to disinfect wound because honey will disinfect it 1. Apply honey as much honey on a gauze or clean cotton cloth as it is necessary to cover wound fully. Gauze and cloth need not be sterile. 2. Abscesses, cavity or deep wounds need more honey to adequately penetrate deep into the wound tissues. The wound bed should be filled with honey before applying the honey dressing pad. 3. Change bandage once a day. When doing it, wound need not be cleaned from honey. Honey is „dissolved “ in the wound or sticks to the gauze. 4. When changing the bandage remove hornification at the border of the wound with a pincette. This can be done under running water or with a soft tooth brush. Cell debris, which were not removed will not disturb healing process. 5. After cleaning, wound should be padded with as much gauze as is needed for drawing the wound liquid. 6. If wound is infected by yeast or it heals badly, a mixture of honey-betadine 1 : 1 can be used...|$|E

To reveal whether the observed differences in performance between contract producers, cooperative producers and spot-market producers are attributable to the different coordination channels, a more profound econometric analysis is needed.|$|R

5000|$|The National hive, as {{it usually}} known, {{is based on}} the same {{principles}} as other Langstroth designs: a vertical stack of modular components. The original specification and the associated Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food leaflet detail a floor (now often superseded by an open-mesh floor which allows monitoring of Varroa infestation), stand, 'deep' boxes (actually not 'deep', but standard brood boxes), shallow <b>honey</b> supers, a <b>section</b> rack (for production of <b>sections</b> of comb <b>honey),</b> a crownboard, and a roof. The main boxes are 18⅛" [...] (460mm) squares in footprint: the standard brood boxes being 8⅞" [...] (225mm) tall, and the shallow super 5⅞" [...] (150mm) tall. The main walls are ¾" [...] (19mm) thick.Because the boxes are square, it is possible to stack them in two orientations above the floor (that is, with respect to the entrance). The orientation of the moveable frames within the boxes, then, can be either aligned with the entrance block ('warm way'), or perpendicular to it ('cold way'). The frames are supported on runners on two sides of the box, in a deep rebate formed by the two-piece construction of the sides.|$|R
40|$|The Technical Working Group (TWG) for Cotton is {{the third}} one of the European Coexistence Bureau (ECoB) and is {{established}} for elaboration of the coexistence issues between genetically modified (GM) cotton cultivation and non-GM cotton and honey production in the EU. The present technical report analysed the possible sources for potential cross-pollination with GM cotton and adventitious admixture of GM cotton material such as seeds and pollen and presents consensually agreed by TWG for Cotton best practices for coexistence. The terms of reference for this review are presented in Section 1. The scope of the Best Practice Document is coexistence in cotton production in the EU. It includes the coexistence between GM cotton cultivation and honey production but excludes coexistence in seed production. The ECoB TWG for Cotton held two meetings in October 2014 and April 2015 and examined the state-of-the-art from scientific literature, research projects and empirical evidence provided by existing studies for segregation in cotton production looking at the factors determining the cross-pollination rates in cotton {{as well as other}} sources of admixture of GM material in conventional cotton harvests and EU-produced honey. The review of this information (coming from a total of 194 references) is presented in a structured manner in Sections 5 and 6 of this document. Finally, the TWG for Cotton reviewed the up todate approaches for the detection and identification of traces of GM cotton material in non-GM cotton harvests and <b>honey</b> (<b>Section</b> 7). The TWG for Cotton of the ECoB, based on the analysis of the evidence summarised in this document submitted proposals for best management practices, which form the ground the agreed consensus recommendations presented in Section 8, complemented by ex-ante view about their economic impact (Section 9).

40|$|This thesis explores {{writing about}} food as a {{creative}} way to communicate ideas. Perhaps {{more than any other}} genre, food writing memoir with recipes is a genre that addresses both vast and specific interrelationships between people and places. These memoirs highlight thoughts and feelings regarding cultural differences, cultural similarities, politics, personal experiences (both from childhood and adult life), family relationships, romantic relationships, caretaking, definitions of home, personal identity, and how that identity fits in with humanity as a whole. There are two parts to this thesis. The first part situates the project into a broader survey of food’s role in the writing world. A narrative of food’s presence in writing leads into an introduction to the well-known food writer M. F. K. Fisher, a brief history of the recipe, then discussion of how best to define food writing. Theorized using ideas from Roland Barthes’s “Toward a Psychosociology of Contemporary Food Consumption,” the section will move into theorizing food as language, looking at how, as Lynn Z. Bloom posits, food writing uses the language of food to welcome readers into whatever story is being told. Part One will conclude with a warning regarding the way writing about diverse foods could contribute to cultural appropriation. Part Two begins with an introduction that briefly mentions an array of food writing memoir with recipes and introduces the two memoirs I will focus on: Annia Ciezadlo’s Day of Honey and Diana Abu-Jaber’s The Language of Baklava. The rest of Part Two is broken into two sections, the first discussing Day of Honey and the second discussing The Language of Baklava. The Day of <b>Honey</b> <b>section</b> draws attention to connections made between food and love, and food and war. The Language of Baklava section highlights food’s role in relationships and cultural identity. Both sections explore the effect the recipes have on the narration, how they serve as objective story anchors and as ways for the authors to communicate directly with their readers. Together the two parts of this thesis show that, because food is connected to living, it influences all aspects of life. Furthermore, just as food can bring people together, food writing memoir with recipes has the potential to connect people by sharing life experiences through the rhetoric of food...|$|R
40|$|The Technical Working Group (TWG) for Maize of the European Coexistence Bureau (ECoB) {{analysed}} in 2010 {{the best}} practices for coexistence between GM maize crop production with non-GM maize. In this document {{the analysis is}} extended to the coexistence between GM maize crop production and honey production in the EU. The TWG assessed if any further coexistence measure to those currently recommended in the previous document was required to limit adventitious presence of GM maize pollen in honey avoiding economic loses for producers. The terms of reference for this review are presented in Section 1. An overview {{of the structure of}} the honey-producing sector in Europe is given in Section 2. The EcoB TWG maize held two meetings in June and November 2012 and examined state-of-art-knowledge from scientific literature, study reports and empirical evidence provided by numerous finished and ongoing studies looking at the factors determining the presence of pollen in general or maize pollen (even specifically GM maize pollen) in samples of EU produced honey. In addition to biological factors (related to honeybee behaviour and maize pollen characteristics) the TWG also analysed existing mandatory quality standards that impact the eventual presence of pollen in commercial honey. The review of this information (coming from a total of 132 references) is presented in a structured manner in Section 3 of this document. Finally, the TWG reviewed the state of the art and possibilities for the detection and identification of traces of GM maize pollen in <b>honey</b> (<b>Section</b> 4). The analysis of existing information indicates that total pollen presence in honey ranges between 0. 003 to 0. 1 % in weight. Considering the share of maize pollen in total pollen found in honey, the extrapolated figures for maize pollen in honey would be around an order of magnitude lower. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that studies aiming at the detection/identification of this trace-levels of maize pollen are usually carried out with morphological identification and counting of pollen grains, and that a routine DNA analysis based on validated PCR protocol able to quantify total pollen in honey is unavailable. Once such a method could be found, the maize pollen fraction as well as the GM-pollen fraction of the total pollen could be established. In conclusion, the TWG maize of the ECoB, based on the analysis of the evidence summarised in this document concludes that no changes in the Best practice document on maize coexistence of July 20101 are necessary to ensure that adventitious presence of GM maize pollen in honey is far below legal labelling thresholds and even below 0. 1 %.
