50|$|The AC50 class yachts {{used in the}} America's Cup {{competition}} {{have four}} positions (on each <b>side)</b> for <b>grinders.</b> These must be continuously operated to generate the hydraulic pressure needed by the yacht's controls. Until 2017, the machinery was arm operated winches. However, in 2017 Team New Zealand changed their grinding system to pedal operated positions similar to exercise bikes. This change reportedly gained a 40% increase in power delivered to the hydraulic system.|$|R

5000|$|The Telegraph of 25 February 2006 praised Glendower Street {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{beautiful}} in Monmouth, singling out its [...] "charming townhouses." [...] Glendower Street is home to a number of listed buildings, some of the most notable including an award-winning residence converted from a chapel, an apartment building that has seen use first as a gymnasium and then as a museum, and a blue plaque building on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. Glendower Street is located within the medieval walls of Monmouth that were built around 1300 and are shown on Speed's map of the town (pictured). In the medieval and post-medieval period, extending into the mid 19th century, Glendower Street was referred to as Grinder Street or Grinders Street. In 1804, author Charles Heath indicated that Monmouth was formerly divided into four parochial wards: Wye Bridge Ward, Castle Bailey Ward, Monnow Street Ward, and Over Monnow Ward. Glendower Street was split between two of the wards, with Castle Bailey Ward containing the left <b>side</b> of <b>Grinder</b> Street and Monnow Street Ward containing the right <b>side</b> of <b>Grinder</b> Street. The street now bears the anglicised version of the name of Welsh leader Owen Glendower (Owain Glyndŵr). Glendower Street extends to the southeast from the intersection of Agincourt Street and St John's Street. In 1960, the Monmouthshire County Council ordered that the two streets at the west end of Glendower Street both be made one-way streets, such that traffic proceeded on Agincourt Street from Agincourt Square to Glendower Street (west to east), and traffic proceeded on St John's Street from Glendower Street to Monnow Street (east to west). Since the Coflein listings, there has been at least a partial renumbering of the buildings on Glendower Street (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Wheels {{sometimes}} need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, {{and then}} the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed on the left <b>side</b> of the <b>grinder</b> from the operator's viewpoint, with wheel rotation [...] "toward" [...] the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas {{on the other side}} the nut is right-handed. [...] "In other words, to remove the nut, it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation." [...] Holding the wheel against the wrench's turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is {{on either side of the}} wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel flange from bearing directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) on the flange. The wheel's inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a bushing (sleeve) to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves gently tapping it with a fingernail or tool handle (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell's ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "hoarse" [...] sound (failing to [...] "sing") indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the ring test, the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel flanges, and nut are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, {{and then the}} grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.|$|R
