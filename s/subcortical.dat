5|$|The {{input to}} the {{hippocampus}} (from varying cortical and <b>subcortical</b> structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and <b>subcortical</b> structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|The living {{brain is}} very soft, having a gel-like {{consistency}} similar to soft tofu. The cortical layers of neurons constitute {{much of the}} brain's grey matter, while the deeper <b>subcortical</b> regions of myelinated axons, make up the white matter.|$|E
5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and <b>subcortical</b> network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and <b>subcortical</b> dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain <b>subcortical</b> regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the <b>subcortical</b> motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subcortical</b> aphasias {{characteristics}} and symptoms {{depend upon the}} site and size of <b>subcortical</b> lesion. Possible sites of lesions include the thalamus, internal capsule, and basal ganglia.|$|E
25|$|Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) {{images are}} the most sensitive. In about 24% of cases DWI shows only {{cortical}} hyperintensity; in 68%, cortical and <b>subcortical</b> abnormalities; and in 5%, only <b>subcortical</b> anomalies.|$|E
25|$|Higher Activation of <b>Subcortical</b> Limbic Regions. A 1998 {{study showed}} higher {{activation}} of <b>subcortical</b> limbic regions of {{two groups of}} reactive and proactive murderers, especially in the more “emotional” right hemisphere of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Patients with <b>subcortical</b> band heterotopia (another {{disorder}} {{associated with}} pachygyria) typically have milder symptoms and their cognitive function is {{closely linked to}} the thickness of the <b>subcortical</b> band and the degree of pachygyria present.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive ability {{correlates}} with {{the thickness of}} any <b>subcortical</b> band present {{and the degree of}} pachygyria.|$|E
25|$|Should neurons {{follow an}} {{abnormal}} migration during development possible cortical malformations include classical lissencephaly (as stated above) and <b>subcortical</b> band heterotopia with an agyria-pachygyria band spectrum.|$|E
25|$|The {{striatum}} is a <b>subcortical</b> structure generally {{divided into}} the dorsal striatum and ventral striatum, although a medial lateral classification {{has been suggested}} to be more relevant behaviorally and is being more widely used.|$|E
25|$|Classical lissencephaly, {{also known}} as type I or {{generalized}} agyria-pachygyria, is a severe brain malformation of a smooth cerebral surface, abnormally thick (10-20mm) cortex with four layers, widespread neuronal heterotopia, enlarged ventricles, and agenesis or malformation of the corpus callosum. Classical lissencephaly can range from agyria to regional pachygyria and is usually present along with <b>subcortical</b> band heterotopia (known as ‘double cortex’ to describe the circumferential bands of heterotopic neurons located beneath the cortex). <b>Subcortical</b> band heterotopia is a malformation slightly different from lissencephaly that is now classified under the agyria-pachygyria-band spectrum because it consists of a gyral pattern consistent with broad convolutions and an increased cortical thickness.|$|E
25|$|Many {{researchers}} {{focus on}} the brain to explain aggression. Numerous circuits within both neocortical and <b>subcortical</b> structures {{play a central role}} in controlling aggressive behavior, depending on the species, and the exact role of pathways may vary depending on the type of trigger or intention.|$|E
25|$|Thalamic {{convergence}} {{suggests that}} referred pain {{is perceived as}} such due to the summation of neural inputs in the brain, {{as opposed to the}} spinal cord, from the injured area and the referred area. Experimental evidence on thalamic convergence is lacking. However, pain studies performed on monkeys revealed convergence of several pathways upon separate cortical and <b>subcortical</b> neurons.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{difficulties}} {{that must be}} addressed in this model. First, it must provide a mechanism for the integration of signals across different brain regions (both cortical and <b>subcortical).</b> It must also be able to explain the simultaneous processing of unrelated signals that are held separate from one another and integrated signals that must be viewed as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Though {{invasive}} tracer {{studies are}} largely not possible in humans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography {{studies have also}} been used to map the connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex to cortical and <b>subcortical</b> brain structures. Connections in the human orbitofrontal cortex follow a conserved pattern, similar to what is shown in tracer studies in rhesus macaques, but with a distinct pattern of connectivity with regions of the striatum.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Meyer loosely {{defined the}} Cajal–Retzius cells {{as the family}} of Reln-immunoreactive neurons in the {{marginal}} zone of the hippocampus, as so to settle {{a difference between the}} pioneer neurons, Reln-negative preplate derivatives that settle in the same area and project to the <b>subcortical</b> area that he had already described in 1998. He also described simpler cells with simpler morphologies in the marginal zone of rodents.|$|E
25|$|Tracer {{studies in}} monkeys {{have shown that}} the orbitofrontal cortex shares {{extensive}} connections with other association cortices, primary sensory and association cortices, limbic systems, and other <b>subcortical</b> areas. Corticocortical connections include extensive local projections to and from other prefrontal regions, as well as with motor, limbic, and sensory cortices. Areas projecting to motor areas are densely interconnected with other prefrontal cortical regions, reflecting integration for executive motor control.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in amygdalar CB1 receptor binding following imipramine treatment {{is consistent with}} prior studies which collectively demonstrate that several treatments which are beneficial to depression, such as electroconvulsive shock and tricyclic antidepressant treatment, increase CB1 receptor activity in <b>subcortical</b> limbic structures, such as the hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. And preclinical studies have demonstrated the CB1 receptor {{is required for the}} behavioral effects of noradrenergic based antidepressants but is dispensable for the behavioral effect of serotonergic based antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Melodic Intonation Therapy is used {{to treat}} non-fluent aphasia and {{has proved to be}} {{effective}} in some cases. However, there is still no evidence from randomized controlled trials confirming the efficacy of MIT in chronic aphasia. MIT {{is used to}} help people with aphasia vocalize themselves through speech song, which is then transferred as a spoken word. Good candidates for this therapy include left hemisphere stroke patients, non-fluent aphasias such as Broca's, good auditory comprehension, poor repetition and articulation, and good emotional stability and memory. It has been hypothesized that MIT is effective because prosody and singing both rely on areas of the right hemisphere; it may be these right-hemisphere areas that are recruited for natural speech production after intensive training. An alternative explanation is that the efficacy of MIT depends on neural circuits involved in the processing of rhythmicity and formulaic expressions (examples taken from the MIT manual: “I am fine,” “how are you?” or “thank you”); while rhythmic features associated with melodic intonation may engage primarily left-hemisphere <b>subcortical</b> areas of the brain, the use of formulaic expressions is known to be supported by right-hemisphere cortical and bilateral <b>subcortical</b> neural networks.|$|E
25|$|Delta is the {{frequency}} range up to 4nbsp&Hz. It {{tends to be}} the highest in amplitude and the slowest waves. It is seen normally in adults in slow-wave sleep. It is also seen normally in babies. It may occur focally with <b>subcortical</b> lesions and in general distribution with diffuse lesions, metabolic encephalopathy hydrocephalus or deep midline lesions. It is usually most prominent frontally in adults (e.g. FIRDA – frontal intermittent rhythmic delta) and posteriorly in children (e.g. OIRDA – occipital intermittent rhythmic delta).|$|E
25|$|Additional <b>subcortical</b> {{projections}} {{are shared}} between the striatum, particularly ventral reward-related areas,. Connectivity with thalamic and periaqueductal grey areas further suggests {{a role for}} the orbitofrontal cortex in both inhibitory and excitatory regulation of autonomic function. Parallel processing loops in connectivity between cortico-striatal networks seem {{to be involved in}} the processing of goal-directed and habitual action, whereas cortico-limbic connectivity seems to be of prime importance for action selection, implicating the basolateral amygdala, and the integration of information into behavioral output.|$|E
25|$|Theta is the {{frequency}} range from 4nbsp&Hz to 7nbsp&Hz. Theta is seen normally in young children. It {{may be seen}} in drowsiness or arousal in older children and adults; it can also be seen in meditation. Excess theta for age represents abnormal activity. It {{can be seen as a}} focal disturbance in focal <b>subcortical</b> lesions; it can be seen in generalized distribution in diffuse disorder or metabolic encephalopathy or deep midline disorders or some instances of hydrocephalus. On the contrary this range has been associated with reports of relaxed, meditative, and creative states.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that testosterone influences brain areas that control behavioral reactions. Studies in animal models indicate that aggression is affected by several interconnected cortical and <b>subcortical</b> structures within the so-called social behavior network. A study involving lesions and electrical-chemical stimulation in rodents and cats revealed that such a neural network consists of the medial amygdala, medial hypothalamus and periaqueductal grey (PAG), and it positively modulates reactive aggression. Moreover, a study done in human subjects showed that prefrontal-amygdala connectivity is modulated by endogenous testosterone during social emotional behavior.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a visual}} cortex in each {{hemisphere}} of the brain, {{much of which}} {{is located in the}} Occipital lobe. The left hemisphere visual cortex receives signals mainly from the right visual field and the right visual cortex mainly from the left visual field, although each cortex receives a considerable amount of information from the ipsilateral visual field as well. The visual cortex also receives information from <b>subcortical</b> regions, such as the lateral geniculate body, located in the thalamus. However, ample evidence indicates that object identity and location are preferentially processed in ventral (occipito-temporal) and dorsal (occipito-parietal) cortical visual streams, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The higher brain {{works by}} {{regulating}} <b>subcortical</b> processes. High placebo responses link with enhanced dopamine and mu-opioid {{activity in the}} circuitry for reward responses and motivated behavior of the nucleus accumbens, and, on the converse, anti-analgesic nocebos responses were associated with deactivation {{in this part of}} the brain of dopamine and opioid release. (It has been known that placebo analgesia depends upon the release in the brain of endogenous opioids since 1978.) Such analgesic placebos activation changes processing lower down in the brain by enhancing the descending inhibition through the periaqueductal gray on spinal nociceptive reflexes, while the expectations of anti-analgesic nocebos acts in the opposite way to block this.|$|E
25|$|With {{the use of}} {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET), {{research has shown that}} brain regions active during translation are outside classical language areas. Translating from L1 to L2 and vice versa activates the anterior cingulate and bilateral <b>subcortical</b> structures (i.e. putamen and head of caudate nucleus). This pattern is explained in terms of the need for greater coordination of mental operations. More specifically, automated circuits are favoured over cerebral pathways for naming words. Language switching is another task in which brain activation is high in Broca's area and the supramarginal gyrus. This was originally observed by Poetzl, (1925, 1930) and Leischner, (1943)—all of whom reported that patients with supramarginal lesions were defective in switching languages.|$|E
25|$|The endocannabinoid system {{appears to}} play a {{significant}} role in the mechanism of action of clinically effective and potential antidepressants and may serve as a target for drug design and discovery. The endocannabinoid-induced modulation of stress-related behaviors appears to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of the serotoninergic system, by which cannabinoid CB1 receptors modulate the excitability of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons. Data suggest that the endocannabinoid system in cortical and <b>subcortical</b> structures is differentially altered in an animal model of depression and that the effects of chronic, unpredictable stress (CUS) on CB1 receptor binding site density are attenuated by antidepressant treatment while those on endocannabinoid content are not.|$|E
25|$|Anterograde amnesia {{is a loss}} of {{the ability}} to create new {{memories}} after the event that caused the amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. This is in contrast to retrograde amnesia, where memories created prior to the event are lost while new memories can still be created. Both can occur together in the same patient. To a large degree, anterograde amnesia remains a mysterious ailment because the precise mechanism of storing memories is not yet well understood, although it is known that the regions involved are certain sites in the temporal cortex, especially in the hippocampus and nearby <b>subcortical</b> regions.|$|E
25|$|One {{study done}} by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to {{investigate}} serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{to measure the}} serotonin 2A receptor availability. When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD {{were found to have}} lower receptor availability as well as lower <b>subcortical</b> perfusion and hypothalamic availability. The results of this study provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs. Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct validity for this study, which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.|$|E
25|$|Substantial {{damage to}} tissue {{anywhere}} {{within the region}} shown in blue on the figure below can potentially result in aphasia. Aphasia can also sometimes be caused by damage to <b>subcortical</b> structures deep within the left hemisphere, including the thalamus, {{the internal and external}} capsules, and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia. The area and extent of brain damage or atrophy will determine the type of aphasia and its symptoms. A very small number of people can experience aphasia after damage to the right hemisphere only. It has been suggested that these individuals may have had an unusual brain organization prior to their illness or injury, with perhaps greater overall reliance on the right hemisphere for language skills than in the general population.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Andreas Vesalius and Francesco Piccolomini {{were the}} first to {{distinguish}} between white matter, the cortex, and the <b>subcortical</b> nuclei in the brain. About a century later, Thomas Willis noticed that the corpus striatum was typically discolored, shrinkened, and abnormally softened in the cadavers of people who had died from paralysis. The view that the corpus striatum played such a large role in motor functions was the most prominent one until the 19th century when electrophysiologic stimulation studies began to be performed. For example, Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig performed them on dog cerebral cortices in 1870, while David Ferrier performed them, along with ablation studies, on cerebral cortices of dogs, rabbits, cats, and primates in 1876. During the same year, John Hughlings Jackson posited that the motor cortex was more relevant to motor function than the corpus striatum after carrying out clinical-pathologic experiments in humans. Soon it would be discovered that the theory about the corpus striatum would not be completely incorrect.|$|E
25|$|The {{vascular}} arterial system supplying {{fresh blood}} branches into {{smaller and smaller}} vessels as it enters the brain surface and within-brain regions, culminating in a connected capillary bed within the brain. The drainage system, similarly, merges into larger and larger veins as it carries away oxygen-depleted blood. The dHb contribution to the fMRI signal is from both the capillaries near the area of activity and larger draining veins that may be farther away. For good spatial resolution, the signal from the large veins needs to be suppressed, since it does not correspond to {{the area where the}} neural activity is. This can be achieved either by using strong static magnetic fields or by using spin-echo pulse sequences. With these, fMRI can examine a spatial range from millimeters to centimeters, and can hence identify Brodmann areas (centimers), <b>subcortical</b> nuclei such as the caudate, putamen and thalamus, and hippocampal subfields such as the combined dentate gyrus/CA3, CA1, and subiculum.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} ventral pathway being {{important}} for visual processing, {{it is also}} important for processing auditory information. During processing, when sound waves enter the ear, this information is transduced into an unanalyzed auditory object. The <b>subcortical</b> auditory pathway then relays the information to the auditory cortex in the dorsal superior temporal gyrus (dSTG). In the dSTG, it is then divided into its constituent phones. These phones are then recognized into phonetic words in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). The information first enters the ventral stream at the posterior middle temporal gyrus and the posterior inferior temporal sulcus p(MTG+ITS). Here the auditory words are converted into semantic words. These words are then converted into a semantic phrase by the first combinatorial net at the anterior portion of the middle temporal lobe and then converted into a syntactic noun phrase at the second combinatorial net. This second combinatorial net is location in the anterior inferior temporal gyrus.|$|E
