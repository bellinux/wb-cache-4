At this time, the eight processes considered to be the most likely candidates for oxygen production on the moon are: ilmenite reduction with H 2, CO, and CH 4, glass reduction with H 2, molten silicate <b>electrolysis,</b> <b>fluxed</b> molten silicate <b>electrolysis,</b> vapor pyrolysis, and ion plasma pyrolysis...|$|R
50|$|The {{modern economy}} of the town {{is based on the}} {{economic}} assets of the region historically. Though it is normal to think of steel works in connection with extensive, flat sites and the proximity of coal, here iron-working began before the use of coal for the purpose was practical. The forest was needed to provide charcoal. The river in its steep bed provided power. There was plenty of limestone for <b>smelting</b> <b>flux</b> and some ferruginous limestone, though how useful that will have been as ore is not clear. (Compare Red Mountain, Birmingham, Alabama). Another consideration is the fact that Champagnole is so to speak, just over the hill from La Tène, the centre of late Iron Age culture. See La Tène culture.|$|R
50|$|The main {{application}} of synthetic cryolite is as a solvent (or <b>flux)</b> for <b>electrolysis</b> of aluminium oxides such as bauxite. The conversion of aluminium oxides into metallic aluminium {{requires that the}} metal ions be dissolved {{so that they can}} accept the electrons provided in the electrolysis cell. A mixture of cryolite and some aluminium trifluoride is that solvent. Unlike typical solutions, this one requires temperatures approaching 1000 °C to melt.Sodium aluminium hexafluoride is also used as a pesticide. Other uses include a whitener for enamels and an opacifier for glass.|$|R

25|$|Earth's {{atmospheric}} circulation pattern requires westerly meteorological observations for prediction of weather conditions to the east. Weather observation stations in Greenland improved {{the accuracy of}} weather forecasting for the Atlantic Ocean and northern Europe for tactical advantage {{in the battle of}} the Atlantic and European theatre of World War II. Greenland had been part of the Danish colonial empire since 1814. Greenland appeared relatively unprotected following German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940. The Allies of World War II became concerned about the possibility of Axis military bases on Greenland. The cryolite mine at Ivittuut was a strategically important source of <b>flux</b> for <b>electrolysis</b> of aluminum ores by the Hall–Héroult process for aircraft production.|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{elaborated}} for {{the determination of}} the content of gold and silver in geological samples by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) in combination with the fire assay method. The weight of sample used for analysis was 10 g. Sulphur present as sulphide, which is an undesirable element in smelting, was removed by the addition of iron to the charge. The sample was <b>smelted</b> with <b>fluxes</b> and lead oxide to replace the silver and gold by lead and to transfer non-precious elements to slag. Lead was separated from precious metals by cupellation. The separated silver and gold alloy was dissolved with aqua regia with addition of hydrochloric acid in excess. Silver and gold were determined from the same solution. For determination of the silver content, the AAS method with an air-acetylene flame was used. Gold was determined in a graphite furnace {{with the addition of a}} matrix modifier in an argon current, at an atomization temperature of t = 2200 °C. The lower determination limit for silver was 0. 05 g/t and for gold 0. 005 g/t. The results of the analysis for silver and gold obtained with the proposed method showed good agreement with the results of the analysis of the same samples with the fire assay method...|$|R
40|$|Generation of {{iron ore}} fines needs {{sintering}} and pelletization before its {{being used in}} blast furnace /iron ore reduction. Further huge deposit of non coking coal has compelled Iron and Steel Industries to use these coals after gasification. Carbon dioxide gas coming out as flue gas is source of air pollution. In the present study, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the reduction behavior of CO/ CO 2 produced after gasification of high ash non coking coal with flue gas coming out from a furnace under isothermal condition through statistical design of experiments. It was observed that degree of reduction increases with increase in temperature, time and concentration of CO in CO/CO 2 mixture. Temperature has strongest effect followed by time and concentration of CO in CO/CO 2 mixture. The produced syn gas is used for <b>smelting</b> purpose then <b>flux</b> requirement to the process will be decreased because the ash of coal will not enter into the smelting furnace. In this way high ash non coking coal will be used in iron and steel industry for reduction and smelting purpose...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityMagnesium is {{the least}} dense {{engineering}} metal, with an excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio. Magnesium recycling is important for both economic and environmental reasons. This project demonstrates feasibility of a new environmentally friendly process for recycling partially oxidized magnesium scrap to produce very pure magnesium at low cost. It combines refining and solid oxide membrane (SOM) based oxide electrolysis in the same reactor. Magnesium and its oxide are dissolved in a molten flux. This is followed by argon-assisted evaporation of dissolved magnesium, which is subsequently condensed in a separate condenser. The molten flux acts as a selective medium for magnesium dissolution, but not aluminum or iron, and therefore the magnesium collected has high purity. Potentiodynamic scans are performed to monitor the magnesium content change in the scrap {{as well as in}} solution in the <b>flux.</b> The SOM <b>electrolysis</b> is employed in the refining system to enable electrolysis of the magnesium oxide dissolved in the flux from the partially oxidized scrap. During the SOM electrolysis, oxygen anions are transported out of the flux through a yttria stabilized zirconia membrane to a liquid silver anode where they are oxidized. Simultaneously, magnesium cations are transported through the flux to a steel cathode where they are reduced. The combination of refining and SOM electrolysis yields close to 100 % removal of magnesium metal from partially oxidized magnesium scrap. The magnesium recovered has a purity of 99. 6 w%. To produce pure oxygen it is critical to develop an inert anode current collector for use with the non-consumable liquid silver anode. In this work, an innovative inert anode current collector is successfully developed and used in SOM electrolysis experiments. The current collector employs a sintered strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 Mn 03 -δ or LSM) bar, an Inconel alloy 601 rod, and a liquid silver contact in between. SOM electrolysis experiments with the new LSM-Inconel current collector are carried out and performance comparable to the state-of-the-art SOM electrolysis for Mg production employing the non-inert anode has been demonstrated. In both refining and SOM electrolysis, magnesium solubility in the flux plays an important role. High magnesium solubility in the flux facilitates refining. On the other hand, lower magnesium solubility benefits the SOM electrolysis. The dissolution of magnesium imparts electronic conductivity to the flux. The effects of the electronic conductivity of the flux on the SOM electrolysis performance are examined in detail through experiments and modeling. Methods for mitigating the negative attributes of the electronic conductivity during SOM electrolysis are presented...|$|R
