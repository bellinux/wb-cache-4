5|$|More or {{less the}} Scottish answer to American bands like Interpol and the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, with their du-jour cool and deft {{combination}} of insular art flair and dance-floor populism, was hailed by British hype machine New Musical Express as {{the dawn of a}} new rock revolution. The band's blue-blazered appeal, however, started to slip after 2009's overly serious concept album Tonight: Franz Ferdinand. Four years later, the zeitgeist may prefer its rock stars with <b>suspenders</b> and banjos, but Franz Ferdinand's Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is an unapologetically swaggering disco-rock album that refuses to overstay its welcome.|$|E
5|$|The video {{features}} Bieber dancing along several dance crews along a black backdrop, and a {{scene with}} ninjas and a flame outline. The video begins with Bieber dancing with different {{members of the}} crews with use of a spotlight effect, followed by Bieber being flaunted by a single female dancer. Then the video cuts to Bieber performing Stepping (African-American)-style choreography with two male dancers, shirtless with red hats and red <b>suspenders.</b> With the aid of smoke, the video moves to Bieber dancing with Beat Freaks. Usher sings his verse along with The Syrenz as dancers {{in a room with}} metal chandeliers before uniting with Bieber dancing in the scene aided by Poreotics. Then Bieber and Usher sing and dance with Medea Sirkas in ninja attire in front of a background of Chinese calligraphy ("Love") and flames, before returning to the black backdrop and metal chandeliers as Bieber dances with Simrin Player and LXD in a scene with bookbags. The ending features Bieber and several of the dancers featured performing group choreography before cutting to Bieber and Usher with the in front of the calligraphy and flames.|$|E
25|$|A {{suspension}} bridge {{is a type}} of bridge in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical <b>suspenders.</b> The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century. Simple {{suspension bridge}}s, which lack vertical <b>suspenders,</b> have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} closed between May and July 1987 after three <b>suspender</b> cables (connecting the deck to the {{overhead}} suspension cable) failed. All of the <b>suspender</b> cables were X-rayed during the closure, {{and the three}} <b>suspender</b> cables, along with three neighboring <b>suspender</b> cables were replaced, with some damage noted to all <b>suspender</b> cables. A draft root cause investigation identified the potential for fatigue and corrosion damage in the overhead suspension cables. The final root cause concluded in 1990 that the <b>suspender</b> cables had failed in fatigue {{at the top of}} the socket connector to the bridge deck. Since the fatigue was caused by swaying in the overhead suspension cables relative to the bridge deck, all <b>suspender</b> cables were potentially vulnerable to fatigue failure. The most cost-effective repair that would maintain the aesthetic appearance of the current structure was complete replacement of the <b>suspender</b> cables on a periodic basis (estimated at 20-25 years).|$|R

25|$|On a {{conventional}} suspension bridge, sections of deck are hung {{in place and}} so immediately tension the <b>suspenders.</b> The proper initial length of each suspender is predetermined by engineering calculations and adjustments are required for segment relative positioning and equality of load distribution amongst the several <b>suspenders</b> of the section. On this bridge, the deck sections were already in a fixed relative position (being joined together and resting upon the falsework) and all suspender cables must be brought to specific tensions individually in order to tension the main cable. A jacking saddle on the western end is used to balance the tension among the sections of the single main cable.|$|E
25|$|Field service uniform (Felddienstuniform) – The summer field uniform {{for both}} {{officers}} and enlisted {{consisted of a}} jacket and trousers in Strichtarn, a dark-brown (later a forest green) raindrop camouflage pattern on a stone-gray background; a field cap, service cap, or steel helmet; high black boots; and a gray webbing belt with y-strap <b>suspenders.</b> In winter, a quilted stone gray padded suit without a camouflage pattern was worn over the service uniform. Later winter uniforms were also of the same camouflage pattern as the summer variant. The winter uniform also included a fur pile cap or a steel helmet, boots, knitted gray gloves, belt, and <b>suspenders.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At {{specific}} {{points along}} the main cable (each being the exact distance horizontally {{in relation to the}} next) devices called [...] "cable bands" [...] are installed to carry steel wire ropes called <b>Suspender</b> cables. Each <b>suspender</b> cable is engineered and cut to precise lengths, and are looped over the cable bands. In some bridges, where the towers are close to or on the shore, the <b>suspender</b> cables may be applied only to the central span. Early <b>suspender</b> cables were fitted with zinc jewels and a set of steel washers, which formed the support for the deck. Modern <b>suspender</b> cables carry a shackle-type fitting.|$|R
25|$|Two {{versions}} of <b>suspender</b> were also produced. The first medals, including the dated ones, had a straight <b>suspender</b> that was {{wide enough to}} accept the 38 millimetres (1½ inches) wide ribbon. The <b>suspender</b> was changed to a narrower width in 1875, to accept a new 32 millimetres (1¼ inches) wide ribbon. Both types of <b>suspender</b> were swiveling and were affixed to the medal {{by means of a}} double-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For the {{arrangement}} of <b>suspender</b> and arch rib in the combination of beam and arch bridge, the finite element model is established according to the background of practical engineering. The influence of the variations of structure design parameters on structure characteristics of the static and dynamic is analyzed. The calculation {{results show that the}} different layout of <b>suspender</b> has small effect on the axial force variations of tie beam and arch rib, but has bigger influence on the bending moment of partial section. The structural transverse basic frequency augments with increase of arch rib leaning-angle, the vertical and twisting basic frequency is larger when the leaning <b>suspender</b> and netted <b>suspender</b> are used. The arrangement of <b>suspender</b> and arch rib should be optimized in the design of similar bridge...|$|R

25|$|Some {{dry suits}} are {{provided}} with internally attached <b>suspenders</b> which when hooked over the shoulders, will hold the trouser section up when the top part of the suit {{has not yet been}} fully dressed into by the diver, this is also convenient if the suit is partly removed between dives for comfort. The <b>suspenders</b> also help to keep the trousers fully lifted if the torso of a membrane suit is a little long to provide enough space for the diver to bend the torso comfortably when in use. If the crotch hangs too low it encumbers the legs when finning, and increases the risk of the feet pulling out of the boots in an inversion.|$|E
25|$|Curtis removed parasols, <b>suspenders,</b> wagons, {{and other}} traces of Western {{material}} culture {{from many of}} his images. In his photogravure In a Piegan Lodge, published in The North American Indian, Curtis retouched the image to remove a clock {{between the two men}} seated on the ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{medal and}} ribbon <b>suspender</b> were struck separately {{and attached to}} {{each other with a}} small ring, which enabled the medal to swing. Later versions were struck in one piece, with the <b>suspender</b> {{as an integral part of}} the medal, as depicted.|$|R
25|$|As {{a bundle}} is laid down, it was {{initially}} supported by supports {{mounted on the}} catwalk, then both ends were attached and the cable is tensioned at the eastern anchor points. As with a conventional cable suspension span, all of the tensioned bundles were then compressed into a circular shape and protected with a circular wrap of wire. Saddles for <b>suspender</b> cables were added and <b>suspender</b> cables placed and tensioned. The <b>suspender</b> cable tensioning lifted the span from its supporting falsework.|$|R
25|$|Starting in 2011, {{proper balance}} between main cable runs and <b>suspender</b> cables and proper tension {{were applied to}} the main and <b>suspender</b> cables. On November 20, 2012, this process was {{completed}} which made the SAS portion of the bridge self-supporting. After that, the falsework was removed.|$|R

25|$|In {{response}} to the punk fashion of the mid-late 1970s, there was {{a throwback to the}} late 1950s Ivy League style. This revival came to be definitively summarized in an enormously popular paperback released in 1980: The Official Preppy Handbook. Popular preppy clothing for men included Oxford shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, polo shirts with popped collars, khaki slacks, argyle socks, dress pants, Hush Puppies Oxford shoes, brogues, <b>suspenders,</b> seersucker or striped linen suits, corduroy, and cable knit sweaters that were often worn tied around the shoulders.|$|E

25|$|The {{design on}} the reverse has {{remained}} virtually unaltered through all versions of the medal. Generally speaking, the two early Queen Victoria versions with a wide <b>suspender</b> had a slightly different reverse with a larger flag at the masthead of the ship, while the later narrow <b>suspender</b> and subsequent versions had a more triangular flag.|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of a long-range guided wave inspection technique called “magnetostrictive sensor (MsS) ” for inspection of <b>suspender</b> ropes was field-evaluated on the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in New York City. From a test location above the sidewalk of the bridge, a pulse of 10 -kHz longitudinal guided waves was launched {{along the length}} of the <b>suspender</b> and the reflected signals from geometric features and defects in the <b>suspender</b> were detected without requiring any paint removal. The test results showed that, from a single test location and without scanning the sensor along the rope, the MsS technique could examine the entire length of the <b>suspender</b> rope (from the socket to the main cable including the region over the main cable band) that was up to more than 100 -meters (330 -feet) long. The field tests indicated therefore that the MsS technique has good potential for providing a very cost- and performance-effective method of inspecting <b>suspender</b> ropes including areas that are remote and difficult to access, such as the socket end of the rope below the sidewalk and the region over the main cable band...|$|R
25|$|The Auguste face base makeup {{color is}} a {{variation}} of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and <b>suspenders</b> often characterize Auguste costumes.|$|E
25|$|Black tie {{trousers}} {{traditionally have}} no cuffs (turn-ups in British English) or belt loops. The outer seams are usually {{decorated with a}} single braid of silk or a material that matches the lapel facing. Traditionally, braces (<b>suspenders),</b> hidden by the waistcoat, are used to support the trousers. Belts should not ever be worn with black tie trousers. Evening trousers can be flat-fronted or pleated today; pleats first coming into fashion in the 1930s. Whilst flat-fronted trousers are more fashionable at present, pleated trousers may be considered more comfortable by men who have wider hips and a narrow waist.|$|E

His later self-destructive interrogation at the hands of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels all but sealed his fate. He was found the next day hanged in his cell by his <b>suspenders,</b> after he had complained about German military personnel molesting the actresses and made disparaging remarks about the German war effort.|$|E
