5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson <b>Seedless</b> grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, <b>seedless</b> table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson <b>Seedless.</b> It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson <b>Seedless.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{wildlife}} monitoring organization, WildTrack, started using JMP with the Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) system to identify individual endangered animals by their footprints. In 2009, the Chicago Botanic Garden used JMP to analyze DNA data from tropical breadfruit. Researchers {{determined that the}} <b>seedless,</b> starchy fruit {{was created by the}} deliberate hybridization of two fruits, the breadnut and the dugdug. The Herzenberg Laboratory at Stanford has integrated JMP with the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). The FACS system is used to study HIV, cancer, stem-cells and oceanography.|$|E
5|$|Clementine cake is a cake {{prepared}} with clementine fruit {{as a primary}} ingredient and other typical cake ingredients. Additional ingredients can be used, and some preparation variations exist. It can be prepared using whole or peeled clementines that have been manually-seeded, or <b>seedless</b> fruit may be used. It may provide significant amounts of Vitamin D. It can be topped with a sweet glaze or sauce, powdered sugar, honey and clementines or candied clementines. Its origin may be roughly based upon an orange cake developed by the Sephardi Jews. In popular culture, the cake played a minor part in {{the plot of the}} 2013 film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.|$|E
5|$|The cake can be {{prepared}} with clementines and/or clementine zest mixed in the batter, with them atop the cake, such as in slices, and in both ways. The seeds and membrane of the clementine can be removed {{as part of the}} preparation process, or <b>seedless</b> clementines can be used. Whole, sliced clementines including the peel, or peeled clementines can be used, and the clementines can be cooked before being used in the cake batter. The fruit can be chopped or blended using a food processor. Candied clementines can be used atop the cake or as a garnish. The almonds used can be toasted or blanched.|$|E
5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' <b>seedless</b> banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, <b>seedless</b> triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{sources of the}} {{seedlessness}} trait, and essentially all commercial cultivators get it from one of three sources: Thompson <b>Seedless,</b> Russian <b>Seedless,</b> and Black Monukka, all being cultivars of Vitis vinifera. There are currently {{more than a dozen}} varieties of <b>seedless</b> grapes. Several, such as Einset <b>Seedless,</b> Benjamin Gunnels's Prime <b>seedless</b> grapes, Reliance, and Venus, have been specifically cultivated for hardiness and quality in the relatively cold climates of northeastern United States and southern Ontario.|$|E
25|$|In some situations, {{polyploid}} {{crops are}} preferred {{because they are}} sterile. For example, many <b>seedless</b> fruit varieties are <b>seedless</b> {{as a result of}} polyploidy. Such crops are propagated using asexual techniques, such as grafting.|$|E
25|$|Seedlessness is an {{important}} feature of some fruits of commerce. Commercial cultivars of bananas and pineapples are examples of <b>seedless</b> fruits. Some cultivars of citrus fruits (especially grapefruit, mandarin oranges, navel oranges), satsumas, table grapes, and watermelons are valued for their seedlessness. In some species, seedlessness {{is the result of}} parthenocarpy, where fruits set without fertilization. Parthenocarpic fruit set may or may not require pollination, but most <b>seedless</b> citrus fruits require a stimulus from pollination to produce fruit.|$|E
25|$|The Jaffa orange (also {{known as}} Shamouti orange) {{is a popular}} almost <b>seedless</b> orange variety with a tough skin that makes it {{particularly}} suitable for export.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seedless</b> {{bananas and}} grapes are triploids, and {{seedlessness}} {{results from the}} abortion of the embryonic plant that is produced by fertilization, a phenomenon known as stenospermocarpy, which requires normal pollination and fertilization.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{varieties}} {{include the}} very productive Early Golden, the productive John Rick, Miller, Woolbright and the Ennis, a <b>seedless</b> variety. Another nickname of the American persimmon, 'date-plum' also {{refers to a}} persimmon species found in South Asia, Diospyros lotus.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} Pedro Ximénez is an offspring variety of the Arabic table grape Gibi and a half sibling to Alarije. In 2007, it was also confirmed that the table grape Corinto bianco was a <b>seedless</b> mutation of Pedro Ximénez.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{crossing}} between Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo occurred {{is not known}} with some believing the cross happened in Tuscany while other ampelographers suggesting it may have happened in southern Italy. Evidence for this latter theory is the proliferation of <b>seedless</b> mutations of Sangiovese, known under various synonyms, throughout various regions of southern Italy including Campania, Corinto nero which is grown {{on the island of}} Lipari just north of Sicily and Tuccanese from the Puglia region in the heel of the Italian boot. In Campania, among the many <b>seedless</b> mutations of Sangiovese still growing in the region are Nerello from the commune of Savelli, Nerello Campotu from the commune of Motta San Giovanni, Puttanella from Mandatoriccio and Vigna del Conte.|$|E
25|$|A sultana was {{originally}} a raisin made from Sultana grapes of Turkish origin (known as Thompson <b>Seedless</b> in the United States), {{but the word}} is now applied to raisins made from either white grapes or red grapes that are bleached to resemble the traditional sultana.|$|E
25|$|Diospyros virginiana grows through , in well-drained soil. In summer, {{this species}} {{produces}} fragrant flowers which are dioecious, so one must have {{both male and}} female plants to obtain fruit. Most cultivars are parthenocarpic (setting <b>seedless</b> fruit without pollination). The flowers are pollinated by insects and wind. Fruiting typically begins when the tree is about 6 years old.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seedless</b> cultivars {{now make}} up the {{overwhelming}} majority of table grape plantings. Because grapevines are vegetatively propagated by cuttings, the lack of seeds does not present a problem for reproduction. It is an issue for breeders, who must either use a seeded variety as the female parent or rescue embryos early in development using tissue culture techniques.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{reliable}} statistics that break down grape production by variety. It {{is believed that}} the most widely planted variety is Sultana, also known as Thompson <b>Seedless,</b> with at least 3,600km2 (880,000 acres) dedicated to it. The second most common variety is Airén. Other popular varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Grenache, Tempranillo, Riesling, and Chardonnay.|$|E
25|$|Today, navel oranges {{continue}} to be propagated through cutting and grafting. This {{does not allow for}} the usual selective breeding methodologies, and so all navel oranges can be considered fruits from that single, nearly two-hundred-year-old tree: they have exactly the same genetic make-up as the original tree and are, therefore, clones. This case {{is similar to that of}} the common yellow <b>seedless</b> banana, the Cavendish, or that of the Granny Smith apple. On rare occasions, however, further mutations can lead to new varieties.|$|E
25|$|In 1787, Bligh took {{command of}} Bounty. In {{order to win}} a premium offered by the Royal Society, he first sailed to Tahiti to obtain breadfruit trees, then set course for the Caribbean, where breadfruit was wanted for {{experiments}} to see {{whether it would be}} a successful food crop for slaves there. The notion that breadfruit had to be collected from Tahiti was intentionally misleading. Tahiti was merely one of many places where esteemed <b>seedless</b> breadfruit could be found. The real reason for choosing Tahiti {{has its roots in the}} territorial contention that existed between France and England at the time. The Bounty never reached the Caribbean, as mutiny broke out on board shortly after the ship left Tahiti.|$|E
500|$|Thomcord is a <b>seedless</b> {{table grape}} variety and a hybrid of the popular Thompson <b>Seedless</b> or Sultanina grape (a Vitis vinifera variety) and Concord grape (a Vitis labrusca variety). [...] Thomcord was {{developed}} in 1983 by Californian grape breeders working for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{as part of a}} test to better understand a new <b>seedless</b> grape breeding procedure.|$|E
500|$|Thomcord is {{suitable}} for hot, dry growing conditions, more so than Concord and other Concord <b>seedless</b> types. [...] Its adaptability to hot dry climates was derived from Thompson <b>Seedless.</b> [...] It grows well in California's vineyards, particularly the San Joaquin Valley, just like Thompson <b>Seedless.</b> [...] The plant is tolerant of (but not resistant to) powdery mildew, and is less susceptible to the fungus than Ruby <b>Seedless,</b> but more susceptible than Mars, Venus, Niabell, and Cayuga White varieties. [...] The fungus can affect its leaves, stems, rachis (stem of the grape cluster), and berries. [...] The grape ripens in the summer (mid-season), between late July and mid-August.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{has been}} called a [...] "sentimental favorite" [...] at farmers' markets, it is not {{expected}} to become a major commercial variety because its flavor is not as neutral as more popular grapes, such as Thompson <b>Seedless,</b> Crimson <b>Seedless,</b> or Flame <b>Seedless.</b> [...] However, Ramming predicted that it would become a specialty item, much like the Muscat varieties, due to its distinctive, Concord-like flavor. [...] Because of its strong reception at farmers' markets, it could compete with Concord and Niabell varieties in eastern markets, according to Ramming.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, {{research}} horticulturist David W. Ramming and technician Ronald L. Tarailo—Californian grape breeders {{working for}} the ARS, the chief scientific research agency of the USDA—crossed Thompson <b>Seedless</b> and Concord in order to answer a technical question about a newly developed procedure for breeding novel, superior <b>seedless</b> grapes. [...] The researchers wanted to demonstrate that plants created from embryo culture were derived from fertilized eggs (zygotic) instead of the maternal tissue (somatic). [...] From 1231emasculations (removal of male flower parts to control pollination) of Thompson <b>Seedless,</b> the researchers produced 130ovules using embryo rescue procedures. [...] From these, 40embryos developed and three seedlings were planted. [...] The original seedling of Thomcord was planted in 1984 in plots in cooperation with California State University, Fresno. [...] It was later selected in 1986 by Ramming and Tarailo and tested in the San Joaquin Valley under the name A29-67, and was introduced as [...] "Thomcord." ...|$|E
500|$|Compared with Thompson <b>Seedless,</b> the berry {{weight and}} {{diameter}} of Thomcord are larger, but cluster tightness is similar. [...] The berry length ranged between [...] and the diameter ranged from [...] in tests between 2001 and 2002. [...] The berries weigh between , averaging [...] in 2002, {{which is on}} par with Venus, but heavier than Sovereign Coronation, {{and even more so}} than Thompson <b>Seedless.</b> [...] The fruit's size has not been shown to increase appreciably by girdling the vines or by applying gibberellic acid when the berries set.|$|E
500|$|Its aromatic, [...] "labrusca" [...] {{flavor is}} similar to that of Concord, but mellowed by the mild, sweet taste from Thompson <b>Seedless.</b> [...] Thomcord grows well in hot, dry climates, ripens between late July and mid-August, and tolerates powdery mildew. [...] It is a {{productive}} variety, yielding an average of [...] of grapes per vine, but has produced as much as [...] per vine in grower trials. [...] The berries weigh between [...] and have a medium-thick, blue-black skin that adheres to the fruit, unlike Concord, which has a thick skin that can slip off the pulp easily. [...] The aborted seeds in the fruit body are relatively small, but larger than those in Thompson <b>Seedless.</b>|$|E
500|$|Thomcord is a {{productive}} variety, with a yield comparable to Thompson <b>Seedless.</b> [...] When two cordons (arms) of the vines are trained horizontally on wires ("bilateral-trained") and are pruned to remove {{most of the}} previous year's growth ("spur-pruned") during the winter, it can produce up to [...] per vine, or an average of [...] [...] In 2002, cane-pruned vines of Thomcord were significantly more productive than Sovereign Coronation and were comparable to the Venus variety, averaging [...] per vine. [...] Unlike Thompson <b>Seedless,</b> which has its cluster size thinned as a normal production practice, Thomcord's is not thinned because of its smaller cluster size. [...] The grape clusters range in weight between [...] and average , have medium to slightly loose tightness (or are [...] "well-filled", meaning the individual pedicels are not easily visible), and have a conical shape with a small wing.|$|E
500|$|The new hybrid {{was tested}} and {{scrutinized}} for 17years {{before it was}} declared ready for growers and gardeners and was released on [...] [...] Around 2008, trials outside of California were just beginning. [...] Thomcord quickly became a hit at farmers' markets while it was being tested, and it {{has appeared in the}} fresh-fruit section at supermarkets. This continued the long-standing success of the ARS' grape-breeding research in California, which has developed {{some of the most popular}} <b>seedless</b> grapes on the market as well as red, white, and black grapes varieties for hobbyists and professional growers since 1923.|$|E
500|$|The aborted {{seeds of}} Thomcord are small, {{but in some}} years they can become sclerified (a {{thickening}} and lignification of the walls of plant cells and the subsequent dying off of the protoplasts), making them more noticeable inside the medium-soft flesh. [...] There are usually two aborted seeds per berry, which averaged between 14 and 22.3mg in 2001 and 2002. [...] This varied in comparison to Venus depending on the year and location, was comparable to the Sovereign Coronation, and was significantly smaller than the Sovereign Rose and Saturn varieties. [...] However, as with the other cultivars, it was consistently larger than Thompson <b>Seedless,</b> which had the smallest aborted seeds.|$|E

500|$|A {{well known}} {{occurrence}} of disease susceptibility in crops lacking diversity concerns the 'Gros Michel', a <b>seedless</b> banana that saw world marketing in the 1940s. [...] As the market demand became high {{for this particular}} cultivar, growers and farmers began to use the Gros Michel banana almost exclusively. [...] Genetically, these bananas are clones, {{and because of this}} lack of genetic diversity, are all susceptible to a single fungus, Fusarium oxysporum (Panama disease); large areas of the crop were destroyed by the fungus in the 1950s. 'Gros Michel' has been replaced by the current main banana on the market, the 'Cavendish', which in turn is (2015) at risk of total loss to a strain of the same fungus, 'Tropical Race 4'.|$|E
500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} 02:58UTC (7:28a.m. Iran Standard Time), {{while many of}} the estimated 60 million Iranians affected were in their homes.

At least 261 people were killed, 1,500 injured, and 25,000 left homeless. An earlier death toll was reported as 500, but this number was believed to be inflated once it became known that some of the severely injured had been mistaken for dead. Most of the dead were women, children and the elderly, as many of the men were working in local vineyards. Over 20 aftershocks were recorded, with magnitudes up to 5.1 on the moment magnitude scale.
