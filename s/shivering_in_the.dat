25|$|Ondine bears a {{resemblance}} to The Little Mermaid. The story derives from Fouqué's novella Undine, {{the tale of}} a water-nymph who marries a mortal. Similar to other 19th century fairy tales, the plot is based on man (Palemon) encountering the supernatural (the water nymph Ondine), but the outcome is rather different from many of the 19th century classics: here, it is the man that dies, and the female character survives. Ondine makes her first entrance from a fountain, <b>shivering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold air as we would in water. She meets the hero, Palemon, and is astonished when she feels his heartbeat as she doesn't possess a heart. Palemon deserts Berta, whom he has been courting, and decides to marry Ondine. During a particularly strong storm while at sea, Ondine is lost overboard. Palemon survives the shipwreck created by the angry Ondines and believing Ondine is lost ends up marrying Berta. Ondine returns and is heartbroken when she discovers Palemon's unfaithfulness. When she kisses him, he dies and she brings his body back into the sea with her forever.|$|E

40|$|Background: Shivering {{associated}} with neuraxial anesthesia {{is a common}} problem that is uncomfortable for patients; it is of unknown ethnology and has no definite treatment. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the effects of warm intrathecal bupivacaine stored at 23 °C and cold intrathecal bupivacaine stored at 4 °C on shivering during delivery under spinal anesthesia. Methods: Seventy-eight parturient women scheduled for nonemergency cesarean delivery were enrolled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study and separated into 2 groups. The standard group received 10 mg of heavy bupivacaine 0. 5 % stored at room temperature (23 °C) plus 10 μg of fentanyl intrathecally (warm group), and the case group received 10 mg of heavy bupivacaine 0. 5 % stored at 4 °C plus 10 μg of fentanyl intrathecally (cold group). Data collection, including sensory block level, blood pressure, core temperature, and shivering intensity, was first performed every minute for 10 min, then every 5 min for 35 min and, finally, every 10 min until the sensory level receded to L 4. Results: There were no differences between <b>the</b> 2 groups <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of bleeding, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, neonatal Apgar, and incidence of vomiting. The incidence and intensity of <b>shivering</b> decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warm group (P= 0. 002). Conclusion: Warming of solutions can reduce the incidence and intensity of <b>shivering</b> <b>in</b> parturient candidates for cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Background: Post- and intra-operative {{shivering}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} complications of spinal anesthesia so recommend a suitable drug with at least complications for prevention and control of postoperative shivering. This current study aimed to compare the preventive effect of hydrocortisone on intra- and post-operative <b>shivering</b> <b>in</b> patients undergoing surgery with spinal anesthesia. Materials and Methods: In a clinical trial study, ninety patients who candidate for surgery with spinal anesthesia were selected and randomly divided into three groups. The first and second groups were received 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg hydrocortisone, respectively, and the third group was received normal saline, and postoperative shivering was compared between the three groups. Results: The investigation of the incidence of inter- and post-operative <b>shivering</b> <b>in</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three groups revealed that within the study period, 31 patients suffered from shivering among which 9, 5, and 17 cases were in 1 mg/kg hydrocortisone group, 2 mg/kg hydrocortisone group, and placebo group, respectively, and according to the Chi-square test, the difference among the three groups was significant (P = 0. 004). Conclusion: According to the obtained results, the overall conclusion of the study is that using hydrocortisone at least with the dose of 1 mg/kg as a preventive drug reduced the incidence of intra- and post-operative shivering with spinal anesthesia...|$|R

40|$|Human {{adaptation}} to repeated short term exposure to cold {{appears to be}} characterised by a decreased shivering threshold and unchanged sweating threshold, producing a widening of the inter-threshold zone (1). As a consequence, deep body temperature may fall more rapidly in cold habituated individuals on exposure to cold.

Although a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metabolic response to cold is probably the most widely and frequently reported alteration with cold habituation <b>in</b> humans (3), <b>the</b> nature of this attenuation remains unclear. It may be caused by a change <b>in</b> either <b>the</b> threshold for the onset of <b>shivering,</b> or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sensitivity (gain) of the shivering response, or both.

40|$|Reviews on {{whole body}} human cold {{adaptation}} {{generally do not}} distinguish between population studies and dedicated acclimation studies, leading to confusing results. Population studies show that indigenous black Africans have reduced <b>shivering</b> thermogenesis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold and poor cold induced vasodilation in fingers and toes compared to Caucasians and Inuit. About 40, 000 y after humans left Africa, natives in cold terrestrial areas seems to have developed not only behavioral adaptations, but also physiological adaptations to cold. Dedicated studies show that repeated whole body exposure of individual volunteers, mainly Caucasians, to severe cold results in reduced cold sensation but no major physiological changes. Repeated cold water immersion seems to slightly reduce metabolic heat production, while repeated exposure to milder cold conditions shows some increase in metabolic heat production, in particular non-shivering thermogenesis. In conclusion, human cold adaptation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of increased metabolism and insulation seems to have occurred during recent evolution in populations, but cannot be developed during a lifetime in cold conditions as encountered in temperate and arctic regions. Therefore, we mainly depend on our behavioral skills to live <b>in</b> and survive <b>the</b> cold...|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> Japanese {{flounder}} (Paralichthys olivaceus), {{a typical}} <b>shivering</b> behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metamorphosing larvae called the Ω (Ohm) -posture is often observed; it disappears after {{the transition from}} the larval to juvenile stage, coinciding with the onset of aggressive behavior. From previous studies, I hypothesized that there is a positive correlation between the Ω-posture and aggressive behavior. A rearing experiment using individual otolith markings by ALC (Alizarin complexone) was conducted. On day 21 after hatching (metamorphosing stage), 200 fish showing Ω-posture (Ω fish) were labeled with ALC and another 200 fish (non-Ω fish) were not labeled before being transferred into the same tank and reared until day 58 (juvenile stage). Reverse sets of 200 otolith-labeled non-Ω fish and 200 otolith-unlabeled Ω fish were reared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same manner. From behavioral observation of a total of 100 juveniles, I found a social rank with three categories: dominants, intermediates and subordinates, with the body sizes of the former being the largest. There was a positive correlation between Ω-posture and aggressive behavior as was revealed by checking the otolith label. Therefore, the Ω-posture is defined as a precursor behavior of aggression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metamorphosing stage, indicating that we can predict the aggression of juveniles in this species by their behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metamorphosing stage...|$|R
