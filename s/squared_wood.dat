5000|$|The {{production}} of lumber, lengths of <b>squared</b> <b>wood</b> {{for use in}} construction, begins with the felling of trees and the transportation of the logs to a sawmill.|$|E
30|$|For {{estimating}} tree MOE, a {{model with}} velocity <b>squared,</b> <b>wood</b> density, and taper as predictors is recommended. For estimating MOE of boles and logs, models with velocity squared and wood density are recommended. The models have an accuracy, {{as determined by}} RMSE, of about[*]±[*] 2  GPa.|$|E
30|$|Predictive mixed-effects {{models of}} tree, bole, and log MOE were {{developed}} {{using data from}} 139 trees. Fixed effects comprised combinations of velocity <b>squared,</b> <b>wood</b> density, acoustic MOE (derived from the wave equation), diameter, height, taper, and age. Random effects comprised site, plot, and, at the log level, tree. The models were validated {{using data from the}} remaining trees and compared using multiple performance metrics.|$|E
5000|$|A {{measure of}} 100 varas by 100 varas (Spanish) is almost 7000 square meters, {{and is known}} {{traditionally}} throughout Latin America as a manzana (i.e., a [...] "city block"). As well, lumber is still measured in Costa Rica using a system based on 4 vara, or 11 feet, for both round and <b>square</b> <b>wood.</b> With <b>square</b> <b>wood,</b> using inches, the width is multiplied by the depth to get a measurement which they call pulgadas, or inches.
