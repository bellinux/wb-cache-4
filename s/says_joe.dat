"Simcha has no {{credibility}} whatsoever," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Joe</b> Zias, who was {{the curator}} for anthropology and archeology at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem from 1972 to 1997 and personally numbered the Talpiot ossuaries. [...] "He's pimping off the Bible … He got this guy Cameron, who made Titanic or something like that—what does this guy know about archeology? I am an archeologist, but if I were {{to write a book}} about brain surgery, you would say, 'Who is this guy?' People want signs and wonders. Projects like these make a mockery of the archeological profession." ...|$|E

6000|$|... --Nannan's going too, <b>says</b> <b>Joe.</b> The league {{told him}} to ask a {{question}} tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.|$|E

5000|$|... 'I am not <b>saying</b> <b>Joe</b> {{would have}} won but I am saying they forced him {{to do some things}} that weren't in his game plan. He didn't box the best I have seen him box but scoring makes a {{difference}} to the tactics and those had to be changed because of the scoring.

These young fellows,' he added, turning to his daughter, 'are always committing some folly or another.

He'll be missing one of these mornings, and will have gone away upon some wild-goose errand, seeking his fortune.--Why, what's the matter, Doll? YOU are making faces now.

"This is the place," [...] Master Plummer said, {{with an air}} of proprietorship; [...] "an' seein's you've got the kid in your arms, I'd better light {{a candle}} so's you can see the way, 'cause there's a lot of stuff out here at this end. I've been countin' on clearin' it up some day, but can't seem to find the time. Besides, it wouldn't make any {{difference}} to us,--it's only 'cause we've got the princess to lodge with us that I'd like to see it a little cleaner. <b>Say,</b> <b>Joe,</b> what is a princess, anyhow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, lad, it's me. I {{was coming}} home from Stilbro' market, and just as I got {{to the middle of}} the moor, and was {{whipping}} on as swift as the wind (for these, they say, are not safe times, thanks to a bad government!), I heard a groan. I pulled up. Some would have whipt on faster; but I've naught to fear that I know of. I don't believe there's a lad in these parts would harm me--at least, I'd give them as good as I got if they offered to do it. I said, 'Is there aught wrong anywhere?' ''Deed is there,' somebody says, speaking out of the ground, like. 'What's to do? Be sharp and tell me,' I ordered. 'Nobbut four on us ligging in a ditch,' <b>says</b> <b>Joe,</b> as quiet as could be. I telled 'em more shame to 'em, and bid them get up and move on, or I'd lend them a lick of the gig-whip; for my notion was they were all fresh. 'We'd ha' done that an hour sin', but we're teed wi' a bit o' band,' <b>says</b> <b>Joe.</b> So in a while I got down and loosed 'em wi' my penknife; and Scott would ride wi' me, to tell me all how it happened; and t' others are coming on as fast as their feet will bring them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't he a dear little man?" [...] said Captain Jim gloatingly. [...] "I do love {{to watch}} a little child asleep, Mistress Blythe. It's the most {{beautiful}} sight in the world, I reckon. Joe does love to get down here for a night, because I have him sleep with me. At home he has to sleep {{with the other two}} boys, and he doesn't like it. Why can't I sleep with father, Uncle Jim?" [...] says he. 'Everybody in the Bible slept with their fathers.' As for the questions he asks, the minister himself couldn't answer them. They fair swamp me. 'Uncle Jim, if I wasn't ME who'd I be?' and, 'Uncle Jim, what would happen if God died?' He fired them two off at me tonight, afore he went to sleep. As for his imagination, it sails away from everything. He makes up the most remarkable yarns--and then his mother shuts him up in the closet for telling stories. And he sits down and makes up another one, and has it ready to relate to her when she lets him out. He had one for me when he come down tonight. 'Uncle Jim,' says he, solemn as a tombstone, 'I had a 'venture in the Glen today.' 'Yes, what was it?' says I, expecting something quite startling, but nowise prepared for what I really got. 'I met a wolf in the street,' says he, 'a 'normous wolf with a big, red mouf and AWFUL long teeth, Uncle Jim.' 'I didn't know there was any wolves up at the Glen,' says I. 'Oh, he comed there from far, far away,' <b>says</b> <b>Joe,</b> 'and I fought he was going to eat me up, Uncle Jim.' 'Were you scared?' says I. 'No, 'cause I had a big gun,' <b>says</b> <b>Joe,</b> 'and I shot the wolf dead, Uncle Jim,--solid dead--and then he went up to heaven and bit God,' says he. Well, I was fair staggered, Mistress Blythe." ...|$|E

[...] Are we men or--a-chew!"--here be gasped in his speech, [...] For a stink-pot had fallen {{just out of}} his reach. [...] "Shall we stand here as idle, and let Asia pour [...] Her barbaric hordes on this civilized shore? [...] Has the White Man no country? Are we left in the lurch? [...] And {{likewise}} what's gone of the Established Church? [...] One man to four hundred is great odds, I own, [...] But this 'yer's a White Man--I plays it alone!"

60|$|So <b>saying,</b> <b>Joe</b> sprang lightly {{over the}} slight parapet of their little fortress, and ran swiftly out, unarmed, towards the Indians. In {{a few seconds}} he was close up with them, and in another moment was surrounded. At first the savages brandished their spears and rode round the solitary man, yelling like fiends, as if they wished to intimidate him; but as Joe stood like a statue, with his arms crossed, and a grave {{expression}} of contempt on his countenance, they quickly desisted, and, drawing near, asked him where he came from, {{and what he was}} doing there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>say,</b> <b>Joe,</b> you {{can talk}} 'bout {{steamboat}} snaps; but this house of mine lays over 'em all. I s'pose I've got about the swellest layout in this city, an' don't {{have to give up}} a cent for it, either. First off McDaniels counted on chargin' me rent, an' after I'd been there a couple of days he said it didn't seem right to take money, 'cause the place wasn't fit for a dog. I'll tell you what it is, if McDaniels keeps his dogs in any better shanty than that, they must be livin' on the fat of the land." ...|$|R

[...] "'It had a {{gorgeous}} interior, high-end food and drinks, and of course stunningly beautiful women in sexy gowns.

Outside the Health Centre, Joe asks Sarah if she would like to go ten-pin bowling with him and to ring him if she fancies going. They then part company. Sarah speaks with a female colleague, Maggie, and <b>says</b> that <b>Joe</b> seems a bit wild. She states that she is not going to go bowling with Joe.|$|R
