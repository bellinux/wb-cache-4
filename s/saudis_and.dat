5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|<b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> Jordanians {{provided}} an active {{support to the}} royalists through {{the first years of}} war. The September 1962 coup d'état in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1. The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to the Republicans, rapidly spiraling the country into a full-scale war, as the Republicans called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North Yemen, the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages. The same day, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known. Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans, the Saudis decided to launch attacks on the Republicans in North Yemen.|$|E
5|$|Operation Desert Storm {{began on}} 17 January 1991, {{but for the}} first two weeks 3rd Battalion only {{conducted}} sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border. That all changed on 29 January, when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly crossed the border and seized the Saudi town of Khafji, less than 15kilometers north of 3rd Battalion's position. During the attack the Executive Officer along with the Battalion Sergeant Major drove into the town on a rescue mission looking for two Army soldiers who had been captured. Although they were unable to find them, the Marines from 3rd Battalion did encounter an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before escaping. While Saudi and Qatari units ultimately retook the town, 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward. In addition, several heavy machine guns and forward air controllers from the battalion were shifted over to the <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> took place in the assault. From 19–21 February, 3rd Battalion moved from Al Mish'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack into Kuwait. It was also during this period that 3rd Battalion was given its assignment for the ground offensive. Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport, the battalion (along with 2/3) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border and provide flank security {{for the rest of the}} 1st Marine Division to make its assault into Kuwait. On the night of 22 February, 3rd Battalion crossed the border into Kuwait, infiltrating past Iraqi minefields, tank traps, and other obstacles. Like many American units, 3rd Battalion encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from friendly fire. Throughout the ground war, the battalion advanced steadily northwards, encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners. 3rd Battalion arrived outside the Kuwait International Airport around 27 February where a SCUD missile landed near the battalion's command post. Several months later, 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii, having suffered no combat casualties.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} differences between how men and women greet and take leave of someone {{of the same sex}} in Saudi Arabia, a gender segregated society. Age, social status, relationship between participants, and setting were also tested to see if they have any effect on how <b>Saudis</b> greet <b>and</b> take leave of each other. A total of 237 participants: 127 males and 110 females were recorded in naturally occurring conversations. The participants were from all social classes and included three age groups: 18 - 30, 31 - 50, and over 50. Relationship between participants included close friends, relatives, acquaintances, and strangers. Data was collected in social and family gatherings, work, school, and the hospital. The data was analyzed in light of Brown and Levinson's (1987) politeness theory. Variables like formulaic expressions, length, and hyperbole were also tested. The results of the study indicate that age had a significant affect on how Saudis greet, take leave/reply to a leave-taking of someone of the same sex. Based on my corpus, social status had no significant affect on how <b>Saudis</b> greet/reply <b>and</b> take leave/reply of someone of the same sex. The relationship between participants showed a significant correlation with how <b>Saudis</b> greet/reply <b>and</b> take leave/reply of someone of the same sex. Setting had no significant affect of how <b>Saudis</b> greet <b>and</b> take leave of someone of the same sex. But it did show a significant affect of how Saudis reply to greetings and leave-takings of someone of the same sex. Gender did not on any significant affect on how <b>Saudis</b> greet <b>and</b> reply to greetings of someone of the same sex. Whereas, gender showed a significant correlation with how <b>Saudis</b> take leave <b>and</b> reply to a leave-taking. Results of the study indicate that women consistently took longer to greet and take leave of someone of their own sex, regardless of age, social status, relationship between participants, or setting. Women also used more metaphors and superlatives while greeting or taking leave of someone of their own sex. Women were found to repeat their greetings and leave-takings more than men.

Islamic Scholars, particularly Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab and his descendants, {{are believed to have}} {{played a significant role in}} Saudi rule during this period. The <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> their allies referred to themselves during this period as the Muwahhidun or Ahl al-Tawhid ("the monotheists").

500|$|Foreign {{workers in}} Saudi Arabia, {{estimated}} to number about 9 million as of April 2013, began migrating {{to the country}} soon after oil was discovered in the late 1930s. Initially, the main influx was composed of Arab and Western technical, professional and administrative personnel, but subsequently substantial numbers came from Southeast Asia. Saudi Arabia has become increasingly dependent on foreign labour, and although foreign workers remain present in technical positions, most are now employed in the agriculture, cleaning and domestic service industries. The hierarchy of foreign workers is often dependent on their country of origin; workers from India and western nations generally hold the highest positions not held by <b>Saudis,</b> <b>and</b> the lower positions are occupied by persons from Africa, [...] and Southeast Asia. The Saudi government has faced criticism from legal bodies and employers over the treatment of foreign workers.|$|E
500|$|From 1985 {{the declining}} oil price {{led to a}} {{decreased}} demand for foreign labour, resulting in a substantial drop in migration from Asia.

The Gulf War of 1991 sparked a series of expulsions of guest workers suspected of disloyalty, including the removal of 800,000 Yemenis. The numbers of foreign workers reached a plateau in the 1990s, but {{from the end of the}} decade the inflow of migrants resumed its increase. According to official figures in 2012, foreign workers filled 66 per cent of jobs in Saudi Arabia, despite an official unemployment rate of 12 per cent amongst <b>Saudis,</b> <b>and</b> expatriates sent, on average, US$18 billion each year, in remittances to their home countries.|$|E

The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father's unpopularity. One sheik said [...] "The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years. Some were good and some bad. We killed the bad ones sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones". The hill tribes were Shia, like the Imam, while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni, as were most Egyptians. President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis. Al-Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser's biggest target, saying [...] "Now I'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser.

Quwatli had a prior relationship with the House of Saud, stemming from his own family's commercial links with the <b>Saudis</b> <b>and</b> Quwatli's friendship with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, a Syrian adviser to Ibn Saud, who Quwatli had dispatched to Arabia during Faisal's rule. Quwatli, strongly distrustful of the Hashemites, was impressed by Ibn Saud's relatively quick conquest over much of Arabia and saw in the Saudis a strong potential ally against British and French imperialism in the Middle East.
