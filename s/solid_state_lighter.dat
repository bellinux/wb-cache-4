Analysis of conventional and emerging optosemiconductor lighting industries highlights important differences of influence within the value chain. For <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting,</b> the significance of system integration shifts control away from large LED manufacturers and closer to the end user.

Copious corporations and academic institutions are investing cosmic treasures in tracking down the advanced artificial lighting applications with a vision towards energy efficient and eco-friendly <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting.</b> In this regard, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) {{are going to change}} the human lifestyle, by offering a promising avenue to develop future energy saving solid-state lighting sources because of their intrinsic characteristics such as low driving voltage, high resolution, high brightness, large viewing angle, large color gamut, high contrast, less weight and size, efficiency etc., there by dictating their ability to reach the pinnacle in the field of flat panel displays and <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting</b> sources.

They can be positioned and used in an urban environment in numerous ways. This article studies whether their future use in general outdoor lighting will positively affect people’s acceptance of urban space illuminated in this way. Two different lighting concepts were formed based on the innovative use of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting</b> solutions. The first concept is based on plane lighting, {{and the second is}} based on a detailed depiction of architectural and urban elements. Lighting proposals were designed for five different city locations. They consider not only functional needs, but also urban planning and the architectural aspects of illumination. I present my study of the underlying core effects on the respondents through their assessment of the affective quality of graphic representations. My findings indicate that the respondents strongly agree with the assessment of the “pleasantness” and “arousal” variables of most proposals. However, the statistics show characteristic differences between the answers of both variables for both concepts. Direct comparison of the two concepts shows that the respondents’ attitudes towards a certain lighting concept also depend on their location in the city.

40|$|Lighting is an {{indispensable}} energy end use of man. A significant number people {{in developing countries}} live without electric lighting and depend on oil-based lamps. Globally, lighting consumes {{substantial amount of energy}} and is a major contributor to green house emissions. Conventional electric lighting systems such as incandescent lamps are highly inefficient and waste energy while the fluorescent/CFL lamps contain toxic chemicals like mercury. Incandescent lamps with short lifespan as well as the fluorescent/CFL lamps pose environmental waste disposal problems (e. g.). The use of renewable energy resource such as solar and wind power systems for example as sources of power for the most efficient and long life lighting source such as high-brightness light emitting diodes (LEDs) (also known as <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting)</b> would reduce global energy consumption for lighting by half, with corresponding reduction in green house emissions.

30|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting</b> {{technology}} is the next generation light source, owing to its potential luminescence efficiency. GaN-based white light-emitting diode (LED) is {{the most widely used}} <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>light</b> source because of its long lifetime, high energy efficiency, small size, ability to produce color light directly without filtering, and integration with other semiconductor electronic elements [1 – 6]. However, prohibitively high manufacturing costs, unstable production in run-to-run and wafer-to-wafer, inadequate light uniformity, and inferior color rendering index represent major obstacles to GaN-based LED as a main light source in the future. The first two obstacles are attributed to the expensive growth technology of metal-organic chemical vapor deposition and the Ga-N bonding mechanism. The latter two obstacles are caused by a mixture of blue and yellow lights. White LED consists of a blue LED chip and a yellow phosphor coating. A non-conformal phosphor coating causes thickness of phosphor coating layer variation and inadequate color uniformity.|$|R
40|$|White light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) based on III-nitride InGaN/GaN quantum wells currently offer the highest overall efficiency for <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting</b> applications. Although current phosphor-converted white LEDs have high electricity-to-light conversion efficiencies, it has been recently {{pointed out that the}} full potential of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting</b> could be exploited only by color mixing approaches without employing phosphor-based wavelength conversion. Such an approach requires direct emitting LEDs of different colors, including, in particular, the green-yellow range of the visible spectrum. This range, however, suffers from a systematic drop in efficiency, known as the "green gap," whose physical origin has not been understood completely so far. In this work, we show by atomistic simulations that a consistent part of the green gap in c-plane InGaN/GaN-based {{light emitting}} diodes may be attributed to a decrease in the radiative recombination coefficient with increasing indium content due to random fluctuations of the indium concentration naturally present in any InGaN alloy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In the future, {{buildings}} will be lit using <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting,</b> particularly {{white light}} emitting diodes (LEDs). <b>Solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>lighting</b> is a rapidly expanding area of research due to the reliability of LEDs and the numerous applications possible including Visible Light Communications (VLC), where a white LED is used to illuminate {{a room at the}} same time as providing a data communications system. VLC systems are restricted by limited modulation bandwidths of typically only a few MHz. This can be overcome however, since multiple arrays of LEDs are manipulated, allowing a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique which simultaneously illuminates the room uniformly and provides parallel data transfer. In this paper, a non-imaging MIMO technique is employed, with results showing that the system does not perform consistently at all receiver positions, owing to symmetry. The simulations performed show that aggregate speeds up to 12 Mbps can be achieved using this transmitter distribution.
