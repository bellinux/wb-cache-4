40|$|ABSTRACT VLSI Standard Cell Placement {{is a hard}} {{optimization}} problem, {{which is}} further complicated with new issues such as power dissipation and performance. In this work, a fast hybrid algorithm is designed to address this problem. The algorithm employs Simulated Evolution (SE), an iterative search heuristic that comprises three steps: evaluation, selection and allocation. Solution quality is a strong function of the allocation procedure which is both time consuming and difficult. In this work a force directed approach in the allocation step of SE is used to both accelerate and improve the solution quality. Due to the imprecise nature of design information at the placement <b>stage,</b> <b>objectives</b> to be optimized are expressed in the fuzzy domain. The search evolves towards a vector of fuzzy goals. The proposed heuristic is compared with a previously presented SE approach. It exhibits significant improvement in terms of runtime for the same quality of solution...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the two stage stochastic integer programming problems, {{with an emphasis}} on problems in which integer variables appear in the second stage. Drawing heavily on the theory of disjunctive programming, we characterize convexifications of the second stage problem and develop a decomposition-based algorithm for the solution of such problems. In particular, we verify that problems with fixed recourse are characterized by scenario-dependent second stage convexifications that have a great deal in common. We refer to this characterization as the C^ 3 (Common Cut Coefficients) Theorem. Based on the C^ 3 Theorem, we develop an algorithmic methodology that we refer to as Disjunctive Decomposition (D^ 2). We show that when the second stage consists of 0 - 1 MILP problems, we can obtain accurate second <b>stage</b> <b>objective</b> function estimates afer finitely many steps. We also set the stage for comparisions between problems in which the first stage includes only 0 - 1 variables and those that allow both continuous and integer variables in the first stage...|$|R
