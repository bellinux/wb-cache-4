5|$|Following most {{present day}} {{damaging}} earthquakes, teams of investigators from {{institutions such as}} the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute are sent to the affected region to set up instruments to capture <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> records, and to study the damage and other effects of the event. This has not always been the case, and the 1954 report from Steinbrugge and Moran that thoroughly detailed the effects (especially to buildings) of the 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written. The <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> record that was obtained from the 1952 shock, as well as the accelerogram from the 1940 El Centro earthquake, were the most widely used data sets until the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Valley is {{surrounded}} by a number of interconnected fault systems and is vulnerable to both moderate and strong earthquakes as well as earthquake swarms. The area was equipped with an array of <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> seismographs for analyzing the fault mechanisms of nearby earthquakes and seismic characteristics of the sediments in the valley. The earthquake was significant in the scientific community for studies of both fault mechanics and repeat events. Four of the region's known strike-slip faults and one additional newly discovered normal fault all broke the surface during the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{regional}} seismic risk, the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s. No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units that were still operational at the facility. Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> data in this seismically-active area, {{but the majority of}} records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or inadequate maintenance. Only one piece of equipment at the facility provided data by which an estimate of the peak ground acceleration could be made.|$|E
30|$|In some {{previous}} studies (e.g., Hashimoto et al., 1996; Ide et al., 1996; Kikuchi and Kanamori, 1996; Sekiguchi et al., 2000) separate inversions of static displacement, teleseismic body waves, or <b>strong</b> <b>motions</b> {{were performed to}} analyze the rupture process of this earthquake. In these studies, half-space velocity structure models were used for calculating Green’s functions of static displacements, and 1 D stratified velocity structure models were used for those of teleseismic body waves or <b>strong</b> <b>motions.</b> In addition to these separate inversions, joint inversions have been conducted using <b>strong</b> <b>motions</b> and static displacements by Horikawa et al. (1996), and using <b>strong</b> <b>motions,</b> teleseis-mic body waves, and static displacements by Wald (1996) and Yoshida et al. (1996). 1 D stratified and half-space velocity structure models were also used in these studies.|$|R
50|$|Seismologists usually define <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> as the <b>strong</b> {{earthquake}} shaking {{that occurs}} close to (less than about 50 km from) a causative fault. The {{strength of the}} shaking involved in <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> usually overwhelms a seismometer, forcing the use of accelerographs (or <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> accelerometers) for recording. The science of <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> also deals with the variations of fault rupture, both in total displacement, energy released, and rupture velocity.|$|R

5|$|Following the event, a {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} along the fault zone {{with the goal of}} estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area. The <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{displacement}} along the Imperial Fault {{was very similar}} to that observed for {{the northern part of the}} rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake, although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico. This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979. The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> recordings. This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity, making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred.|$|E

40|$|For regions lack of <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> records, {{a method}} is {{developed}} to predict <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> by small earthquake records from local broadband digital earthquake networks. Sichuan and Yunnan regions, located in southwestern China, are {{selected as the}} targets. Five regional source and crustal medium parameters are inversed by micro-Genetic Algorithm. These parameters are adopted to predict <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> for moment magnitude (M w) 5. 0, 6. 0 and 7. 0. <b>Strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> data are compared with the results, most of the result pass through ideally the data point plexus, except the case of M w 7. 0 in Sichuan region, which shows an obvious slow attenuation. For further application, this result is adopted in probability seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) and near-field <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> synthesis of the Wenchuan Earthquake...|$|R

25|$|The event {{affected}} {{a number}} of health care facilities in Sylmar, San Fernando, and other densely populated areas north of central Los Angeles. The Olive View Medical Center and Veterans Hospital both experienced very heavy damage, and buildings collapsed at both sites, causing the majority of deaths that occurred. The buildings at both facilities were constructed with mixed styles, but engineers were unable to thoroughly study the buildings' responses {{because they were not}} outfitted with instruments for recording strong ground motion, and this prompted the Veterans Administration to install seismometers at its high-risk sites. Other sites throughout the Los Angeles area had been instrumented as a result of local ordinances, and an extraordinary amount of <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> data was recorded, more so than any other event up until that time. The success in this area spurred the initiation of California's <b>Strong</b> <b>Motion</b> Instrumentation Program.|$|E
25|$|Caltech {{scientists}} {{recorded the}} events on {{a cluster of}} twelve <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> sensors that were placed throughout the region {{with a total of}} 87 channels of recorded data. Nine of these instruments were located on the Caltech campus, two were at the nine story Jet Propulsion Laboratory building 180 (ten miles northwest of the campus) and the final device was placed on a hillside 5km to the west. Investigation of the accelerograms from these units revealed the strongest shaking lasted 4–5 seconds. The vertical accelerations were considered relatively high and early analysis (pre-digitilization) indicated that the mainshock was complex, with a double train of P-waves arriving with a 1.4–1.8 second interval.|$|E
25|$|The Loma Prieta {{earthquake}} {{was named}} for Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which lies just {{to the east of}} the mainshock epicenter. The duration of the heaviest shaking in the Santa Cruz Mountains was about 15 seconds, but strong ground motion recordings revealed that the duration of shaking was not uniform throughout the affected area (due to different types and thicknesses of soil). At sites with rocky terrain, the duration was shorter and the shaking was much less intense, and at locations with unconsolidated soil (like the Marina District or the Cypress Street Viaduct) the intensity of the shaking was more severe and lasted longer. The <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> records also allowed for the causative fault to be determined – the rupture was related to the San Andreas Fault System.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{characteristics}} of <b>strong</b> <b>motions</b> obtained by K-NET and KiK-net particularly for M 6.5 and M 7.3 events starting with the spatial distribution of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV). The distribution of these peak values suggests some notable characteristics specific to the Kumamoto earthquakes, and the factors causing them are then investigated. These analyses are relatively conventional approaches to exploiting the information after the earthquake based on the stably recorded triggered data. The real-time observation of <b>strong</b> <b>motions</b> has become feasible, which will contribute to ongoing earthquake disaster mitigation. To demonstrate its potential, we finally present our efforts to utilize the real-time strong-motion observations for rapidly and certainly issuing a warning of strong shakings.|$|R
30|$|JMA 7.3. Some records {{exceeded}} a peak ground velocity (PGV) of 100  cm/s, {{and devastating}} damage was caused. Source modeling {{of the earthquake}} by simulating <b>strong</b> ground <b>motions</b> is important for predicting <b>strong</b> ground <b>motions</b> and understanding their generation mechanism. Researchers have conducted source process analyses of the earthquake. For example, Yagi et al. (2016) and Yamanaka (2016) estimated the source process using teleseismic records. Koketsu (2016), Asano and Iwata (2016), Kubo et al. (2016), and Nozu (2016) used <b>strong</b> ground <b>motions.</b> These analyses indicated that the rupture propagated mainly toward the northeast from the hypocenter, and the rupture extended almost {{as far as the}} western edge of Mount Aso. This kind of rupture propagation can cause the rupture directivity effect, where seismic waves are coherently superposed. In the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, <b>strong</b> <b>motions</b> observed northeast of the epicenter could be amplified by the forward directivity effect. <b>Strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> simulations using point-source models do not seem appropriate for such earthquakes. However, the pseudo point-source model proposed by Nozu (2012 a) has been successfully applied to large earthquakes such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Nozu 2012 a) as well as shallow crustal earthquakes (Hata and Nozu 2014), although the source model does not consider the rupture directivity effect.|$|R

25|$|Following many of California's major earthquakes, {{lawmakers have}} acted quickly to develop {{legislation}} related to seismic safety. After the M6.4 1933 Long Beach earthquake the Field Act was passed the following month, {{and after the}} 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act and Senate Bill 1953 (hospital safety requirements) were established. Following the San Fernando event, earthquake engineers and seismologists from established scientific organizations, {{as well as the}} newly formed Los Angeles County Earthquake Commission, stated their recommendations that were based on the lessons learned. The list of items needing improvements included building codes, dams and bridges being made more earthquake resistant, hospitals that are designed to remain operational, and the restriction of development near known fault zones. New legislation included the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act and the development of the <b>Strong</b> <b>Motion</b> Instrumentation Program.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{compelling}} seismogram from the 1940 event in El Centro, strong-motion seismology was not explicitly sought until later events occurred—the San Fernando earthquake made evident {{the need for}} more data for earthquake engineering applications. The California <b>Strong</b> <b>Motion</b> Instrumentation Program was initiated in 1971 with the goal of maximizing the volume of data by furnishing and maintaining instruments at selected lifeline structures, buildings, and ground response stations. By the late 1980s, the program had instrumented more than 450 structures, bridges, dams, and power plants. The 1979 Imperial Valley and 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquakes were presented as gainful events that were recorded during that period, because both produced valuable data that increased knowledge of how moderate events affect buildings. The success of the Imperial Valley event was especially pronounced because of a recently constructed and fully instrumented government building that was shaken to the point of failure.|$|E
25|$|Few <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> {{seismometer}} installations {{were present}} {{outside of the}} western United States prior to the San Fernando earthquake but, upon a recommendation by the Earthquake and Wind Forces Committee, the Veterans Administration entered into {{an agreement with the}} Seismological Field Service (then associated with NOAA) to install the instruments at all VA sites in Uniform Building Code zones two and three. It had been established that these zones had a higher likelihood of experiencing strong ground acceleration, and the plan was made to furnish the selected VA hospitals with two instruments. One unit would be installed within the structure and the second would be set up as a free-field unit located a short distance away from the facility. As of 1973, a few of the highest risk (26 were completed in zone 3 alone) sites that had been completed were in Seattle, Memphis, Charleston, and Boston.|$|E
30|$|The 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (Mw 9.0) {{generated}} widespread <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion,</b> and seismic intensities of 6 -lower and 6 -upper {{were recorded}} in the Tohoku and Kanto districts over an area of approximately 400 km × 100 km. The durations of <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> were very long.|$|R
30|$|These {{results suggest}} that it is {{important}} to take into account site-specific characteristics of <b>strong</b> ground <b>motions</b> for reasonable safety assessment of anti-derailment devices for future large earthquakes. In future study, seismic response analysis of elevated bridges for bullet trains will be carried out using estimated <b>strong</b> ground <b>motions.</b>|$|R

500|$|The foreshock, mainshock, and the {{two largest}} {{aftershocks}} were recorded by <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> stations that were operated by the California <b>Strong</b> <b>Motion</b> Instrumentation Program (CSMIP) and the USGS. A total of 36 seismograms were captured from 11 stations, including a two-story steel frame building, the Long Valley Dam, and several free field stations. The Chalfant <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> station recorded the largest horizontal accelerations for the foreshock, mainshock, and the July 21 M5.6 aftershock of [...]28g, [...]46g, and [...]17g. The instruments at the building on North Main street in Bishop recorded all four shocks and indicated [...]25g at ground level and [...]4g on the roof, both during the mainshock.

At the Altadena station ( [...] from the epicenter) [...]46g was recorded. The Cogswell Dam station recorded a peak horizontal acceleration of [...]58g, but no major damage occurred.|$|E
500|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the October 1989 {{event in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, the mainshock near Petrolia produced {{some of the highest}} ground motions ever recorded (at that time) by the California <b>Strong</b> <b>Motion</b> Instrumentation Program (CSMIP). Fourteen existing CSMIP stations comprising 84 <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> sensors recorded the event, ten of which were ground response stations. The remaining four were located on structures, including a Highway 101 overpass in Rio Dell, a dam, a one-story supermarket in Fortuna, and a 5-story residential building in Eureka. The supermarket, residential building, and dam were 28, 50, and 75 kilometers distant from the epicenter respectively, and recorded peak accelerations of [...]46g, [...]34g, and [...]15g. An accelerograph at the Painter Street overpass (a concrete bridge, [...] from the epicenter) recorded a free field acceleration of [...]55g and an instrument on the structure saw an amplified peak of 1.23g during the mainshock.|$|E
30|$|The JMA EEW system issued one “warning” to {{the general}} public in the Tohoku {{district}} before the start of <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion.</b> It was earlier than the S wave arrival and 15 s earlier than <b>strong</b> ground <b>motion</b> (intensity 5 -lower or greater) at the closest station to the epicenter.|$|R
30|$|It is {{well-known}} that soil deposits when subjected to <b>strong</b> <b>motions</b> exhibit nonlinear behavior. In order {{to account for}} nonlinearity of soil during shaking, an equivalent linear method is adopted herein. The equivalent-linear method is widely {{being used in the}} design industry and the method is capable of considering effect of inelasticity through modulus reduction and damping increment.|$|R
30|$|During {{the main}} shock, Hata et al. (2016 b) {{were given an}} {{unexpected}} opportunity to observe <b>strong</b> <b>motions</b> at TMP 01, TMP 02 and TMP 03 as shown in Fig.  1. The observed <b>strong</b> <b>motions</b> at TMP 03 exceeded the largest observed ground motions during the 1995 Kobe earthquake in terms of spectral acceleration and JMA seismic intensity (Nishimae 2004) and have a significant importance to the engineering as well as seismological communities (Hata et al. 2016 a). With installation of the seismograph at TMP 03 on April 15, 2016, between the foreshock and the main shock, Hata et al. (2016 c) have previously conducted microtremor measurement in order to confirm the validity as a candidate site for the temporary earthquake observation (see photograph in Fig.  1). After the main shock, intermittent measurements of microtremor at TMP 03 were also carried out within December 6, 2016, in order to evaluate recovery process of properties of subsurface soil for this study.|$|R

The event occurred beneath the San Gabriel Mountains on the Clamshell–Sawpit Fault, which {{is a part of}} the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System.

The faulting reached {{the surface of}} the ground, but the maximum amount of measurable slip was limited to about [...] of strike-slip motion along the White Mountain Fault Zone. Other destructive and surface-rupturing earthquakes, as well as large volume volcanic eruptions, have occurred in the area. Although the series of shocks occurred within the White Mountain seismic gap, the region continues to have potential for a very large earthquake.|$|E
500|$|The 1979 Coyote Lake {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} [...] on August 6 with a moment magnitude of 5.7 {{and a maximum}} Mercalli Intensity of VII (Very strong). The shock occurred on the Calaveras Fault near Coyote Lake in Santa Clara County, California and resulted {{in a number of}} injuries, including some that required hospitalization. Most of the $500,000 in damage that was caused was non-structural, but several businesses were closed for repairs. Data from numerous <b>strong</b> <b>motion</b> instruments was used to determine the type, depth, and extent of slip. A mild aftershock sequence lasted throughout the remainder of the month that was of interest to seismologists, especially with regard to fault creep, and following the event, local governments evaluated their response to the incident.|$|E

For this task there have traditionally been adopted two separate approaches...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the damage to buildings, damage to highway bridges was also significant in the near-source region of the Kumamoto earthquake. Although some bridges were clearly affected by landslides, several bridges, including the Ogiribata Bridge (see Fig.  1), could have been simply damaged by <b>strong</b> ground <b>motions</b> (Nikkei Construction 2016). To understand the true damage mechanism of the bridges, {{it is necessary to}} estimate the <b>strong</b> ground <b>motions</b> at the bridge sites. For this purpose, again, it is necessary to understand the rupture process of this earthquake especially when the bridge site is located close to the fault, because the rupture process of the earthquake easily affects the <b>strong</b> ground <b>motions</b> near the fault.|$|R
