5|$|A similar {{cladogram}} {{was published}} in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Dicunculus and including the pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) {{at the base of}} the clade. The DNA used in these studies was obtained from the Oxford specimen, and since this material is degraded, and no usable DNA has been extracted from subfossil remains, these findings <b>still</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> independently verified. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E

25|$|Large-scale {{reactors}} using neutronic fuels (e.g. ITER) {{and thermal}} power production (turbine based) are most comparable to fission power from an engineering and economics viewpoint. Both fission and fusion power stations involve a relatively compact heat source powering a conventional steam turbine-based power station, while producing enough neutron radiation to make {{activation of the}} station materials problematic. The main distinction is that fusion power produces no high-level radioactive waste (though activated station materials <b>still</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disposed of). There are some power station ideas that may significantly lower the cost or size of such stations; however, research in these areas is nowhere near as advanced as in tokamaks.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum {{deposition}} is not {{a suitable}} method for forming thin films of polymers. However, polymers can be processed in solution, and spin coating is a common method of depositing thin polymer films. This method is more suited to forming large-area films than thermal evaporation. No vacuum is required, and the emissive materials can also be applied on the substrate by a technique derived from commercial inkjet printing. However, as the application of subsequent layers tends to dissolve those already present, formation of multilayer structures is difficult with these methods. The metal cathode may <b>still</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum. An alternative method to vacuum deposition is to deposit a Langmuir-Blodgett film.|$|E
25|$|Throughout this process, {{every time}} the soul {{associates}} itself with a particular form, it collects through this medium impressions of the gross world. When the impressions through association with a particular form have been exhausted, the soul dissociates from that form. Yet the collected impressions must be further experienced and for this the soul associates with the next most developed form. So when the human form is reached, although consciousness is fully developed, it has a store of impressions that <b>still</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> experienced. While the soul {{is no longer in}} search of a better medium, it has to go through numerous human forms, until these impressions gathered through evolution are weakened and finally exhausted.|$|E

The payment (made with a bond sale) was reportedly the end of the Argentine default, which began in 2001.|$|E

500|$|The {{final step}} of the viral cycle, {{assembly}} of new HIV-1 virions, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the Golgi complex where it is cleaved by furin resulting in the two HIV envelope glycoproteins, gp41 and gp120. [...] These are transported to the plasma membrane of the host cell where gp41 anchors gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. The budded virion is still immature as the gag polyproteins <b>still</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cleaved into the actual matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. This cleavage is mediated by the packaged viral protease and can be inhibited by antiretroviral drugs of the protease inhibitor class. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion. Only mature virions are then able to infect another cell.|$|E

The communication points would tentatively have free Wi-Fi service, advertising, and free calls to at least 9-1-1 (the emergency service) or 3-1-1 (the city information hotline). The contract would require the operator, or the operating consortium, to pay [...] "$17.5 million or 50 percent of gross revenues, whichever is greater" [...] to the City of New York every year.
