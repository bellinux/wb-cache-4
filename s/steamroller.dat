5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a <b>steamroller</b> kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the <b>steamroller</b> there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter <b>steamroller</b> together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criss Angel {{became the}} creator, director, and {{executive}} producer of the A Network show Criss Angel Mindfreak, and had entered production in January. Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed at The Aladdin in Las Vegas, with Season 3 at the Luxor Las Vegas. Premiering on July 20, 2005, the show's illusions included walking on water, levitating, walking up the side of Luxor Hotel (in the light of 39 focused lamps that can be seen from space), floating between two buildings, causing a Lamborghini to disappear, surviving in an exploding C4 Crate, cutting himself in half in full view of an audience and getting run over by a <b>steamroller</b> while lying on a bed of broken glass.|$|E
5|$|At the Acme factory, Doom {{reveals his}} plot to destroy Toontown {{with a giant}} machine loaded with dip to build a freeway, the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf has bought out Los Angeles' tram system. Roger unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to save Jessica, and the couple is tied onto a hook {{in front of the}} machine's hose. Valiant then performs a comedic vaudeville act, causing the weasels to die of laughter; Valiant kicks their leader, Smart Ass, into the machine's Dip vat, killing him instantly. Valiant then fights Doom, who is eventually flattened by a <b>steamroller,</b> but survives. Eddie is shocked when Doom reveals that he is the toon who killed Teddy. Valiant uses a toon mallet with a spring-loaded boxing glove and fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom, dissolving him.|$|E

5|$|Atari created prototypes for {{location}} testing, but {{the game}} did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as Street Fighter II. Atari assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. Because the new models were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to Guardians of the 'Hood, a beat 'em up game. An urban legend states that when WMS Industries purchased Time Warner Interactive (the company which Atari Games had since merged into) in 1996, they ran a <b>steamroller</b> over the Marble Madness II boards in order to clear inventory for tax purposes. In actuality, no Marble Madness II boards were made apart from the prototypes, and according to Cerny at most 12 of these exist. These prototypes have since become collector items.|$|E
5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played {{from the perspective}} of the driver seat of the car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant <b>steamroller</b> with an attached flamethrower that can not be damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it.|$|E

25|$|During {{his third}} year at the VGIK, Tarkovsky met Andrei Konchalovsky. They found much in common as they liked the same film {{directors}} and shared ideas on cinema and films. In 1959 they wrote the script Antarctica – Distant Country, which was later published in the Moskovskij Komsomolets. Tarkovsky submitted the script to Lenfilm, but it was rejected. They were more successful with the script The <b>Steamroller</b> and the Violin, which they sold to Mosfilm. This became Tarkovsky's graduation project, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Torquay {{had been}} {{steadily}} increasing in size over this period and in 1900 {{the regions of}} Chelston and Livermead, previously part of the Cockington estate owned by the Mallocks had been annexed by the town and 1903 saw further expansion of Torquay's political size and power, as the former borough of St Marychurch was amalgamated into the town, having long since been residentially and commercially intermingled with the town due to its rapid expansion {{in the latter half}} of the past century. Rumour has it the catalyst for the merger was that Torquay wanted a <b>steamroller</b> and could not afford its own, unlike its smaller neighbour, however this has never been verified.|$|E
