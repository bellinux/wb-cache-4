50|$|In {{either case}} {{significant}} amounts of code to manage records must be provided in protected routines to ensure file integrity. An alternate to a Record-oriented file is a stream. In a <b>stream</b> <b>file,</b> in which the file system treats files as an unstructured sequence of bytes. The applications may, but need not, impose a record structure. This approach significantly reduces the size {{and complexity of the}} library and reduces the number of utilities required to maintain files.|$|E
50|$|The DDM <b>stream</b> <b>file</b> model {{consists}} of file attributes, {{such as its}} creation date {{and the size of}} the stream and a continuous stream of bytes. The stream can be accessed by means of the Stream Access Method. Application programs write data onto portions of the stream, even if that data {{consists of}} records. They keep track of the location of data items in the stream in any way they want. For example, the data stream of document files is defined by a text processing program such as Microsoft Word and that of a spreadsheet file by a program such as Microsoft Excel.|$|E

Recent gains in energyefficiency of new-generation NAND flash storage have strengthened the case for in-network storage by data-centric sensor network applications. We argue that current storage solutions offering a simple file system abstraction are inadequate for sensor applications to exploit storage. Instead, we propose Capsule – a rich, flexible and portable object storage abstraction that offers <b>stream,</b> <b>file,</b> array, queue and index storage objects for data storage and retrieval. Further, Capsule supports checkpointing and rollback of object state for fault tolerance. Our experiments demonstrate that Capsule provides platform independence, greater functionality and greater energy-efficiency than existing storage solutions...|$|E

Such an {{extraction}} depends {{on the kind of}} frame or the type of selected header/coefficient to be transmitted. Then, a second script (“H. 264 encoding adapter script” in Figure 1) processes the data array with the objective of generating the data <b>stream</b> <b>file</b> to be transmitted to the vehicular emulator. This second script lets us separate the different images or headers/coefficients in the video depending on the position of the bits in the H. 264 /AVC architecture. Thanks to this module we can isolate certain data in order to analyze their impact in GOP recovery percentage and video quality. In the same way, this script allows us to transmit different images using different channel encoding procedures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Image Features are {{the basis}} {{for most of the}} real time image {{processing}} applications. Edge is one of the prime features of image. It helps us to analyze, infer and take decision in various image processing applications. In this paper sobel and prewitts algorithms are implemented over Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Real time system demands dedicated hardware for image processing. Prototype of the ASIC can be obtained by FPGA based implementation of edge detection algorithm. FPGA has many significant features, that serves as a platform for processing real time algorithm. It gives substantially higher performance over programmable Digital Signal Processor (DSPs) and microprocessor. Modern approach of ‘Xilinx System Generator ’ (XSG) is used for system modeling and FPGA programming.

40|$|Abstract- H. 264 /AVC, {{the latest}} video Codec {{standard}} {{is the most}} popular among Video professionals owing to its exact and unambiguous guidelines for dealing with the input stream to be transported from one place to another, having minimum loss in the transit and a very good compression ratio, both attributes highly sought after in today’s world of high quality multimedia broadcast and reception. Another parameter is the bit rate with which the data has to be transmitted. This paper is an attempt to show how various input parameters affect the output of the H. 264 Codec. The input video file is a. yuv file, which after encoding becomes a. 264 file, which is also called a <b>stream</b> <b>file</b> because this file has to be sent as a stream to various locations owing to its small size. At the receiving end, this <b>stream</b> <b>file</b> is decoded back into. yuv file. In the entire process, there is some loss in the quality of the video transmitted. This loss has to be minimum and is indicated by a parameter called PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio). Apart from PSNR, there are some other parameters as well like sequence parameter set, picture parameter set, information about different frames as regards slices and macroblocks, all ensconced in different files. PSNR being an important parameter will be dealt with here. There are three different input profiles namely, baseline profile, main profile and extended profile for H. 264. In this work, variation of bit rate versus PSNR is studied in all the three profiles. A higher PSNR for a given constant bit rate is rated as a better performance. Here, the input sequence is a yuv file (foreman_part_qcif. yuv) with one reference frame. The quantization parameter for the I, B and P slices has been set at 30. The PSNR is plotted against bit rate and it is observed that they show a striking similarity with each other...|$|E
