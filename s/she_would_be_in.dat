25|$|The {{original}} sentencing {{was to be}} in July 2005, but Stewart's {{defense team}} had repeatedly asked for and received numerous adjournments because she was receiving treatment for breast cancer.

25|$|In May 2009, {{after the}} show's , Hargitay and Meloni's {{contracts}} expired {{when they were}} reportedly making $375,000–$385,000 per episode. During negotiations in April for a new contract, the duo attempted to receive {{a percentage of the}} show's profits as other high-profile Law and Order actors had done in the past. It was rumored that NBC threatened to replace Hargitay and Meloni if they persisted in their demands. However, two months later it was officially reported that both their contracts had been renewed for two more years. When the thirteenth season was about to air, initial reports indicated that Hargitay would appear in only the first 13 episodes. However, NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt later clarified that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> every episode of the season.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to Athens, Tryfonos {{attended}} the Athens auditions for the first season of Greek Idol. There she received all yes votes from the judges along with praise, while judge Kostas Kapetanidis predicted that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the top ten. Tryfonos initially {{did not want to}} audition for the show, but did so after encouragement from family and friends, as well as after having viewed a television commercial for the show; producers called her back the next day. She had not told anyone she was auditioning besides her brother and best friend, and instead told her parents about it shortly before the first episode was set to air. Tryfonos had also previously auditioned for the second season of rival Greek talent competition The X Factor, and passed the audition phase before ultimately being cut before the live shows. In response, she later stated that {{she did not want to}} join any reality show as she did not want to be judged on anything other than her voice, but auditioned for Greek Idol as she believed it was more of a simple talent show. Throughout the competition, she was considered a favourite to win. Recalling her experience on the show later on, she stated that she thought she would make it as a finalist onto the live shows with some difficulty, but never expected to win the completion. Following recall rounds and ten live shows, Trifonos came first in the competition and won a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment Greece.|$|E

500|$|Another major feud {{featured}} at {{the event}} was between Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty, who had teamed for several years as The Rockers. The team split up in December 1991, however, when Michaels attacked Jannetty during an episode of Brutus Beefcake's interview segment, [...] "The Barber Shop". Michaels became a singles wrestler and won the WWF Intercontinental Championship on October 27, 1992 from Davey Boy Smith. On the October 31, 1992 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Jannetty returned to the WWF after a lengthy absence and confronted Michaels. He attempted to hit Michaels with a mirror, but Michaels pulled his valet, Sensational Sherri in front of him. Sherri was hit with the mirror, which caused friction between her and Michaels. Michaels and Jannetty were scheduled to face {{each other for the}} Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble 1993. Leading up to the match, Sherri announced that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the corner of one of the men, but she refused to say which one.|$|E
500|$|After {{she rose}} to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her major-label debut Pies Descalzos (1995), Shakira was introduced to Emilio Estefan, the most important producer in the Hispanic market at the time, by her promoter and longtime friend, Jairo Martínez. Estefan was renowned for launching the careers of various Hispanic singers, such as Enrique Iglesias, Thalía, and his wife Gloria Estefan. He decided to work with Shakira as he identified her potential to strongly break into the US Latin market and expand her commercial presence there. One of Shakira's concerns was having creative autonomy over her music. Before signing their contract, the roles and duties were defined. Estefan would be her manager and her executive producer, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> charge of all the material and arrangements and have approval over the final look of the records. She later stated about her producer, [...] "He had a great respect for me as an artist and trusted me totally on this project". Since then, they started working on Estefan's Crescent Moon Studios in Miami.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>In</b> the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I think I could understand / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E

[...] "We need all {{the women who are}} accustomed to speak in public – every stick of timber that is sound," [...] Stone wrote to Antoinette Brown, a fellow Oberlin student who was preparing for the ministry. On Davis's list to contact was Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who sent her regrets along with a letter of support and a speech to be read in her name. Stanton wished to stay at home because <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the late stages of pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|At Elimination Chamber, Naomi {{defeated}} Alexa Bliss {{to win the}} SmackDown Women's Championship, but a legit injury {{forced her}} to relinquish the title. Alexa then insisted that since Naomi could not face her for a rematch, she should be awarded the title. Instead, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan scheduled her to face Becky Lynch for the vacant title, which Alexa won. On the March 7 episode of SmackDown, Becky, Natalya, and even Alexa's ally Mickie James all demanded to challenge the SmackDown Women's Champion at WrestleMania. Daniel Bryan decided that Alexa would {{have the chance to}} prove her claim of being [...] "the greatest female on the roster" [...] as she would be defending the title against all available female SmackDown wrestlers at WrestleMania, much to the dismay of the champion. In a subsequent tag team match pitting Alexa and Mickie against Becky and Natalya, both Natalya and Mickie turned against their respective partners. The following week, Becky defeated Natalya, but both were attacked by Carmella. Later, Mickie defeated Alexa. On the March 21 episode, Natalya interfered in a match between Becky and Carmella. In the ensuing brawl also involving Mickie and Alexa, Alexa remained the last woman standing. On the final SmackDown before WrestleMania, Naomi returned, attacked all women, and confirmed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the match at WrestleMania, making it a six-pack challenge.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{critics and}} biographers have {{expressed}} doubts regarding {{the veracity of}} Blavatsky's claims regarding her visits to Tibet, which rely entirely on her own claims, lacking any credible independent testimony. It has been highlighted that during the nineteenth century, Tibet was closed to Europeans, and visitors faced the perils of bandits and a harsh terrain; the latter {{would have been even}} more problematic if Blavatsky had been as stout and un-athletic as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> later life. However, as several biographers have noted, traders and pilgrims from neighboring lands were able to access Tibet freely, suggesting the possibility that she would have been allowed to enter accompanied by Morya, particularly if she had been mistaken for an Asian. Blavatsky's eyewitness account of Shigatse was unprecedented in the West, and one scholar of Buddhism, D. T. Suzuki, suggested that she later exhibited an advanced knowledge of Mahayana Buddhism consistent with her having studied in a Tibetan monastery. Lachman noted that had Blavatsky spent time in Tibet, then she would be [...] "one of the greatest travelers of the nineteenth century", although added that [...] "in all honesty I do not know" [...] if Blavatsky spent time in Tibet or not. Conversely, biographer Marion Meade commented on Blavatsky's tales of Tibet and various other adventures by stating that: [...] "hardly a word of this appears to be true".|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{the events}} of the Harry Potter books, Professor Trelawney falls into a prophetic trance while in an {{interview}} with Dumbledore at the Hog's Head, making a prophecy about the birth of a wizard [...] "with the power to vanquish" [...] Voldemort. This prophecy was partly overheard by Snape, who relayed what he heard to Voldemort. This led Voldemort to attack the Potter family, believing that Harry was the child named. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Professor Trelawney prophesies to Harry about the events of the book's climax. In Order of the Phoenix, Professor Trelawney is first put on probation by Umbridge, and later fired. However, Professor Trelawney continues to reside in Hogwarts castle due to an order by Dumbledore, who believes that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> danger outside Hogwarts due to the prophecy she made during her interview. Dumbledore later reveals that the prophecy is why he keeps her employed as a Divination teacher. Professor Trelawney returns to teaching in Half-Blood Prince, but has to share classes with Firenze, as he was cast out by his fellow centaurs when he agreed to replace Professor Trelawney after she was fired, which she thinks is an outrage. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, she is seen aiding in the Battle of Hogwarts by magically accelerating her crystal balls at Death Eaters. She uses one of these crystal balls to defend an injured Lavender against the attack of werewolf Fenrir Greyback. In the film adaptation, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, she is seen covering someone's body, with the aid of Padma Patil.|$|E
