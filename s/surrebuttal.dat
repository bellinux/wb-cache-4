5000|$|Rufus Choate, {{representing}} the relatives, {{argued that a}} witness to Smith's will, Theophilus Phelps, was insane and the will, therefore, invalid. According to twelve different friends, physicians, and family members who offered testimony, Phelps had believed, since a student at Amherst College in 1843, {{that he was being}} pursued by an invisible force intent on capturing and dissecting him. Phelps himself was called to the stand by Daniel Webster, acting on behalf of the will's executors. During his testimony, Phelps showed extreme composure and claimed that, while he had previously had health issues, he had not suffered any [...] "headaches" [...] or [...] "fears" [...] for the preceding two years, covering the time in 1844 when he attested the will. <b>Surrebuttals</b> were offered from others who had recently observed unusual behavior by Phelps; in one case it was claimed Phelps had been seen sitting motionless in a sleigh outdoors in the middle of winter for two hours. Nevertheless, Choate and the relatives ultimately lost their challenge to the will's validity.|$|R
2500|$|On December 16, 1981, both counsels {{delivered}} their {{closing arguments}} {{before the jury}} (these closing arguments, rebuttals and <b>surrebuttals</b> lasted until December 22). In his closing argument {{on behalf of the}} prosecution, Stirling Norris described Bonin as an insatiable, callous individual who acted with malice aforethought, and who derived extreme pleasure from the suffering he inflicted upon his victims. Having outlined the torture Bonin's victims had endured, Norris concluded his closing arguments by urging the jury to [...] "give him [...] what he has earned". Defense attorney William Charvet began his closing argument in defense of Bonin on December 21. Although Charvet did not specifically ask the jurors to find Bonin not guilty, he did request they only return the [...] "reasonable verdict you can bring"; indicating a likelihood of not guilty verdicts on at least some counts upon which Bonin stood charged. Charvet then hearkened towards the credibility of some of the delivered testimony, pouring particular scorn upon Miley and Munro, whom he emphasized had turned state's evidence, and thus, Charvet alleged, had tailored their testimony to the desires of the police. As such, Charvet contended the testimony of both accomplices as unworthy of belief. Charvet repeatedly reminded the jury he had exposed a myriad of inconsistencies in the testimony of Munro's account of the murder of Steven Wells in the various statements he had given, and had compelled him to admit that he lied on numerous occasions.|$|R

5000|$|Ellenberger's {{most widely}} read criticisms of Velikovsky were two 1985 correspondences to Nature: [...] "Falsifying Velikovsky" [...] vol. 316, p. 386, and [...] "Velikovsky's evidence?" [...] vol. 318, p. 204, and two 1987 {{letters to the}} editor in New York Times: May 15, p. 14, and August 29, p. 14. While citing these publications, Richard J. Huggett, Senior Lecturer in Geography, University of Manchester, averred that Ellenberger [...] "has, since his {{conversion}} to the anti-Velikovsky camp in 1984, relentlessly and mercilessly tried to show why Velikovsky's ideas were downright silly[...] [...] [...]" [...] The second Times letter was rebutted by Clark Whelton in a letter published September 29. Although the Times did not print Ellenberger's point-by-point <b>surrebuttal</b> to Whelton's letter, it was distributed (a) privately by mail with the September 1, 1987 [...] "Dear Friends" [...] letter and (b) to all attendees at the August 1990 [...] "Reconsidering Velikovsky" [...] Conference in Toronto. In 1994, Ellenberger's invitation to a conference on Velikovsky was rescinded, due to other participants' stating that they would not attend if he participated. This incident came about through the efforts of a group of individuals who in 1992 had deleted the section [...] "Magnetism, Dynamos and Neptune" [...] from Ellenberger's memoir for Aeon that explained the ignorance of Velikovsky and many of his supporters concerning the role of electromagnetism in astronomy and the origin of planetary magnetic fields. Previously, he was an invited speaker at Milton Zysman's August 1990 [...] "Reconsidering Velikovsky" [...] Conference at University of Toronto, identified on the program as [...] "Velikovsky's most unrelenting critic" [...] who was interviewed for The Globe and Mail, and he was the keynote speaker at the August 1992 Canadian Society for Interdisciplinary Studies conference in Haliburton, Ontario.

40|$|Journal. Two {{follow-up}} {{articles have}} been submitted that continue the discussion of these important subjects. The first is by Roberta Ann Johnson of the University of San Francisco, editor of the 2004 book The Struggle Against Corruption: A Comparative Study, who gives an overall favorable critique of Werlin’s analysis while herself extending the discussion in several ways, including bringing in the typologies introduced by Michael Johnston in his Syndromes of Corruption (2005). Werlin has followed this with a second article of his own, in this case, among other things, delving more deeply into the comparisons of Bangladesh with Vietnam, and Singapore with Jamaica. We are publishing the two articles together here as in effect one package. It is interesting that the two articles are complementary, not a rebuttal by Johnson and <b>surrebuttal</b> by Werlin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} legitimacy—or illegitimacy—of filing and {{maintaining}} a case under the Bankruptcy Code when the sole or principal beneficiary or beneficiaries of the case would be a secured creditor or secured creditors. In the situation posited here, {{the application of the}} usual distributional priority rules would not produce any distribution for the general, unsecured creditors of the debtor. In the prototypical case virtually all of the assets of the debtor would be subject to secured claims securing obligations that exceed the value of the collateral, i. e., the secured creditor would be undersecured {{and there would be no}} equity in the collateral for the benefit of the debtor’s estate (a “secured creditor bankruptcy”). The paper first offers a brief overview of several bankruptcy-law-related settings and contexts in which the appropriateness of a secured creditor bankruptcy might be questioned: (i) a proposed sale of substantially all of a debtor’s assets under Bankruptcy Code section 363, often relatively early in a Chapter 11 case, free and clear of the secured creditor’s security interest; (ii) a sale of substantially all of a debtor’s assets, in a transaction similar to a 363 sale, but pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization; (iii) conversion of a secured creditor Chapter 11 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 case or dismissal of the secured creditor bankruptcy; and (iv) the practice of “gifting” in a secured creditor bankruptcy under which, with the secured creditor’s consent, a distribution is made to or set aside for a person whose claim or interest is junior to the secured creditor’s claim. It also provides a summary of the treatment of secured party bankruptcies by the courts, including “carve-outs” from collateral. The paper next focuses primarily on the bankruptcy policy implications of secured party bankruptcies—primarily policies that underpin Chapter 11. It asks and offers a range of answers to the question: How should bankruptcy law treat secured creditor bankruptcies? Two competing visions of secured party bankruptcies are presented. One view is generally critical and opposed, the “Against” position, and the other generally supportive, the “For” position. It then offers rebuttals and <b>surrebuttals</b> of the Against and For positions and discusses and critiques the issues that these positions raise. Finally, the paper concludes that some secured creditor bankruptcies are appropriate and consistent with bankruptcy policies, but subject to several caveats...|$|R
40|$|Into {{the breach}} primed by the U. S. Supreme Court’s {{decision}} in Employment Division Department of Human Resources v. Smith in 1990, Congress plunged headlong, dragging {{along with it}} a judiciary charged with enforcement of a mandate only defined ambiguously. Thus, in 2004 the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) was passed and heralded as a legislative sum certain — a “clear” articulation of Congress’ balancing of local zoning prerogative with idiosyncratic religious use. It has proved anything but; for, since its passage, the results of litigation have remained resolutely immune to coherent explanation, as the Federal Circuit courts have become mired in a deep split, with resulting uncertainties engendering risks for both land user and regulator, alike, as well as crippling {{the very notion of}} federalism. This Article probes the present divisions of — principally — the Third, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, and concludes that Judge Richard Posner’s analytical approach to resolving this dilemma in applying RLUIPA is the strongest objective template for determining when the Fair Terms of RLUIPA have been violated by zoning authorities. In order to introduce a needed quantum of certainty in judicial decision making, this Article concludes that one of two options should be pursued: resolving cases under the rubric of conformity with objective criteria — thereby vindicating the prerogative of local zoning authorities while protecting sectarian land users from the limitless discretion of a provincial bureaucracy; or, alternatively, rationalizing the procedures of a RLUIPA action in such a manner that recognizes a land user’s statutory claim under this legislation establishes a prima facie case. Under this second option, such a case could be rebutted upon the showing by a locality that its actions were reasonable under the common law doctrine of nuisance. A <b>surrebuttal</b> to this assertion could be made by a showing by the plaintiff that there was a discriminatory intent exhibited by the governmental authority in its actions to restrict the religious use of land. Each of these two evidentiary approaches represent a fair reading of RLUIPA — and, each would serve to lift the veil of ambiguity covering the capacious issue of religious land use under present law...|$|E
