40|$|The {{release of}} {{indomethacin}} from fatty-base suppositories, {{which had been}} <b>stored</b> <b>at</b> a low (4 degrees C) and a high (25 - 30 degrees C) temperature for about one month, was examined in vitro and in vivo. In the in vivo experiments, the plasma indomethacin levels after administration of suppositories <b>stored</b> <b>at</b> different temperatures were measured in conscious and anesthetized rats. In the in vitro release test using a dialysis cell method, much lower amounts of indomethacin were released from the suppositories <b>stored</b> <b>at</b> a high temperature than from those <b>stored</b> <b>at</b> a low temperature. The melting point of suppositories <b>stored</b> <b>at</b> a high temperature was higher by approximately 2 degrees C than those <b>stored</b> <b>at</b> a low temperature. In conscious rats, the plasma indomethacin levels attained after the intrarectal administration of suppositories <b>stored</b> <b>at</b> a high temperature were slightly lower than those after the animals were given suppositories <b>stored</b> <b>at</b> a low temperature, but the difference was significant only 30 min after administration.

These results suggest that in conscious rats many factors such as a locomotor hyperactivity and enhancement of gastrointestinal motility caused by the rectal administration mask the real character of suppositories.
