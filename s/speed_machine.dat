40|$|Abstract—As an {{advanced}} manufacturing technology {{which has been}} developed rapidly in recent years, high <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> is widely applied in many industries. The chip formation during high <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> is a complicated material deformation and removing process. In research area of high <b>speed</b> <b>machining,</b> the prediction of chip morphology is a hot and difficult topic. A finite element method based on the software ABAOUS which involves Johnson-Cook material model and fracture criterion was used to simulate the serrated chip morphology and cutting force during high <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> of AISI 1045 hardened steel. The serrated chip morphology and cutting force were observed and measured by high <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> experiment of AISI 1045 hardened steel. The effects of rake angle on cutting force, sawtooth degree and space between sawteeth were discussed. The investigation indicates that the simulation {{results are consistent with}} the experiments and this finite element simulation method presented can be used to predict the chip morphology and cutting force accurately during high <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> of hardened steel.

40|$|High <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> is a {{necessary}} manufacturing method for ensuring productivity and profitability.

This paper investigates the effect of cutting speed on the surface integrity and fatigue properties of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (ASTM Grade 5) and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ELI (ASTM Grade 23) alloys in the beta annealed and mill annealed heat treated conditions.

High <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> is {{very popular}} and widely used in {{industry}} recently, {{and it has been}} accepted as a key technology for die and mold steel manufacturing because it has much advantage as compared with conventional machining such as low cutting resistance, low cutting heat generation and high production rate, etc. The finite element method is utilized in this study to simulate the processes of chip formation during high <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> of SKD 11 die steel workpiece step by step from an incipient of tool-workpiece engagement to a steady state of chip formation.

The {{metallurgical}} {{observations of}} microstructure {{characteristics of the}} adiabatic shear bands(ASB) within the primary shear zones of the serrated chips produced during high <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> high strength steel have been performed by using optical microscope, SEM and TEM.

The serrated chip formation was likely due to material softening that occurred in the primary shear zones. The microstructural development of dynamic recovery and rotational dynamic recrystallization is the dominant metallurgical process leading to material softening in primary shear zone during high <b>speed</b> <b>machining.</b> A model of microstructural development in primary shear zone during serrated chip formation in high <b>speed</b> <b>machining</b> was suggested by analyzing material softening mechanism...|$|R
