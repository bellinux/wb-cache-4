40|$|We {{report on}} a {{comparison}} between <b>stress</b> <b>relaxations</b> after an applied step strain and <b>stress</b> <b>relaxations</b> during slow, continuous strain in a bubble raft. A bubble raft serves as a model two-dimensional foam and consists of a single layer of bubbles on a water surface. For both step strains and continuous strain, one observes periods of stress increase and decrease. Our {{focus is on the}} distribution of stress decreases, or stress drops. The work is motivated by apparent disagreements between quasistatic simulations of flowing foam and simulations of continuous strain for foam. Quasistatic simulations have reported larger average stress drops than the continuous strain case. Also, there is evidence in quasistatic simulations for a general divergence of the average size of the stress drops that only appears to occur in steady strain near special values of the foam density. In this work, applied step strains are used as an approximation to quasistatic simulations. We find general agreement in the dependence of the average stress drop on rate of strain, but we do not observe evidence for a divergence of the average stress drop...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{simulation of}} amorphous silicon (a-Si) using the Stillinger- Weber potential reveals {{the existence of}} two distinct atomic environments: one solidlike and the other liquidlike. The mechanical behavior of a-Si when plastically deformed to large strain can be completely described by the mass fraction [phi] of liquidlike material in it. Specifically, samples with higher [phi] are more amenable to plastic flow, indicating that liquidlike atomic environments act as plasticity "carriers" in a-Si. When deformed under constant pressure, all a-Si samples converge to a unique value of [phi] characteristic of steady state flow. Discrete <b>stress</b> <b>relaxations</b> {{were found to be}} the source of low-temperature plastic flow in a-Si in deformation simulations by potential energy minimization. These relaxations are triggered when a local yielding criterion is satisfied in a small cluster of atoms. The atomic rearrangements accompanying discrete <b>stress</b> <b>relaxations</b> are describable as autocatalytic avalanches of unit shearing events. Every such unit event centers on a clearly identifiable change in bond length between the two split peaks of the second nearest neighbor shell in the radial distribution function (RDF) of bulk a-Si in steady-state low. by Michael J.

40|$|Rate-independence for {{stresses}} {{within a}} granular material {{is a basic}} tenet of many models for slow dense granular flows. By contrast, logarithmic rate dependence of stresses is found in solid-on-solid friction, in geological settings, and elsewhere. In this work, we show that logarithmic rate-dependence occurs in granular materials for plastic (irreversible) deformations that occur during shearing but not for elastic (reversible) deformations, {{such as those that}} occur under moderate repetitive compression. Increasing the shearing rate, Ω, leads to an increase in the stress and the stress fluctuations that at least qualitatively resemble what occurs due to an increase in the density. Increases in Ω also lead to qualitative changes in the distributions of <b>stress</b> build-up and <b>relaxation</b> events. If shearing is stopped at t= 0, <b>stress</b> <b>relaxations</b> occur with σ(t) / σ(t= 0) ≃ A (t/t_ 0).

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>relaxation</b> <b>stress</b> on the {{hydrogen}} concentration in Niobium- (Nb-) H media were investigated by iterative numerical modeling approach. To calculate the transformation strain, <b>relaxation</b> <b>stress,</b> and corresponding relaxed hydrogen concentration around an edge dislocation, a new third-order polynomial formulation was utilized in the model. With {{the aid of}} this polynomial, hydrogen induced <b>relaxation</b> <b>stress</b> never exceeds the dislocation stress, which indicates that the total stress field never turns to compressive state and diverges the results. The current model calculates the hydrogen concentration {{not only in the}} vicinity of an edge dislocation but also far away from the dislocation. Furthermore, the effect of <b>relaxation</b> <b>stress</b> on the interaction energy was also captured in the model. Overall, the current findings shed light on the complicated hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms of metallic materials by demonstrating that hydrogen induced relaxation has a significant effect on the hydrogen atom concentration and the interaction energy between the existing internal stress field and the solute hydrogen atom...|$|R

40|$|We study {{experimentally}} {{the effect}} of the axial tension load on the residual <b>stresses</b> <b>relaxation</b> in the surface-hardened hollow cylindrical specimens of D 16 T aluminium alloy at a temperature of 125 ∘C. The surface is hardened by the air shot-peening. We describe the testing machine and the routine of experiment. The experimental curves of hardened specimens creep under the axial loads 353, 385, 406. 2, 420 MPa and test duration of 100 – 160 hours are obtained. The axial and circumferential residual stresses after the hardening and the creep at the given temperature and load conditions are constructed by the method of circles and strips. The significant qualitative and quantitative changes of residual stresses take place under the tension load σ¯ in comparison with the thermal exposure (heat exposal with no load). The <b>relaxation</b> of residual <b>stresses</b> is essentially independent of the thermal exposure. In contrast, the loading leads to the significant residual <b>stresses</b> <b>relaxation</b> and to the changes in the distribution type. The axial and circumferential residual stresses evolve from the compressive to the tension with the increase of the axial tension load. Also the depth of residual stresses location changes with the increase of the axial tension load from the 600 microns in the original state after the air shot-peening to the 250 – 300 microns after the creep under the given loading.
