40|$|Abstract - The {{objective}} of this work was to identify the for the more promising parental combinations to obtain lines with good resistance to <b>soybean</b> Asian <b>rust</b> (Phakopsora pachyrhizi). Two experiments were {{carried out in the}} field during the 2006 / 2007 and 2007 / 2008 growing seasons, to determine the percentage of infected leaf area of individual plants of five parents and their segregant F 2 and F 3 populations. The data obtained indicates that additive genetic variance predominates in the control of soybean resistance to Asian rust, and that the year and time of assessment do not significantly influence the estimates of the genetic parameters obtained. The narrow-sense heritability (h 2 r) ranged from 23. 12 to 55. 83 %, and indicates the possibility of successful selection of resistant individuals in the early generations of the breeding program. All the procedures used to select the most promising populations to generate superior inbred lines for resistance to P. pachyrhizi presented similar results and identified the BR 01 - 18437 x BRS 232 population as the best for inbred line selection. 200...|$|R

40|$|Aiming at {{improving}} the efficiency control of Phakopsora pachyrhizi, this research evaluated different application techniques, using spray deposits and yield parameters of soybean crop. Two experiments {{were carried out}} in the experimental area of FCA/UNESP - Botucatu, SP, Brazil, in the soybean crop, Conquista variety, in the 2006 / 2007 season. The first experiment was arranged in random blocks with eight treatments and four replications. The treatments were conducted in factorial arrangement 4 × 2 (four air levels 0, 9, 11 and 29 km/h combined at two nozzle angles 0 and 30 °) using AXI 110015 nozzles. Ten plants on each plot were selected for sampling spray deposits. Artificial targets were fixed on plants, two in the top and another two in the bottom part of plants (abaxial and adaxial leaf surface each one). For deposit evaluations, a cupric tracer was used and the amount of deposits was determined by a spectrophotometer. The second experiment was {{carried out in the}} same place and the treatments were of the same arrangement as the previous experiment, including control treatment (untreated plants). The spraying with triazole fungicide was realized in R 2 and R 5. 2 growth stages of soybean with 142 l/ha spray volume.

Among them, calda viçosa (CV, mixture of Cu, Zn and Mg sulfates), Fish Fertil" (FF, hydrolyzed organic based on crustacean shell and marine fish, rich in chitosan), and sodium silicate (55) {{were selected for}} defense induction studies. Sovbean sown in greenhouse, at V 3 development stage, was sprayed with alternative products and inoculated or not-inoculated with spores of P. pachyrhizi. Control plants were neither sprayed with products nor fungus inoculated. At O (before treatment) and 72, 96 and 120 hours after treatments, leaves were collected, extracted in MeOH, filtered, and HPLC injected for identification and quantification of compounds. In general, FF + fungus plant treated increased isoflavone concentrations and responded faster than the other treatments. Malonyl genistin, malonyl daidzin and malonyl glycitin concentrations of were approximately, four and 90 times (72 h) and two (96 h) times greater, respectively, compared to previous analysis, in fungus + FF treated plants. In this treatment, genistein and daidzein concentration also increased at 72 h after treatment. Acethyl daidzin concentration increased in most of treatments, but was bigger in FF + fungus, 72 h after treatment. Aglycones (genistein, daidzein and glycitein) concentration was lower compared to glycosides. However, FF has been exhaustively tested for management of phytopathogens in flowers and fruits, its role in soybean disease management needs additional experiments.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of luminosity and of leaf epicuticular wax on the infection of soybean by P. pachyrhizi. The adaxial and abaxial leaflet surfaces of the first trifoliate leaf from cultivar BRS 154, phenological stage V 2, were inoculated with a suspension of 105 uredospores/mL. The plants were kept for 24 hours in a humid chamber at temperature of 23 degrees C, in light or dark conditions, using a factorial design. Subsequently, the plants were maintained for 14 days under a 12 -hour photoperiod. The disease severity and density were evaluated. For in vitro experiments, in light or dark conditions, the evaluation was done in terms of uredospore germination and appressorium formation. The wax content of adaxial and abaxial leaflets was analyzed quantitatively using chloroform extraction and ultrastructurally using scanning electron microscope. Higher density and severity were observed when the adaxial surface was inoculated, with later incubation of the plants in the dark, with no significant interaction between these factors. Spore germination in the dark (40. 7 %) was statistically different from spore germination in the light (28. 5 %). The same effect was observed with appressorium formation, in the dark (24. 7 %) and in the light (12. 8 %).

Algumas doenças que ocorrem na parte área das plantas podem ser manejadas através do tratamento das sementes com produtos sistêmicos. Essa forma de controle tem sido utilizada há muitos anos, visando o controle de fungos biotróficos em arroz e trigo. A ferrugem asiática da soja é a {{principal}} doença que ataca a cultura, a qual necessita de ferramentas eficientes para seu manejo. O objetivo desta dissertação foi verificar a contribuição do tratamento de sementes de soja com produtos fitossanitários no manejo da ferrugem asiática. Desta forma, produtos fitossanitários foram aplicados às sementes de soja em diferentes doses, a fim de se verificar os efeitos fitotóxicos sobre sementes e plântulas que eventualmente fossem causados pelos mesmos. As maiores doses não fitotóxicas de cada tratamento foram selecionadas, novamente aplicadas às sementes e distribuídas em campo experimental, onde se verificou o efeito do tratamento das sementes isoladamente ou com a aplicação foliar de fungicidas foliares, no manejo da ferrugem asiática da soja. Ciproconazol + azoxistrobina (10, 0 + 25, 0 g i. a. / 100 kg de sementes), difenoconazol (50, 0), epoxiconazol (2, 5), fluquinconazol (50, 0), flutriafol (10, 0), flutriafol TS (5, 0), flutriafol + tiofanato metílico (10, 0 + 50, 0), tebuconazol (10, 0), tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina (10, 0 + 5, 0), tetraconazol (10, 0), triticonazol (25, 0), acibenzolar-S-methyl (50, 0) e pó de rocha (2, 0) não apresentaram fitotoxicidade e foram comparados em campo. Ciproconazol + azoxistrobina (25, 0 + 10, 0 g i. a. / 100 kg de sementes) e epoxiconazol (2, 5) diminuíram a emergência das plântulas de soja em campo. No ensaio somente com tratamento de sementes, sem aplicação de fungicida foliar, tebuconazol e tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina diminuíram a ferrugem asiática em plantas de soja. Quando se integrou a pulverização foliar de fungicidas, fluquinconazol, tebuconazol e tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina, diminuíram a severidade da ferrugem asiática da soja.

ASR pustules usually do not have the yellow halo which is related to bacterial pustule. Besides, ASR pustules are raised and can be commonly found on the underside of the leaf which makes it different from the lesions caused by spot diseases.|$|E
50|$|Soybean {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commercial crops around the world and in the United States. Asian <b>soybean</b> <b>rust</b> is the major disease that affects soybeans. It causes lesions on the leaves of soybean plants and eventually kills the plants. The disease has caused serious yield loss of soybeans. In the areas where this disease is common, the yield losses can be up to 80%. In 2002, USDA reported 10-60% of yield losses in South America and Africa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soybean</b> <b>rust</b> {{is spread}} by windblown spores and has caused {{significant}} crop losses in many soybean-growing {{regions of the}} world. Windblown spores can travel for great distances and are released in cycles of seven days to two weeks. It is likely that ASR will survive on vast acreages of naturalized kudzu in the southern U.S. and thereby establish a permanent presence in the continental U.S. It is commonly believed that the disease was carried from Venezuela to the United States by Hurricane Ivan.|$|E
50|$|Asian <b>Soybean</b> <b>Rust</b> {{favors the}} environments that are humid and warm. Continuous period of wetness on leaves {{will help the}} growth of this disease since this {{situation}} is required for spores to germinate. Therefore, {{is most likely to}} appear under the condition which the temperature is between 60 and 85 degree Fahrenheit and relative humidity of 75% to 80%. Therefore, ASR is a more serious problem in tropical and subtropical areas in Asia, Africa, Australia and South America. It is unable to survive the cold winters of northern habitats.|$|E

In 2006, EPA settled with Syngenta for $15,600, because {{they failed to}} report cyproconazole production in India and Switzerland. In 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had issued a Section 18 quarantine exemption for using Syngenta's then unregistered cyproconazole product [...] "Alto 100 SL" [...] against Asian <b>soybean</b> <b>rust</b> in soybeans, and in 2008, it issued a Section 3 registration.In 2009, Syngenta applied for full registration of cyproconazole use on soybean.In 2012, Syngenta requested the EPA to establish regulations for residues of cyproconazole in or on peanut including nutmeat, peanut hay, peanut meal, peanut butter and refined oil, which as of 2015 was still under review.|$|E
