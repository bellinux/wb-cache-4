50|$|An inkwell {{is a small}} jar or container, {{often made}} of glass, porcelain, silver, brass, or pewter, used for holding ink in a place {{convenient}} {{for the person who}} is writing. The artist or writer dips the brush, quill, or dip pen into the inkwell as needed or uses the inkwell as the source for filling the reservoir of a fountain pen. An inkwell usually has a lid to prevent contamination, evaporation, accidental spillage, and excessive exposure to air. A type known as the travelling inkwell was fitted with a secure, <b>screw</b> <b>lid</b> so a traveller could carry a supply of ink in their luggage without the risk of leakage.|$|E
40|$|Niger {{is one of}} the {{important}} oilseed crop in the Madhya Pradesh, it is the life line of the tribes and cultivated mainly by marginal farmers in marginal conditions. Its storage on marginal conditions is highly affected by storage fungi. Siddaramiah et al. (2) reported Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, Alternaria alternata, Alternaria sp., Rhizopus nigricans, Rhizoctonia bataticola and septate sterile fungal mycelium {{to be associated with the}} niger seeds. In oilseed crops the seed mycoflora are known to affect the quality and quantity of oil (4, 5). Further many workers have shown that the affected seed showed reduction in germination and seedling vigour. The present study was therefore undertaken to know the predominant fungi associated in the storehouses for storage to find out the optimum moisture content, to identify the suitable containers, to maintain the viability of niger seed. Three types of storage containers, viz. permeable (gunny bags), semi-permeable (Baked earthen pitcher mud plastered outside) and impermeable (plastic container with <b>screw</b> <b>lid)</b> were taken to store niger seeds. Seeds were stored at initial moisture levels of 6, 8, 10 and 12 percent. Desirable moisture level was set by drying the seeds in oven or by adding water.

50|$|This {{self-locking}} {{property is}} {{one reason for the}} very large use of the screw in threaded fasteners such as wood screws, sheet metal screws, studs and bolts.

Voices from the Killing Jar is a seven movement work which depicts a series of female protagonists caught in their own kinds of killing jars: hopeless situations, inescapable fates, impossible fantasies, and other unlucky circumstances.

40|$|The {{first step}} in the DNA {{profiling}} process is the recovery of DNA from the crime scene or item. Such surfaces can be varying with absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces. Ridged surfaces, such as those encountered on bottle-tops or firearms, are also common. Although low trace DNA or “touch DNA” is problematic in forensic casework, ridged surfaces should be a more effective surface for the recovery of such DNA due their abrasive nature. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate six recovery techniques; single wet swab, dry-wet double swab, wet-dry double swab, flocked swab, PCR square, and tape lifts. 36 falcon tubes with <b>screw</b> top <b>lids</b> were sterilised before DNA was deposited on the screw-top lids. Each of the recovery techniques were then utilised on 6 screw-top lids. All recovery media then underwent standard DNA extraction prior to DNA quantification by UV/Vis spectroscopy and quantitative PCR. The data indicated that the tape lifts recovered significantly more DNA from the ridged surface than the other techniques. There was no significant difference between the remaining 5 techniques, although on average, flocked swabs recovered the least amount. This suggested that the success in recovery of DNA is not down to the particular technique used, but down to the competence of the individual examiner and the amount of DNA deposited onto the surface...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the memory and visual discrimination capabilities of Enteroctopus dofleini, the Giant Pacific Octopus. Octopuses {{have been known}} to have advance sensory capabilities and through this study we challenged our specimen to remember and actively choose a specific patterned jar based on a visual pattern and positive reinforcement. The results of this study could be used to compare the learning capabilities and visual discrimination skills of this species of octopus to other cephalopods that have been previously studied. Daily trials were conducted using differently patterned jars with one containing food to act as positive reinforcement for the octopus opening a specific patterned jar. The jars were floated in the tank in random order and the time was recorded for how long it took the octopus to make a definite grab onto a specific jar. After obtaining all our data, we ran a T-test as well as ANOVA statistical tests with a Tukey comparison in Minitab to determine if our results were significant. The data collected in this study did not support the original hypothesis that octopuses are capable of visual discrimination and memory, but it did support the assertion that they are able to learn new tasks.

Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.

He placed a large strong-box on the table, and cautiously drew from under his bed a carpet-bag, which, from the effort made to lift it, seemed to be filled with some weighty substance.

40|$|Background: Mirror writing (MW) {{refers to}} the {{production}} of individual letters, words or word strings in reversed direction [1]. When held to a mirror, these letters or words can be read normally. MW has mainly been observed in left hemisphere damaged patients writing with their left hand [2]. Two theories have been put forward to account for this phenomenon: a perceptual and a motor one. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the presence of MW in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) compared to elderly volunteers Materials and Methods: 24 MCI and 21 healthy controls underwent a screening for MW. Results: No group difference emerged. MW of individual letters was observed in 3 MCI patients, but also in 6 controls. However, one individual (F. C.) with MCI showed overt and severe MW when writing with her left hand. She (50 y. old, 7 y. of education) was not an outlier in terms of severity of cognitive impairment or any other clinical or demographic variable. She and a matched control group of 6 women were further assessed with a comprehensive battery of tests aimed at investigating her MW. She was much slower than the controls but as accurate in all tests. In particular, she did not commit more errors in mirror reading and reading backwards text on paper, in executing directional actions (like <b>screwing</b> a <b>lid),</b> and in left-right discrimination, nor did she perform differently when asked to write under the surface of a table or in writing with transparent titles. However, under dictation (8 words) she reversed two individual letters and one whole word, whereas the performance of the controls was flawless. Conclusions: MW is a rare occurrence in MCI. The case of F. C. cannot be interpreted as resulting from a perceptual impairment, her performance is more easily accounted for by a deficit in the motor transformation of the engrams to be written with the non dominant hand or an impairment of the monitoring of directional errors.

5000|$|A {{contemporary}} {{account in}} The Secrets of the Great City describes the trick: A stranger {{in the city}} would be accosted by a well-dressed individual, who would immediately begin a careless, friendly conversation. If the overtures of this individual are not repulsed in the first instance, he is soon joined by his accomplice, who professes to be a stranger to swindler number one.The accomplice has in his possession a small brass ball or sphere, which he says is the model of a patent safe, much used by merchants in China and India. He is trying to introduce it in this country, {{and would like to}} show the gentleman his model. This brass ball is, to all appearance, solid, but to the initiated it is soon made hollow, by pressing on a certain inner circle, when the centre of the ball, which is {{in the shape of a}} small cone, drops out. The bottom of the cone may be unscrewed, when a little chamber is revealed, in which is a long piece of white paper, carefully folded and secreted. The other end of the cone, the top of it, can be unscrewed, and a second chamber is revealed, in which is a second piece of paper, exactly like the first.Swindler number one takes the ball, examines it, and declares that it must be solid. The accomplice then presses the spring, and the centre drops out. He then unscrews one of the chambers, and reveals the paper to the admiring stranger and swindler number one. The accomplice's attention is here called away for a moment, and swindler number one, quietly winking at the stranger, abstracts the paper from the chamber, <b>screws</b> the <b>lid</b> on, and replaces the centre in the ball. Handing it back to the accomplice, he whispers to the stranger that he is about to win some money. He then bets the accomplice a sum which he thinks proportioned to the means of the stranger, that there is no paper in the ball. The bet is promptly taken by the accomplice. Swindler number one finds that he has no money, and asks the stranger to lend him the amount, offering to divide the winning with him. The stranger, who has seen the paper abstracted from the ball, is sure his new-found friend will win, and not being averse to making a little money on the spot, produces the desired amount, and hands it to his friend. The accomplice then opens the second chamber, reveals the duplicate piece of paper, and claims the stakes. The stranger loses his money, and is taught a useful lesson. He may apply to the police, if he wishes to do so, but the probabilities are that he will never see either his [...] "friends", the safe, or his money, again.|$|R
