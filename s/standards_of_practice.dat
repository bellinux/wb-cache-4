25|$|Roman law {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated. Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the Roman Empire, law was adapted {{to cope with the}} changing social situations and underwent major codification under Theodosius II and Justinian I. Although codes were replaced by custom and case law during the Dark Ages, Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin legal maxims (called brocards) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of precedent which later became the common law. A Europe-wide Law Merchant was formed so that merchants could trade with common <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property. As nationalism grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The Napoleonic and German Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging. EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the European Court of Justice.|$|E

40|$|The {{specialization}} {{of forensic}} mental health assessment (FMHA) has incorporated important advances {{during the last}} two decades. As scientific advances, specialized tools, and relevant ethical guidelines have become core elements of FMHA, how-ever, {{the question of how to}} regulate poor practice has assumed increasing impor-tance. One such means of regulation that has been rarely applied to FMHA thus far is malpractice litigation using a clearly defined <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care. This article focuses on the relationship between <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care in FMHA. The authors discuss the current absence <b>of</b> a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care in FMHA, describing the historical, regulatory, and legal influences that have helped to shape the current state <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in this specialty area and their relevance to operationalizing a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care. The authors address the various sources of authority that the law might consider in defining a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care and specify circumstances under which legal regulation using a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care would be more useful than would ethical/ professional regulation using a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Finally, the authors describe the advantages of developing a clearer <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in FMHA, which can then inform the operationalization <b>of</b> a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> care...|$|R

2500|$|Artists, {{particularly}} in the remoter parts of Australia, sometimes paint for outlets other than the indigenous art centres or their own companies. They do this for economic reasons, however the resulting paintings can be of uneven quality, and of precarious economic value. Doubts about the provenance of indigenous paintings, and about the prices paid for them, have spawned media scrutiny, an Australian parliamentary inquiry, and have been a factor limiting the growth in value of works. Questions regarding the authenticity of works have arisen in relation to particular artists, including Emily Kngwarreye, Rover Thomas, Kathleen Petyarre, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, Ginger Riley Munduwalawala, and Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri; in 2001 an art dealer was jailed for fraud in relation to Clifford Possum's work. These pressures led in 2009 {{to the introduction of}} a commercial code of conduct, intended to establish [...] "minimum <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and fair dealing in the Indigenous visual arts industry". However, persistent problems in the industry in September 2012 led the chair of the code's administering body Indigenous Art Code, Ron Merkel, to call for the code to be made mandatory for art dealers.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Richard Janda of the McGill University Faculty of Law {{produced}} a report entitled, Bill C-300: Sound and Measured Reinforcement for CSR. [...] According to Professor Janda Bill C-300 would make Canadian companies world leaders in CSR, and that good CSR performance would give Canadian extractive companies {{a competitive edge}} and international business advantage. [...] Industry submissions agree that good CSR performance is generally a source of competitive advantage. [...] Professor Janda's report does not examine the current position of Canadian companies and CSR, nor does it examine whether C-300 is {{required in order to}} make Canadian companies world leaders, both which are beyond the scope of the report. [...] However, John McKay has stated that Canadian companies already have a competitive advantage in some developing countries because they are held to higher <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and more likely to fulfill licensing conditions. [...] Essentially, there is agreement that CSR is important, and that Canada is already in many ways a strong player - the debate is whether C-300 will improve CSR performance, and if so whether it is the most appropriate way to do so.|$|E

2500|$|The medical {{director}} {{plays a key}} role in the professional development of paramedics as well. [...] In almost all cases, the {{medical director}} will have, at a minimum, input into the curriculum of paramedic training at a local level. [...] In actual practice, in a great many cases they will also teach some portions of the program, supervise clinical rotations of paramedics, and in some cases, even precept their initial field practice, prior to formal certification or licensing. [...] In almost all cases, the medical director will be charged with the creation of all protocols and standing orders, and with any research that goes into their creation. [...] The medical director will also, assisted by others, be responsible for the creation and development of the <b>Standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Practice</b> for their EMS system. Throughout the paramedic's career, the medical director will provide the mechanism for medical quality control, conducting chart audits and reviewing medically related service complaints, and may often have the ability to de-certify individual paramedics for cause. Medical directors will also act as advocates for their paramedics, advising elected officials and building support within the medical community for expanded scopes of practice when appropriate. Finally, medical directors will act as expert advisors to those in the EMS system administration and government administration, with respect to policies and legislation required by the EMS system, and in guiding its future direction. [...] In this model, the paramedic is very much seen as an 'extender' of the emergency physician's reach. [...] It is rare to see physicians in the field, unless they are precepting new paramedics or performing quality assurance activities, or are residents in emergency medicine training programs, gaining required field experience or conducting research. Medical directors and ED physicians will occasionally go into the field for large incidents, such as multi victim accidents and disasters to assume on site medical command.|$|E
