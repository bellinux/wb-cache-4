Writing in The Guardian in 2008, Jeremy Sare argued that [...] "the social exclusion of British <b>Somalis</b> is unparalleled and mirrors the isolation of Somalia itself". According to an article in The Economist published in 2013, <b>Somalis</b> [...] "are among the poorest, worst-educated and least-employed" [...] refugee populations in Britain. Hammond argues that data on the educational, employment and housing status of <b>Somalis</b> in the UK reveals their [...] "stark living conditions". However, she cautions against taking these indicators of evidence a lack of desire to integrate {{on the part of}} British <b>Somalis,</b> arguing that while non-Somalis regard them as [...] "a stubborn refusal to conform", for <b>Somalis</b> themselves their social exclusion [...] "is experienced by <b>Somalis</b> as a constraint on their ability to engage both with their community living in the diaspora and, most importantly, with <b>Somalis</b> living in the country of origin".|$|R

5|$|A new {{generation}} of more entertainment-oriented movies coming from the <b>Somali</b> film industry has grown increasingly popular among Somalis both within Somalia and in the diaspora. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart cinematic movement has energized the local movie scene, in the process introducing innovative storylines, production techniques and advertising strategies. The latter include cross-media marketing, with tie-in film soundtracks featuring prominent <b>Somali</b> music artists. Popular movies from Somaliwood include the <b>Somali</b> language slasher thriller Xaaskayga Araweelo, the action comedy Rajo, and Warmooge, the first <b>Somali</b> animated film. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are {{at the forefront of}} this quiet revolution. In 2010, the <b>Somali</b> director Mo Ali also released Shank, his first feature film set in a futuristic London.|$|E

[...] From 1982 to 2000, resettlement agencies placed refugees, including 315 <b>Somalis,</b> in the Portland, Maine area. [...] High rates of rental housing occupancy in Portland caused the first relocations to Lewiston. [...] <b>Somalis</b> {{have a history of}} nomadism and maintain contact, often via cell phone, with a large network of extended family, clan members, and friends. [...] More <b>Somalis</b> learned about Lewiston and were attracted by the quality of life there, the low housing costs, good schools, safety and greater social control of their children in the smaller town. [...] Between February 2001 and August 2002 over 1,000 <b>Somalis</b> moved to Lewiston. [...] Most of these early secondary migrants came from Clarkston, Georgia, a suburb just outside Atlanta. [...] By 2007, <b>Somalis</b> were 6.5% of the population of Lewiston and had come to the city from all over the United States and at least three other countries.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} public film {{display in the}} country were Italian newsreels of key events during the colonial period. Growing out of the <b>Somali</b> people's rich storytelling tradition, the first few feature-length <b>Somali</b> films and cinematic festivals emerged in the early 1960s, immediately after independence. Following {{the creation of the}} <b>Somali</b> Film Agency (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as riwaayado were the main driving force behind the <b>Somali</b> movie industry. Epic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of video technology and national television networks. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged.

Following the disastrous Ogaden War, Barre's government began arresting government and military officials under suspicion {{of participation in the}} abortive 1978 coup d'état. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad where they formed the <b>Somali</b> Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.
