5000|$|Adding {{absorptive}} {{materials to}} the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) {{will result in a}} decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) <b>steel</b> <b>stud</b> partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.|$|E

40|$|Cold-formed Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall {{systems are}} {{commonly}} used in commercial, residential and industrial buildings. This is due to their cost effectiveness, sustainability, quality and resistance to external elements such as termites and pests and high fire resistance. Conventional LSF wall systems are made of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>studs</b> and lined with gypsum plasterboards. When LSF walls are exposed to fire, the thermo-mechanical properties of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>studs</b> deteriorate at elevated temperatures, which may cause premature wall failure. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} protect the thin-walled <b>steel</b> <b>studs</b> from direct fire exposure as well as to delay the temperature rise. LSF wall fire performance is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of wall board lining, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and prevent the <b>steel</b> <b>studs</b> from heating up. Recently, Calcium silicate board has been used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been fully investigated. Hence an experimental study was conducted using calcium silicate boards. Two full scale fire tests were conducted, one with single layer calcium silicate boards and another with a combination of calcium silicate boards and gypsum plasterboards. This paper presents the details of this experimental study on LSF walls and the results of failure times and temperatures across and along the wall panels. Effects of using calcium silicate boards are discussed by comparing the fire test results with those from previously conducted LSF wall fire tests for gypsum plasterboards...|$|R

5000|$|The {{effect of}} adding {{multiple}} layers of gypsum wallboard to a frame also varies depending on the framing type and configuration. Doubling the mass of a partition does not double the STC, as the STC is calculated from a non-linear decibel sound transmission loss measurement. So, whereas installing an additional layer of gypsum wallboard to a light-gauge (25-ga. or lighter) <b>steel</b> <b>stud</b> partition will result in about a 5 STC-point increase, doing the same on single wood or single heavy-gauge steel will result in only 2 to 3 additional STC points. Adding a second additional layer (to the already 3-layer system) does not result in as drastic an STC change as the first additional layer. The effect of additional gypsum wallboard layers on double- and staggered-stud partitions {{is similar to that}} of light-gauge steel partitions. Due to increased mass, poured concrete and concrete blocks typically achieve higher STC values (in the mid STC 40s to the mid STC 50s) than equally thick framed walls. [...] However the additional weight, added complexity of construction, and poor thermal insulation tend to limit masonry wall partitions as a viable sound isolation solution in many building construction projects. Temperate climates and hurricane- or tornado-prone areas may, however, require the use of masonry walls for structural stability.|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] <b>Steel</b> <b>stud</b> wall systems are a common building material known for their low cost and ease of construction. However, standard building practices cause them to be inefficient with respect to explosive resistant design. Poorly designed anchor systems causes <b>steel</b> <b>stud</b> walls to achieve only a fraction of their potential during blast loading. The University of Missouri is researching new methods for anchoring infill <b>steel</b> <b>stud</b> walls to a building frame or floor slabs to protect occupants during an explosion. By combining the high ductility of bearing connections with the high strength of pin connections, a hybrid connection has the potential to greatly improve the dynamic response of <b>steel</b> <b>stud</b> walls. This research focused on creating an analytical model to predict the behavior of a <b>steel</b> <b>stud</b> wall utilizing hybrid connections. The model was verified by testing sample walls in a quasi-static loading tree. Resistance functions generated from the analytical model were incorporated into SSWAC to predict a wall system's dynamic response to any blast scenario. The analytical model predicts the response of a <b>steel</b> <b>stud</b> wall in four distinct phases; elastic bending, plastic bending, elastic tension, and bearing. The analytical model was proven to closely predict the experimental resistance functions for all regions of the walls response. This document concentrates on the design and verification of an analytical model to predict wall behavior. It covers all assumptions and calculations used to predict behavior. It also covers all methods for construction and testing of walls for validation...|$|E

A total of 14 full-scale fire resistance tests were conducted on loadbearing gypsum board-protected, <b>steel</b> <b>stud</b> wall assemblies. The wall assemblies had either diagonal cross-bracing or shear membrane to enhance shear resistance to lateral loads. Both single row and double row <b>steel</b> <b>stud</b> configurations with installation of gypsum board on each of the fire exposed and unexposed sides were considered in the experimental program. The insulation used, within the wall assemblies, were glass, rock and dry-blown cellulose fibers.
