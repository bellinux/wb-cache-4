50|$|Early {{theories}} of magnetization in ferromagnets assumed that ferromagnets {{are divided into}} magnetic domains and that the magnetization changed by the movement of domain walls. However, as early as 1930, Frenkel and Dorfman predicted that sufficiently small particles could only hold one domain, although they greatly overestimated the upper size limit for such particles. The possibility of single domain particles received little attention until two developments in the late 1940s: (1) Improved calculations of the upper size limit by Kittel and Néel, and (2) a calculation of the magnetization curves for systems of <b>single-domain</b> <b>particles</b> by Stoner and Wohlfarth.

Coating Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles with SiO 2 effectively eliminates magnetic interparticle interactions so that the coercive field HC in the hightemperature range between 300 K and the Curie temperature (855 K) can be well fitted by an expression for noninteracting randomly oriented <b>single-domain</b> <b>particles.</b> From the fitting parameters, the effective anisotropy constant K {{is found to be}} (1. 68 ± 0. 17) × 105 erg/cm 3, which is slightly larger than the bulk magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of 1. 35 × 105 erg/cm 3.

Often <b>particles</b> are considered <b>single-domain</b> if their saturation remanence is consistent with the single-domain state.

40|$|A simple {{model that}} {{provides}} a quantitative description of the magnetic susceptibility of superparamagnetic to stable single-domain uniaxial magnetic particles can be built {{in the framework of}} the theory of stochastic resonance. This model expands that of Mullins and Tile (1973) for superparamagnetic grains by considering the dependence of superparamagnetic susceptibility on the particle orientation and thus describes the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) of ensembles of superparamagnetic as well as <b>single-domain</b> <b>particles.</b> The theory predicts that on the contrary of stable single domain, the maximum anisotropy of superparamagnetic particles is parallel to their easy axis and shows that the AMS of ensembles of uniaxial particle is strongly dependent on the distribution of particle grain size, coercivity, measurement temperature, and frequency. It also explains why the inverse AMS pattern expected for stable <b>single-domain</b> <b>particles</b> is rarely observed in natural samples.

Using micromagnetic numerical simulation we prove that in the optimal range of particle diameters the magnetization reversal of the vortices in spherical iron and magnetite nanoparticles is possible for moderate amplitudes of external alternating magnetic field. In contrast {{to the case of}} superparamagnetic nanoparticles, for the vortex configuration the hysteresis loop area increases as a function of frequency. So that high values of the specific absorption rate, on the order of 1 kW/g, can be obtained at a frequency 1. 0 MHz. Because the diameter D of a non <b>single-domain</b> <b>particle</b> is several times larger than the diameter d of a superparamagnetic particle, the volume of heat generation for the vortex turns out to be many times larger.
