40|$|As Web <b>Services</b> <b>have</b> matured the {{interactions}} that the <b>services</b> <b>have</b> between themselves have gotten increasingly complex and sophisticated.

As web <b>services</b> <b>have</b> become dominant in the Internet and Grid systems landscape, a need to ensure guaranteed delivery of interactions (encapsulated in messages) between <b>services</b> <b>has</b> become increasingly important. In this paper we describe our work with the WSRM specification. Here we describe our support of WSRM and also include an empirical evaluation of the various facets of this specification. We believe this would be very useful for system designers who intend to incorporate support for reliable messaging within their Grid applications. 1...|$|R
