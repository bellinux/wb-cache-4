40|$|Polling {{policies}} have been introduced to simplify the accessing process in client/server systems by a centralized control access scheme. This paper considers a client/server model which employs a polling policy as its access strategy. We propose a learning-automata-based approach for polling {{in order to improve}} the throughput-delay performance of the system. Each client has an associated queue and the server performs <b>selective</b> <b>polling</b> such that the next client to be served is identified by a learning automaton. The learning automaton updates each client's choice probability according to the feedback information. Under the considered approach, a client's choice probability asymptotically tends to be proportional to the probability that this client is ready. Simulation results have shown that the proposed polling policy is beneficial in comparison to the conventional round-robin polling when operating under bursty tra#c conditions. The benefits are significant for the delay reduction in the considered client/server system...|$|E
5000|$|Her book Islam, den 11. landeplage {{became one}} of Norway's biggest bestsellers during the autumn of 2015, selling 20,000 copies in its first month with several new editions issued, despite being self-published and gaining little to none initial {{mainstream}} media coverage. The same year she led online voting for the [...] "Name of the Year" [...] award of newspaper Verdens Gang by a wide margin, but fell short of winning the award following a final <b>selective</b> opinion <b>poll.</b> Some including Gunnar Stavrum and Kjetil Rolness criticised the selection process of the newspaper, particularly that the final results were not publicly disclosed and a less favourable presentation of Storhaug in the poll.|$|R

Through <b>selective</b> breeding, <b>polled</b> and black genetics are now also {{prevalent in the}} breed. Gelbvieh cattle {{are known for their}} high rate of gain and feed efficiency, and were originally selected for easy growth, quick maturity, length of loin, leanness, docility, and longevity. They are able to adapt to many different rangelands and climate conditions. Gelbvieh females were selected to be very maternal with strong fertility, mothering instincts, good udders, and strong milk production. They are also known to have smaller bodied offspring, allowing for ease of calving.|$|R
40|$|Active Messages form a user-level {{communication}} {{mechanism that}} allows a message to extract itself from the network upon arrival at its destination. Delivery of such a message can be realized via an interrupt-driven or a polling-based approach. This paper proposes a new mechanism, Active Messages Using <b>Selective</b> Interrupts Without <b>Polling</b> (AM_SIWOP). It improves upon Active Messages by {{reducing the number of}} interrupt dispatch and deeply overlapping communication with computation. The AM_SIWOP uses dual hardware switched receive buffers and an adaptive timer in the network interface. Instead of each message causing an interrupt, a group of messages in a buffer as a whole will cause a single interrupt when the buffer becomes full or when {{a certain period of time}} has elapsed for messages waiting in a buffer. The timer is adjustable according to the communication traffic. The simulation results showed that the AM_SIWOP significantly improved the computational efficiency of Active Messages [...] . ...|$|R
