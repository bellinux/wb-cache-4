50|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> Atlantic hake or New England hake, Merluccius bilinearis, is a merluccid hake of {{the genus}} Merluccius, found in the {{northwest}} Atlantic Ocean. It is highly predatory and typically feeds on fish and crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> is a long, thin {{species with}} a {{protruding}} lower jaw and two dorsal fins. The silvery hake is named as such for its silvery coloring, while darker dorsally. They typically grow {{to be about}} 37 cm, but can reach a maximum length of 76 cm.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates {{the effects of}} {{different}} cooking methods (grilling, frying and boiling) on selenium contents of six marine species commonly consumed in Portugal. Forty-two composite samples of sardine, horse mackerel, gilthead seabream, <b>silver</b> scabbardfish, <b>hake</b> and octopuswere digested in a microwave systemand analysed by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The described method is adequate {{for the analysis of}} selenium in marine species and meets the requirements of validation and quality control. Mean selenium contents in raw species ranged from 0. 35 mg kg− 1 to 1. 24 mg kg− 1. Cooked samples presented mean selenium contents from 0. 38 mg kg− 1 to 1. 85 mg kg− 1 in grilled fish, from 1. 22 mg kg− 1 to 1. 28 mg kg− 1 in fried fish and from 0. 84 mg kg− 1 to 0. 87 mg kg− 1 in boiled fish. No statistically significant differences were determined for selenium levels in raw and cooked samples and in different marine species. Estimated selenium intake agrees well with recommendations and is far below the Upper Tolerable Nutrient Level. This is the first study concerning the evaluation of the effects of cooking methods on selenium contents of marine species consumed in Portugal.

50|$|Many pelagic and {{demersal}} fish species, {{as well as}} marine mammals and diving birds, prey upon juvenile and adult longfin inshore squid. Marine mammal predators include longfin pilot whales and common dolphins. Fish predators include striped bass, bluefish, sea bass, mackerel, cod, haddock, pollock, <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> red hake, sea raven, spiny dogfish, angel shark, goosefish, dogfish, and flounder.|$|E
50|$|Merluccius albidus, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the offshore hake, offshore <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> or offshore whiting, is a species of fish in the Merlucciidae family. It is found on the outer (offshore) continental shelf at depths of 70 - 1170 m in the west Atlantic, ranging from New England to French Guiana. It reaches 70 cm in length and 4.1 kg in weight.|$|E
50|$|Bouillabaisse is {{the most}} famous seafood dish of Marseille. It is a fish stew {{containing}} at least three varieties of very fresh local fish: typically red rascasse (Scorpaena scrofa); sea robin (fr: grondin); and European conger (fr: congre). It can include gilt-head bream (fr: dorade); turbot; monkfish (fr: lotte or baudroie); mullet; or <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> (fr: merlan), and it usually includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins (fr: oursins), mussels (fr: moules); velvet crabs (fr: étrilles); spider crab (fr: araignées de mer), plus potatoes and vegetables. In the traditional version, the fish is served on a platter separate from the broth. The broth is served with rouille, a mayonnaise made with egg yolk, olive oil, red bell pepper, saffron, and garlic, spread on pieces of toasted bread, or croûtes. In Marseille, bouillabaisse is rarely made for fewer than ten people; the more people who share the meal, and the more different fish that are included, the better the bouillabaisse.|$|E
5000|$|... "The diet of the {{longfin inshore squid}} {{changes with}} size; small {{immature}} individuals feed on planktonic organisms while larger individuals feed on crustaceans and small fish. Studies showed that juveniles fed on euphausiids and arrow worms, while older individuals fed mostly on small crabs, but also on polychaetes and shrimp. Adults fed on fish (clupeids, myctophids) and squid larvae/juveniles, and those larger than 16 cm fed on fish and squid. Fish species preyed on by longfin inshore squid include <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> mackerel, herring, menhaden, sand lance, bay anchovy, weakfish, and silversides. Maurer and Bowman (1985) discovered a difference in inshore/offshore diet: in offshore waters in the spring, the diet is composed of crustaceans (mainly euphausiids) and fish; in inshore waters in the fall, the diet is composed almost exclusively of fish; and in offshore waters in the fall, the diet is composed of fish and squid. Cannibalism is observed in individuals larger than 5 cm." ...|$|E
50|$|Swordfish prefer water {{temperatures}} between 18 and 22 C, but have the widest tolerance among billfish, {{and can be}} found from 5 to 27 C. This highly migratory species typically moves towards colder regions to feed during the summer. Swordfish feed daily, most often at night, when they rise to surface and near-surface waters in search of smaller fish. During the day, they commonly occur to depths of 550 m and have exceptionally been recorded as deep as 2878 m. Adults feed {{on a wide range of}} pelagic fish, such as mackerel, barracudinas, <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> rockfish, herring, and lanternfishes, but they also take demersal fish, squid, and crustaceans. In the northwestern Atlantic, a survey based on the stomach content of 168 individuals found 82% had eaten squid and 53% had eaten fish, including gadids, scombrids, butterfish, bluefish, and sand lance. Large prey are typically slashed with the sword, while small are swallowed whole.|$|E
50|$|The {{steep sides}} of the plateau cause deep-water {{currents}} to rise up {{when they hit the}} bank; this upwelling brings with it nutrients and minerals from the bottom, feeding the local ecosystem. Over 130 species from numerous classes of the animal kingdom call the bank home at least temporarily. Some such fish are the Atlantic cod, <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> yellow-tail flounder, blue-fin and yellow-fin tuna, striped bass, blue fish and numerous species of shark including the great white shark. Shellfish such as the American lobster, sea scallops, squid and ocean quahogs are also prevalent. Many marine birds call the bank home including gannets, shearwaters, storm petrels, fulmars, puffins and razorbills. Reptiles are even present, primarily being represented by the leatherback sea turtle. Possibly the most famous animals on Stellwagen Bank are the mammals. Five species of seals (harp seal, gray seal, harbor seal, hooded seal, and ringed seal), and numerous whale species swim in the waters of Stellwagen. Whale watchers can frequently see humpback whales, minke whales and fin whales. There are occasional sightings {{of one of the most}} critically endangered whale species, North Atlantic right whale. Several other whale species can also be seen here including the sperm whale, beluga, orca, pilot whale, White-beaked dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, harbor porpoise, blue whale, and sei whale.|$|E
40|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius bilinea:Pis) feeding {{intensity}} and catchability {{during periods of}} daylight and darkness has been examined. A variety of free-swimming crustaceans (i. e., Crangon septemspinosa, Dichelopandalus leptocerus, and Monoculodes intermedius) made up the largest part of the <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> diet. Examination of stomach fullness, intestinal fullness, the number of empty stomachs, state of digestion of prey, and {{the ratio of the}} stomach contents weight to the intestinal contents weight during different time periods shows that <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> feed at night. Their feeding period begins Just after dusk and continues. until pre-dawn, with the majority of their prey being taken between dusk and midnight. Prey are broken down in the stomach and passed into the intestine after a period of approximately 15 hours. The intestine is emptied after a further 9 hours has elapsed, which results in a total digestive tract evacuation time of about 24 hours. The ability of several types and sizes of trawls to catch <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> has been evaluated. Catch data from various studies, most of which were rigidly controlled trawl comparison experiments show that pelagic trawls, off bottom trawls, and. bottom trawls with roller gear tend to pass over <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> during the day, while bottom trawls with chain-disc sweeps an. d cable sweeps catch large quantities of <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> during daylight hours. These data establish that <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> are located on or immediately above the bottom during the day and that they are off bottom at night. It is suggested that a high opening trawl to catch <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> at night, combined with a chain-disc sweep to increase the day catch, would substantially increase the overall <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> catches by a vessel operating on a 24 -hour per day basis...|$|E
40|$|The SARC {{reviewed}} the preliminary results arising from a research study concerning <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> (whiting). Although a formal stock assessment of <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> {{had not been}} undertaken by the current SAW, it was appropriate for the SARC to review {{the findings of this}} research study as it had used a microsatellite DNA study to investigate an issue of considerable relevance to the management of this fishery, i. e., a determination of whether the assemblages of <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> from the Mid-Atlantic Bight, southern and northern Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine, and the Scotian Shelf could be considered as representing different stocks. The standard Advisory Report format for reporting scientific stock status and stock specific management advice is not well suited to such a review.

40|$|Abstract. The stomach {{contents}} of fish 100 mm SL, collected during June and October in two deep basins on the Scotian Shelf, showed that juvenile cod and <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> fed {{primarily on the}} two most abundant species of zooplankton in the basins: Calanus finmarchicus and Meganyctiphanes norvegica. These zooplankton were abundant in the basins during the 2 months, forming high concentrations at depths below 200 m during the day. In June, fish ( 100 mm SL) both feed on M. norvegica and C. finmarchicus in the deep regions of the basins. In October, <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> {{was the most common}} juvenile fish in the basins, feeding primarily on small stages of M. norvegica. The populations of fish (> 100 mm SL) in the basins were mainly species known to feed heavily on euphausiids.

40|$|CORRECTION: The {{original}} {{publication of}} this report, released in January 2011, had some incorrect {{values in the}} <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> Loligo squid, and red hake chapters. On February 23, 2011 the report was corrected. The changes did not affect any conclusions about stock status that were given in the original report. For <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> the overfishing threshold for the southern area was changed from 52. 30 kt/kg to 34. 19 kt/kg. The wrong set of years {{was used in the}} calculation (1965 – 1974 instead of 1973 – 1982). For Loligo squid, the median biomass over the time series was changed from 25, 578 mt to 27, 578 mt, and the terminal year for that calculation was changed from 2009 to 2008. For red hake, the nominal discards in the southern area were corrected, which also required the catch and relative exploitation rate to be corrected in a table and figure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a bioeconomic {{simulation}} of the U. S. fisheries for <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> Merluccius bilinearis, is presented. The model design combines elements of age-structured population and harvest yield models with {{economics of the}} <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> fishery. The analysis evaluates both biological and economic effects of interest to mangers, such as future yields or rebuilding of parental stock, as well as future revenues and net returns to vessels. The bioeconomic model is {{used to evaluate the}} economic implications of tradeoffs between alternative selection patterns in the U. S. Atlantic <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> fishery. Throughout the study, a selection pattern is defined as the suite of age-specific selection coefficients that are applied to a fish population over time. The results indicate that shifting fishing pressure to younger age classes could result in short-run gains in economic value that may not be sustainable due to longer run declines in biomass, hence lowered fishery yield and value. By contrast, strategies to delay age at first capture may improve economic value over current levels with only modest reductions in short-run fishery yield.

40|$|Georges Bank has {{exhibited}} marked changes in ecosystem structure {{over the last}} half century. The community once dominated by groundfish and other finfish is now primarily composed of pelagic and elasmobranch species. Community dynamics are profoundly influenced by species interactions such as predation. The focus of this dissertation is to estimate the trophic interactions among fish species on Georges Bank. These species interactions are estimated by developing a multispecies, statistical catch-at-age model of the Georges Bank fish community that explicitly quantifies the mortality due to predation. ^ Manuscript I: A submodel was developed for three important fish species on Georges Bank: Atlantic cod, <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> and Atlantic herring. The model was fit to time series of commercial catch, fishery-independent survey catch, and predator diet composition data from 1978 – 2007. Estimated predation rates were high, compared with fishing mortality, and variable with time. Monte Carlo simulations were {{used to evaluate the}} ability of the model to statistically estimate parameters with known error introduced into each of the three input datasets. The model parameters and derived indices could be estimated with confidence from input data with error levels similar to those obtained from the model fit to the observed data. This manuscript helps to elevate multispecies statistical catch-at-age models to the level of statistical rigor expected of fishery dynamics models. ^ Manuscript II: The submodel developed in the first chapter was expanded by applying the model to nine fish species within the Georges Bank community. While sensitivity to dataset weights and initial parameter estimates was apparent, both the magnitude and temporal trends in the predation mortality rates experienced by prey species were statistically estimated. Predation mortality rates again varied both temporally and ontogenetically. Mackerel, herring and <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> experienced the greatest mortalities due to predation, with maximum predation mortality rates of 0. 62 for mackerel, 1. 01 for herring and 1. 58 for <b>silver</b> <b>hake.</b> For these species, losses due to predation generally exceeded annual landings. Goosefish was the most dominant predator, followed by cod and <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> and consumption of modeled fish was related to prey abundance. These results demonstrate the strong impact of predation on Georges Bank fish community dynamics. ^ Manuscript III: The multispecies statistical catch-at-age model developed in the first two manuscripts was used to develop stochastic forward projections. These projections were used to explore the consequences of different fishing scenarios while accounting for predation. Stochastic projections indicated strong interactions between modeled species, though the interactions were not always direct. Examples of indirect interactions included the effect of goosefish on herring and similarly, the impact of goosefish on white hake. Consequently, population responses to fishing were a function of not only the rates of fishing, but also of these direct and indirect interactions among species. ^ Collectively, this dissertation demonstrates the strong impact of predation on Georges Bank fish community dynamics and provides a tool for statistically estimating the mortality due to predation. Through the development of a multispecies statistical catch-at-age model, we have expanded the multispecies modeling approaches implemented for Georges Bank and the Northeast U. S. Continental Shelf. ...|$|E

One application is to augment information on size-frequency distributions obtained in multispecies trawl surveys where stratum boundaries and sampling density are not optimal for all species. Analysis focused on ten recreationally and commercially important species: bluefish, butterfish, Loligo squid, weakfish, summer flounder, winter flounder, <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> (whiting), black sea bass, striped bass, and scup (porgy). The commercial vessel took 59 tows in the sampled domain south of Long Island, New York and the survey vessel 18. Black sea bass, Loligo squid, and summer flounder demonstrated an onshore-offshore gradient such that smaller fish were caught disproportionately inshore and larger fish offshore. Butterfish, <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> and weakfish were characterized by a southwest-northeast gradient such that larger fish were caught disproportionately northeast of the southwestern-most sector. All sizes of scup, striped bass, and bluefish were caught predominately inshore. Winter flounder were caught predominately offshore. The commercial vessel was characterized by an increased frequency of large catches for most species. Consequently, patchiness was assayed to be higher by the commercial vessel in nearly all cases. The size-frequency distribution obtained by the survey vessel for six of the ten species, bluefish, butterfish, Loligo squid, summer flounder, weakfish, and <b>silver</b> <b>hake,</b> {{could not be obtained}} by chance from the size-frequency distribution obtained by the commercial vessel. The difference in sample density did not significantly influence the size-frequency distribution. Of the six species characterized by significant differences in size-frequency distribution between boats, all but one was patchy at the population level and all had one or more size classes so characterized. Although the variance-to-mean ratio was typically higher for the commercial vessel, five of the six cases that were otherwise were among the species for which the size-frequency distribution differed between the two vessels. Thus, the origin of the significant differences observed between vessels would appear to lie in the spatial pattern of the species as it interacts with the tendency for one vessel to obtain large catches more frequently for some size classes. One consequence of differential distribution and catchability is that more large fish were present in the commercial vessel catches than in the survey vessel catches in cases where the two vessels obtained different size-frequency distributions. Application of commercial vessels to the evaluation of size frequency hinges on understanding how to interpret differences among boats, gear, and sampling design. Here we show that key ingredients to this understanding are the degree of nonlinearity in catchability across a range of size classes, the interaction of varying spatial arrangements among size classes and the sampling design, and the interaction of varying spatial arrangements with differential catchability...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of some biological characteristics and abundance dynamics of <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius bilinearis) from Scotian Shelf (Northwest Atlantic) and cape hake (Merluccius capensis) from Southeast Atlantic area (between 18 °– 28 °S). Differences in size composition, growth rate and length-at-maturity were most significant in late- 1960 s – first half of 1970 s. During the subsequent period these parameters became more similar. Taking into consideration the approximately similar rates of natural mortality, these species may be described as belonging to similar abundance dynamics with high reproduction ability and strong fluctuation of abundance. During the period 1968 – 90 similarity of recruitment trends and total biomass of southern and northern species was found, along with evidence of a synchronous pattern of general trends under the impact of global climatic variations...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} catch per unit effort (CPUE) index of squid biomass was produced based on 1977 - 1999 squid by-catch from the directed fishery for <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius bilinearis) during July on the Scotian Shelf (Subarea 4). Although this index was not standardized {{to account for}} variation in fleet composition, it was included with 3 other input variables in multiple regression analysis with SA 3 + 4 squid catch as the dependent variable. Other regressors included squid biomass and body size from July Scotian Shelf surveys {{as well as an}} environmental index. The CPUE index did not contribute significantly in explaining variation in catch, but a final model which included the July survey biomass index and mean weight, as well as spring ice extent, accounted for considerably more of the variation in annual catch than any single-variable model...|$|E
40|$|Parvalbumins {{constitute}} {{a class of}} calcium-binding proteins characterized {{by the presence of}} several helix-loop-helix (EF-hand) motifs. In a previous study (Revett SP, King G, Shabanowitz J, Hunt DF, Hartman KL, Laue TM, Nelson DJ, 1997, Protein Sci 7 : 2397 - 2408), we presented the sequence of the major parvalbumin isoform from the <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius bilinearis) and presented spectroscopic and structural information on the excised "EF-hand" portion of the protein. In this study, the X-ray crystal structure of the <b>silver</b> <b>hake</b> major parvalbumin has been determined to high resolution, in the frozen state, using the molecular replacement method with the carp parvalbumin structure as a starting model. The crystals are orthorhombic, space group C 2221, with a = 75. 7 A, b = 80. 7 A, and c = 42. 1 A. Data were collected from a single crystal grown in 15 % glycerol, which served as a cryoprotectant for flash freezing at - 188 degrees C. The structure refined to a conventional R-value of 21 % (free R 25 %) for observed reflections in the range 8 to 1. 65 A [1 > 2 sigma(I) ]. The refined model includes an acetylated amino terminus, 108 residues (characteristic of a beta parvalbumin lineage), 2 calcium ions, and 114 water molecules per protein molecule. The resulting structure was used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations focused primarily on the dynamics of the ligands coordinating the Ca 2 + ions in the CD and EF sites. MD simulations were performed on both the fully Ca 2 + loaded protein and on a Ca 2 + deficient variant, with Ca 2 + only in the CD site. There was substantial agreement between the MD and X-ray results in addressing the issue of mobility of key residues in the calcium-binding sites, especially with regard to the side chain of Ser 55 in the CD site and Asp 92 in the EF site...|$|E

40|$|The {{comparative}} analysis of recruitment dynamics of nine commercial fish populations (stock units) and water {{temperature in the}} Northwestern Atlantic (NAFO Subareas 2 - 4) has been carried out.
