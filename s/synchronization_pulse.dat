25|$|A {{transmission}} {{consists of}} horizontal lines, scanned {{from left to}} right. The color components are sent separately one line after another. The color encoding and order of transmission can vary between modes. Most modes use an RGB color model; some modes are black-and-white, with only one channel being sent; other modes use a YC color model, which consists of luminance (Y) and chrominance (R–Y and B–Y). The modulating frequency changes between 1500 and 2300Hz, corresponding to the intensity (brightness) of the color component. The modulation is analog, so even though the horizontal resolution is often defined as 256 or 320 pixels, they can be sampled using any rate. The image aspect ratio is conventionally 4:3. Lines usually end in a 1200Hz horizontal <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulse</b> of 5 milliseconds (after all color components of the line have been sent); in some modes, the <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulse</b> lies {{in the middle of}} the line.|$|E

[...] These AVT modes differ radically from the other modes mentioned above, in that they are synchronous, that is, they have no per-line horizontal <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulse</b> but instead use the standard VIS vertical signal to identify the mode, followed by a frame-leading digital pulse train which pre-aligns the frame timing by counting first one way and then the other, allowing the pulse train to be locked in time at any single point out of 32 where it can be resolved or demodulated successfully, after which they send the actual image data, in a fully synchronous and typically interlaced mode.|$|E

50|$|The {{above is}} the {{continuous}} mode, where the host initiates the protocol. In the quiet mode, a device requests interruption by driving SERIRQ low for a clock.

30|$|Special {{cases of}} the {{procedure}} that we have described to retrieve clock drift and travel time nonreciprocity from ambient noise cross-correlations have been previously employed in seismology [22]-[24], {{where there was no}} nonreciprocity, and in atmospheric acoustics [20], where there was no clock drift. To test our method of estimating time shifts, we applied it to the ambient noise recorded between <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulses</b> in the laboratory experiment on clock stability. The relative drifts of clocks measured by matching the leading fronts of the <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulses</b> and from cross-correlations of ambient noise were found to agree within 0.1 % (Figures  3 a, b). Our relative clock drift estimates based on Figure  4 c are of the same magnitude as the clock drifts measured (i) in September-October 2013 using pre-deployment and post-recovery clock <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulses,</b> and (ii) in the May 2014 laboratory experiment. The reported values of the relative clock drifts, including our estimates based on Figure  4 c, are consistent with the clock drifts being nearly constant over time periods of the order of a few weeks and slowly varying over periods of the order of a few months.|$|R
50|$|In such a {{situation}} where the speed of the camera and the recorder are absolutely free of any variation there remains no need for a <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulse</b> cable to run between the camera and the recorder. This has made the work of a sound man much simpler. It also give more freedom of movement to the camera at the time of motion picture filming.|$|E
5000|$|The {{format of}} the {{horizontal}} sync pulse varies. In the 525-line NTSC system it is a 4.85 µs-long pulse at 0 V. In the 625-line PAL system the pulse is 4.7 µs <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulse</b> at 0 V [...] This {{is lower than the}} amplitude of any video signal (blacker than black) so it can be detected by the level-sensitive [...] "sync stripper" [...] circuit of the receiver.|$|E
50|$|In video {{production}} and computer graphics, {{changes to the}} image are often kept {{in step with the}} vertical <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulse</b> to avoid visible discontinuity of the image. Since the frame buffer of a computer graphics display imitates the dynamics of a cathode-ray display, if it is updated with a new image while the image is being transmitted to the display, the display shows a mishmash of both frames, producing a page tearing artifact partway down the image.|$|E
50|$|Separate sync is {{most common}} with VGA, used {{worldwide}} for analog computer monitors. This is sometimes known as RGBHV, as the {{horizontal and vertical}} <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulses</b> are sent in separate channels. This mode requires five conductors. If separate cables are used, the sync lines are usually yellow (H) and white (V), yellow (H) and black (V), or gray (H) and black (V).|$|R
5000|$|In a CRT {{the image}} is {{generated}} by an electron beam that sweeps {{back and forth across}} the screen. The electron beam excites the phosphor coating on the glass and causes it to glow. The strength of the beam determines the brightness of individual pixels (see CRT for a detailed description). The electric signal which drives the electron beam is amplified to hundreds of volts from TTL circuitry. This high frequency, high voltage signal creates electromagnetic radiation that has, according to Van Eck, [...] "a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal". The signal leaks out from displays and may be captured by an antenna, and once <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulses</b> are recreated and mixed in, an ordinary analog television receiver can display the result. The <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulses</b> can be recreated either through manual adjustment or by processing the signals emitted by electromagnetic coils as they deflect the CRT's electron beam back and forth.|$|R
50|$|A {{composite}} {{video signal}} combines on one wire the video information required to recreate a color picture, as well as line and frame <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulses.</b> The color video signal is a linear combination of the luminance of the picture, and a modulated subcarrier carries the chrominance or color information, a combination of hue and saturation. Details of the encoding process vary between the NTSC, PAL and SECAM systems.|$|R
50|$|Since it is {{the slave}} {{pendulum}} that releases the gravity lever, this synchronization {{is vital to the}} functioning of the clock. The synchronizing mechanism used a small spring attached to the shaft of the slave pendulum and an electromagnetic armature that would catch the spring if the slave pendulum was running slightly late, thus shortening the period of the slave pendulum for one swing. The slave pendulum was adjusted to run slightly slow, such that on approximately every other <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulse</b> the spring would be caught by the armature.|$|E

50|$|DAC {{word length}}s range usually from 6 to 10 bits. The SRAM's word length {{is three times}} the DAC's word length. The SRAM acts as a color lookup table (CLUT). It usually has 256 entries (and thus an 8-bit address). If the DAC's word length is also 8 bits, we have a 256 x 24-bit SRAM which allows a {{selection}} of 256 out of 16777216 (16,7 million) possible colors for the display. The contents of this SRAM can be altered when no pixel needs to be generated for transmission to the display. A <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulse</b> is required to maintain vertical picture stability. Therefore, a vertical blanking pulse is generated for every frame. This vertical blanking pulse is not visible on the display, nor is any pixel sent. Therefore, the D/A is idle and can allow the user to modify the SRAM color lookup table.|$|E

5000|$|For a color TV {{to recover}} hue {{information}} from the color subcarrier, it must have a zero phase reference to replace the previously suppressed carrier. The NTSC signal includes a short sample of this reference signal, known as the colorburst, located on the 'back porch' of each horizontal <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulse.</b> The color burst consists of a minimum of eight cycles of the unmodulated (fixed phase and amplitude) color subcarrier. The TV receiver has a [...] "local oscillator", which is synchronized with these color bursts. Combining this reference phase signal derived from the color burst with the chrominance signal's amplitude and phase allows {{the recovery of the}} 'I' and 'Q' signals which when combined with the Luminance information allows the reconstruction of a color image on the screen. Color TV has been said to really be colored TV because of the total separation of the brightness part of the picture from the color portion. In CRT televisions, the NTSC signal is turned into three color signals called Red, Green and Blue, each controlling that color electron gun. TV sets with digital circuitry use sampling techniques to process the signals but the end result is the same. For both analog and digital sets processing an analog NTSC signal, the original three color signals (Red, Green and Blue) are transmitted using three discrete signals (Luminance, I and Q) and then recovered as three separate colors and combined as a color image.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} a distribution/aggregation network that employs optical code {{division multiple access}} (OCDMA) to transmit information to a head-end node in a metropolitan area network. The head-end node transmits <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulses</b> and the nodes employ ranging techniques to offset the propagation delay, resulting in a quasi-synchronous reception at the receiver. The paper develops a methodology to design orthogonal OCDMA codes for such quasi-synchronous communication systems.

30|$|After {{successfully}} capturing <b>synchronization</b> <b>pulses,</b> {{the software}} begins {{to recognize the}} mode pulses. In the mode section, the first pulse is a wide pulse so the both states of T 1 and T 2 are all 1, which is unique in the whole sequence. Other cases of two adjacent locations with state 1 {{at the same time}} are illegal. When recognizing, we can also consider this wide pulse {{as a part of the}} synchronization section. The other two pulses in the mode determine the current data mode.|$|R
