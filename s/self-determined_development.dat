The article explores the consequences of linguistic choices for quality education, <b>self-determined</b> <b>development</b> and children’s rights in education. The analysis centers on {{a case study of}} a curriculum change in Zanzibar in which English has replaced Kiswahili as the language of instruction {{in the last years of}} primary school in Mathematics and Science subjects. The case study is grounded in an extensive review of theory and practices on the relationship between language of instruction, learning and rights in education. The field study researched the reasons behind the curriculum change, the extent to which schools were prepared for the change, and the consequences of the change for the learning environment. The article, therefore suggests that for the 21 st century, Africa should place emphasis on rights policies that promotes not only access, but also inclusion and quality education...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} language, language programs, {{and language}} projects {{to explore their}} power and potential for informing, guiding, and improving economic development efforts in the Hoopa Nation of Northern California. Studies have shown that when economic development projects conflict with cultural norms and values, they have either limited success, struggle to remain viable, or simply fail. Despite the crucial role that culture plays in economic development on reservations, scholars have developed neither the theory nor the research to help tribes, practitioners, foundation staff, and policymakers understand and manage the relationship between culture and economic development in order to pursue culturally sustainable projects. This article attempts to fill this gap by offering a new approach for understanding the key role of culture, {{as well as the}} power and potential of culture for shaping viable and broadly supported development projects and practices. This study examines the relationship between culture and economic development by drawing from a series of interviews with tribal leaders, development practitioners, business leaders, and tribal officials. It explores {{the ways in which the}} conceptualizations, discourses, and practices of Hoopa culture have the potential to inform and shape development projects and the ways in which they provide for greater efficacy. Language provides a medium by which critical cultural information can be accessed in support of <b>self-determined</b> economic <b>development</b> on the reservation. This <b>self-determined,</b> culturally informed <b>development</b> is understood as contributing to larger projects of community healing, nation building, and tribal sovereignty...|$|R
40|$|Western Maputaland {{is located}} in the borderlands of South Africa, Mozambique and Swaziland. The {{combination}} of poverty, rural remoteness and exceptional ecological diversity has long made the region a target of conservationists and development planners, locating it centrally within the Usuthu-Tembe-Futi Transfrontier Conservation Area (TFCA). While driven by the rhetoric of ‘participatory biodiversity management’, which links environmental conservation with economic development, the fulfillment of the transboundary project remains dependent upon exogenous resources and authority, and conservation agencies are ambivalent towards local demands for <b>self-determined</b> <b>development.</b> This paper examines the politics of land in Western Maputaland, its position in local memories, and its foundation in spatial practices and cultural identities. More specifically, as conservation developments have affected women differently to men, my analysis focuses on the ways in which mobilities and gender intersect in a changing landscape, and how meanings given to varying mobilities through sound, song and performance inflect local experiences of land, spatiality and belonging. Building on narratives inspired by the revival of mouth-bows and the jews harp, once performed by young women as walking songs, but remembered now by elderly women only, the paper discusses how memories invoked through sounding in place and motion rehearse and revitalize senses of place. Its aim is ultimately to provide witness to transboundary conservation planners for a more culturally integrated and economically apposite reimagining of southern African borderlandscapes...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{development}} is under immense scrutiny. By questioning what is development {{and development for}} whom?' a re-thinking of these practices is underway throughout the world. Critical development practitioners are seriously evaluating development' {{to better understand the}} divided views between the North and South from a richly interdisciplinary perspective. In my thesis, I present findings of a recent research project in which I sought the perspectives of eight Indigenous Maya leaders of El Quiché, Guatemala. Based on interviews conducted in September 2010 in the Guatemalan highland city of Santa Cruz del Quiché and surrounding area, I attempt to better understand the meaning(s) of the word development from an Indigenous perspective, and how a self-determined vision of life best suits local communities. Based on their lived experiences, the Indigenous Maya interviewees asserted that development' practices prescribed by the local government and country's elites, as well as outside non-government organizations and multinational corporations, are not {{in the best interests of}} the Indigenous population. I attempt to highlight how the imposition of the development' itself has become, to these leaders, synonymous with forms of racism, inequality, exclusion, oppression and a loss of Indigenous identity and culture. Rather, Maya leaders in El Quiché stress the right to <b>self-determined</b> <b>development,</b> cultural preservation and a more holistic vision of life for individuals and communities. [...] P. ii.

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the spatial}} impacts of public / private services and {{trade on the}} regional economy. Two different aspects are used in this context: an investigation on what is offered and, complementary to this, what is demanded. This approach might serve for a delimitation of buffer-zones and, in a broader sense, a methodology for economic zoning (2 ̆ 7 zonificación económica 2 ̆ 7) and spatial occupation (2 ̆ 7 ocupación del territorio 2 ̆ 7), two planning instruments frequently discussed in Bolivia and Peru. The southern buffer-zone of the Amboró National Park (Departamento Sta. Cruz / Bolivia) serves as a case study. For that reason, a summary of regional characteristics is presented: population, land use and land tenure, social and economic infrastructure, principal objectives of development planning on the Departamento and the Province level. The following aspects can be resumed as main findings: - The study region is situated closely {{to one of the}} most dynamic economic centers, Sta. Cruz, and on the basis of functional relations depends on this center. The high intensity of transport to and from Sta. Cruz reflects this very well. - Considering the number of villages located very closely to the National Park and the changes of its boundaries, it seems that the protected area was interpreted as a land reserve for colonization projects in the future. - The existing planning documents show a well developed basis for environmental planning. It is worth mentioning especially the case of the Florida Province Development Plan. - With reference to the internal spatial structure four sub-centers were identified: Los Negros, Mairana, Samaipata and Comarapa. Whereas Los Negros and Mairana assumed the function of economic centers, the principle administrative functions as well banking facilities and (limited) possibilities of higher education are still concentrated in Samaipata and Comarapa, the main colonial settlements of the region. Due to its intensive relations to the villages on the National Park boarder, all of them should be integrated in a future buffer-zone. - Tourism is concentrated around Samaipata, eco- tourism is still a rather exceptional activity in the region. - The institutional landscape of the region show a number of regional based institutions, an interesting potential for a <b>self-determined</b> <b>development</b> process. Finally, recommendations are presented to extend multidisciplinary investigations on buffer-zones in the future. The study forms part of a comparative investigation on different regions in the eastern slope of the Andes. For further information see as well the publications on the Alto Mayo region in Peru and the eastern buffer-zone of the Sangay National Park in Ecuador...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to popular conventional trekking tours {{that dominate the}} Northern Thai tourist industry, this thesis explores community-based ecotourism, one of the alternative strategies currently being used among highland minority groups and NGOs in Northern Thailand. Ecotourism offers a unique strategy that embraces local aspirations for achieving <b>self-determined</b> sustainable <b>development</b> and is promoted locally and globally as a mechanism of achieving economic development alongside environmental conservation. An analysis of findings from participant observation, interviews, and secondary data gathered during fieldwork in 2002 - 2003, suggests that community-based ecotourism is likely to achieve only limited success {{on a small scale}} in terms of the immediate benefits it generates in host communities. Since ecotourism is premised on the commodification of nature and culture, it seems unlikely that ecotourism, which links people, tourism and the natural and cultural environments, will be a successful avenue for achieving long-term sustainability...|$|R

Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from Angola and Nicaragua in Worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world’s market, and you support their <b>self-determined</b> sustainable <b>development.</b> The alternative trade movement blossomed, if not in sales, then {{at least in terms of}} dozens of ATOs being established on both sides of the Atlantic, of scores of Worldshops being set up, and of well-organized actions and campaigns attacking exploitation and foreign domination, and promoting the ideals of Nelson Mandela, Julius Nyerere and the Nicaraguan Sandinistas: the right to independence and self-determination, to equitable access to the world’s markets and consumers.|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores how {{students}} can be helped by learner autonomy-focused instruction to develop motivation in learning English in a Japanese university EFL setting. It also aims to ascertain the factors in learner autonomy support that account for its relationship with {{a higher degree of}} students’ motivation. Both quantitative and qualitative data from 21 students in the group with learner autonomy support (including metacognitive awareness-raising, instruction of learning strategies, and the use of extrinsic rewards) and 19 students who received the conventional instruction without learner autonomy support were analyzed. The focus of the analysis is to determine the trajectory of motivational development in terms of type and the students’ perception of their level of motivation using the self-determination theory (SDT) framework over 13 weeks of instruction in a university English course. Results suggest that students receiving learner autonomy support performed better and were more motivated than students who did not receive the support. They also indicate that increased and more <b>self-determined</b> motivational <b>development</b> occurred only in the students who received autonomy support.

They have complex needs which are often less to do with their ability to learn and more to do with aspects of confidence and levels of self-belief about achieving or feeling 'good enough' to participate. This article explores the relationship between the learner, the opportunities they have to engage with others and how learning and teaching strategies can be utilised to empower <b>self-determined</b> learning and <b>development.</b> An emerging paradigm of heutagogy or self-directed learning will be examined in the context of mature learners entering higher education for the first time. Supporting students in the process of reflective practice is ongoing, and this research provides a snapshot to determine whether students {{are on their way to}} taking control of their own learning and meaning-making about early childhood concepts and their implementation into practice...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change and}} global {{commodity}} demands have increased {{access to and}} feasibility of extracting natural resources in Arctic regions. As a result, Nunavut is now poised to compete on the global market for oil, gas, minerals, and precious metals. The impacts of increasing resource exploration and development activities on nearby communities therefore require study. In particular, new methodologies are needed to explore how adjacent communities can harness the economic potential of resource extraction toward goals of self-sufficiency, sustainability, and cultural continuity while minimizing the associated risks. Using the predominantly Inuit community of Pond Inlet, Nunavut, as a case study, this thesis uses an article format to introduce the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development’s ‘nation building’ conceptual framework, {{as well as a}} post-colonial theory to explore resource development in the Canadian Arctic context. The nation building framework is a well-established and validated approach to understanding economic development in Indigenous society that has been refined and used in hundreds of case studies over the past three decades. Based on interviews with residents and regional decision-makers, {{it was found that the}} community of Pond Inlet currently lacks the self-determination and effective institutions needed to implement local strategies for prosperity due to a number of complex factors, including educational and capacity deficiencies; infrastructure needs; as well as a centralized decision-making structure that poorly matches local culture and serves to alienate residents. As a result, the anticipated resource boom in Arctic Canada is in danger of indirectly repeating the colonial legacy of assimilation, this time justified by contemporary economic reasons, instead of providing the region with an inclusive, balanced economic development approach in line with local ideas for development and cultural continuity. This thesis follows the article format and is organized into four chapters: Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter. Chapter 2 is the first of two articles in the thesis titled: Community and Economic Development in Arctic Canada (CEDAC) – Understanding factors that contribute toward <b>self-determined</b> sustainable community <b>development.</b> Chapter 3 is the second of two articles in the thesis titled: Community and Economic Development in Arctic Canada (CEDAC) – Mining in Nunavut: A new path to prosperity or re‐paving old paths of colonial rule?
