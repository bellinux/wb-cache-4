ISE took the initiative to introduce <b>system</b> <b>audit</b> of brokers in 2002 and made it compulsory for maintaining internal control on members. To increase market transparency and improve its surveillance capacity, the Unique (Client) Identification Number (UIN) System was launched at pre trade level in August 2006 in ISE. Also a new risk management structure (RMS) was introduced in December 2006 in ISE. New RMS included, among others, a new netting regime; a margining system based on value at risk (VAR) and capital adequacy. The VAR is a state of the art risk management system practiced internationally that takes into account risk associated with each share based on historical data. <b>System</b> <b>audit</b> of brokers was introduced in 2003 and made necessary.|$|E

50|$|For Building Automation and Controls Systems - BACS, eu.bac {{set up the}} Certification Scheme for Energy Efficiency Performance of BACS at {{delivery}} and system lifetime. Except for this system, no reliable standards to help building owners ensure that buildings (new or refurbished) have the best available BACS technology. No standards are available to help building owners ensure that their building keeps performing as well as {{when it was first}} commissioned. The closest match to these requirements is the EN 15232 standard (Energy performance of buildings - Impact of Building Automation, Controls and Building Management) which is the base of the eu.bac <b>system</b> <b>audit.</b> The System Certification Scheme of eu.bac addresses the principal difficulty in the BACS industry that systems may not be installed and used so as to achieve available efficiencies. It also addresses the tendency of systems to deteriorate without proper maintenance. The recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2002/91/EC) attempts to reduce EU energy consumption by 5-6% (60-80 Mtoe) by 2020. The scope of the Directive includes existing buildings undergoing renovation.|$|E

5000|$|A North Dakota University <b>System</b> <b>audit</b> report {{released}} in February 2012 {{found that the}} school had relaxed standards and waived some requirements to increase enrollment of foreign students and had, {{over a period of}} several years, awarded degrees to 584 foreign students who had not completed the required coursework. The report was a followup of an earlier meeting between Dickinson officials ant the Higher Learning Commission at which the DSU officials [...] "realized they may have an issue with one or more of the HLC’s requirements surrounding academic agreements". Most of the university's foreign students came from China, where the university employed recruiting agents who falsely claimed to be university employees and sometimes misrepresented the university's programs. News media accounts described the audit report as depicting Dickinson State as a degree mill. The audit had been requested by the university's president, Douglas Coston, who took office in January 2012, after some university international agreements were found not to conform with requirements of the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education and the Higher Learning Commission. On the day of the audit release, the Dean of education committed suicide. Six months later, in July, Dickinson's regional accreditor placed the university [...] "on notice," [...] requiring the university provide detailed responses to concerns found in the accreditor's recent site visit.|$|E

We analyzed the HSA-TFL-ES in five different samples with a total number of 1, 718 workers at five sectors. Exploratory Factor Analysis corroborated a single factor in all samples that accounted for 66 % to 73 % of variance. The internal consistency in all samples was good (α =. 92 -. 95). Evidence was found for the convergent validity of the HSA-TFL-ES and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. These results suggested that the HSA-TFL short-scale is a psychometrically sound measure of this construct and can be used for a combined and first overall measurement...|$|E

This index combines the results for individual employees (quality of working life) and for organizations (quality of human capital). To measure the HPRQI, we used data taken from questionnaires administered to a sample of 1785 subjects from 15 organizations and analyzed the correlations between this index and the items and indexes of each of the dimensions and constructs on the general HSA model (Human <b>System</b> <b>Audit),</b> on which the concept is based. Significant results were obtained (p 0. 001) in most cases. The t tests also obtained significant results (p 0. 001) that confirm the capacity of the index to discriminate between employees. The final version of the HPRQ correlated significantly with the different indexs of the dimensions that comprise it, according to the HSA model (Human <b>System</b> <b>Audit).</b> The results obtained so far have confirmed the hypothesis proposed, and provide orientations for producing and validating a construct in the future...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the use and effect of a role-playing game on learners’ ability in information <b>systems</b> <b>audit.</b> The study is based on experimental research. Information <b>systems</b> control and <b>audit</b> case study and video had been developed.

The findings suggested that the role-playing game did enhance participants’ perceived knowledgeability, perceived ability to perform actual tasks, and perceived enjoyment of learning. However,  learning only occurred if the lecturer {{was involved in the}} game. The lecturer had to instruct and provide guidelines to students to perform information <b>systems</b> <b>audit</b> throughout the game. The study also finds an initial relationship between players’ enjoyment and their knowledgeability. In addition, the study indicates the correlation between players’ enjoyment and their ability to perform the actual information <b>systems</b> <b>auditing</b> tasks. </span...|$|R
