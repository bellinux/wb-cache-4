50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a <b>single-start</b> <b>thread</b> with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring gears, have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|E
50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical planetary roller screw are the screw shaft, nut and planetary roller. The screw, a shaft with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the screw and encapsulated by a threaded nut. The thread of the screw is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction transmission elements between screw and nut. The rollers typically have a <b>single-start</b> <b>thread</b> with convex flanks that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with screw and nut. The rollers typically orbit the screw as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as planetary, or satellite, rollers. As with a lead screw or ball screw, rotation of the nut results in screw travel, and rotation of the screw results in nut travel.|$|E
50|$|The pitch P is the {{distance}} between thread peaks. For UTS <b>threads,</b> which are <b>single-start</b> <b>threads,</b> it {{is equal to the}} lead, the axial distance that the screw advances during a 360° rotation. UTS threads do not usually use the pitch parameter; instead a parameter known as threads per inch (TPI) is used, which is the reciprocal of the pitch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{amount of}} {{rotation}} of an accurately made screw {{can be directly}} and precisely correlated to {{a certain amount of}} axial movement (and vice versa), through the constant known as the screw's lead (...) [...] A screw's lead is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn (360°). (In most threads is, in all <b>single-start</b> <b>threads,</b> lead and pitch refer to essentially the same concept.) ...|$|R
