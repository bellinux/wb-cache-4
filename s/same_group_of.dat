5|$|The <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> {{officers}} approached Tomlinson {{outside a}} Montblanc store {{at the southern}} end of Royal Exchange Passage, near the junction with Cornhill. He was walking slowly with his hands in his pockets; according to an eyewitness, he was saying that he was trying to get home.|$|E
5|$|Antigonid Macedonian kings {{relied on}} various {{regional}} officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, {{such as the}} military strategos and the politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a large city (polis), {{as well as the}} politico-religious office of the epistates. No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been chosen among the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> aristocratic philoi and hetairoi who filled vacancies for army officers.|$|E
5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E
5000|$|Several related {{books have}} been {{published}} by the <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> authors. These books {{were based on a}} similar underlying philosophy, and also included the phrase [...] "Laurel's Kitchen" [...] in the title: ...|$|R
25|$|The north {{field is}} still popular for general aviation, {{although}} {{only one of}} its runways, 04/22, is still in use. There {{are a number of}} aircraft component repair facilities located within the <b>same</b> <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> buildings as the Ottawa Flying Club.|$|R
25|$|Taça Rio is {{the second}} stage of the competition. Teams are divided into the two <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> Taça Guanabara, but each team plays against every team from the other group once. The top team from each group compete in the semi-finals with second team from the {{opposite}} <b>group,</b> and winners <b>of</b> the semi-finals compete for the Taça Rio.|$|R
5|$|In 1998, a fragmentary fossil {{of another}} species of this <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> oryzomyines {{was found in}} eastern Argentina. It was {{initially}} identified as a possible second species of Noronhomys {{on the basis of}} the presence of a crest on the upper first molar, the mesoloph, but the specimen is different from Noronhomys vespuccii in other respects, and in 2008 it was described as a new genus and species, Carletonomys cailoi, related to Noronhomys and associated genera.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Richard Apps and Martin Garwicz {{summarized}} {{evidence that}} microzones themselves {{form part of}} a larger entity they call a multizonal microcomplex. Such a microcomplex includes several spatially separated cortical microzones, all of which project to the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> deep cerebellar neurons, plus a group of coupled olivary neurons that project to all of the included microzones {{as well as to the}} deep nuclear area.|$|E
5|$|In late July, a {{boy named}} John Billington became lost for {{some time in the}} woods around the colony. It was {{reported}} that he was found by the Nauset, the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Native Americans on Cape Cod from whom the Pilgrims had unwittingly stolen corn seed the prior year upon their first explorations. The English organized a party to return Billington to Plymouth. The Pilgrims agreed to reimburse the Nauset for the corn which they had taken in return for the Billington boy. This negotiation did much to secure further peace with the Native Americans in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Teaneck Public Schools had a Budgetary Per Pupil Cost of $18,417 in its 2012–13 budget, 26.8% {{higher than}} the average of $14,519 budgeted that year by districts in the <b>same</b> <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> grades and enrollment, ranked as the 101st highest among the 106 K-12 districts in the state with more than 3,500 students.|$|R
50|$|Realm's {{development}} {{began in}} the end of 2010 by Alexander Stigsen, along with Bjarne Christiansen, under the name TightDB. The company started in 2011 at Y Combinator.It was promoted as NoSQL with configurable durability, and the ability to share the <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> data across multiple processes, but also even multiple devices and clusters.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Janet gets pregnant, the {{officers}} are baited into chasing a reckless driver {{into an apartment}} complex, where they are ambushed by the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Latino gang members. They fight their way into an alley, where Taylor is shot in the chest. As Zavala desperately attends to his partner, the assassins arrive and shoot him {{several times in the}} back, killing him. Police backup eventually arrives and the gangsters are brutally slain after refusing to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} in acquiring Masters badges {{has made the}} tournament {{one of the largest}} events on the secondary-ticket market. A majority of the badges for the Masters are delivered to the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> patrons, fans, and members each year, and these perennial ticket holders sometimes decide to sell their badges through large ticket marketplaces such as StubHub, TicketCity, and VividSeats. Some of these marketplaces will allow fans to purchase a Masters badge for a single day, as opposed to the traditional 4-day pass.|$|E
5|$|The {{throwing}} events involve hurling {{an implement}} (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on {{the distance that}} the object is thrown. Combined events involve the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> athletes contesting {{a number of different}} track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.|$|E
50|$|The <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> {{students}} {{can apply for}} European Classes, an English language debate forum in which the institution has been participating since 1994. Participants—imitating the European Parliament —discuss topics concerning the continent’s economical and political hardships while connecting to other institutions’ regularly attending students from Romania, Denmark and Germany thus becoming acquainted with their cultures.|$|R

5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the California {{legislature}} {{passed a}} statute authorizing the California Attorney General to bring claims {{on behalf of}} the tribes in the Court of Claims. The next year, Congress passed a statute granting that court jurisdiction for such claims. California Attorney General Earl Warren (future Chief Justice) finally argued the case in 1941. The court found liability but indicated it would not award pre-judgment interest, and the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari. Warren negotiated a $5M settlement. After the passage of the Indian Claims Commission Act, the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> tribes struggled to bring a single action for recovery under the broader claims allowed under the ICCA, which settled for $29M.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen's {{recent work}} has {{concentrated}} on further large-scale collaborations with the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of species richness and geographical range size {{did not show}} the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it {{did not appear to}} apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after controlling for species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{collects}} {{arguments to}} present that the consumption- and emission {{characteristics of the}} rail and inland navigation modes {{are very close to}} each other. Considering that these modes are able to transport more or less the <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> goods, it is a much better way to develop them within an integrated transport policy than trying to bring arguments for one of them against the other...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of SUNCT {{often lead}} to {{misdiagnosis}} as paroxysmal hemicrania, which is also categorized in the <b>same</b> <b>group.</b> Inefficiency <b>of</b> indomethacin usually indicates SUNCT over paroxysmal hemicrania.|$|R
50|$|Sixteen {{teams of}} the {{competition}} are divided into the two <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> Taça Guanabara, which is previously held. However, unlike Taça Guanabara, each team of Taça Rio play against every team <b>of</b> the other <b>group,</b> rather than teams <b>of</b> the <b>same</b> <b>group,</b> once. The top team from each group play against the second team <b>of</b> the other <b>group</b> in the semi-finals in a single match, with the winner qualified for the final {{of the competition}}. The winner of Taça Rio plays against the winner of Taça Guanabara in the Campeonato Carioca Final.|$|R
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt, near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds, including the Trait du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutré, this is not true. Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct equines have been found at Solutré, {{but there is no}} evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the Trait du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of the Trait du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and the Trait du Nord share the same ancestry, and the Trait du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch Heavy Draft, Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred.|$|E
25|$|Phytoestrogen content {{varies in}} {{different}} foods, and may vary significantly within the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> foods (e.g. soy beverages, tofu) depending on processing mechanisms {{and type of}} soybean used. Legumes (in particular soybeans), whole grain cereals, and some seeds are high in phytoestrogens.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{resilience}} {{is defined}} as an individual's ability to successfully adapt to life tasks {{in the face of}} social disadvantage or highly adverse conditions. A year later, the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> researchers created tools to look at systems that support development of resilience.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{reports on}} some change in {{endogenous}} auxin content in black poplar inflorescences and infructescences {{in the course}} of their development. The <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> auxin were present in both inflorescences and infructescences examined. The maximum activity of auxin was found in male as well as female inflorescences about 3, 5 cm long. The female ones, however, showed a higher level of total auxin content than the males...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between into microbial {{use and the}} development of resistance to antimicrobials has been demonstrated through both external models and has been observed clinically. However, the strength of this relationship in practical production systems has not been clearly quantified. We designed this study to examine the strength of the {{relationship between}} use of antimicrobials and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistence among Salmonella spp. collected from the <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> growing pig...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{conditions}} for extracting hair follicle proteins by a modified wax-sheet technique were studied {{with reference to}} the yields and electrophoretic mobilities of the proteins obtained from different tissue preparations. Proteins were extracted more readily from dispersed hair-roots on wax-sheets than from intact hair-root suspensions. Dilute salt solutions and urea solubilized the <b>same</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> follicle proteins, estimated by starch-gel electrophoresis, although the yields were less with the former...|$|R
25|$|In {{the lottery}} game, {{they were allowed}} to bet only on low numbers (from 1 through 30), and all {{belonging}} to the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 10. In case of a draw of five numbers of that kind, the Romans said that on that day in the ghetto there was taking place a great feast.|$|E
25|$|Anand had the <b>same</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> seconds {{who helped}} his {{preparation}} in World Chess Championship 2008: Peter Heine Nielsen, Rustam Kasimdzhanov, Surya Ganguly and Radosław Wojtaszek. In a post-match interview Anand mentioned that Magnus Carlsen and Garry Kasparov had also helped him in preparation and that Vladimir Kramnik helped during the match.|$|E
