25|$|The signal {{entering}} a compressor is split, one copy {{sent to a}} variable-gain amplifier {{and the other to}} a side-chain where the <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> is measured and a circuit controlled by the measured <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> applies the required gain to the amplifier. This design, known as a feed-forward type, is used today in most compressors. Earlier designs were based on a feedback layout where the <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> was measured after the amplifier.|$|E

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of direct path with no trees, {{attenuated}} direct, and tree scattered <b>signal</b> <b>levels</b> at 1. 3 GHz. Signals were received in two small groves of mixed hardwood trees. In the groves studied, average total <b>signal</b> <b>levels</b> were about 13 dB below adjacent no-trees locations, with attenuated direct <b>signal</b> <b>levels</b> about 14. 6 dB below the no-trees case and scattered signals about 17. 3 dB below the no-trees case. A simple model for land mobile satellite service (LMSS) propagation in groves of trees is proposed. The model assumes a constant scattered signal contribution at 17 dB below no-trees levels added to an attenuated direct signal which varies, depending on the number and density of trees in the direct path. When total <b>signal</b> <b>levels</b> are strong, the attenuated direct signal dominates.

Automixers {{are used in}} live sound reinforcement to maintain a steady limit on the overall <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> of the microphones; if a public address system is set up so that one microphone will not feed back, then, in general, multiple microphones will not feed back if they are automixed. The equivalent number of open mics (NOM) present at {{the output of the}} automixer is kept low, regardless of the actual number of open mics.|$|E
25|$|While {{some might}} say that Nakamichi {{violated}} the tape recording standards to achieve the highest dynamics possible, producing non-compatible cassettes for playback on other machines, {{the reasons for this}} are more complex than they appear on the surface. Different interpretations of the cassette standard resulted in a 4dB ambiguity at 16kHz. Technically, both camps in this debate were still within the original cassette specification as no tolerance for frequency response was provided above 12.5kHz and all calibration tones above 12.5kHz are considered optional. But also Nakamichi is not error-prone. Decreasing noise at 16kHz also decreases the maximum <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> at 16kHz, the HighFrequency-Dynamics stay almost constant.|$|E
25|$|FM {{provides}} improved Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), {{as compared}} for example with AM. Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> called the noise threshold, but above {{a higher level}} – the full improvement or full quieting threshold – the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5-15dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.|$|E

Although many applications use RS-485 <b>signal</b> <b>levels,</b> the speed, format, and protocol of the data transmission is not specified by RS-485.

40|$|Use of high {{frequency}} ripple signals {{for the control}} of loads such as off-peak hot water systems and street lighting systems is common within distribution utilities. Although injected <b>signal</b> <b>levels</b> are small and within stipulated limits, in distribution systems dominated by underground cables the <b>signal</b> <b>levels</b> received at the load ends can be relatively large due to resonance. One significant problem associated with the excessive <b>signal</b> <b>levels</b> is racing digital clocks caused by the additional zero crossings of the mains waveform.

25|$|At {{one time}} three-pin XLR {{connectors}} {{were also used}} extensively on loudspeaker cables, as when first introduced they represented a new standard of ruggedness, and economic alternatives were not readily available. Often, two-conductor loudspeaker cable had three-pin female connectors on both ends, to distinguish it from a three-conductor shielded <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> cable, which has a female connector {{at one end and}} a male at the other. Either pin 2 or 3 was live, depending on the manufacturer, with pin 1 always the 'earthy' return. This usage is now both obsolete and dangerous to equipment but is still sometimes encountered, especially on older equipment. For example, some loudspeakers have a built-in male connector as an input connector for speaker-level signal. This use was superseded in professional audio applications by the Neutrik Speakon connector.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawback}} of SECAM {{for production}} is that, unlike PAL or NTSC, certain post-production operations of encoded SECAM signals {{are not really}} possible without a significant drop in quality. As an example, a simple fade to black is trivial in NTSC and PAL: you just reduce the <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> until it is zero. However, in SECAM the color difference signals, which are frequency modulated, need first to be decoded to e.g. RGB, then the fade-to-black is applied, and finally the resulting signal is re-encoded into SECAM. Because of this, much SECAM video editing was actually done using PAL equipment, then the resultant signal was converted to SECAM. Another drawback of SECAM is that comb filtering, allowing better color separation, is not possible in TV receivers. This was not, however, much of a drawback {{in the early days}} of SECAM as such filters did not become readily available in high-end TV sets before the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Precoding is multi-stream beamforming, in {{the narrowest}} definition. In more general terms, it is {{considered}} to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (single-stream) beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain – by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively – and to reduce the multipath fading effect. In line-of-sight propagation, beamforming results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by multipath propagation. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the <b>signal</b> <b>level</b> at all of the receive antennas, and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that precoding requires knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.|$|E
