5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the first Sphecomyrma fossils, there were no fossil records of any ants from Cretaceous amber and the oldest social insects at the time extended back to the Eocene epoch; the earliest known ant at the time was described from a forewing found in the Claiborne Formation in Tennessee. The great diversity of ant fossils found in the Baltic amber and Florissant shales of the Oligocene and in the Sicilian amber of the Miocene have prompted entomologists to search for ants of Cretaceous age that may link ants and non-social wasps together. Such a link may shed light on the early origins of ants, but no fossils of any <b>social</b> <b>insect</b> existed before S. freyi was discovered, thus the early evolution of ants remained a mystery. Only a single hymenopterous Upper Cretaceous fossil {{has been the subject of}} possible significance to the evolution of aculeate wasps and ants. A single forewing was discovered in Siberia and described in 1957 as Cretavus sibiricus, with the author noting that the wing ventation closely resembles those of bethylid or scoliid wasps, of which these families of wasps have close connections with the origin of ants. However, there were several problems: as the fossil was only a single wing, scientists could not explain or answer whether or not the insect had key diagnostic body traits that would even place it within the subclade Aculeata.|$|E

25|$|P. dominula is a <b>social</b> <b>insect</b> {{that lives}} in colonies. They are haplodiploid insects, as are other Polistes species. The haploid males produce {{identical}} haploid sperm, and diploid females produce haploid eggs through meiosis. In most social insects, colonies are composed of related individuals, and social insects are assumed to help close relatives according to W. D. Hamilton's theory of kin selection. However, in P. dominula, 35% of the nest mates are unrelated. In many other species, unrelated individuals only help the queen when no other options are present. In this case, subordinates work for unrelated queens even when other options may be present. No other <b>social</b> <b>insect</b> submits to unrelated queens in this way. This seemingly unfavorable behavior parallels some vertebrate systems. This unrelated assistance may be evidence of altruism in P. dominula.|$|E

Because of the often limited quantities and limited precision of data from which to calculate parameters values in non-human behavior studies, such models should generally be kept simple.

25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>insect</b> {{males are}} {{often seen as}} mating machines, with an undiscriminating eagerness to mate. However, males {{encounter}} costs of unsuccessful mating in terms of energy investment. Therefore, P. dominula males are able to recognize female castes and preferentially choose reproductive females to workers, regardless of health or age. Males are able to differentiate castes through perceiving differences in chemical signals and physiological status. While males are able to discriminate between castes, they are not capable of discriminating between health, as males showed a strong preference for gynes, both healthy and parasite-castrated, compared to workers, because males distinguish females by CHC profiles, which are very similar between healthy and unhealthy gynes. Therefore, males {{are not able to}} evaluate the true reproductive potential of the females they encounter.|$|E

25|$|Vespula squamosa, the {{southern}} yellowjacket, {{is a social}} wasp. This species can be identified by its distinctive black and yellow patterning and orange queen. These yellowjackets are typically found in the eastern United States, and its territory extends {{as far south as}} eastern Mexico and Guatemala. Within these territories, they create enormous, multiple-comb nests. The colonies may be either annual or perennial depending on the climate, and in many perennial nests, polygyny takes place. In addition, this species uses pheromones both as a sexual attractant and an alarm signal. This species feeds on insects and animal carcasses; it does not produce honey. V. squamosa, a <b>social</b> <b>insect,</b> has developed a parasitic relationship with the species V. vidua and V. maculifrons. Due to their painful, venomous stings, the species is considered a pest.|$|E
25|$|Colony-level {{inhibitory}} {{strategies can}} also create 'organizational immunity'. For example, <b>social</b> <b>insect</b> workers tend to work initially at {{the centre of}} the nest, nursing the brood, and as they age adopt tasks {{closer and closer to the}} periphery, e.g., foraging. This compartmentalization, termed centrifugal polyethism, means that workers of the same age interact mainly with others of the same age, who are performing the same task in the same spatial compartment: thus if a new disease arises that is transmitted through physical worker-worker contact it is limited to one section of the colony. The spatial structuring of western honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera) privileges young individuals-when colonies are afflicted with diseases that have a short infectious period (the time period during which infected individuals can transmit the disease to susceptible individuals), it is confined only to the older individuals closer to the outside. In the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens), workers who feed larvae tend to remain near {{the centre of the}} nest even when not performing this activity, and the converse is true for workers who forage; 11–13% of workers remain in small zones a particular distance from the nest centre throughout their life. The demographic distribution of a colony can also can be utilized for antiparasite purposes: work on Z. angusticollis has shown that not only are there differences to parasite susceptibility between instars but that the demographic constitution of a group significantly affects survivorship (mixed age groups do better than single-age groups). The effect of colony structuring on disease dynamics and social immunity is also analyzed theoretically using mathematical models.|$|E

Human social group-based endeavors, such as political parties, communities, geopolitical organizations, war, and terrorist networks are also considered CAS.

2500|$|Task {{allocation}} {{within a}} <b>social</b> <b>insect</b> colony can be modeled using a network-based approach, in which workers {{are represented by}} nodes, which are connected by edges that signify inter-node interactions. [...] Workers performing a common task form highly connected clusters, with weaker links across tasks. These weaker, cross-task connections are important for allowing task-switching to occur between clusters. This approach is potentially problematic because connections between workers are not permanent, and some information is broadcast globally, e.g. through pheromones, and therefore does not rely on interaction networks. One alternative approach to avoid this pitfall is to treat tasks as nodes and workers as fluid connections.|$|E
2500|$|To {{demonstrate}} how {{time and space}} constraints of individual-level interactions affect colony function, <b>social</b> <b>insect</b> network approaches can also incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics.

40|$|I present {{evidence}} that humans have evolved convergently to <b>social</b> <b>insects</b> {{with regard to}} a large suite of social, ecological and reproductive phenotypes.

[...] Unlike other wasp species, P. colobopterus has multiple queens. It can be difficult to explain the occurrence of sociality in populations where individuals are not necessarily directly related, such as this wasp. However, relatedness remains high enough that sociality is a beneficial strategy. P. colobopterus demonstrates that organisms do not necessarily need to have extreme differentiation between castes in order to maintain a successful, highly social system.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dominant}} {{theory of}} explaining the self-organized {{division of labor}} in <b>social</b> <b>insect</b> societies such as honey bee colonies is the Response-Threshold Model. [...] It predicts that individual worker bees have inherent thresholds to stimuli associated with different tasks. [...] Individuals with the lowest thresholds will preferentially perform that task. [...] Stimuli could include the “search time” that elapses while a foraging bee waits to unload her nectar and pollen to a receiver bee at the hive, the smell of diseased brood cells, or any other combination of environmental inputs that an individual worker bee encounters. [...] The Response-Threshold Model only provides for effective task allocation in the honey bee colony if thresholds are varied among individual workers. [...] This variation originates from the considerable genetic diversity among worker daughters of a colony due to the queen’s multiple matings.|$|E
2500|$|The genetic {{homogeneity}} of insect colonies makes them theoretically susceptible to infection en masse; the high similarity {{of each group}} members genome means that each is susceptible (and resistant) to the same parasites, whilst experimental manipulation has demonstrated that genetically heterogenous colonies of B. terrestris have lower levels of parasite infection than homogenous colonies. To increase genetic diversity, colonies can {{increase the number of}} queens and/or increase the number of mating partners a queen has— it is thought these social immune benefits may explain the seemingly costly polyandry found in <b>social</b> <b>insect</b> colonies. Social Hymenoptera also have exceptionally high rates of meiotic recombination when compared against a wide range of higher eukaryote taxa which further increases genetic diversity. [...] Ongoing theoretical and empirical work is seeking to tease out the scenarios in which these immune benefits of genetic heterogeneity can be negated due to concomitant costs, e.g., the increased intra-colony conflict and/or susceptibility to an increasing number of parasites which comes with increased genetic diversity.|$|E
