40|$|ABSTRACT Several {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} measure the effects of extender pH, size and type of storage vessel, insemination dose volume, and frequency of insemination on the motility and fertilizing capacity <b>of</b> turkey <b>semen</b> held 6 hr at 15 C. The fertilizing capacity and motility of both unstored and stored turkey sperm were depressed more when diluted in Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender at pH 5. 5 than at pH 6. 5 or 6. 0. The fertility <b>of</b> <b>stored</b> <b>semen</b> was impaired when agitated for 6 hr regardless {{of the type of}} storage vessel used. Sperm motility was higher when semen was held in flasks than when held in tubes. There were no differences in fertility of hens inseminated with. 025,. 05, or. 10 cm 3 of either unstored or stored semen during the first 10 weeks of egg production. However, fertility differences between unstored and stored semen were noted with all insemination doses late in the production period. Hens inseminated every 7 days with unstored semen maintained a constant level of fertility (+ 90 %) for the 20 -week production period, whereas the fertility of hens inseminated at 10 - or 14 -day intervals was lower in Weeks 11 to 20.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} the microbiological quality <b>of</b> <b>stored</b> <b>semen</b> specimens processed for artificial insemination by a donor (AID), we developed a PCR assay targeting the chlamydial plasmid to detect Chlamydia trachomatis in semen. The lower limit of detection of this assay corresponded to 2. 5 to 5 elementary bodies per microl <b>of</b> <b>semen.</b> A total <b>of</b> 669 cryopreserved ejaculates from 97 asymptomatic donors were tested for C. trachomatis infection. Twelve ejaculates, originating from four donors, {{were found to be}} positive, indicating a 4 % prevalence of C. trachomatis infection among the donor population studied. Cross-contamination between the cryopreserved specimens in the storage container was studied by typing using sequence analysis of PCR-amplified omp 1 genes of the strains. Two donors were infected with serovar E, one was infected with serovar F, and one was infected with serovar K. For two donors, the duration of C. trachomatis positivity could be assessed. One donor donated C. trachomatis-positive semen for at least 4 successive months, and the other did so for at least 16 months. The occurrence of C. trachomatis infection in cryopreserved donor semen indicates that ejaculates from donors not tested for a C. trachomatis infection just prior to donation should be tested for infection by a direct test such as the PCR described here.

40|$|Increased global use {{of highly}} {{productive}} breeds of farm animals has been coupled to loss of genetic diversity in most species. In European countries, various governmental, non-governmental, and private organizations try to preserve genetic diversity of livestock in situ (e. g., by stimulating {{the use of}} indigenous, rare breeds by farmers; in nature reserves; or in noncommercial farms). In the case of poultry, maintaining in situ populations of the noncommercial (fancy) breeds largely relies on hobby farmers. In addition to in situ conservation, gene banks are being established for ex situ conservation. In at least 2 countries, France and The Netherlands, there are limited collections <b>of</b> frozen <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> rare poultry breeds. Since 2003, the CGN has started with a more systematic effort to collect, freeze, and <b>store</b> <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> indigenous Dutch poultry breeds.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} experiments {{undertaken to}} evaluate the usefulness of selected physicochemical indices <b>of</b> <b>semen,</b> cell membrane integrity and sperm chromatin structure for the assessment <b>of</b> boar <b>semen</b> sensitivity to processes connected with pre-insemination procedures. The experiments were carried out on 30 boars: including 15 regarded as providers <b>of</b> sensitive <b>semen</b> and 15 regarded as providers <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> that is little sensitive to laboratory processing. The selection of boars for both groups was based on sperm morphology analyses, assuming secondary morphological change incidence in spermatozoa as the criterion. Two ejaculates were manually collected from each boar at an interval of 3 to 4 months. The following analyses were carried out for each ejaculate: sperm motility assessment, sperm pH measurement, sperm morphology assessment, sperm chromatin structure evaluation and cell membrane integrity assessment. The analyses were performed three times. Semen storage did not cause {{an increase in the}} incidence of secondary morphological changes in the group of boars considered to provide sperm of low sensitivity. On the other hand, with continued storage there was a marked increase in the incidence of spermatozoa with secondary morphological changes in the group of boars regarded as producing more sensitive <b>semen.</b> Ejaculates <b>of</b> group I boars evaluated directly after collection had an approximately 6 % smaller share of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes than the ejaculates of boars in group II (p≤ 0. 05).

40|$|The use <b>of</b> equine frozen <b>semen</b> has {{variable}} results. Pregnancy rates per cycle may {{be between}} 10 to 70 %. Although an inseminating dose of 280 a 320 millones progressive motile sperm (PMS) has been recommended, under experimental {{conditions it is}} posible to obtain acceptable results with doses of 50 to 100 millones PMS. Deep intrauterine insemination is prefered when using frozen thawed semen, which consists in depositing the dose {{at the tip of}} the horn, ipsiltateral to ovulation. Young mares usually have better uterine condition and that increase their chance of become pregnant. It is important to make a correct follicular monitoring, in order to determine the right time to induce ovulation. Ovulation may be induced with Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) or deslorelin. It posible to perform a fixed time insemination or to choose an ultrasound follicular following protocol, inseminating within 6 h of ovulation. This option offers the best prenancy rates.

40|$|Artificial Insemination (AI) is {{the single}} most {{important}} tool in facilitating the genetic improvement of dairy cows. Both frozen and liquid semen are used in AI, however the majority (~ 95 %) of insemination doses worldwide (and in Ireland) employ use <b>of</b> frozen <b>semen</b> (Vishwanath & Shannon, 2000). Only 5 % of insemination doses used in Ireland are liquid semen, however, during peak breeding season of April and May, this number could rise to 25 %. Use <b>of</b> frozen <b>semen</b> in AI has the benefit of long term storage as it causes the biochemical and developmental changes in sperm to stop, however, after the freeze thaw process, more than 50 % of sperm cells are damaged (Vishwanath & Shannon, 2000), meaning a higher concentration of sperm cells per dose is required and therefore, less insemination doses per ejaculate are achieved. The use <b>of</b> <b>stored</b> fresh <b>semen</b> would remove this problem of damaged sperm cells after a freeze thaw process. Liquid semen would also allow a lower concentration of sperm cells per insemination dose, thereby, maximising the use <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> from high genetic merit bulls. It has been reported that although liquid bull semen maintains motility for up to 4 weeks post collection, in vivo fertility declines significantly after 4 - 5 days post collection (Vishwanath & Shannon, 1997). The reason for this sudden drop in fertility remains to be elucidated; however, it could be attributed to a number of factors, such as changes in the lipid profile and a subsequent loss in cell membrane fluidity, perhaps due to attack from reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of long chain fatty acids to bull sperm in vitro may have a stabilising effect on the sperm membrane, through fatty acids constituents being incorporated into the sperm cell membrane, as reported in a study by Neill & Masters (1971) or by inhibiting or reducing the lipid peroxidation (LPO) of the sperm membrane, which is high in polyunsaturated fatty acids...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Pilocarpine (50 mg) {{administered}} to the boar 20 min before semen collection had no detectable effect on either ejaculation or semen composition. However, the volume <b>of</b> fluid <b>semen,</b> the total volume <b>of</b> <b>semen,</b> and the time required for ejaculation differed significantly(P< 0 =. 1) between breeds ofboars.

40|$|In the {{previous}} paper(Hiraiwa and Uchida, 2 ̆ 755) we experimentally studied that the spermatozoa {{introduced into the}} uterus of the bat, PiPistrellus abramus abramus(Temminck) in the autumn are able to retain their fertilizing capacity for 118 days and fertilize the ova which have been discharged from the ovary in the spring. In this case, how are the spermatozoa stored in the uterus? Looking over the literatures one notes that most former workers generally believed that the spermatozoa stored in the bat uterus in the winter {{are in a very}} active state. We have some doubts, however, whether the semen stored in the uterus during such a long period retain similar conditions in their properties such as the viscosity <b>of</b> <b>semen,</b> percentage and index of motile sperm, and sperm concentration. On the otherhand, winter and spring copulations have been observed in the cave-dwelling bat Myoiis, though not noticed in Pipistrellus except the ordinary autumnal copulations. If winter or sprlng copulations occur also in some individuals of the bat, large difference may exist between the properties <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> <b>stored</b> in the uterus since autumn and that introduced into the uterus by the later supplementary copulations. Accordingly if there is a great disparity in the properties <b>of</b> <b>semen,</b> {{we may be able to}} admit that copulations occur again in the winter or spring. In order to solve these two problems above mentioned, studies on the properties <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> were made quantitatively. The results may be summarized as follows: 1. The stored semen are classified into three types by their properties. The semen contained in the uterus of bats captured in the autumn belong to only the first type(Fig. 2), but the semen in the spring consist of the first, second and third types(Figs. 3, 4 and 5), and large differences in properties exist among three types(Tables 2 and 3). And the index of motile sperm is shown in inverse proportion to the sperm concentration of semen(Fig. 1). Although our results disagree with those of previous workers and Wimsatt 2 ̆ 7 s observations(2 ̆ 742, 2 ̆ 744,), it is obvious that the spermatozoa found in the uterus in the spring are not always in a active state, because in about half individuals the majority of spermatozoa lose their activity, very few being surviving. 2. Judging from the histological observations, the large difference in the properties <b>of</b> <b>stored</b> <b>semen</b> has never been based on the endogenous factor, i. e., the influence of estrous or preovulatory conditions of female genital organs. It is, accordingly, believed that the exogenous factor, i. e., the disparity in length of passage of days after copulations gives rise to such a large difference in the properties <b>of</b> <b>semen.</b> In the spring, On the other hand, the existence of such abundant active spermatozoa as are found in the first type semen introduced into the uterus is never found anywhere except the cauda epididymis of male bat. In conclusion, then, it appears that the supplementary copulations take place at relatively high percentages in the winter or spring. 3. In the third type semen, the spermatozoa shown histologically with their heads towards the uterine. epithelium(Fig. 7), corresponds to the motile sperm seen by direct observations. 4. The third type semen, together with the first and second type semen, may be capable of fertilizing the ova, and even a small volume of semen(+) is enough for fertilization(Table 1) 1. 子宮内精液は 3 つの型に大別され, それらの性状には著しい差異が認められる. われわれの観察は多くの先進者の確信と一致しないが, 春の子宮内精子のすべてが必ずしも高い活力を保持しているのではなく, むしろ約半数の個体では子宮内精子の大部分は死滅し, 極く僅かの率の精子が生存しているのみであることを知つた. 2. 組織学的観察によれば, 上述した子宮内精液の性状における差異は内的要因, 即ち雌性生殖器官の発情ないし排卵現象の影響に基づいて生じたものではない. 従つて, 交尾の時期の差異に由来する交尾後の経過日数の長短が子宮内精液の性状にかかる差異を生ぜしめることが考えられる. 一方, 春の第I型子宮内精液にみられるような活力の高い多量の精子の存在は, 春には雄の副睾丸尾部を除いては何処にも見出されない. これらのことから, 基本的な秋の交尾後に, 冬及び春にも比較的高い割合で交尾が再び行われることを推論する. 3. 第III型精液において, 生体観察による僅かの率の生存精子は組織学的には子宮壁に沿うてその頭部を上皮に接し尾部を膣に向けて規則正しく一列に並んでいる精子に相当すると考えられる. 4. 第I･II型はもちろん, 第III型精液も受精可能であり, 受精には僅かの子宮内精液量(+) で十分である...|$|R
