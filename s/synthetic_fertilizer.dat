25|$|Crops do not end {{up using}} all of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> it is fed. The {{remainder}} ends up polluting surrounding land. Some of it will evaporate into the air where it will acidify the rain and produce greenhouse gases. It will also seep into the groundwater or run off into nearby bodies of water, thus polluting the drinking water of nearby communities. Poor soil health resulting from overproduction, excessive fertilizer use and inappropriate application of fertilizer causes runoff and leaching. Runoff into forests or marine areas can alter the ecosystem by fertilizing some plan species and poisoning others. The result of toxic runoff from commodity agriculture surrounding the Mississippi River {{can be seen at}} the hypoxic zone where the river meets the Gulf of Mexico. Here, algae grow rampant as a result of nitrogen fertilizer runoff thereby suffocating the animal life. This area has not reduced in size despite previous action plans for reduction made by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force. This hypoxic zone threatens the $2.8 billion fishing industry that depends on {{the northern part of the}} Gulf, which could affect the economy at large.|$|E

2500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1970s, most animals were fed local crops, and the animals’ wastes were returned to the fields as fertilizer. Today most U.S. animals are fed crops grown hundreds of miles away, making it “uneconomical” to return the manure. The solution? Require CAFO owners to treat their wastes, just as municipalities must do with human wastes. Further, if we ate less meat, less waste would be generated and less <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> {{would be needed to}} grow animal feed. Eating meat from animals that are range-fed on perennial grasses would be ideal. The explosive growth in the production of ethanol as a biofuel is greatly aggravating nitrogen pollution. Several studies have suggested that if mandated U.S. ethanol targets are met, the amount of nitrogen flowing down the Mississippi River and fueling the Gulf of Mexico dead zone may increase by 30 to 40 percent. The best alternative would be to forgo the production of ethanol from corn. If the country wants to rely on biofuels, it should instead grow grasses and trees and burn these to co-generate heat and electricity; nitrogen pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would be much lower." ...|$|E

25|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) applied to agricultural land (via <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic {{sources such as}} manures (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome. Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, eutrophication can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to anoxic areas called dead zones.|$|R

5000|$|Although air and {{sunlight}} are available everywhere on Earth, crops also depend on soil nutrients {{and the availability}} of water. When farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some of these nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced yields. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as natural gas (used in converting atmospheric nitrogen into <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer),</b> or mineral ores (e.g., phosphate). Possible sources of nitrogen that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include: ...|$|E

50|$|The Birkeland-Eyde {{process was}} {{developed}} by Norwegian industrialist and scientist Kristian Birkeland along with his business partner Sam Eyde in 1903, based on a method used by Henry Cavendish in 1784. This process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into nitric acid (HNO3), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as nitrogen fixation. The resultant nitric acid was then used {{for the production of}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> A factory based on the process was built in Rjukan and Notodden in Norway, combined with the building of large hydroelectric power facilities. The process is inefficient in terms of energy usage, and is today replaced by the Haber process.|$|E
40|$|Turfgrass {{production}} and maintenance {{relies heavily on}} the addition of nutrients, typically {{in the form of}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> based on natural gas. Soy-based biocomposite fertilizers have the potential to replace these <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and reduce dependence on abiotic resources as well as decrease the environmental impact associated with the {{production and}} use of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> Plant-based turfgrass fertilizers already exist on the market and typically use plant materials, such as sugar beets, that are relatively difficult and costly to produce. Soybeans are the preferred plant protein to provide nutrients in a biocomposite fertilizer because of the soybean’s unique relationship with bacteria that allows it to utilize nitrogen gas from the atmosphere. Soybeans are also grown on a large scale in the Midwest, making them readily available. In this work, it was determined that soy-based biocomposites performed as well as commercially available fertilizers in terms of facilitating plant growth. It was also seen that nutrient levels in leachate samples were not significantly different for soy-biocomposite <b>fertilizers</b> compared to <b>synthetic</b> slow-release <b>fertilizers</b> when applied at a standard application rate. Addition, when over-applied the soy-based composites exhibited drawbacks similar to that of some <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> Economic analysis demonstrated that soy-based biocomposites could be produced on a commercial scale and at a competitive cost. Dependent on the specific formulation, the production costs for soy biocomposites were as low as $ 15. 15 per pound of nitrogen. In comparison, the <b>synthetic</b> slow-release <b>fertilizers</b> used for comparison in this study are currently sold at a retail price of $ 54. 73 per pound of nitrogen. A life cycle assessment also demonstrated that the cradle-to-gate production of soy-biocomposite fertilizers creates significantly less global warming potential (GWP) compared to the production of traditional ammonium nitrate and urea fertilizers. In the case of biocomposites comprising of more than 60 % soy filler, the GWP was shown to be negative, suggesting the production of these biocomposites have the potential to sequester greenhouse gases...|$|R

White clover can tolerate close mowing and grazing, and it can grow on many different types and pHs of soil (although it prefers clay soils).

Natural nitrogen fixing reduces leaching from the soil and by maintaining soil health can reduce the incidence of some lawn diseases that are enhanced by the availability of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> For these reasons, it is often used as a green manure and cover crop.|$|E
5000|$|A {{farm that}} {{is able to}} [...] "produce perpetually", yet has {{negative}} effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture.

5000|$|With good management, manure has {{environmental}} benefits. Manure {{deposited on}} pastures by grazing animals themselves is applied efficiently for maintaining soil fertility. Animal manures are also commonly collected from barns and concentrated feeding areas for efficient re-use of many nutrients in crop production, sometimes after composting. For many areas with high livestock density, manure application substantially replaces application of synthetic fertilizers on surrounding cropland. Manure was spread as a fertilizer on about 15.8 {{million acres of}} US cropland in 2006. [...] Manure is also spread on forage-producing land that is grazed, rather than cropped.
