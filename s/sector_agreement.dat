50|$|Until 2006, a major {{driver of}} forest {{loss in the}} Amazon was the {{cultivation}} of soy, mainly for export and production of biodiesel and animal feed; as soybean prices have risen, soy farmers pushed northwards into forested areas of the Amazon. However, a private <b>sector</b> <b>agreement</b> {{referred to as the}} Soy Moratorium has helped drastically reduce the deforestation linked to soy production in the region. In 2006, a number of major commodity trading companies such as Cargill agreed to not purchase soybeans produced in the Brazilian Amazon on recently deforested areas. Before the moratorium, 30 percent of soy field expansion had occurred through deforestation, contributing to record deforestation rates. After eight years of the moratorium, a 2015 study found that although soy production area had expanded another 1.3 million hectares, only about 1 percent of the new soy expansion had {{come at the expense of}} forest. In response to the moratorium, farmers were choosing to plant on already cleared land.|$|E
30|$|Temporary opening or ‘inability to pay’ clauses {{have become}} rather popular during the Recession. They {{are to be}} {{distinguished}} from the general derogation clauses discussed in the previous paragraph. General derogation clauses delegate particular issues to be decided at enterprise level under conditions specified in the <b>sector</b> <b>agreement</b> and with outcomes that can deviate from sectoral minima or standards. In the limit case, as in some sector agreements in manufacturing in Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands the <b>sector</b> <b>agreement</b> does not specify (minimum) pay provisions. Temporary ‘inability to pay’ clauses allow the suspension or renegotiation of (part of) the agreement in cases of hardship, although how tightly this is defined varies. General opening or derogation clauses are an instrument of organized decentralisation within sectoral agreements; they {{have no place in}} enterprise agreements. Temporary hardship clauses can apply to any collective agreement at any level and rather being an element of decentralisation they are a safety valve in agreements that define hard minimum or standard conditions, and in agreements that cover a period longer than one year.|$|E
30|$|Specific one-off {{hardship}} clauses, {{related to}} the recession, in Germany’s chemicals and metalworking <b>sector</b> <b>agreements</b> in 2009 and 2010 {{made it possible to}} vary the implementation of elements of the wage settlement in these years. In Finland, several <b>sector</b> <b>agreements</b> in 2010 included a similar clause allowing individual companies to adjust the agreed wage increase to reflect their own financial circumstances. In Norway, a one-off opening clause in most private <b>sector</b> <b>agreements</b> provided local negotiators with the option not to implement the sector increase agreed for 2009. Proposals of the industrial employers to add specific opening clauses to industry agreements have routinely been rejected by the Swedish unions. In 2009, however, under pressure of sharply rising unemployment combined with the government’s refusal to raise the level of unemployment benefits, the metal workers union conceded a temporary two-years crisis agreement reminiscent of German-style opening clauses (Kjellberg 2012 : 63). In Austria, in addition, the 2011 metalworkers’ collective agreement contains a clause allowing companies which {{in the last three years}} did not have a positive operating result to split the agreed wage increase for the sector in a general and a contingent part.|$|R

30|$|In Italy and France, too, {{there were}} long delays in {{renewing}} existing agreements. According {{to data from}} the national statistical office, early 2014 {{more than half of all}} workers in Italy’s private sector were waiting for a new agreement and the mean delay in contract renewal had increased to 12  months (almost 24  months in the cash-strapped public sector). 10 Ministry data in France, early 2014, showed a 30 percent drop in the number of (national and regional) <b>sector</b> <b>agreements</b> compared to the year before. 11 Already in 2011 a Ministry study complained that many (regional) <b>sector</b> <b>agreements</b> were characterized by “une ancienneté forte et une activité conventionnelle peu dynamique”. 12 In Germany and the Netherlands the problems with renewing agreements also showed, especially when the recession ended and employers offered resistance to higher wages demanded by the unions after years of austerity. In Belgium there was a marked decline in sectoral agreements concluded under the latest central agreement, presumably because there was nothing left to bargain over.|$|R
30|$|In Southern Europe the {{hierarchical}} layering of agreements {{based on the}} favourability principle has usually found strict legal application (Sciarra 2006). However, under heavy international pressure, recent legal changes have opened Pandora’s box. In Italy lowering sectorally agreed pay norms had been possible from 2001 in some ‘underdeveloped’ regions with high unemployment {{if there is a}} tripartite employment pact. The tripartite national pact of 2009, without approval of the largest union confederation, conceded the possibility to suspend the sectoral wage increase in firms that had fallen on hard times. In 2010 Fiat tested the pact by a round of concession bargaining including radical changes in working practices and dismissal protection in two of its plants, on threat of closure and relocation. Workers voted in favour in ballots organized by the company and the two plants were removed from the <b>sector</b> <b>agreement.</b> Soon after Fiat withdrew from the <b>sector</b> <b>agreement.</b> In June 2011 a new central agreement, with the signature of all three union confederations, stipulated that enterprise agreements can introduce temporary and experimental modifications of provisions in sector agreements within established limits and with approval by a majority of union delegates at the local level. These new rules have been applied in a few industry agreements since. When in August 2011 the government introduced, under pressure of the ECB, a decree-law with the possibility of derogation, by collective agreement, from legally-established dismissal protection guarantees, the main employers’ confederation could only rescue the central agreement it had just signed by promising not to use the new law. This has prompted Fiat to leave the confederation.|$|E

30|$|When {{collective}} agreements {{apply to}} whole {{branches of the}} economy, employers who seek {{a change in the}} contract face different strategic options. They cannot easily escape collective arrangements by switching to a non-union environment, at least not when staying in the same sector and country. They can outsource activities to firms located in branches with cheaper collective agreements; make greater use of ‘flexible employment’; discontinue membership in employers’ associations; or work hard to obtain a change in the <b>sector</b> <b>agreement,</b> for instance transforming it into a framework for local negotiations. All of these strategies have been used and are visible in the data, but the overall impact on coverage rates is not a priori clear. For instance, outsourcing to cheaper contracts, or greater use of flexible employment, may be matched by an increase of collective bargaining activities and coverage of agreement in sectors such as cleaning, catering and security, and for agency work, part-time and fixed-duration employment, as has been the case in the Netherlands (Visser 2013).|$|E

30|$|In Romania no sectoral {{collective}} agreements {{have been}} signed since 2011 besides {{a handful of}} agreements combining specific company groups. In Bulgaria, the previous trend of <b>sector</b> <b>agreements</b> in manufacturing {{to be replaced by}} company agreements accelerated after 2008, when employers stopped negotiating at the sector level in chemicals, electrical equipment and food processing. According to a state inspectorate’s report collective bargaining in Poland is now rare in the private sector, with hardly any sectoral bargaining. During the recession sectoral bargaining further weakened to the point of near extinction in the private sector in Lithuania and Latvia. Gonser (2011) in a review of developments during the current crisis in the three Baltic states, claims that governments have de-legitimized collective bargaining as an institution by walking away from the agreements they had signed as employer. In Slovakia <b>sector</b> <b>agreements</b> used to be fairly widespread, but their number and coverage have declined in recent years, with employers withdrawing from their organizations. Kézdi and Kónya (2011), using an establishment survey, affirm that sector bargaining in the private sector has become rare in Hungary. In the Czech Republic since 2008 fewer collective agreements stipulate a specific year-on-year wage increase; in 2010 such rate increases were agreed in less than half of all agreements. Even in Slovenia, where multi-employer bargaining is more established, during the recession breaches of the pay guarantees in sectoral agreements soared from 462 reported cases in 2007 to 2, 596 in 2010, followed by a slowing down, or even full stop, of the renewal of agreements.|$|R
30|$|In Spain {{there had}} been {{attempts}} to apply ‘inability to pay’ clauses in collective agreements even before the Recession. The 2010 legal reform widened the scope for the non-application of higher-level agreements on wages and other working conditions, especially working hours, at company level (Molina and Miguélez 2013 : 23). The 2011 reform, still by the socialist government, aimed at giving priority to enterprise bargaining. In their framework agreement, of February 2012 the central union and employers’ associations took this up and allowed a greater use of opening clauses on {{a wider range of}} issues—working time, remuneration systems, shift work and work organization. These opting-out clauses can only be applied in case of a persistent drop of revenues, but that should not have been a major constraint during the deep recession in which the Spanish economy found itself. In Greece, a 2010 law introduced scope for company agreements to derogate from the wage and working time provisions of <b>sector</b> <b>agreements</b> in cases of economic hardship. The 2011 reform radicalized this by making <b>sector</b> and cross-sector <b>agreements</b> redundant regarding wages.|$|R

30|$|In addition, firm-level {{agreements}} can complement sector-specific agreements.

30|$|Lack of {{articulation}} {{has been}} a recurrent theme {{in the literature on}} collective bargaining in Spain, Portugal, Greece and France. Costa (2012 : 405) notes juridification, excessive competition among unions, lack of self-regulation and recurrent state intervention as impediments to collective bargaining in Portugal. Xavier (2004 : 194 – 5) finds collective bargaining incoherent “because these forms of bargaining (i.e. interprofessional, sectoral, regional or company, auth.) are not articulated”. According to Barreto (1992 : 471), “the tension between an over-regulated and highly legalistic framework and voluntary collective bargaining may help explain why formal company bargaining is so rare in the private sector, and why industry bargaining has so little impact on working conditions and terms of employment in leading or even average enterprises.” He sees this as a legacy of the state-corporatist regime, which compensated the repression of unions and limitations on collective bargaining by legalistic rules of protection. The legal reform of 2009 introduced the possibility that in firms of 500 and more staff, the works councils negotiate enterprise agreements that override the standards set in sector agreements. In the Memorandum of Understanding with the Troika, signed in 2011, the threshold was lowered to 250 and in the Labour Code of 2012 to 150. The suggestion of the Troika to strike the unions’ veto from the law was not taken up and works councils can only sign agreements when unions allow it. The 2012 reform specifies that provisions of enterprise agreements take priority over those contained in <b>sector</b> <b>agreement</b> unless employers and trade unions insert a clause to the contrary in sectoral agreements. Note that according to the European Company Survey of 2009, Portugal, along with Greece and some countries in CEE, had the weakest and least diffused system of works councils in the EU.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{processes}} of creating renewable electricity systems in new locations. Specifically it addresses the challenges and drivers of building-up renewable energy system in a `fast follower' country, Ireland. With increasing scientific, political, civil society and private <b>sector</b> <b>agreement</b> {{on the need to}} reduce green-house gas emissions from the provision of electricity, the rolling out of complex, renewable electricity systems from countries in which initial system building activities have taken place to others is an important issue. The primary research question posed is `what explains the growth of the wind electricity system in Ireland?' This question is reflected upon by asking `what does the Irish experience tell us about why and how these systems spread to new locations?' The thesis addresses an innovation studies audience, making a theoretical contribution to the field of sustainability transitions. It contributes to recent research integrating theories from human geography by offering new insights on how location influences building of large scale renewable electricity systems in new jurisdictions. It contributes findings about the rapid development of the Irish wind system that challenge two dominant perspectives; roll-out in Ireland has been driven by EU policy push and the development of the industry is fundamentally about the extent of national subsidies. We find both perspectives are partial; what they omit is likely to be essential to reproducing the Irish experience. This thesis takes as its unit of analysis the wind energy system itself, and using a `technological innovation system' framework, examines and evaluates the structure of the system; the complex arrangement of institutions, actors and technologies; and the dynamic innovation processes or `functions' of the system. An inquiry into the substantive historical contexts of the development of the system make possible insights into the locational characteristics and relations within and between the system; drivers, barriers and influences of direction of the system processes; and the contexts in which decisions are made and technological change takes place. The thesis finds the development of a renewable electricity system in new locations is simultaneously heavily influenced by transnational dimensions of system actors relations and institutions, and shows that while the direction of the emergent technological pathway is influenced at multiple spatial and governance levels, legitimation of the technology is highly localised...|$|E

30|$|Since the Great Recession {{extension}} {{procedures have}} been changed in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and Germany. In Greece, the Budget Law of 2011 suspended extension {{for the duration of}} the financial assistance measures, until 2015 or later. Unilateral recourse to arbitration, which usually helped trade unions to defend their case, was also struck from the law. Once non-member firms were no longer bound by the <b>sector</b> <b>agreement,</b> many took the opportunity to negotiate company agreements with less favourable provisions. After the change in government in May 2011, the Portuguese administration stopped issuing extension orders. Pressure from the Troika led to the introduction of a quantitative threshold, similar to those in other countries; in order to qualify for extension the agreement must already cover half of the workers in the branch, geographical area or professional category (Ramalho 2013). The Portuguese economy is dominated by very small firms and with a 38 percent employment share of member firms in the private sector, employers’ organization is low by European standards (Naumann 2015). The result has been a dramatic drop in both sectoral agreements and extension orders, from an average of 113 per year between 2000 and 2010, or 61 percent of all sectoral agreements concluded during these years, to 17 in 2011, 12 in 2012, 9 in 2013 and 13 in 2014.7 The number of newly reached sectoral agreements had been declining since 2008 but dropped under 100 for the first time in 2011 with 36 new agreements in 2012 and just 27 in 2013. There was some recovery in sectoral bargaining in 2014 but the number of workers covered by newly concluded sectoral agreements, 215 thousand, is only a fifth of the number covered by newly reached agreements in 2010. Enterprise and ‘group level’ agreements register a similar sharp decline in recent times and the total coverage of new agreements has dropped to a mere 6.4 percent in 2013 from an average of 44.2 percent between 2000 and 2010. It is only through the coverage of older, still valid agreements, of which half are more than eight years old, that a coverage rate of about 70 percent is reached, but this begs the question as to how relevant these older agreements are in terms of (minimum) wage protection. The decline in bargaining activity at all levels suggests that the change in extension policy is not the only or perhaps not even the main cause, but that the dire economic conditions in many sectors and firms and uncertainty about government policies and regulatory changes may have prompted a standstill in bargaining (see for another interpretation Addison et al. 2015 a). Whatever the role of extension, in 2014, after the rescue program finished, the government eased the criteria for extension: employers’ organisations with 30 percent or more SMEs among their members can have their agreements extended even if they do not represent 50 percent of the sector’s employees.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} presented is {{the outcome}} of a survey conducted by the Bank and forming the Belgian component of an initiative launched by the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN), in order to accompany the empirical analysis based on individual employees’ wage data obtained, for instance, from administrative data banks. The survey contains questions on the wage-setting process, the existence of downward rigidity and the reasons for it, the reaction of firms to shocks, and the frequency and timing of wage and price adjustments. The survey reveals that almost all firms in Belgium are covered by a <b>sector</b> <b>agreement,</b> and just over a quarter apply an additional collective wage agreement at the firm level. Such firm-level collective agreements are more common in large firms. The results also show that just over half of firms apply a wage indexation mechanism with a threshold index, while just under half operate in an environment where indexation takes place at fixed intervals. The latter system is more common in large firms, so that the weighted results indicate that this mechanism applies to the majority of employees. The level of wages of new employees depends mainly on what is specified in collective agreements and on the wage level of comparable employees in the firm. However, the wages which the firm actually pays to its staff may deviate from the pay scales specified in the sectoral agreements. In a significant number of firms, especially for white-collar workers and skilled staff, actual wages paid exceed the sectoral pay scales. Such a wage cushion, forming a buffer between the actual wages and the collectively agreed lower limits, is more common in large firms. Overall, firms seldom respond to adverse shocks by cutting basic wages or using alternative ways of reducing labour costs per employee. Certainly in large firms, costs are reduced mainly via the employment channel, i. e. by reducing the number of primarily permanent staff, {{and to a lesser extent}} temporary workers. Reductions in non-wage costs are also important, while variable pay components are only cut in a small number of cases. Only a quarter of firms state that they adjust their prices more than once a year. Time-dependent price adjustments, in which the time of the adjustment does not depend on economic conditions (as opposed to state-dependent adjustments), occur in 22 p. c. of firms and are noticeably common in the business service sector. Combined with the low frequency of price adjustments, this indicates price rigidity in that sector. The frequency and timing of wage adjustments are closely linked to the indexation mechanism applied. Most firms adjust their wages no more than once a year. Time-dependent wage adjustments in a specific month apply to 61 p. c. of firms, and – like price adjustments – wage adjustments are concentrated in the month of January. Another peak occurs in July, and there is some concentration at the beginning of the second and fourth quarters, particularly in the case of wage adjustments. Survey, wages, prices, employment...|$|E

It is to be stressed, however, that although more enterprise agreements are signed compared to ten or fifteen years ago, their weight in terms of employees covered has not. Company bargaining received a boost after the privatisation of former state companies in the 1980 s and 1990 s, but there are few cases of sectoral agreements breaking up in firm-level agreements, after the UK example in the 1980 s.

30|$|Romania’s {{extension}} provisions {{were stopped}} by the 2011 Social Dialogue Act, which stipulates that <b>sector</b> <b>agreements</b> are applicable only {{to the members of}} the employers’ organization(s) concluding them. In Ireland, decisions by the High Court in 2011 and the Supreme Court in 2013 found that Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), which give binding effect to wage-setting mechanisms in some sectors, are unconstitutional (see also Regan 2013). The 1946 Industrial Relations Act was amended in 2015 to re-allow extension. Estonia has moved away from automatic extension, although applying to very few agreements. The procedure for triggering extension in Slovakia has been a source of controversy and was changed each time after elections. A 2007 law had removed the requirement that a non-organized firm affected by extension orders must give its consent. This decision was reversed in 2010 and reinstated in 2014, after the change in government. The result was that there were no extension orders between 2011 and 2013. In the Czech Republic the law was amended in 2012 to provide for a provision that allows for the exemption of SMEs or firms in financial distress.|$|R
40|$|The {{medium term}} outlook for state {{finances}} within Ireland remains difficult (International Monetary Fund, 2013). Within this environment government {{policy is to}} ensure that the provision of state services remains at acceptable levels (Department of An Taoiseach, 2011). To achieve this, it is necessary to extract increased productivity levels from a decreasing pool of state employees (Labour Relations Commission, 2013). As part of this process, it is envisaged that the successful operation of public <b>sector</b> collective <b>agreements</b> will form a key element in achieving this higher productivity. However given the constrained resources available, the operation of these agreements has the potential to generate disputes between employees and management across the range of public sector organisations (Cutcher & Joel, 1991). Included in this is the Defence Forces, which despite its unique industrial relations environment is still subject to the management / employee strains that can arise within traditionally structured organisations. Given this context, it is the intent of this research to explore if the use of mediation as a dispute prevention tool can contribute to the maintenance of a positive relationship between the largest Defence Forces employee representative association ‘PDFORRA’ and management during the operation of public <b>sector</b> collective <b>agreements?</b> In order to address this aim, a detailed literature review was conducted that covered previous academic work in the areas of ‘Industrial Relations within a Military Environment’, ‘Public Sector Collective Agreements’ and ‘Mediation’. The information that was obtained from this review was then complimented by the collection of primary data through a series of semi-structured interviews. These interviews involved the participation of the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) Advisory Service as well as the main actors within the Defence Sector. As a result of this collection of both primary and secondary data, a number of research findings became apparent. These findings would include; The existence of a positive approach to engagement between management and employee representatives; Management concerns over the delays that can be experienced when attempting to resolve disagreements with representative associations; A willingness on the part of all parties to consider the use of mediation as a dispute prevention mechanism; A concern on the part of management over the scope of use that would accompany a mediation process; A desire within the LRC to support the use of dispute prevention mechanisms such as mediation in the public sector; A willingness {{on the part of the}} LRC to support the use of mediation within the Defence Sector. Building on these findings four conclusions were drawn from the research that was conducted. Specifically the research identified that there is significant evidence to support the premise that mediation is a suitable tool for use within the unique internal industrial relations process of the Defence Forces. It is also assessed that mediation can have a positive impact on the operation of public <b>sector</b> collective <b>agreements</b> within the Defence Forces. In addition the conclusions recognise that the research which has been conducted has the capacity to contribute to the level of academic knowledge that is available on the use of mediation as a tool to assist in the operation of public <b>sector</b> collective <b>agreements.</b> Then to conclude, the research supports the conclusion that the use of mediation as a dispute prevention tool can contribute to the maintenance of a positive relationship between PDFORRA and management during the operation of public <b>sector</b> collective <b>agreements</b> within the Defence Forces...|$|R
