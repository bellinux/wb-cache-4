5|$|Anarchism as a <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> in Cuba held great {{influence}} with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following {{the abolition of}} slavery in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>movements</b> {{have been}} studied from the {{perspective}} of several disciplines—sociology, anthropology, social psychology, economics, and political science. When we conceive of <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> as political phenomena we need to take seriously their relations with the political context in which they act. Clearly, many, if not most, <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> are embedded in political institutions (Tarrow 1994). For this reason, the discipline of political science is of importance in understanding the close link between political institutions and <b>social</b> <b>movements,</b> and how politics matters in shaping <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> in different contexts...|$|R
5|$|Satyajit Ray's ancestry can {{be traced}} back for at least ten generations. Ray's grandfather, Upendrakishore Ray was a writer, illustrator, philosopher, publisher, amateur {{astronomer}} and a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a religious and <b>social</b> <b>movement</b> in nineteenth century Bengal. He also set up a printing press by the name of U. Ray and Sons, which formed a crucial backdrop to Satyajit's life. Sukumar Ray, Upendrakishore's son and father of Satyajit, was a pioneering Bengali writer of nonsense rhyme (abol tabol) and children's literature, an illustrator and a critic. Ray was born to Sukumar and Suprabha Ray in Calcutta.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system <b>social</b> <b>movement,</b> dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles.

Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way.

5|$|The FN {{has been}} part of several groups in the European Parliament. The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also {{consisted}} of the Italian <b>Social</b> <b>Movement</b> (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union. Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans' arrival. As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN. From 1999 to 2001, the FN {{was a member of the}} Technical Group of Independents. In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group. Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits. It leads the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, which also includes the Freedom Party of Austria, Polish Congress of the New Right, Italian Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the Alternative for Germany, the Dutch Freedom Party, a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania's Conservative Party.

5|$|While the ON had {{competed in}} some local {{elections}} since 1970, at its second congress in June 1972 {{it decided to}} establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections. The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity (Front national pour l'unité française), or Front National. In order to create a broad movement, the ON sought to model the new party (as it earlier had sought to model itself) on the more established Italian <b>Social</b> <b>Movement</b> (MSI), which at the time appeared to establish a broad coalition for the Italian right. The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo. It wanted to unite the various French far-right currents, and brought together Le Pen's nationalist group, Roger Holeindre's Party of French Unity, Georges Bidault's Justice and Liberty movement, former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists, among others. Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure on the far-right.|$|E

50|$|Several key {{processes}} lie {{behind the}} history of <b>social</b> <b>movements.</b> Urbanization led to larger settlements, where people of similar goals could find each other, gather and organize. This facilitated social interaction between scores of people, {{and it was in}} urban areas that those early <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> first appeared. Similarly, the process of industrialization which gathered large masses of workers in the same region explains why many of those early <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> addressed matters such as economic wellbeing, important to the worker class. Many other <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> were created at universities, where the process of mass education brought many people together. With the development of communication technologies, creation and activities of <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> became easier - from printed pamphlets circulating in the 18th century coffeehouses to newspapers and Internet, all those tools became important factors in the growth of the <b>social</b> <b>movements.</b> Finally, the spread of democracy and political rights like the freedom of speech made the creation and functioning of <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> much easier.|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} essay {{provides a}} general {{framework for the}} study of crossnational similarities among <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> by looking at three broad social processes: globalization, structural affinity, and diffusion. Each of these concepts {{is at the core of}} three apparently rival explanations of movement similarities. The globalization model explains similarities among <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> as a product of similar movement reactions to transnational political opportunities; the structural affinity model states that similar national political opportunity structures account for similarities among <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> across countries; and the diffusion model argues that the adoption of information from abroad causes similarities among <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> in different countries. This essay integrates three concepts in a general model of crossnational similarities among <b>social</b> <b>movements.</b> The model is illustrated with data on new <b>social</b> <b>movements</b> in four West European countries...|$|R
