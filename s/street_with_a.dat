In response to a request from Johnson, Transport for London undertook to reduce the bus flow in Oxford Street by 10% in both 2009 and 2010. Subsequently, the New West End Company called for a 33% reduction in bus movements in Oxford Street.|$|E

5|$|The RTA, by then renamed to Sound Transit, began {{a series}} of public {{hearings}} in late 1997 to determine the routing of the line. Tukwila leaders preferred a route serving the Southcenter Mall that would add six to seven minutes of travel time and $150 million in project costs. The Sound Transit Board chose an at-grade line on International Boulevard as their preferred routing in February 1999, which the city argued would interfere with their near-term plans to revamp the street. The board's preferred route, selected in November 1999, included an at-grade line on International Boulevard through Tukwila and an elevated station at South 154th <b>Street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> park and ride facility.|$|E

5|$|The IND Fulton Street Line {{would get}} an eastward extension; it would first be {{extended}} to 106th Street as a four-track line, where it would connect to the IND Rockaway Line. Afterwards, the line would stretch along Linden Boulevard to 229th Street in Eastern Queens. The line {{was to go to}} a two-track terminal at 105th or 106th Streets, with intermediate stops at 75th or 76th Streets and at 84th or 85th Streets (both proposed local stops), as well as at Cross Bay Boulevard (a proposed express stop). In 1951, these relay tracks were still planned to go as far as 105th <b>Street,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> connection to the IND Rockaway Line east of Cross Bay Boulevard. In May 2004, this idea resurfaced, with an attached track map drawn up. If the line were ever built, Pitkin Avenue would have been routed to the east rather than to the southeast at 80th Street, and Linden Boulevard between Conduit and Rockaway Boulevards would have been built to facilitate the line.|$|E
5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the <b>street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E
