5|$|A {{series of}} {{derailments}} {{in the mid-1970s}} shattered Amtrak's confidence in the locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and steam generators used for train heating, or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and <b>Santa</b> Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. The <b>Santa</b> Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern <b>Santa</b> Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to the <b>Santa</b> Fe, retired them in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Below Prado Dam, the <b>Santa</b> Ana River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the <b>Santa</b> Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow <b>Santa</b> Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering <b>Santa</b> Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of <b>Santa</b> Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of <b>Santa</b> Ana River County Beach.|$|E

When the mall <b>Santa</b> leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, <b>Santa</b> mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that <b>Santa</b> leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E

500|$|... "Dog of Death" [...] {{features}} {{a number of}} references to popular culture and famous dogs. <b>Santa's</b> Little Helper's adventure resembles {{the plot of the}} 1963 film The Incredible Journey. The scene in which Mr. Burns brainwashes <b>Santa's</b> Little Helper with the Ludovico technique is a parody of Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange, including the way <b>Santa's</b> Little Helper's eyes are held open while he is forced to watch a film featuring dog abuse, such as dogs being physically assaulted and getting their heads slammed by falling toilet lids. Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony is heard during the sequence. In another scene, the dog Lassie is referenced when <b>Santa's</b> Little Helper rescues a child from a burning building. Homer claims that <b>Santa's</b> Little Helper will be going to Doggie Heaven, while Richard Nixon's dog Checkers and Adolf Hitler's dog Blondi will be going to Doggie Hell. The doctor who performs the surgery on <b>Santa's</b> Little Helper is based on the main character in the Ben Casey television series.|$|R

5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call <b>Santa</b> Claus over a special telephone number was printed in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on Christmas Eve 1955 and took many calls from children inquiring about <b>Santa.</b> He told his operators to give a current location for <b>Santa</b> Claus to any child who called in.

The pair are reunited, but Bart traps himself in a closet. Mr. Mitchell, thinking Bart is a burglar, sits outside the closet and gloats to Bart that he had called the police, but Bart explains that he's just a boy, and that <b>Santa's</b> Little Helper was his dog to begin with. To solve the problem, Bart and Mitchell let <b>Santa's</b> Little Helper decide which owner he prefers, by having both of them call him. After briefly getting distracted by his own tail, <b>Santa's</b> Little Helper chooses Bart. Chief Wiggum arrives with Laddie, who immediately sniffs out a bag of marijuana in Mr. Mitchell's pocket.

He also tasks Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous trick-or-treating children, to abduct <b>Santa</b> Claus and {{bring him back to}} Halloween Town.
