40|$|M. Tech. (Business Administration) The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the service quality perceptions of the internal clients who use Radiopark Studios' facilities. This subject is regarded as important in that Radiopark Studios now competes with outside facilities. Internal clients can hire studio facilities and personnel from different production houses. Radiopark Studios should, therefore, improve its clients relationship. The aim was to find out whether there were gaps between the internal clients' service expectations and the services delivered by Radiopark Studios. Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Berry (1990) Servqual analysis was used as the primary theory base. The researcher investigated the following sections: • Booking office, • Production assistants, • Radio block (studios), • Technicians, • Radio main control, • <b>Security</b> <b>and</b> <b>reception,</b> and • Marketing. The main findings were that there were gaps between the service received by Radiopark Studios internal clients and the service they would like to get. It also showed that Radiopark Studios internal clients were receiving inconsistent service in that some were satisfied with the service delivery whereas others were dissatisfied. Recommendations are made in this report on how to close the service gaps identified in the study...|$|E

40|$|Many {{people who}} go to gaol are mentally ill. Remandees, {{prisoner}} receptions or people in jails have a substantially higher rate of severe mental disorder than other prisoners and the general population. There are no completely satisfactory ways to screen for psychosis and few existing screening questionnaires are available for use in correctional establishments. The Screening Instrument for Psychosis (PS) was developed {{in the context of the}} Australian Mental Health Survey: Study of Low Prevalence Disorders. It can help indicate whether a person should be referred to mental health professional for a diagnostic evaluation and possible treatment and/or diversion. We trialled the PS in a high <b>security</b> remand <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> centre. Measures of validity and reliability are reported. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a video signal {{processing}} {{algorithm is proposed}} which is Modified H. 264 /AVC as a solution for Bandwidth saving through LBR (Low Bit Rate) applications to ensure acceptable video quality. Based on this concept, where the intraframe pictures are hybrid wavelet-based coded and the interframe pictures are coded with a Modified H. 264 /AVC encoder and decoder is proposed. Use of Modified H. 264 /AVC algorithm shows that this proposed hybrid encoder and decoder not only retains the same quality of the video but also lowers down the bit rate of the video considerably. AES based encryption and decryption system is proposed for added <b>security</b> for transmission <b>and</b> <b>reception.</b> The proposed algorithms are characterized by their efficient compression ratio, good PSNR, MSE results and lower bit rate {{as well as its}} efficient implementation in MATLAB...|$|R
5000|$|Following his conviction, Adler {{was taken}} to the maximum <b>security</b> Metropolitan Remand <b>and</b> <b>Reception</b> Centre <b>and</b> {{following}} initial classification, was placed in Long Bay Correctional Centre, before being transferred to the minimum security Kirkconnell Correctional Centre in late April 2005. However, less than two months later, Adler was transferred to the higher security Bathurst Correctional Centre after allegedly secretly restarting his business career from within the Kirkconnell facility. On 13 October 2007, Adler was released from the St Heliers Correctional Centre in the Upper Hunter Valley on parole, after serving {{two and a half years}} of his sentence, spending time in eight different correctional facilities. [...] Adler was reunited with his wife, Lyndi, and their four children at their home in the eastern Sydney suburb of Vaucluse. Adler described the prison system as [...] "Darwinian, degrading, outdated, boring and pointless" [...] in an article written for The Bulletin magazine in December 2007. During his time in solitary confinement, Adler befriended an individual in the next cell, as they were communicating through the acoustics of the toilet in their respective cells. They formed a deep friendship, something he spoke about with media.|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have attracted}} {{a lot of}} interest in the research community due to their potential applicability in a wide range of real-world practical applications. However, due to the distributed nature and their deployments in critical applications without human interventions and sensitivity and criticality of data communicated, these networks are vulnerable to numerous <b>security</b> <b>and</b> privacy threats that can adversely affect their performance. These issues become even more critical in cognitive wireless sensor networks (CWSNs) in which the sensor nodes have the capabilities of changing their transmission <b>and</b> <b>reception</b> parameters according to the radio environment under which they operate in order to achieve reliable and efficient communication and optimum utilization of the network resources. This chapter presents a comprehensive discussion on the <b>security</b> <b>and</b> privacy issues in CWSNs by identifying various security threats in these networks and various defense mechanisms to counter these vulnerabilities. Various types of attacks on CWSNs are categorized under different classes based on their natures and targets, and corresponding to each attack class, appropriate security mechanisms are also discussed. Some critical research issues on <b>security</b> <b>and</b> privacy in CWSNs are also identified. Comment: 36 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables. The book chapter is accepted for publication in 201...|$|R
