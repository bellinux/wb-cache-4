5|$|At its founding, music <b>submissions</b> to {{the site}} were {{evaluated}} for inclusion solely by Lloyd, who required that all arrangements both meet his quality bar and also feature an original interpretation of the music, rather than minimally changing the original track. In early 2002, however, to better accommodate the volume of music <b>submissions</b> and improve selection consistency, Lloyd instituted a panel of judges, composed of accomplished artists and contributors to the community, to assist him in music selection, though he still provided an initial evaluation of all <b>submissions</b> for meeting a minimum quality bar. Judge Larry Oji (a.k.a. Liontamer) became head <b>submissions</b> evaluator for the organization in June 2006, taking over the majority of Lloyd's evaluation work and freeing him {{to focus on the}} site and company itself.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from the hosts {{and went on to}} thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from <b>submissions</b> by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with <b>submissions</b> by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these <b>submissions</b> and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple <b>submissions</b> together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E
50|$|The game also {{introduces}} {{four types}} of <b>submission</b> options. While applying a <b>submission</b> hold, players can choose from one of four <b>submission</b> types: a Taunt <b>submission</b> depletes the opponent's momentum meter, a Rest Hold <b>submission</b> allows the player's character to regain stamina, the Drain <b>submission</b> drains the opponent of stamina, while a regular <b>submission</b> move causes damage to a particular body part.|$|R

5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for <b>submissions,</b> seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those <b>submissions</b> to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make <b>submissions,</b> and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by <b>submissions</b> or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations.

5|$|Although {{the award}} {{was created by}} The Bookseller, {{the idea of an}} award celebrating books with odd titles was {{proposed}} by Trevor Bounford of the Diagram Group in order to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978. Originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for The Bookseller, took over administrative duties. Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given {{due to a lack of}} odd titles, The Bookseller opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by Bent. In 2009, online <b>submissions</b> sent on Twitter were accepted. This resulted in the highest number of <b>submissions</b> for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), almost three times the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance at people who gave <b>submissions</b> that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880. The 2014 prize allowed nominations from self-published works, the first book being Strangers Have the Best Candy by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.|$|E
