The spacecraft was transferred on 1 February {{into a series}} of four elliptical planetary orbits (pericenter, 867 km). It was next transferred to an elliptical orbit with high pericenter, then to a circular <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbit</b> (altitude ~ 6, 330 km) in which it circled the planet 114 times. Ground connection with the spacecraft was lost at the end of March (Sagdeev and Zakharov, 1989).

50|$|To an {{observer}} on the earth, a satellite in a geostationary orbit appears motionless, in a fixed {{position in the}} sky. This is because it revolves around the earth at the earth's own angular velocity (360 degrees every 24 hours, in an <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbit).</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Satellite {{attitude}} estimation {{is one of}} {{the important}} processes in accomplishing a satellite mission. All the state estimation process requires dynamics model and filtering algorithm to estimate the state. Most of the estimation algorithm such as well-known Kalman filter and its variation assume the underlying noise in the dynamics model is Gaussian white noise. Hence, the objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate whether the noise in satellite attitude dynamics model in Near <b>Equatorial</b> <b>orbit</b> is Gaussian white noise process or not. This is important because if the assumption regarding the noise is incorrect, this will lead to unreliable and inaccurate estimation. In this paper, the noise is analyzed using normality characterizations and autocorrelation function. The result shows that the noise in the attitude dynamics at Near <b>Equatorial</b> <b>orbit</b> is not Gaussian white noise process...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} off-equatorial orbits in razor-thin disks {{is still in}} its beginnings. Contrary to what was {{presented}} in the literature in recent publications, the vertical stability criterion for <b>equatorial</b> circular <b>orbits</b> cannot be based on the vertical epicyclic frequency, because of the discontinuity in the gravitational field on the equatorial plane. We present a rigorous criterion for the vertical stability of circular orbits in systems composed by a razor-thin disk surrounded by a smooth axially symmetric distribution of matter, the latter representing additional structures such as thick disk, bulge and (dark matter) halo. This criterion is satisfied once the mass surface density of the thin disk is positive. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of nearly <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> are presented. In particular, the analysis of nearly <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> allows us to construct an approximate analytical third integral of motion in this region of phase-space, which describes the shape of these orbits in the meridional plane.
