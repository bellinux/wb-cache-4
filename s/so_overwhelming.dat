5|$|Lettice Dudley {{was left}} a wealthy widow. Leicester's will {{appointed}} her as executrix and her income from both her husbands' jointures amounted to £3,000 annually, to which came plate and movables worth £6,000. However, her jointure was to suffer greatly from paying off Leicester's debts, which at some £50,000 were <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> {{that she was}} advised to decline the responsibility of dealing with her husband's financial legacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} capture the ridge {{had little effect on}} the overall Allied position, as the success of Operation Cobra was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> that the Germans {{diverted}} significant resources, including two Panzer divisions, from the ridge in their attempt to keep Bradley's forces boxed in. With its defences weakened, subsequent Commonwealth attacks on the ridge were successful; Operation Totalize finally managed to wrest the position from its SS defenders on 8 August.|$|E
5|$|When the war resumed in June 1410, Władysław {{advanced}} {{into the}} Teutonic heartland {{at the head}} of an army of about 20,000 mounted nobles, 15,000 armed commoners, and 2,000 professional cavalry mainly hired from Bohemia. After crossing the Vistula over the pontoon bridge at Czerwińsk, his troops met up with those of Vytautas, whose 11,000 light cavalry included Lithuanians, Ruthenians, and Tatars. The Teutonic Order's army numbered about 18,000 cavalry, mostly Germans and 5,000 infantry. On 15 July, at the Battle of Grunwald after {{one of the largest and}} most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages, the allies won a victory <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> that the Teutonic Order's army was virtually annihilated, with most of its key commanders killed in combat, including Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen and Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode. Thousands of troops were reported to have been slaughtered on either side.|$|E

5|$|The aerial {{operation}} had {{a considerable}} effect in strangling Axis logistics. The supplies reaching Axis units dwindled, and the Axis armies and air units remaining in Tunisia gradually {{ran out of}} fuel, ammunition and other supplies. Having lost most of its airbases, the Luftwaffe also evacuated most of its units. By early May 1943, only the Italian fighter units, and one German Gruppe (I. JG 77), remained as the Axis held on to a narrow strip of African coastline near Tunis. Allied air superiority was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> that Luftwaffe personnel climbed into fighter fuselages, or squeezed into the cockpits of Bf 109s alongside the pilot rather than risk flying in transport aircraft. Most ground crew and pilots attempted to escape this way. Flying large numbers of personnel in one go and by transport was too dangerous; 16 personnel {{were killed in a}} crash on 29 or 30 April. The last transport missions were flown on 4 May, in which 117 tons of fuel and ammunition was brought in. Some supply drops were attempted (by II./Kampfgeschwader 1), but most of the remaining signals, FlaK, transport and administrative staff left were captured when the campaign ended on 13 May 1943.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Kapoor {{became the}} first Guest Artistic Director of Brighton Festival. Kapoor {{installed}} four sculptures during the festival: Sky Mirror at Brighton Pavilion gardens; C-Curve at The Chattri, Blood Relations (a collaboration with author Salman Rushdie); and 1000 Names, both at Fabrica. He also created a large site-specific work titled The Dismemberment of Jeanne d’Arc and a performance-based installation: Imagined Monochrome. The public response was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> that police had to re-divert traffic around C Curve at the Chattri and exercise crowd control.|$|E
500|$|On 5 May 1892, an {{election}} held at Etchmiadzin unanimously elected Khrimian {{to the position}} of Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church. According to Vartooguian, [...] "Khrimian's popularity was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> that any one opposing him would be recognized by the nation as a traitor. Khrimian was recognized as the standard of patriotism, and whoever sought {{the best interests of the}} nation could not but favor his election." [...] Vartooguian adds that the Russian imperial government was displeasing with his election as they sought to incorporate the Armenian Church under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church in an attempt to Russify the Armenian population.|$|E

500|$|Response to {{the album}} was slow. Steinman asserts that it was [...] "underpromoted", having a {{reputation}} of being [...] "damaged goods {{because it had been}} walked around to so many places." [...] Due to the enthusiastic response to the music videos from the record, Australia and England were the first to develop interest. The BBC television programme The Old Grey Whistle Test aired a clip of the live band performing the nine-minute title track. According to Classic Rock, response was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> that they screened it again the following week. They later invited the band to perform [...] "Paradise" [...] live. [...] "As a result, in the UK Bat became an unfashionable, uncool, non-radio record that became a 'must-have' for everyone who heard it, whether they 'got' Steinman's unique perspective or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics reacted in a {{generally}} positive manner to [...] "Summer Love". Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine gave [...] "Summer Love" [...] a positive review and additionally praised [...] "its good foot hesitation boom-clap and cascading chorus". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated, [...] "a dreary central-casting pop ballad called 'Summer Love' is enlivened only by another of Timberlake's peculiar announcements: 'I'm {{sick and tired}} of trying to save the world.' Shaheem Reid and Jayson Rodriguez off MTV News stated that [...] "Summer Love" [...] alongside Timberlake's 2007 singles [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "LoveStoned", rocked every iPod, stereo player and stadium during his tour. North by Northwestern's Dagny Salas called [...] "Summer Love/Set the Mood (Interlude)" [...] a stand-out track on FutureSex/LoveSounds. According to him the song [...] "oozes sun, sex, and a sultry affair". A reviewer of IGN commented that [...] "the bulk of the album is focused on funk lite, but with 'Summer Love/Set The Mood (Prelude)' Timberlake and Timbaland slip into darkness." [...] An editor of Billboard criticized Timbaland's production: [...] "hile the track offers cunning instrumentation, Timbaland's heavy production hand is <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> that the singer is pushed {{to the back of the}} track".|$|E
500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> that they would do something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E

500|$|The drug {{addiction}} of Towelie, {{a living and}} talking towel, is growing <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> that the South Park boys make attempts to help him. Towelie's history is shown, using head interviews and on-screen captions (in a parody of Intervention), starting with years of {{drug addiction}} to cannabis, crystal meth, heroin and crack. He previously had a girlfriend named Rebecca and conceived a child with her (a washcloth), but he {{was kicked out of}} their home due to his persistently getting high. Having run out of money for hard drugs, Towelie starts getting high off of cans of computer duster. His life continued in a downward spiral, leaving him in heavy debt and offering oral sex to strangers for money in the alleys. The boys help him get a job at Lake Tardicaca, a summer camp for kids with physical and mental disabilities, as a towel to dry off the campers. However, Towelie persists in drug use and fellating strangers in the supply closet, and is fired by the camp. The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself (except for Cartman, who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of thousands of pages of anti-Semitic remarks on television, which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the [...] "no interruptions" [...] rule). Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie's child, [...] "Washcloth", which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California. Later, Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son.|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. When I came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Tillich {{believes}} {{the essence of}} religious attitudes is what he calls [...] "ultimate concern". [...] Separate from all profane and ordinary realities, {{the object of the}} concern is understood as sacred, numinous or holy. The perception of its reality is felt as <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> and valuable that all else seems insignificant, and for this reason requires total surrender. [...] In 1957, Tillich defined his conception of faith more explicitly in his work, Dynamics of Faith.|$|E

[...] (p.40) Because of his German citizenship, he was initially unable to gain employment, and was almost interned during the war. He received his PhD in 1940 from University College London (UCL) working in the Department of Psychology under the supervision of Professor Sir Cyril Burt, with whom he had a tumultuous professional relationship throughout his working life.

2500|$|Serú Girán went touring in Brazil in 1980, {{where their}} {{reception}} by fans at the Monterrey Jazz Festival in Rio de Janeiro was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelming</b> that the organizers requested that they perform again, the next day, {{but on the}} main stage with jazz-rockers Weather Report.

That year they had also performed in concert with Spinetta Jade, Luis Alberto Spinetta's latest project and the other popular rock group of the early 1980s.
