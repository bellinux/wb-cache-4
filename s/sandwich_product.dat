40|$|In the multiethnic EU contest, the European Institutions {{encourage}} {{all citizens}} to be multilingual by learning {{at least two}} languages {{in addition to their}} mother tongue, including the local languages to maintain alive their cultural backgrounds and preserve their ethnic identity. The objective {{of this study is to}} verify whether the local language used in marketing communication strategies could significantly affect the consumers ’ preferences for food product and their decisions. The theoretical framework is given by the consumer motivational approach that enlarges the traditional consumer theory including other determinants of consumers decisions as the language and ethnicity; the empirical analysis is performed with the multivariate conjoint analysis to evaluate the influence of the cross cultural influence in consumer’s choice. A number of students from the university of Udin have been interviewed with a questionnaire focusing on preferences for a simulated packed <b>sandwich</b> <b>product</b> distributed by vendor machine inside the University space to test the influence of local language. The results suggest some reactions to the messages reported by package in different languages depending on the level of language knowledge and suggest their use for potential demand segmentation to generate niche markets.

40|$|This paper {{covers the}} {{integrity}} of decorative sandwich materials; relations between relative deformations of the sandwich system {{and the length of}} contact between layers; thicknesses of the surface layer and relative deformations of the concrete base. Principles of the proposed technology are also provided in the article. The field study of the behaviour of decorative sandwich concrete products exposed to severe conditions of operation have proven that products collapse due to cracking and peeling of the polymer concrete layer in particular cases. Deformations of sandwich materials caused by temperature and humidity fluctuations were analyzed by strain-gauge resistance sensors placed onto the surface polymer concrete layer of a product fragment and on the concrete base {{in the course of their}} freezing. Deformations were measured at the temperature intervals of 4 to 5 degrees Celsius. Freezing represents the most severe condition. Mathematical method of experimental planning was employed to identify the dependence between relative deformations of sandwich system Исс and length of layer-to-layer contact L, thickness of surface layer h and relative deformations of the concrete base ɛ 105. As a result of the probabilistic and statistical processing of the experimental data a three-factor quadratic model of relative deformations of a sandwich system was generated. This equation is used to identify the most favourable conditions to assure {{the integrity of}} a <b>sandwich</b> <b>product</b> under the combined impact of the aforementioned factors. The analysis has proven that the surface layer made of polymer concrete does not crack irrespective of the contact length if deformations of the concrete base do not exceed the limit tensibility of the surface layer. In the event of substantial deformations of the concrete base, integrity of the sandwich system is to be assured by means of the right choice of thickness and length of the surface layer. Based on the dependence of relative deformations of the sandwich composite, made of a concrete matrix and a polymer concrete decorative and protective layer, analysis of their integrity was performed with the account for the thickness of the surface layer, contact length and relative deformations of the water saturated concrete base in the course of freezing. Pre-set theoretical provisions were applied to develop recommendations aimed at the optimization of the composition and characteristics of the technology of production of double-layer decorative and protective products based on polymer and mineral binders.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{research}} concerns the passive damping of structural vibrations {{by the use of}} viscoelastic layers. It is motivated by the need for efficient numerical tools to deal with the medium frequency behaviour of industrial viscoelastic <b>sandwich</b> <b>products.</b> The <b>sandwich</b> modelling technique is based on the use of an interface element: the two deformable plates are modelled by special plate elements while the intermediate dissipative layer is modelled with interface elements. This interface element is based on the first-order shear deformation theory and assume constant peel and shear stresses in the polymer thickness. This element couples the lower and upper layers without additional degrees of freedom. The partition of unity finite element method (PUFEM) is applied to the development of enriched Mindlin plate elements. The element shape functions are obtained as the product of partition of unity functions with arbitrary chosen enrichment functions. Polynomial enrichment leads to the generation of high-order polynomial shape functions and is therefore similar to a p-FEM technique. Numerical examples illustrate the use of both PUFEM Mindlin plate elements and interface elements for the simulation of viscoelastic sandwich structures. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{addition}} to helping consumers make healthier food choices, front-of-pack nutrition labels could encourage companies to reformulate existing products and develop new ones with a healthier product composition. This {{is the largest}} study to date to investigate {{the effect of a}} nutrition logo on the development of healthier products by food manufacturers. Methods A total of 47 food manufacturers joining the Choices Foundation in the Netherlands (response: 39. 5 %) indicated whether their Choices products were newly developed, reformulated or already complied with the Choices criteria and provided nutrient composition data for their products (n = 821; 23. 5 % of the available Choices products in August 2009). Results Most products carrying the logo as a result of reformulation and new product development were soups and snacks. Sodium reduction was the most common change found in processed meats, sandwiches, soups and sandwich fillings. Dietary fiber was significantly increased in most newly developed Choices product groups; for example, in fruit juices, processed meats, dairy <b>products,</b> <b>sandwiches</b> and soups. Saturated fatty acids (SAFA) and added sugar were significantly decreased both in reformulated and newly developed dairy products. Caloric content was significantly decreased only in reformulated dairy <b>products,</b> <b>sandwich</b> fillings and in some newly developed snacks. Conclusions The results indicate that the Choices logo has motivated food manufacturers to reformulate existing products and develop new products with a healthier product composition, especially where sodium and dietary fiber are concerned. </p...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A comparative study of the variation between and within muscles of different subprimals as affected by cook method was conducted for both beef fajita and steak <b>sandwich</b> <b>products.</b> In Phase 1, eighteen subprimals were fabricated into 6 mm wide x 15 mm high x 5. 08 cm long fajita strips. Fifteen randomly chosen strips were reconstituted from a frozen state in 16. 4 cm wide x 2. 5 cm deep Egg RingSTm and evaluated for tenderness. The gooseneck bottom flat, inside round, knuckle, clod Infraspinatus, clod Triceps brachii and tri tip were chosen to be evaluated in Phase II. Subprimals were fabricated into 10 mm steaks and divided into 5 major groups. Two treatment groups of steaks were established and steaks were cooked in either the Temp PerfeCtTM oven or in Egg RingSTM. Remaining steaks were further divided into adjacent groups of two and either discarded or cooked in the Temp Pe@eCtTM oven or in Egg RingSTM. Cooled steaks were cubed and one by one, sections were selected throughout each steak and evaluated for tenderness. Muscles in Phase I varied in tenderness. The inside skirt was found to be the most tender, while the brisket point was found to be the toughest. In Phase H, cooking method affected tenderness of steaks. Overall, mean shear force values were lowest for steaks cooked in the Temp PerfectTm oven. For both cooking methods, location (anterior to posterior) within a subprimal showed tenderness to vary remarkably between steaks of different locations. The location of side to side shears across steaks effected tenderness in certain muscles, depending on cook method. Both cook methods proved nonsignificant in effecting the overall tenderness of steaks from the bottom round flat and tri tip (p> 0. 05). Location effects were nonsignificant in clod Infraspinatus steaks cooked in the Temp PerfeCtTM oven and clod Triceps brachii steaks cooked in Egg RingSTM. However, side to side variations were apparent for clod Triceps brachii steaks cooked in the Temp PerfectTM oven and clod Infraspinatus steaks cooked in Egg RingSTM. Inside round and knuckle steaks both had considerable variations within steaks for both cook methods (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
