40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of the import management, this study applies generalized ARDL approach to estimate MIDAS regression for wheat <b>import</b> <b>value</b> and to compare the accuracy of forecasts with those competed by the regression with adjusted data model. Mixed frequency sampling models aim to extract information with high frequency indicators so that independent variables with lower frequencies are modeled and foorcasted. Due to a more precise identification of the relationships among the variables, more accurate prediction is expected. Based on the results of both estimated regression with adjusted frequency models and MIDAS for the years 1978 - 2003 as a training period, wheat <b>import</b> <b>value</b> with internal products and exchange rate was positively related, while the relative price variable had an adverse relation with the Iran's wheat <b>import</b> <b>value.</b> Based on the results from the conventional statistics such as RMSE, MAD, MAPE and the statistical significance, MIDAS models using data sets of annual wheat <b>import</b> <b>value,</b> internal products, relative price and seasonal exchange rate significantly improves prediction of annual wheat <b>import</b> <b>value</b> for the years 2004 - 2008 as a testing period. Hence, it is recommended that applying prediction approaches with mixed data improves modeling and prediction of agricultural <b>import</b> <b>value,</b> especially for strategic import products...|$|R

Original procedures {{have been developed}} to reconcile data reported by almost 150 countries to the United Nations Statistics Division, which disseminate them via COMTRADE. When both exporting and importing countries do report, we have two different figures for the same flow, which is useful to reconcile in a single figure. Firstly, as <b>import</b> <b>values</b> are reported CIF (cost, insurance and freight) and the exports are reported FOB (free on board), CIF costs have to be estimated and removed from <b>imports</b> <b>values</b> to compute FOB <b>import</b> <b>values.</b> We regress the unit-values ratios reported for a given elementary flow by gravity variables and for years, and world median unit-value for each product category. The second step is an evaluation of the reliability of country reporting, based on the reporting distances among partners. We decompose the absolute value of the ratios of mirror flows using a (weighted) variance analysis, and an index is build for each country. These reporting qualities are used as weights in the reconciliation of each bilateral trade flow twice reported. Taking advantage of this double information on each flow, we end up with a large coverage of countries not reporting at a given level of the product classification with a special care in the treatment of unit-values.

40|$|The use of {{technical}} {{barriers to trade}} (TBT) is widespread and has increasing impact on international trade. In contrast to most other trade measures, TBT have both trade promotion and trade restriction effects. Due to their theoretical complexity and data scarcity, TBT have been considered {{as one of the}} most difficult non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to quantify. In this paper, we construct a TBT database from 1998 - 2006 to examine the influence of TBT imposed by China on the country's imports. When using the frequency index, we find that TBT are trade restrictive: a one unit increase in TBT will decrease <b>import</b> <b>value</b> by about 0. 8 %. However, when the coverage ratio is used, we find that the negative effects of TBT are not statistically significant based on the entire period. However, if the focus is shifted to data from 1998 - 2001, we find that TBT have trade promotion effects. A one unit increase in TBT will increase <b>import</b> <b>value</b> by about 0. 2 %. Finally, China's TBT (measured by both frequency index and coverage ratio) are trade restricting for agriculture goods but trade promoting for manufacturing goods. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
