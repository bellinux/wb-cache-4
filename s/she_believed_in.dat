5|$|Hill was {{a moving}} {{force behind the}} {{development}} of social housing, and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her to put her theories into practice {{with the aid of}} his initial investment. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal.|$|E
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in.</b> In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by Robert Raikes, Trimmer {{also became}} {{active in the}} Sunday school movement, {{founding}} the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. She {{and two of the}} ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the poor children of the neighborhood. Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer's Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil. The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls. While some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical changes; <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> educating the sexes separately. The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—"a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desired them". Trimmer's schools became so well known and admired that Raikes, Trimmer's initial inspiration, recommended those who needed assistance organizing a Sunday school to turn to Trimmer; even Queen Charlotte asked Trimmer's advice on founding a Sunday school at Windsor.|$|E
25|$|Marguerite was {{not only}} {{one of the most famous}} people who were {{supporting}} the education of children (especially girls), she had the courage and mindset of her own. She had a rough life growing up. When she was about 15 years old, Marguerite decided to let herself make her own choices despite the fact of what her family was going through. Later on, Marguerite became well known of a lecturer in her early ages. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> god and was really religious of the choices she spoke.|$|E
25|$|She was {{a staunch}} defender of women's rights {{in general and}} refused to allow jokes at women's expense to be told in her company. Those who {{questioned}} the capabilities or equality of women earned her wrath, as Brigham Young discovered when the First Lady grilled him about the Mormons' practice of polygamy and its negative effect on women. Yet while <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the abilities of women, she was not sure that women should work nor did she publicly support women's suffrage although she refused to sign an anti-suffrage petition—an obvious omission to many.|$|E

25|$|Todd argues that, in {{addition}} to patriarchal prejudice, Behn suffered for her dismissal of any liberal agenda. Going against the tide of the times, <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the divine right of kings and aristocratic hierarchies. Todd writes that Behn was contemptuous of democracy and the common man in the street, not expressly interested in human rights — for women or slaves or anyone else — and that, {{because she did not}} support any kind of a liberal agenda, her causes were not cheered by the progressives. She does not easily fit into any mould of proto-feminism. She had come into adulthood, following the English Civil War, under the harsh puritan rule of the Restoration, and regarded political populism as a sign of moral collapse and the triumph of venality.|$|E
500|$|Among Hill's {{concerns}} {{was that}} her tenants, and all urban workers, {{should have access to}} open spaces. [...] <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> [...] "the life-enhancing virtues of pure earth, clean air and blue sky." [...] In 1883, she wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Raised {{a devout}} Christian by her mother, Murray had {{initially}} become a Sunday School teacher to preach the faith, but after entering the academic profession she rejected religion, gaining a reputation among {{other members of}} the Folklore Society as a noted sceptic and a rationalist. She was openly critical of organised religion, although continued to maintain a personal belief in a God of some sort, relating in her autobiography that <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> [...] "an unseen over-ruling Power", [...] "which science calls Nature and religion calls God".|$|E

Tension is built by the repeated appearance of George's old-style shaving razor, his insistence that she join him {{at the edge of}} a cliff, references to his masculine virility, and his warning that her investigation could threaten his business.|$|R

500|$|In 1885 Eddy {{was accused}} of {{promoting}} Spiritualism and pantheism by the Reverend Adoniram J. Gordon, in a letter read out by Joseph Cook {{during one of his}} popular Monday lectures at Tremont Temple in Boston. She demanded a right of reply, and on March 16, 1885, she told the congregation that she was not a Spiritualist, and that <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> God as the Supreme Being and in the atonement. She described Christian Science healing as [...] "Christ come to destroy the power of the flesh." [...] Stephen Gottschalk wrote that the occasion marked the [...] "emergence of Christian Science into American religious life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, {{he became}} the subject of child sexual abuse accusations and Presley, along with a few others, was there for {{emotional}} support. Michael would call Presley from overseas as he embarked upon the second leg of the Dangerous World Tour and the child abuse investigation intensified. During such telephone conversations, Presley attempted to reverse Jackson's sadness with humor and advice. Presley later recalled that <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the musician's innocence and that she could [...] "save him". Fueled by her past addictions and her father's death, Presley supported Jackson as he became addicted on painkillers, urging him to settle the allegations out of court and go into rehabilitation. He subsequently did both.|$|E
500|$|Gillard {{was brought}} up in the Baptist tradition, but is non-{{religious}}. In a 2010 interview, when asked if <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> God, she stated: [...] "No, I don't... I'm not a religious person... I'm a great respecter of religious beliefs but they're not my beliefs." [...] Comparing Australia to the United States in a 2013 interview with The Washington Post, she stated: [...] "I think it would be inconceivable for me if I were an American to have turned up at the highest echelon of American politics being an atheist, single and childless." [...] In her 2014 autobiography, My Story, Gillard stated, [...] "Kevin had to be the leader in our alliance because I understood that I was not what Labor needed at that point: a woman, not married, an atheist." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1903 Pankhurst {{believed}} that years of moderate speeches and promises about women's suffrage {{from members of}} parliament (MPs) had yielded no progress. Although suffrage bills in 1870, 1886, and 1897 had shown promise, each was defeated. She doubted that political parties, with their many agenda items, would ever make women's suffrage a priority. She even broke with the ILP when it refused to focus on Votes for Women. It was necessary to abandon the patient tactics of existing advocacy groups, <b>she</b> <b>believed,</b> <b>in</b> favour of more militant actions. Thus on 10 October 1903 Pankhurst and several colleagues founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an organisation open only to women and focused on direct action to win the vote. [...] "Deeds," [...] she wrote later, [...] "not words, was to be our permanent motto." ...|$|E
500|$|In New York, Dworkin worked {{again as}} an anti-war organizer, participated in demonstrations for lesbian rights and against {{apartheid}} in South Africa. The feminist poet Muriel Rukeyser hired {{her as an}} assistant (Dworkin later said, [...] "I was the worst assistant {{in the history of}} the world. But Muriel kept me on because <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> me as a writer.") Dworkin also joined a feminist consciousness raising group, and soon became involved in radical feminist organizing, focusing on campaigns against violence against women. In addition to her writing and activism, Dworkin gained notoriety as a speaker, mostly for events organized by local feminist groups. She became well known for passionate, uncompromising speeches that aroused strong feelings in both supporters and critics, and inspired her audience to action, such as her speech at the first Take Back the Night march in November 1978, and her 1983 speech at the Midwest Regional Conference of the National Organization for Changing Men (now the National Organization for Men Against Sexism) titled [...] "I Want a Twenty-Four Hour Truce During Which There Is No Rape".|$|E
500|$|Pregnant {{and often}} ill, Mary Godwin {{had to cope}} with Percy's joy at the birth of his son by Harriet Shelley in late 1814 and his {{constant}} outings with Claire Clairmont. Shelley and Clairmont were almost certainly lovers, which caused much jealously on Godwin's part. Shelley greatly offended Godwin at one point when during a walk in the French countryside he suggested that they both take the plunge into a stream naked as it offended her principles. She was partly consoled by the visits of Hogg, whom she disliked at first but soon considered a close friend. Percy Shelley seems to have wanted Mary Godwin and Hogg to become lovers; Mary did not dismiss the idea, since in principle <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> free love. In practice, however, she loved only Percy Shelley and seems to have ventured no further than flirting with Hogg. On 22 February 1815, she gave birth to a two-months premature baby girl, who was not expected to survive. On 6 March, she wrote to Hogg: ...|$|E

Mondale called her [...] "a remarkable woman and a dear human being... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it's a better country for what she did." [...] George H. W. Bush said, [...] "Though we were one-time political opponents, I am happy to say Gerry and I became friends in time – a friendship marked by respect and affection. I admired Gerry in many ways, {{not the least of which}} was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics." [...] Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, [...] "She broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women." [...] Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement that, [...] "Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind – tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> – a New York icon and a true American original." ...|$|E
