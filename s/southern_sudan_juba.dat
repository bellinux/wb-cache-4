5000|$|In 2005, Juba's {{population}} was 163,442. Based on analysis of aerial photos, the best estimate of several donors working in Juba calculated the 2006 population at approximately 250,000. The 5th Sudan Population and Housing Census {{took place in}} April/May 2008, stating the population of Juba County to be 372,413 (the majority residing in Juba City, which dominates the county), but the results were rejected by the Autonomous Government of <b>Southern</b> <b>Sudan.</b> <b>Juba</b> is developing very rapidly due to oil money and the Chinese coming for work and development. [...] In 2011, {{the population of the}} city of Juba is estimated at approximately 372,410, but may potentially be more. , the city's {{population was}} growing at a rate of 4.23%.|$|E
40|$|Northern Bahr el Ghazal area {{in southwestern}} part of Sudan was {{severely}} {{affected by the}} civil wars in Sudan. This has led to lacks of development in most areas, not least water supply. In combination with {{a high number of}} refugees returning to the area the water situation is very difficult. This study is made to investigate how the water project of International Aid Services (IAS) is working. First I wanted to get a good image of the different areas connected to the IAS water project such as community mobilization, drilling and water source and sanitation education. At the time of my studies the Community Mobilization Unit (CMU) had just began their work, therefore the system with Water Source and Sanitation Committees had not yet been really implemented. However, some had been formed but not trained. The drilling is performed using two different methods, Mud Rotary and Air Flush. Mud Rotary is used in clay soil and Air Flush is used in more rocky soil. One of the main problem issues is transport, mainly transport of drilling machines, well material and water used during drilling. Problems in the means of transport are the terrible conditions of the roads which also lead to terrible conditions of the vehicles, especially the heavy vehicles which are very old. Another main problem is supplies, especially supplies of spares for the vehicles and equipment but also food and other essentials. Many things have to be brought from other countries via Khartoum and then by lorry to Northern Bahr el Ghazal. One of my conclusions is that much weight must be put on the county community mobilization to really involve the local people in the project so that they feel responsible for the well after it has been handed over. This is crucial to get full impact of the project. Another conclusion is that if supplies could be handled through <b>Southern</b> <b>Sudan</b> (<b>Juba)</b> it could cut down transport time and costs. But this cannot be realized yet since the range of things in Juba is rather limited compared to Khartoum. Finally I believe that the personnel must be very observant for coming breakdowns and report this immediately to enable ordering spares, etc. as soon as possible and minimize the time standing still...|$|E

40|$|Sudan {{is at an}} important, {{historic}} moment. The upcoming referendum vote {{may very}} likely result in the South becoming an independent state. Since the landmark signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, China, {{and to a lesser}} extent India, have become even more important political and economic partners of the ruling National Congress Party in Khartoum. Generally, commentaries and studies covering China and India's relations with Sudan focus on their interactions with the central government in Khartoum. However, this paper finds that both have also followed a necessary hedging strategy by establishing quasi-diplomatic relations with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-run Government of <b>Southern</b> <b>Sudan</b> in <b>Juba.</b> Both have expanded economic and political relations beyond investment in Sudan's oil sector and beyond merely engaging Khartoum. Chinese and Indian engagement with the GOSS in Juba marks a major shift in policy from dealing exclusively with the central government. The adaptation of both to political developments, however, does not leave them invulnerable to present uncertainties revolving around Sudan's potential split. Due to its economic role in Sudan, China in particular is in a unique position to promote a peaceful transition...|$|R

5000|$|Ibrahim {{was born}} in Sudan in 1957. [...] Ibrahim was from the Koba branch of the Zaghawa ethnic group, which is located mainly in Sudan, with a {{minority}} on the Chad side of the border. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the National Islamic Front (NIF) seizure of power {{under the direction of}} Islamist Hassan al-Turabi in 1989. He also served as the state minister for education in Darfur between 1991 and 1994 in al-Fashir, North Darfur. A physician, Dr. Khalil spent four months in 1992 to fight Sudan People's Armed Forces. By Ibrahim's own account, he was disaffected with the Islamist movement by 2000 after seeing the economic neglect of the NIF, as well as its support to armed militias. At this time, he became part of a covert cell of Islamists who were seeking to change the NiF from inside. Dr. Ibrahim went on to serve as the state minister for social affairs in Blue Nile in 1997 before a post as advisor to the governor of <b>Southern</b> <b>Sudan</b> in <b>Juba</b> in 1998. However, others noted that he never received a national level appointment. Ibrahim's colleague in JEM, Ahmad Tugod, stated, [...] "Khalil is not a first or even second class political leader. ... He struggled all of his life to get a post in Khartoum." [...] He quit the post in August 1998, several months before the end of his appointment, and formed an NGO called [...] "Fighting Poverty". In December 1999, when al-Bashir sidelined al-Turabi with the help of Ali Osman Taha, Dr. Ibrahim was in the Netherlands, studying for a Masters in Public Health at Universiteit Maastricht.|$|R
