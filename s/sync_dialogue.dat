50|$|The {{budget was}} larger on the sequel {{in an attempt}} to attract a bigger audience; in {{contrast}} with the original, where only one of the ten stories was lip sync and the rest in voice over, all the stories in Fantasm Comes Again had lip <b>sync</b> <b>dialogue.</b> Ginnane later thought this was a mistake as it distracted from what was on screen.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{episode was}} shot on {{location}} in and around London. There was no lip <b>sync</b> <b>dialogue,</b> so episodes played like silent movies, narrated by Jason in character over a frenetic piece of library music. Each week Mrs Black would attempt {{to take over the}} world using the electronic gadgetry contained in her [...] "horrible handbag", while Captain Fantastic tried to set things right using his high-tech umbrella.|$|E
5000|$|This {{film was}} {{produced}} in association with Gorky Studios in Moscow. There are several Russian stars whose speech is not in <b>sync</b> with Hindi <b>dialogues</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Drunk History is an American {{television}} {{comedy series}} produced by Comedy Central, {{based on the}} Funny or Die web series created by Derek Waters and Jeremy Konner in 2007. In each episode, an inebriated narrator, who is played by a comedian joined by host Waters, struggles to recount an event from history, while actors enact the narrator's anecdotes and also lip <b>sync</b> the <b>dialogue.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{characters}} {{encountered in}} Dust are rendered {{by way of}} photographs of professional actors given limited animation in <b>sync</b> with <b>dialogue.</b> A later game produced by the same company, Titanic: Adventure Out of Time, uses the same technique and contains several references to Dust, including a reappearance of the character Buick Riviera. Dust: A Tale of the Wired West: The Official Strategy Guide (Prima Publishing, 1995) was written by Steve Schwartz in cooperation with Cyberflix.|$|R
50|$|The many {{martial arts}} movies from Hong Kong that were {{imported}} under the unofficial banner Kung Fu Theater were notorious for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip <b>sync</b> and awkward <b>dialogue.</b> Since {{the results were}} frequently unintentionally hilarious, this {{has become one of}} the hallmarks that endear these films to part of the 1980s culture.|$|R
50|$|Filming a car driving {{slowly in}} reverse, then playing the footage {{backwards}} {{at a higher}} speed gives {{the illusion of a}} car quickly approaching as the camera darts in front of it stylishly. Clever fades give the impression of time changes while smash cuts add tension to a scene in which the protagonist wakes up after passing out. Certain edits were also introduced to the film to time footage to different dialogue, adding certain information and leaving other information out. These edits are noticeable, as the actors' mouths are not always moving in <b>sync</b> with their <b>dialogue.</b> One particular scene, in which de Ravin's character floated toward the camera, used a green screen, but it was edited out of the film before its completion.|$|R
50|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 2 September 2013 at Puducherry. It {{was reported that}} the film would be shot across locations such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Burma among many other countries. In Malaysia, a football game scene {{was shot in the}} oldest English school in South East Asia, Penang Free School. The second schedule took place in Hyderabad, where an action sequence was shot for 20 days, along with a song sequence choreographed by Baba Baskar. According to unit members, Amyra stunned the unit with her perfect lip <b>sync</b> for Tamil <b>dialogues</b> and that she overshadowed the hero in some places as well. By 29 May 2014, 90% of the movie was shot, including 3 song sequences. Another song sequence and part of the climax were shot on a farmland, spread over 100 acres, near Puducherry. During the process of shooting the climax, which was reported to be a racy stunt sequence, Dhanush injured his leg severely, because of which shooting was halted for 3 weeks, after which Dhanush recovered and shooting proceeded as scheduled. The team then went to Scotland to shoot for a song sequence. In mid-August 2014, the filming was almost done with just a song left to be shot in Chennai on 1 September 2014. On 15 September 2014, Anand confirmed that the shooting of the film was completed.|$|R
