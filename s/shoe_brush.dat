50|$|Middlesex Colony was {{intended}} to be as self-sufficient as possible, with the desire that patients capable of working would work at various tasks. Many of the male patients provided the labour for the farming ventures of the institution. Fruits and vegetables were raised and cattle, pigs and chickens were raised. Milk was even sold to Shenley Hospital. Men also worked in workshops to provide needed goods for the hospital, such as clothes, <b>shoes,</b> <b>brushes</b> and upholstery. They also performed carpentry. Female patients worked in the laundry and kitchens and helped keep the wards clean. Even pediatric patients were given duties. A school was built for the children.|$|R

30|$|Phase 2 {{seeks to}} develop daily {{activities}} {{that can occur}} {{at the start of}} the afternoon, during lunchtime. The time of day is represented by a clock on the wall set to 12  pm located beside a door. After this image, Phase 2 starts with the display of six pairs of cards, and the image of one card from each pair is shown while the other is hidden. The aim is to challenge the player a little more, increasing the level of difficulty. The player should first click on the card with the hidden image, which is revealed, and then identify and click on the card with the image corresponding to the card already revealed on the screen. In this phase, actions related to personal hygiene and the house are addressed, represented by an image of washed dishes, shoes being cleaned, feet wearing shoes, a person washing his/her hair, perfume being sprayed, and flossing one’s teeth. Upon correctly associating these actions with the objects represented by the shampoo, the dental floss, the <b>shoe</b> <b>brush,</b> the sandal, the plate, and the deodorant, the phase is concluded.|$|E

50|$|There is {{wide variety}} of artefacts, {{including}} craftsmen's tools, manufactured goods and toys, reflecting the changing fortunes of its traditional industries; - boots and <b>shoes,</b> <b>brushes,</b> woodenware and beer brewing. Exhibits demonstrate the transition from cottage industries to ones carried out in large Victorian factories. Early on in the 20th century the town was the centre of diverse industrial activity. Among the vast range of products made were handbags, pencils, teddy bears, aircraft seats, flags and aluminium foil. Through its exhibits, which form part of its permanent display, the museum illustrates how these manufacturing industries first flourished and then, {{in the second half}} of the 20th century, declined as they were progressively replaced by new businesses relating to pharmaceuticals, information technology and engineering.|$|R
50|$|Emelgem {{was for a}} {{long time}} an {{agricultural}} village. Lots of inhabitants worked in the <b>shoe</b> and <b>brush</b> industry in the nearby city of Izegem.

40|$|This degree {{project is}} a {{realization}} of a strategy for collaboration between an industrial designer and employed workmen of a producing company. The collaboration aims to engage everyone involved in the co-authorship of a products design and manufacturing history. The realization {{has taken place in}} an open dialogue where the designer no longer owns the design process by himself. The project has been carried out in cooperation with the company Iris Hantverk. The company is owned by the Swedish body for visually impaired and has their main production facility in Stockholm. Through interventions and workshops together with the visually impaired workmen a plug-in* has been developed that transforms traditional vegetable <b>brushes</b> into <b>shoe</b> <b>brushes.</b> The result is a small scale design and production process where products emerge through exchange of knowledge and dexterity between designer and workmen...|$|R
500|$|Unlike other {{climbing}} sports, bouldering can {{be performed}} safely and effectively with very little equipment, an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing to many climbers. Bouldering pioneer John Sherman asserted that [...] "The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders". Others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag as the bare minimum, while more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of <b>shoes,</b> chalk, <b>brushes,</b> crash pads, and a skincare kit.|$|R

5000|$|While Philemon {{dances with}} the {{friends at the}} smoky shebeen {{to the tune of}} Spokes Mashiyane’s “Phatha Phatha”, we return to the prologue in which a person dresses: a hand removes a suit from a cupboard, the same hand polishes <b>shoes,</b> <b>brushes</b> trousers, fastens cufflinks, buttons up a jacket. Finally, we realise that the person now fully dressed in the suit is in fact Matilda, though we do not see her face, and the tie is {{attached}} to the rafters of the bedroom. Back at the shebeen, Philemon is seated, contemplating his punishment of Matilda, as the music and sounds fade to a muffle. Gradually, Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit” fades in as Philemon scratches his brow and the song continues to play as Philemon staggers home {{in the early hours of}} the morning. [...] "Strange Fruit" [...] was popular in Sophiatown at the time due to the gradual entrenchment of apartheid laws. Matilda steps up onto a crate, then kicks it out from underneath her and she hangs herself. Philemon enters the bedroom and falls to his knees below Matilda’s hanging feet as he shouts her name repeatedly. “Strange Fruit” continues to play over the end credits of the film.|$|R
40|$|Brush seals {{are rapidly}} {{replacing}} conventional labyrinth seals in turbomachinery applications. Upon pressure application, seal stiffness increases drastically due to frictional bristle interlocking. Operating stiffness {{is critical to}} determine seal wear life. Typically, seal stiffness is measured by pressing a curved <b>shoe</b> to <b>brush</b> bore. The static-unpressurized measurement is extrapolated to pressurized and high speed operating conditions. This work presents a seal stiffness measurement system {{that is capable of}} measuring brush seal stiffness under engine operating pressure and speed condition which is not available in open literature. Stiffness measurement system design, testing methodology and calibration procedure are discussed...|$|R

6000|$|Fiorsen's bedroom was--as {{the maid}} would remark--"a proper pigsty"--until {{he was out}} of it and it could be renovated each day. He had a talent for disorder, so that the room looked as if three men instead of one had gone to bed in it. Clothes and <b>shoes,</b> <b>brushes,</b> water, tumblers, breakfast-tray, newspapers, French novels, and cigarette-ends--none were ever where they should have been; and the stale fumes from the many {{cigarettes}} he smoked before getting up incommoded anyone whose duty it was to take him tea and shaving-water. When, on that first real summer day, the maid had brought Rosek up to him, he had been lying a long time on his back, dreamily watching the smoke from his cigarette and four flies waltzing in the sunlight that filtered through the green sun-blinds. This hour, before he rose, was his creative moment, when he could best see the form of music and feel inspiration for its rendering. Of late, he had been stale and wretched, all that side of him dull; but this morning he felt again the delicious stir of fancy, that vibrating, half-dreamy state when emotion seems so easily to find shape and the mind pierces through to new expression. Hearing the maid's knock, and her murmured: [...] "Count Rosek to see you, sir," [...] he thought: 'What the devil does he want?' A larger nature, drifting without control, in contact with a smaller one, who knows his own mind exactly, will instinctively be irritable, though he may fail to grasp what his friend is after.|$|R

50|$|They usually {{sit on a}} tiny plastic {{chair with}} a small wooden block placed in front at arm’s length as a shoe-holder. The shoe-shining kit {{consists}} mostly of paste tins, sponge daubers, some shine cloths, shoe horns and <b>shoe</b> shine <b>brushes.</b> The white-collar workers in the financial district are the main customers for shoe shiners in Hong Kong. They stand, or sit {{if there is a}} chair provided, facing the shoe shiner with one leg up on the wooden block, waiting patiently for the polishing to be done. Shoe shiners spend approximately 10 minutes buffing each pair of shoes. One can at most, polish over 20 pairs in nice weather day. They charge HK$40 for one pair with tips occasionally. As of 2015, the shoe shiners in Hong Kong are mostly aged 60 or above. It is now considered a fading profession in Hong Kong, which has made the shoe shining industry one of the sunset industries in Hong Kong.|$|R
40|$|Brush seals are {{comprised}} of fine diameter fibers densely packed between retaining and backing plates. To achieve seal compliance bristles {{are arranged to}} contact rotor with some lay angle. When axial pressure load is applied, bristles interlock and get stuck at the backing plate, and seal stiffness varies under operating conditions. Operating stiffness is critical to determine seal-rotor contact pressure and wear life. Typically, seal stiffness is measured by pressing a curved <b>shoe</b> to <b>brush</b> bore as reported in open literature. Due to the complex nature of pressure-stiffness bristle behavior, static and unpressurized measurements cannot represent actual working seal stiffness. This work presents a brush seal stiffness measurement system {{that is capable of}} measuring seal stiffness under working pressure and speed conditions. Rotor speed is achieved by an integrated spindle drive, while contact forces are measured via sensitive load cells. Rotor excursions are applied through lateral motions of the seal housing that is actuated by a motorized linear slide. Stiffness testing methodology and calibration procedure are discussed. Comparative experimental data are presented for both static pressurized and dynamic-pressurized stiffness tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract I {{will not}} violate my {{covenant}} or alter {{the word that}} went forth from my lips. Psalm 89 : 34 Contract law exists since the time immemorial. Our life is full of promises. In Ethiopia, there is a saying that ‘‘it is better to lose one’s son than breaking promises’’. This shows promises which are the basis of contractual agreements have attained idiomatic status. So, the existence of informal agreements is a reality, and their enforcement is backed by societal norms, at the very least. In similar fashion, modern agreements have been recognized since the 1960 s. The civil code of Ethiopia has a general contract and special contracts sections that give effect to formal commitments. Additionally, the Commercial Code, maritime Code and other proclamations regulate specific contractual relations. As stated above, though Ethiopia has a codified civil and commercial code which has a part on contract formation, it has been almost six decades since it took effect. These codes may regulate our contractual relationships when we buy or sell foods and drinks, buy or sell tickets; employ personnel as a laborer, researcher, professor, designer or driver; get our <b>shoes</b> <b>brushed</b> and buffed with polish; give or receive consultation services; buy and sell shares and stocks…etc., in the offline world. However, in recent years {{an increasing number of}} transactions in international trade are carried out by means of electronic data interchange and other means of communication, commonly referred to as “electronic commerce”, which involve the use of alternatives to paper-based methods of communication and storage of information. As the volume of electronic contracting continues to increase rapidly, legislatures around the world are evaluating existing contract law doctrines in light of new business practices. This is because we are seeing contracts on emails, web portals, other electronic devices, and electronic data interchange? we also want to sign electronically and want to avoid physical(place) and time barriers. The question, then is, does Ethiopia take part in this alarmingly increasing electronic transaction. If yes, does it have a legal framework to address and guide the smooth functioning of commercial dealings? No doubt, these days data messages and electronic communications could not be addressed by 60 years old Codes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} very modest. It sifts out one aspect of commercial transactions centering its main focus on contract formation. Accordingly, the paper appreciates the existing contract formation in Ethiopia and its place in the newly emerging electronic communications. Finally, after a thorough examination of contract formation in the offline and virtual world, I put forward recommendations...|$|R

Every thing with regard to his worldly business was so arranged that by Saturday noon it seemed to come to a close of itself. All his accounts were looked over, his work-men paid, all borrowed things returned, and lent things sent after, and every tool and article belonging to the farm was returned to its own place at exactly such an hour every Saturday afternoon, and an hour before sundown every item of preparation, even to the blacking of his Sunday <b>shoes</b> and the <b>brushing</b> of his Sunday coat, was entirely concluded; and at the going down of the sun, the stillness of the Sabbath seemed to settle down over the whole dwelling.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{types of}} {{interactions}} {{between humans and}} animals are presented in the video, including the care, stewardship and play associated with domesticated animals, hunting, animal servitude, and man-eating. Despite the prominent repetition of the lyric [...] "man-eater" [...] the video does not depict men or boys. The schoolgirls' childlike activities (climbing, swinging, walking on stilts, jumping rope, piggy-back riding, pillow fighting, and clapping games) take place near and even on animals such as elephants, greyhounds, tigers, rheas, falcons, and monkeys. Animals are depicted in the video with as much agency as the humans: monkeys read pieces of paper, falcons intervene to prevent the red-head from shooting a monkey, the rhea allows two girls to ride on its back, and the tiger eats the girls brushing him. The video also contains several depictions of Case {{in the form of}} a portrait hung in the manor's stairwell and the transposition of one of Case's promotional portraits from Middle Cyclone onto the paper one of the monkeys possesses. The black comic scene in which the tiger has eaten his youthful groomers (their <b>shoes</b> and <b>brushes</b> have been left behind as the animal licks its chops) alludes to Case's song [...] "The Tigers Have Spoken", whose lyrics describe a man-eating tiger driven mad by the isolation of captivity and shot on his chain.|$|R
500|$|Shoe polish {{is applied}} to the shoe using a rag, cloth, or <b>brush.</b> <b>Shoe</b> polish is not a {{cleaning}} product, and therefore the footwear should be both clean and dry before application. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. [...] Polishes containing carnauba wax {{can be used as a}} protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.|$|R
60|$|Uncertain {{with whom}} he had been holding a {{conversation}} so strange, Jekyl remained looking after him, until his attention was roused by a little boy, who crept out from an adjoining thicket, with a switch in his hand, which he had been just cutting,--probably against regulations to the contrary effect made and provided, for he held himself ready to take cover in the copse again, in case any one were in sight who might be interested in chastising his delinquency. Captain Jekyl easily recognised in him one of that hopeful class of imps, who pick up a precarious livelihood about places of public resort, by going errands, <b>brushing</b> <b>shoes,</b> doing the groom's and coachman's work in the stables, driving donkeys, opening gates, and so forth, for about one-tenth part of their time, spending the rest in gambling, sleeping in the sun, and otherwise qualifying themselves to exercise the profession of thieves and pickpockets, either separately, or in conjunction with those of waiters, grooms, and postilions. The little outcast had an indifferent pair of pantaloons, and about half a jacket, for, like Pentapolin with the naked arm, he went on action with his right shoulder bare; a third part of what had once been a hat covered his hair, bleached white with the sun, and his face, as brown as a berry, was illuminated by a pair of eyes, which, for spying out either peril or profit, might have rivalled those of the hawk.--In a word, it was the original Puck of the Shaws dramaticals.|$|R
