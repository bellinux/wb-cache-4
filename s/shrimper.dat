2500|$|The {{shipwreck}} {{may have}} been known to one or more local watermen before its discovery by archaeologists. [...] During the 1996 excavations, Texas Historical Commission archaeologists observed direct evidence that one of the four bronze cannons known to have been on La Belle had been removed from the wreckage some time before the 1995 discovery of the wreck, possibly decades earlier. [...] It was surmised that this {{may have been}} the action of a local <b>shrimper</b> who may have accidentally snagged and recovered the gun in his nets. [...] The whereabouts of this cannon remain a mystery, and no other clear signs of prior artifact recovery were observed at the wreck site.|$|E

40|$|The inshore shrimp {{fisheries}} {{along the}} coast of the Gulf of Mexico represent {{a significant portion of the}} total shrimp harvest in the Gulf. The shrimp harvest is allocated to the offshore and inshore fisheries through the use of season closures. In 1981, the Gulf of Mexico Regional Fisheries Management Council began implementing a policy known as the Texas Closure; a seasonal closure of the waters of the Federal Conservation Zone concurrent with the traditional season closure of the state waters of Texas. One impact of the Texas Closure on the offshore fishery has been fleet displacement from Texas to Louisiana waters. When offshore <b>shrimpers</b> were surveyed as to their perceptions of the Texas Closure, the most discontent was expressed among those <b>shrimpers</b> closest to the Texas/Louisiana border. This thesis examines the perceived impacts of the Texas Closure on the inshore <b>shrimpers</b> of the two bays closest to th...|$|R
