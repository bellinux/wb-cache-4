5|$|Hurricane Ileana never {{significantly}} impacted land, and no {{tropical cyclone}} warnings or watches for the storm. While near peak intensity, it passed 60mi (100km) {{south of the}} unpopulated Socorro Island; a station on the island recorded sustained winds of 59mph (95km/h), with gusts to 77mph (125km/h).

5|$|In the Warriors universe, a {{large group}} of feral cats has settled into a forest, and claimed it for their own. The cats are split into four smaller Clans: ThunderClan lives in {{woodland}} areas, WindClan reside on the moors, RiverClan by the lake and ShadowClan within and around the swamps. A fifth Clan, SkyClan, also used {{to be a part of}} this system, but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed to make human houses. Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain; RiverClan, for example, will <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river to catch fish, whilst the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water.|$|E

5|$|When Hurricane Hugo {{destroyed}} the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, Duncan {{was forced to}} <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocean and he quickly lost his enthusiasm for swimming because of his fear of sharks. Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and died one day before his 14th birthday. In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's refusal to leave college early. Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.|$|E
5|$|At the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, Brazil {{finished}} 4th in the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle, in a relay {{composed by}} Bruno Fratus, Marcelo Chierighini, Matheus Santana and João de Lucca. César Cielo didn't <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final – despite being {{a participant in}} the championship, he was suffering with shoulder pain. According to the doctor of the Brazilian Aquatic Sports Confederation (CBDA), Gustavo Magliocca, Cielo had an inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon. The injury is considered common in the athletes, and it was being treated with physiotherapy. Due to the problem, in the Men's 50 metre butterfly, Cielo struggled though the heats and the semifinals, but slumped to 6th in the final. On August 5, Cielo left the competition due to the increase of his injury.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E

5|$|In February 1897, he {{was sentenced}} without trial to three years' exile in eastern Siberia. He was granted {{a few days in}} Saint Petersburg to put his affairs in order and used this time to meet with the Social-Democrats, who had renamed {{themselves}} the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. His journey to eastern Siberia took 11 weeks, for much of which he was accompanied by his mother and sisters. Deemed only a minor threat to the government, he was exiled to a peasant's hut in Shushenskoye, Minusinsky District, where he was kept under police surveillance; he was nevertheless able to correspond with other revolutionaries, many of whom visited him, and permitted to go on trips to <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yenisei River and to hunt duck and snipe.|$|E
5|$|In fact, tadpoles {{developing}} in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous. Pond tadpoles {{tend to have}} deep bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria. They also feed on diatoms, filtered from the water through the gills, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut {{to enable them to}} digest this diet. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) can occasionally be cannibalistic, the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Britain, Mayer often {{flew over}} the English Channel as the wingman of Helmut Wick. He claimed three further {{victories}} in this campaign, all over Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfires, but was himself shot down or forced to land at the French Coast. Once he had to <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Channel for an hour before he was rescued. At the end of 1940 Mayer had four victories to his credit and JG2 was withdrawn from combat to replenish the heavy losses it had sustained. Following a short tour as fighter pilot instructor at the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, Mayer {{was sent back to}} the Channel Front.|$|E

The fastest Australian in the corresponding individual event, he was rested in the qualifying round; Australia came third in their heat and ninth overall to miss the final by 1.88s after Peter Dawson swam his split in a time four seconds slower than Kerry's effort in the individual event. Had Kerry repeated his individual time in the relay in place of Dawson, Australia would have qualified fifth.|$|E
5|$|My father... was {{the richest}} man in Palestine. He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe—especially to England and Germany. He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E
