5|$|Around 1991, Gossard {{was selling}} the Wonderbra lines under {{licenses}} {{that were to}} expire in January 1994. At the time, the plunge style was a good seller in the UK market.

Instead of simply renewing the agreement, Gossard executives decided to negotiate better terms with Sara Lee.|$|E

5|$|Roger was consecrated Archbishop of York on 10 October 1154. When he went {{north to}} York, the legal scholar Vacarius, {{who had been}} part of Theobald's household, {{followed}} Roger and spent the next 50 years in the north. Vacarius was responsible for introducing Roman civil law into England, and did <b>so</b> <b>under</b> the patronage of Roger. He wrote a standard textbook on the civil law, the Liber pauperum, and was an important advisor for Roger.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Keyes criticized Massachusetts {{governor}} Mitt Romney for instituting {{gay marriage}} entirely on his own—according to Keyes—with no requirement or {{authority to do}} <b>so</b> <b>under</b> Massachusetts law. Keyes said Romney's actions, which he suggested were due to a complete misunderstanding of his role as governor and {{of the limitations of}} the judicial branch of government, were not necessitated by a ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in November 2003 that directed the state legislature to institute same-sex marriage. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court had ruled that the state law banning same-sex marriage was not constitutional. The court gave the Massachusetts Legislature 180 days to modify the law; after it failed to do so, Gov. Mitt Romney ordered town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses on May 17, 2004, in compliance with the court ruling.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{filed for}} and {{received}} a judgment of divorce before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection. Following the trial, Lhermitte {{was not able to}} pay for the trial costs, <b>so</b> <b>under</b> Belgian law it fell to her now ex-husband to pick up the bill. This conformed to the Law of Belgium, with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement. The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system. Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be balanced by decency” given the nature of the tragedy.|$|E

5|$|On the {{question}} of images, Elizabeth's initial reaction was to allow crucifixes and candlesticks and the restoration of roods, {{but some of the}} new bishops whom she had elevated protested. In 1560 Edmund Grindal, one of the Marian exiles now made Bishop of London, was allowed to enforce the demolition of rood lofts in London and in 1561 the Queen herself ordered the demolition of all lofts. Thereafter, the determination to prevent any further restoration was evidenced by the more thoroughgoing destruction of roods, vestments, stone altars, dooms, statues and other ornaments. The queen also appointed a new Privy Council, removing many Roman Catholic counsellors by doing <b>so.</b> <b>Under</b> Elizabeth, factionalism in the Council and conflicts at court greatly diminished. The Act of Supremacy was passed without difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The West Point Association of Graduates (WPAOG) {{also offers}} {{scholarship}} support {{to people who}} are qualified but not selected. The scholarships usually cover around $7,000 to civilian universities; the students who receive these scholarships do <b>so</b> <b>under</b> the stipulation that they will be admitted to and attend West Point a year later. Those who do not must repay the AOG. Marion Military Institute, New Mexico Military Institute, Georgia Military College, Hargrave Military Academy, Greystone Preparatory School at Schreiner University, and Northwestern Preparatory School are approved programs that students attend on the AOG scholarship prior to admission to West Point.|$|E
5|$|To {{become law}} or bill, a {{constitutional}} amendment {{had to have the}} assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had a veto over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and <b>so,</b> <b>under</b> the Meiji constitution, Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. While the Diet could veto the annual budget, if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force. This all changed with the new constitution after World War II.|$|E

5|$|With Arundel's {{change of}} {{allegiance}} came {{a conflict of}} interest. In August 1321, a demand was made to the king that Hugh Despenser and his father, Hugh Despenser the elder, be sent into exile. The king, facing a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, {{had no choice but}} to assent. Arundel voted for the expulsion, but later he claimed that he did <b>so</b> <b>under</b> compulsion, and also supported their recall in December. Arundel had suffered personally from the rebellion, when Roger Mortimer seized his castle of Clun. Early in 1322, Arundel joined King Edward in a campaign against the Mortimer family. The opposition soon crumbled, and the king decided to move against Thomas of Lancaster, who had been supporting the marcher rebellion all along. Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March, and executed.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} cadmium {{is composed}} of 8 isotopes. Two of them are radioactive, and three are expected to decay but have not done <b>so</b> <b>under</b> laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are 113Cd (beta decay, half-life is 7.7 × 1015 years) and 116Cd (two-neutrino double beta decay, half-life is 2.9 × 1019 years). The other three are 106Cd, 108Cd (both double electron capture), and 114Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes– 110Cd, 111Cd, and 112Cd– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are 109Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and 115Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5 hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known meta states, with the most stable being 113mCd (t1⁄2= 14.1 years), 115mCd (t1⁄2= 44.6 days), and 117mCd (t1⁄2= 3.36 hours).|$|E
5|$|Riel {{made his}} way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or assassination, vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in the House of Commons—Edward Blake, the Premier of Ontario, had {{announced}} a bounty of $5,000 for his arrest. Famously, Riel was the only Member of Parliament who was not present for the great Pacific Scandal debate of 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the interim prime minister, and a general election was held in January 1874. Although the Liberals under Mackenzie formed the new government, Riel easily retained his seat. Formally, Riel had to sign a register book at least once upon being elected, and he did <b>so</b> <b>under</b> disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had become the member for the electoral district of Lisgar.|$|E

5|$|The Denver Broncos {{selected}} Pastrana in {{the eleventh}} {{round of the}} 1969 NFL Draft with the 270th overall pick. In 1969, he saw action in two games and did not attempt a pass, but did have one reception for 15yards. The following season, he played in five games, including three as starter in relief of Steve Tensi, who had suffered a shoulder injury. Against the San Diego Chargers, Pastrana drove the team to the opposing 35-yard line and within field goal range, but he was knocked unconscious and could not call a crucial timeout. As the offensive captain, {{he was the only}} person authorized to do <b>so</b> <b>under</b> the rules at the time, and the clock expired to result in a 1717 stalemate. The rules regarding timeouts were changed after the season. In 1970, Pastrana completed 29of 75pass attempts for 420yards and one touchdown, rushed 14times for 89yards and one touchdown, threw nine interceptions, and was sacked eight times. Five of his interceptions came against the Kansas City Chiefs. Pastrana suffered a severe concussion that effectively ended his career {{near the end of the}} 1970 season and also heavily altered his personality. In the 1971 offseason, head coach Lou Saban held try-outs with seven quarterbacks. By the end of August, Pastrana made the cut to the final three, alongside Don Horn and Steve Ramsey, and was the only quarterback remaining on the team from the prior season. Pastrana, however, was cut in early September.|$|E
5|$|When Salten {{originally}} published Bambi in 1923, he did <b>so</b> <b>under</b> Germany's copyright laws, which required no {{statement that the}} novel was copyrighted. In the 1926 republication, he did include a United States copyright notice, so the work is considered to have been copyrighted in the United States in 1926. In 1936, Salten sold some rights to the novel to MGM producer Sidney Franklin who passed them on to Walt Disney {{for the creation of}} a film adaptation. After Salten's death in 1945, his daughter Anna Wyler inherited the copyright and renewed the novel's copyrighted status in 1954 (U.S. copyright law in effect at the time provided for an initial term of 28 years from the date of first publication in the U.S., which could be extended for an additional 28 years provided the copyright holder filed for renewal before the expiration of the initial copyright). In 1958, she formulated three agreements with Disney regarding the novel's rights. Upon her death in 1977, the rights passed to her husband, Veit Wyler, and her children, who held on to them until 1993 when he sold the rights to the publishing house Twin Books. Twin Books and Disney disagreed on the terms and validity of Disney's original contract with Anna Wyler and Disney's continued use of the Bambi name.|$|E
