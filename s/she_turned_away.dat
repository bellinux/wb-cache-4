25|$|This same trip proved tragic as both of Elisabeth's {{children}} {{became ill}} with diarrhea. While Gisela recovered quickly, two-year-old Sophie grew steadily weaker, then died. It is generally assumed today that {{she died of}} typhus. Her death pushed Elisabeth, who was already prone to bouts of melancholy, into periods of heavy depression, which would haunt her {{for the rest of}} her life. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> from her living daughter, began neglecting her, and their relationship never recovered.|$|E
500|$|Emerald and Amethyst {{had more}} {{success in the}} spring of 1809 when on 23 March they {{captured}} the brigs Caroline and Serpent. In April, Emerald assisted Amethyst in the chase of a large 44-gun frigate off Ushant. Emerald sighted , with a main battery of 18-pounders and under the command of Captain Dupoter, at 11:00 on 5 April and immediately signalled Amethyst for assistance. Amethyst {{caught a glimpse of the}} French forty-four just as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> to the south-east and gave chase but by 19:20 had lost sight of both Niemen and Emerald. Amethyst fell in with Niemen again at around 21:30 and engaged her. Niemen was forced to strike when a second British frigate, [...] came into view and fired a broadside. The Royal Navy took Niemen into service under her existing name.|$|E
500|$|Frauenlob shortly {{thereafter}} encountered the British cruiser [...] {{and opened fire}} at 09:09. She quickly found the range and hit the British ship an estimated 2535 times, disabling {{all but one of}} her guns and inflicting serious damage. One shell detonated a cordite charge and set Arethusa on fire. The ship's engine room flooded and her speed fell to [...] <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> to starboard in order to escape from the punishing fire, but Frauenlob kept up with the badly damaged British cruiser until she disappeared in the fog. In return, Frauenlob was hit ten times, but was not seriously damaged; in all, five men were killed and another thirty-two were wounded. After the engagement ended, Frauenlob took the badly damaged minesweeper [...] under tow and returned her to Heligoland, before proceeding to Wilhelmshaven.|$|E

500|$|Recent historians, however, hold to the German {{account of}} the ship's sinking. Black Prince briefly engaged the German {{battleship}} [...] at about 23:35 GMT, scoring two hits with 6-inch shells. Separated {{from the rest of}} the British fleet, Black Prince approached the German lines at approximately midnight. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> from the German battleships, but it was too late. The German battleship [...] fixed Black Prince in her searchlights and opened fire. Up to five other German ships, including the battleships , , and , joined in the bombardment, with return fire from Black Prince being ineffective. Most of the German ships were between [...] of Black Prince — effectively point-blank range for contemporary naval gunnery. The ship was hit by at least twelve heavy shells and several smaller ones, sinking within 15 minutes. There were no survivors from her crew, all 857 being killed.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{blind and}} unable to {{effectively}} fire her main and secondary armament, South Dakota was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes {{by most of the}} ships of the Japanese force, including Kirishima, beginning around midnight on 15 November. Although able to score a few hits on Kirishima, South Dakota took 26 hits—some of which did not explode—that completely knocked out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement. All of the Japanese torpedoes missed. Admiral Lee later described the cumulative effect of the gunfire damage to South Dakota as to, [...] "render one of our new battleships deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent." [...] South Dakotas crew casualties were 39killed and 59wounded, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> from the battle at 00:17 without informing Admiral Lee, though observed by Kondo's lookouts.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} year of her life, Austen revised Northanger Abbey (1817), wrote Persuasion (1817), and began another novel, {{eventually}} titled Sanditon, which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see Northanger Abbey or Persuasion through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death and her brother Henry included a [...] "Biographical Notice of the Author". This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: [...] "Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives...o much did she shrink from notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced her, had she lived, to affix her name to any productions of her [...] public <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> from any allusion to the character of an authoress." [...] However, this description is in direct contrast to the excitement Austen shows in her letters regarding publication and profit: Austen was a professional writer.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1890, Burnett's {{oldest son}} Lionel died from {{consumption}} in Paris, which greatly affected {{her life and}} her writing. Before his death, she sought a cure from physicians {{and took him to}} Germany to visit spas. After his death, before she sank into a deep depression, she {{wrote in a letter to}} a friend that her writing was insignificant in comparison to having been the mother of two boys, one of whom died. At this time <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> from her traditional faith in the Church of England and embraced Spiritualism and Christian Science. [...] She returned to London, where she sought the distraction of charity work and formed the Drury Lane Boys' Club, hosting an opening in February 1892. Also during this period she wrote a play with a starring role for Stephen Townsend in an attempt to begin his acting career. After a two-year absence from her Washington, D.C. home, her husband, and her younger son, Burnett returned there in March 1892, where she continued charity work and began writing again. [...] In 1893, Burnett published an autobiography, devoted to her eldest son, titled The One I Knew Best of All. Also in that year, she had a set of her books displayed at the Chicago World Fair.|$|E
