50|$|Savoury dumplings {{made from}} balls of dough {{are part of}} {{traditional}} British and Irish cuisine. Traditionally dumplings are made from twice the weight of <b>self</b> <b>raising</b> <b>flour</b> to suet, bound together by cold water to form a dough and seasoned with salt and pepper. Balls of this dough are dropped into a bubbling pot of stew or soup, or into a casserole. They sit, partly submerged in the stew, and expand as they are half-boiled half-steamed for ten minutes or so. The cooked dumplings are airy {{on the inside and}} moist on the outside. The dough may be flavoured with herbs, or it may have cheese pressed into its centre.|$|E
50|$|Chinese buns {{in general}} may {{be divided into}} two types, {{depending}} on the degree of leavening of the flour skin. Buns can be made with leavened or unleavened dough. Those made with unleavened dough use clear water for mixing, the skin is thin and the fillings large. It is frequently made in Nanxiang, but is imitated elsewhere, calling it Xiang-style. Steamed buns made with <b>raised</b> <b>flour</b> are seen throughout China and are what is usually referred to as baozi. Steamed xiaolongbao made with partially <b>raised</b> <b>flour</b> are more commonly seen in the south. This means that their skin is tender, smoother, and somewhat translucent, rather than being white and fluffy. As is traditional for buns of various sizes in the Jiangnan region, xiaolongbao are pinched at the top prior to steaming, so the skin has a circular cascade of ripples around the crown.|$|R

Building on the framework of Eggertsson et al. (2016), we show that the transition to full employment and at-target inflation requires real and nominal depreciation of the exchange rate.

Some recipes favour soaking the dried fruit in tea overnight before the baking. This mixture is then proven to allow fermentation to take place. After an initial period, the air is knocked out of the mixture and it is allowed to prove once more. This period of preparation {{can take up to}} two hours, including the resting time for the bread mixture. It is then baked in an oven. Bara brith is traditionally served at tea time, alongside tea.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a genealogical {{study of the}} self to discover {{the reasons for the}} failure of "self" and "self-concept" as an empirical target, taking the point of departure to be current self research. In discussing the evolution of Michel Foucault's historiography, H. Dreyfus and P. Rabinow (1983) differentiate between an "archeology," which is more or less direct historical analysis of discourse and praxis, and a "genealogy," which emphasizes the conditions that limit, enable, or otherwise alter the context under which a particular discourse is made possible. In this chapter, a geneaology is conducted by reviewing the self literature. It's current uses, meanings, and practices are offered and its is concluded that the concept of <b>self</b> <b>raises</b> issues that one cannot simply ignore, as behaviorism had ignored mental states, nor is an answer to be found in transforming or reframing the self into behavioral operational definitions o self-concept or self esteem. It is recommended that further research be conducted in this area of study. (from the chapter...|$|R

Through embryo rescue for obtaining more progenies, selfed plants were obtained in three species and hybrid plants were obtained from five interspecific crosses.

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} closely {{two aspects of}} Pauline theology, namely, {{the timing of the}} resurrection and the state of the believer who dies before the parousia. Through exegesis of 2 Cor 5 : 1 - 10, the basic {{consistency}} in Paul's thinking and the arguments for and against the intermediate state will be examined. Chapter 1 analyzes what 1 Thess. 4, 1 Cor. 15, and 2 Cor. 5 have to say on the issue, comparing the passages as to content and compatibility. Chapters 2 and 3 pursue more fully questions related to the issue of postmortem existence. Chapter Two deals with Paul's use of verb $ underline{ eta o iota mu alpha sigma beta alpha iota}$ as a metaphor for death and the idea of the intermediate state as soul-sleep (psychopannychism).

40|$|Temperature levels, {{planting}} depths, and cultivars, affected seedling traits as expected. An {{increase in}} temperature from 12. 8 / 12. 8 to 20 / 20 °C increased coleoptile length by 21 min implying that higher temperatures facilitated coleoptile elongation. An increase in planting depth from 2. 5 to 7. 5 an increased coleoptile length, shoot length, and fresh weight and decreased root length and germination % of the seedlings across cultivars. Cultivars had {{a wide range}} of responses in their mean performance for the seedling traits. Scout 66, Nekota, and Niobrara were considered to have good seedling vigor while Alliance, Arapahoe and Centura, were considered to have poor seedling vigor. Strong and significant positive correlation between coleoptile length and germination %, shoot length and fresh weight, and fresh weight and dry weight were observed. ^ In summary, planting depths and cultivars had a greater impact on seedling traits than did our temperature levels. Planting depth and cultivars are controllable management factors; hence the optimum depth must be practiced for the appropriate cultivar. Coleoptile length is the trait that was most significantly affected by temperature regimes, planting depths and cultivars. It is the best predictor of seedling vigor and hence {{can be used as a}} selection criterion in the development of cultivars with vigorous seedlings. ^ While numerous experiments have studied how seeding rates affect agronomic performance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, there are no or very few experiments which have studied how seeding rates affect end use quality particularly of modern wheat cultivars. Twenty winter wheat cultivars, were evaluated to assess the effect of cultivar and seeding rate on agronomic and quality performance of wheat. Significant differences among environments, seeding rates, cultivars and some of their interactions were identified. Lower seeding rates decreased stand density, grain yield and thousand-kernel weight and caused later flowering. Lower seeding rates also lowered flour yield and mixing time and <b>raised</b> <b>flour</b> protein content and mixing tolerance. Cultivars responded more to environmental conditions than to seeding rates. Agronomic and end use quality traits are greatly influenced by the prevailing environmental conditions, but not as much by seeding rates. Seeding rate is a predictable environmental factor which affects some agronomic and end use quality traits of wheat, hence should be carefully studied to obtain higher grain yields with relatively better end use quality. ...|$|R

Comparable percentages of CD 83 (+) DCs were found in peripheral blood of healthy children and children with malaria. However, the percentage of HLA-DR(+) peripheral blood DCs was significantly reduced in children with malaria.

40|$|While {{the self}} is a central figure {{in the study of}} Communication, it is {{generally}} depicted as an autonomous figure that communicates to connect with others and the world. In this thesis we problematize this instrumental articulation by focussing on the concepts of affect and time. Specifically, we analyze these concepts in the film A History of Violence through the three-tiered methodology of discourse analysis, articulation, and intermediality. By analyzing specific scenes in this film, we demonstrate that affective investments function as a communicative circuit in which the individual becomes 'in-between' the pre-personal and subjective intensities of affect. Concomitant with this circuit is the revelation of multiple temporalities that underpin the present moment of investment. We then conclude that affect and time can help us move from being to becoming by challenging the assumption of autonomous <b>selves,</b> which <b>raises</b> new issues that are pressing to be recognized in Communication Studies...|$|R

40|$|In 2005, when Rachel DeWoskin {{published}} her {{memoir of}} living in Beijing during the 1990 s, I was so excited that I immediately bought the first copy I saw in a Hong Kong bookstore. Foreign Babes in Beijing represents a rare female voice among the expats-in-China genre of books, and DeWoskin’s tales of working in public relations and acting in a Chinese soap opera are deftly and humorously written. It’s a book that I still recommend to {{people who want to}} know more about living in China, and I’m looking forward to seeing the film version that’s currently in development. After leaving China in 1999 (she has since returned, now living in both New York City and Beijing), DeWoskin earned an MFA in poetry and taught writing at NYU; earlier this year, her first novel, Repeat After Me, was published by Overlook Press. Readers of Foreign Babes will quickly realize that while Repeat After Me is fiction, it is also a vehicle for DeWoskin to reflect again on her years in China, and the novel’s protagonist, Aysha, serves as a stand-in for the author. DeWoskin builds the story of Repeat After Me around an unusual structure, making each chapter represent one month spanning many years (that is, all events that happened during the month of May, whether in 1990 or 2003, occur in the same chapter). Bouncing back and forth between two main time periods (1989 - 1991 and 2002 - 2003), Aysha relates the story of her young love affair with a Chinese dissident living in New York in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and as her older <b>self,</b> <b>raising</b> their daughter in Beijing and struggling with single parenthood. Aysha meets Da Ge in the fall of 1989; both are in the early stages of piecing their lives back together after tragedy and upheaval. The previous spring, Aysha spun out of control during her senior year at Columbia, building up to a manic breakdown, while at the same time, on the other side of the world, Da Ge joined in the Tiananmen protests, only to escape to the U. S. on the orders of his wealthy father. Now taking Aysha’s ESL class in New York, Da Ge is plagued by survivor’s guilt, depression, and anger, which give him a sullen, resentful air that Aysha finds irresistible. Their brief relationship, and its tragic ending (foreshadowed before the book even begins, with a poem by Anne Carson), do not come as a surprise, but the plot is skillfully handled by DeWoskin. The conversations between Aysha and Da Ge — disjointed, elliptical, and frequently frustrating — will ring true for all readers who have struggled to express themselves in a foreign language...|$|R

Without accounting for the latter self selection the insurance benefit appears undervalued. By focusing on municipalities with both outstanding insured and uninsured bonds (mixed municipalities), I identify that in the pre-crisis period insurance for such municipalities reduces municipal bond yields by 8 basis points. But analysis of homogeneous municipalities reveals the <b>self</b> selection effect <b>raises</b> yields by 6 basis points.
