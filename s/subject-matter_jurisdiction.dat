5|$|This was {{the second}} time the Supreme Court had granted certiorari to the Oneida's land claim. Over a decade earlier, in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974), the Supreme Court had allowed the same suit to proceed by {{unanimously}} holding that there was federal <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to hear the claim. Since then, Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed, replaced by John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E
5|$|The case {{is often}} {{referred}} to as Oneida II because it is the second of three times the Oneida Indian Nation reached the Supreme Court in litigating its land rights claims. It followed Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (Oneida I) (1974), holding that there was federal <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> and was followed by City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), rejecting the tribe's attempt in a later lawsuit to re-assert tribal sovereignty over parcels of land re-acquired by the tribe in fee simple.|$|E
25|$|The {{district}} court dismissed {{the case for}} lack of <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed the {{district court}}. In an opinion by Warren E. Burger, soon to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, {{the court held that}} the federal courts did have <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> but dismissed the case on two grounds: that Powell lacked standing to sue, and that the case represented a non-justiciable political question.|$|E
25|$|The Suffolk County Supreme Court is a {{trial court}} of {{unlimited}} general original jurisdiction, but it generally only hears cases that are outside the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of other trial courts of more limited jurisdiction.

25|$|The {{district}} court agreed and dismissed the suit {{for lack of}} <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and for Bivens's failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on that secondary issue of whether a plaintiff can bring a claim in federal court based solely on an alleged violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.|$|E
25|$|The {{complaint}} {{charged that}} the FTC had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the 2004 Final Order. That conduct, Trudeau asserted, exceeded the FTC's authority under 15 U.S.C. § 46(f) and violated the First Amendment. The FTC responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6).|$|E
500|$|In April 2012, an ex relatio {{complaint}} was filed {{in a federal}} District Court against five mortgage banks.

500|$|Seneca Nation {{has never}} been overruled. But, {{the effect of the}} {{decision}} was undone by rulings in Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State v. Oneida County (1974), known as Oneida I, and Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State (1985), known as Oneida II, which held that there is a federal common law cause of action for ejectment based upon aboriginal title for which there is federal <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Therefore, Indian tribes no longer have to rely on state statutes for a cause of action. In the words of Prof. Hauptman, Oneida I [...] "overturned one hundred forty-three years of American law." ...|$|E
500|$|Tureen was {{critical}} of Gellers' strategy because it required suing in state court (which he believed would be biased against any such claim), because it limited the claim to the [...] promised by the 1794 treaty, and because it would leave the tribes under state jurisdiction and ineligible for federal benefits. One theory that Tureen considered in order to overcome Maine's sovereign immunity was to rely on United States v. Lee (1882), which had permitted a land claim by the heirs of Robert E. Lee against the federal government. Tureen also feared that a federal court would find that it lacked <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> for an ejectment action due to the well-pleaded complaint rule, although the Supreme Court held otherwise in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974)decided {{three years after the}} Passamaquoddy complaint was filed. Tureen also worried about the delay-related defenses of laches, adverse possession, and statute of limitations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{district}} court granted the FTC's motion to dismiss. First, the court {{concluded that it}} lacked <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> because the press release was not [...] "a 'final agency action'" [...] under “section 704 of the ”, 5 U.S.C. § 704. Second, the court held, [...] "in the alternative, that Trudeau’s claims failed to state a viable cause of action {{as a matter of}} law." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 5 to 4 {{decision}} {{delivered on}} May 18, 2009 by Justice Kennedy, the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit's decision (which {{held that the}} Plaintiff did plead sufficient facts). [...] The Supreme Court held that Iqbal’s complaint failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for purposeful and unlawful discrimination. The court affirmed that the Second Circuit had <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to affirm the District Court’s order denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss.|$|E
2500|$|The United States District Courts have <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over {{bankruptcy}} matters. However, each such {{district court}} may, by order, [...] "refer" [...] bankruptcy matters to the Bankruptcy Court, and most district courts have a standing [...] "reference" [...] order to that effect, {{so that all}} bankruptcy cases are handled by the Bankruptcy Court. In unusual circumstances, a district court may [...] "withdraw the reference" [...] (i.e., taking a particular case or proceeding within the case away from the bankruptcy court) and decide the matter itself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{power of}} Congress to {{extinguish}} aboriginal title—by [...] "purchase or conquest," [...] {{or with a}} clear statement—is plenary and exclusive. Such extinguishment is not compensable under the Fifth Amendment, although various statutes provide for compensation. Unextinguished aboriginal title provides a federal common law cause of action for ejectment or trespass, {{for which there is}} federal <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Many potentially meritorious tribal lawsuits have been settled by Congressional legislation providing for the extinguishment of aboriginal title as well as monetary compensation or the approval of gaming enterprises.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{changed dramatically}} in the 1970s and 1980s. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State v. Oneida County (1974) [...] held {{for the first time}} that there was federal <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> for possessory claims by Indian tribes based upon aboriginal title. Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State (1985) , held that there was a federal common law cause of action for such possessory claims, not pre-empted by the Nonintercourse Act, and rejected all of the counties' remaining affirmative defenses. Most importantly, Oneida II held that there was no statute of limitations applicable to such a cause of action, allowing the Oneida to challenge a conveyance from 1795. The Second Circuit had also held that the Act creates an implied cause of action, a question the Supreme Court did not reach.|$|E
2500|$|Causes {{of action}} {{included}} [...] "conversion, unjust enrichment, restitution, {{the right to}} an accounting, human rights violations and violations of international law". <b>Subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> was asserted under federal law, California state law, international law, and common law. According to plaintiffs, defendants [...] "accepted, concealed, hypothecated, laundered, retained, converted and profited from assets looted by the Ustasha Regime during April 1941 through May 1945 and deposited in, or converted, concealed, hypothecated, trafficked, credited, pledged, exchanged, laundered or liquidated through, the IOR, and OFM after {{the demise of the}} NDH-Independent State of Croatia in May 1945. 2007 U.S. Dist.

Specifically, the Vatican bank was said to have laundered and converted [...] "the Ustaša treasury, making deposits in Europe and North and South American, [...] distributing the funds to exiled Ustaša leaders including Pavelić". [...] Since the case was dismissed at a preliminary stage, these claims were never proved.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is {{significantly}} more limited in United States federal courts. The maximal constitutional bounds of federal courts' <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{are defined by}} Article III Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Federal courts' actual <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> derives from Congressional enabling statutes, such as [...] and [...] The United States Congress has not extended federal courts' <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to its constitutional limits. For example, the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction is based on , not a constitutional restriction. Moreover, Congress could constitutionally overrule the complete-diversity rule in diversity cases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> must be {{distinguished}} from personal jurisdiction, which {{is the power of}} a court to render a judgment against a particular defendant, and territorial jurisdiction, which is the power of the court to render a judgment concerning events that have occurred within a well-defined territory. Unlike personal or territorial jurisdiction, lack of <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> cannot be waived. A judgment from a court that did not have <b>subject-matter</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is forever a nullity. To decide a case, a court must have a combination of subject (subjectam) and either personal (personam) or territorial (locum) jurisdiction.|$|E
