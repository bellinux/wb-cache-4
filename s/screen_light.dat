5000|$|A {{conventional}} {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) is powered by an electron gun, essentially an open-ended vacuum tube. At {{one end of the}} gun electrons are produced by [...] "boiling" [...] them off a metal filament, which requires relatively high currents and consumes {{a large proportion of the}} CRT's power. The electrons are then accelerated and focused into a fast-moving beam, flowing forward towards the screen. Electromagnets surrounding the gun end of the tube are used to steer the beam as it travels forward, allowing the beam to be scanned across the screen to produce a 2D display. When the fast-moving electrons strike phosphor on the back of the <b>screen,</b> <b>light</b> is produced. Color images are produced by painting the screen with spots or stripes of three colored phosphors, one each for red, green and blue (RGB). When viewed from a distance, the spots, known as [...] "sub-pixels", blend together in the eye to produce a single picture element known as a pixel.|$|E
50|$|Light {{was first}} {{captured}} in its flight by N. Abramson in 1978, {{who used a}} holographic technique to record the wavefront of a pulse propagating and being scattered by a white-painted screen placed in its path. This high-speed recording technique allowed the dynamic observation of light phenomena like reflection, interference and focusing that are normally observed statically. More recently, light-in-flight holography has been performed in a scattering medium rather than using a reflective <b>screen.</b> <b>Light</b> can also be captured in motion in a scattering medium using a streak camera that has picosecond temporal resolution, thus removing the need for interferometry and coherent illumination but requires additional hardware to raster scan the two-dimensional (2D) scene, which increases the acquisition time to hours. A few other techniques possess the temporal resolution to observe light in motion as it illuminates a scene, such as photonic mixer devices based on modulated illumination, albeit with a temporal resolution limited to a few nanoseconds. Alternatively, time-encoded amplified imaging can record images at the repetition rate of a laser by exploiting wavelength-encoded illumination of a scene and amplified detection through a dispersive fibre, albeit with 160 ns temporal and spatial resolution. Recent studies based on computer tomography using data from multiple probe pulses enabled reconstruction of picosecond pulse propagation phenomena in condensed media. In 2015 a method to visualize events evolving on picosecond time scales based on single-photon detector arrays has been demonstrated.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{issue of}} {{detecting}} harmful compounds in water may be approached in different ways, ranging from analytical methods to chemical sensor arrays. Optochemical sensors offer {{the advantage of}} being a simple and effective method for online monitoring of the parameters of interest in water solution. The core of an optochemical sensor is represented by a dye that changes colour upon the interaction with analytes. In this work, we used porphyrins, pH indicators and their mixtures to prepare the colorimetric sensor array for the analysis of ionic salts and organic compounds in water. The colour changes of sensing dyes exposed to an aqueous solution containing target compounds were read out with a system consisting of a computer <b>screen</b> (<b>light</b> source) and a digital camera (detector). Beyond the detection of metallic salts, nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, and organic compounds, we found that the array can recognize creatinine and urea, two markers of kidney functionalities...|$|E
40|$|This project {{focuses on}} an {{object-oriented}} software architecture for a 3 D rendering package which significantly improves the readability {{of the underlying}} algorithms, drastically improves productivity, and, most importantly, consists of building blocks that lend themselves to programmer customization thus making 3 D image synthesis more accessible. The renderer is object-based rather than drawing based and consists of an extensible set of objects that perform a variety of operations. The 3 D objects {{as well as the}} imaging objects (like Image, <b>Screen,</b> <b>Light)</b> are the building blocks that lend themselves to programmer customization through techniques such as subclassing. State-of-the-art functionality and advanced algorithms can be (and have been) incorporated into this renderer with a minimum amount of programming (i. e., analysis/understanding of existing code and creation of new code). Keeping the functionality local to the individual classes and objects enables software engineers to focus on a specific task rather than spend their time in trying to understand a complex (and sometimes monolithic) package. Experiences with our (inhomogeneous) user population prove that the system meets its design goal of being highly customizable and extendible [1]. Furthermore, it serves as a compact testbed for various rendering aspects from Gouraud shading based on the scan-line z-buffer algorithm to Hall’s illumination equation or from ray acceleration techniques to efficient algorithms for intersecting a ray with multiple meta balls, to name a few. Enhanced rendering techniques like volume rendering or global illumination algorithms like radiosity or path tracing are available, too...|$|E
40|$|The premiere {{performance}} of Theft of Sita {{took place at}} the Adelaide Festival in March this year. It was an outdoor performance set among huge old Moreton Bay figs, beautifully lit against the black night sky. The audience sat in rows of steep bleachers looking down on a square of wooden staging. Ten musicians, five of them Balinese gamelan players and five from the Australian Art Orchestra, took their places. Five puppeteers, a Balinese dalangand four Australians, emerged onto the stage and lit the <b>screen</b> <b>light</b> or damar. A large fabric screen descended from above {{at the front of the}} stage and we were in the enchanted forest of creation. Before us lay the idealised classical landscape of the ancient Ramayana story, complete with shadow puppets of the lovely Sita, her princely lover Rama, and their farting, chatting servant/ clown companions Tualen and Merdah, the latter a father and son pair from the Balinese wayang kulit known aspunakawan. A range of whimsical and funny animal shadow puppets pass across the screen. But there is always trouble in paradise. Sita is captured by the giant demon Rahwana and carried off to his kingdom of Langka. Then huge logging machines invade the forest and begin demolishing trees [...] . This Ramayana begins conventionally, but quickly explodes into a metaphor of the tumultuous events surrounding the overthrow of Suharto. Computer-generated images and photographic projections of demonstrations coexist with giant shadow puppet logging beasts. There are white water rafters and withering paddy fields in Bali. And Langka becomes a futuristic city of gleaming steel and glass towers, and of rubbish tips. Giant screens lift and disappear, perspective shifts from screens at the front to screens at the back of the stage. Shadow puppets emerge on tiny screens in the middle of the space and then shift again. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{to investigate}} the potential of using an ordinary mobile phone to perform chemical sensing by colorimetric analysis of reflected light. The wide availability and familiarity of mobile phones make them excellent devices for aiding consumers in making on site tests in their everyday lives. A {{major part of the}} work has been the development of the necessary software {{to be able to use}} a standard mobile phone to study diffuse reflection with the screen as illumination source and the front view camera for collection of spectral information. Java Micro Edition was used to control the hardware resources of the phone. The NetBeans 6. 5 platform facilitated the design, development, testing and implementation of a dedicated Mobile Information Device  applet for performing the necessary tasks associated with controlling the <b>screen</b> <b>light</b> and recording the reflected light intensities. MATLAB was employed to extract spectral information from the recorded images. Initially, tests with a virtual sample having areas with different colors were performed. Optimization of the alignment of the sample and the distance between the camera and the sample were carried out and the influence of ambient light was investigated. The lateral resolution of the images enables optical readout of sensor arrays as well as arrays for diagnostics. The potential of using the technique for direct measurement of properties related to the quality of drinking water, food and beverages was also investigated. Liquid samples were prepared in deionized water. Colored compounds such as iron(III) chloride and humic acid in the concentration range 2 - 10 mg/l were classified from their reflected intensities. Colorless arsenic(III) was analyzed by its bleaching reaction with iodine/starch. An alternative arsenic detection method based on measurement of discoloration of iron containing sand was demonstrated. We have also demonstrated that mobile phones can be used for qualitative analysis of food and drink, such as cold drinks, meat,  vegetables and milk in terms of general food quality...|$|E
