In order to clarify the complexity of manoeuvring, impact factors of navigation environment and <b>ship</b> <b>particulars</b> are first analysed {{to point out the}} determinants for evaluation. After reviewing existing standards of testing manoeuvres and criteria, it is concluded that {{there is a lack of}} knowledge to develop design guidance for manoeuvring in shallow/restricted water, which is the common sailing condition for inland vessels, making a proper evaluation more difficult. For the purpose of achieving more realistic judgement on manoeuvrability, benchmark manoeuvres are proposed for discussion. Conclusions are drawn on the need of validation for the effectiveness of testing manoeuvres and elaborate manoeuvring criteria for inland vessels.

Whereas current methods rely heavily on detention risk and flag state performance, we extend the risk assessment by considering various risk dimensions and by evaluating {{a wide range of}} risk factors.

Risk factors include <b>ship</b> <b>particulars</b> like ship type and classes of companies and owners, as well as historical information on past accidents, inspections, and changes of particulars. We present methods to summarize and visualize various risk dimensions and we pay particular attention to the identification of potentially risky companies. The empirical results are obtained by combining rich data sets with information on ship arrivals, inspections, and accidents for the period from 2006 to 2010.

40|$|Due to the {{shipping}} industry’s international legal framework {{and the existence}} of loopholes in the system, an estimated 5 - 10 percent of substandard ships exist which {{are more likely to have}} incidents with high economic cost. This article uses ship life cycles to provide insight into the effectiveness of inspections on prolonging ship lives. We account for fluctuations in the relevant economic environment and the (possible time-varying) <b>ship</b> <b>particulars.</b> We use a unique dataset containing information on the timing of accidents, inspections, ship particular changes of more than fifty thousand ships over a 29 year time period (1978 - 2007). The results of our duration analysis reveal that {{the shipping}} industry is a relative safe industry but there is a possible over-inspection of vessels. It also reveals the need to improve transparency related to class withdrawals and changes of classification of the vessel. Another interesting finding is that for the majority of ship types an increase in earnings decreases the incident rate. This is in contrast to the industry perception of the impact of earnings.

It {{is based on a}} unique dataset which combines incident data and ship particular data. The risk profiles can help stakeholders better understand the relationship of <b>ship</b> <b>particulars,</b> casualty types, incident locations, loss of life and pollution and link the results to developments of the legislative framework. The results demonstrate that the fleet improved their risk profiles over time reflecting legislative measures, port state control and vetting inspections. Older, general cargo ships flagged by black listed flags {{are most likely to be}} wrecked, stranded or grounded and remain risk prone towards flooding, foundering and capsizing. Some trading areas characterized by inter-regional trade operating outside the legislative framework remain risk prone. Most incidents do not involve loss of life or pollution. In terms of absolute figures, high risk prone areas for loss of life are the North and South China Sea, Japan and South Korea, the Mediterranean, Red and Black Sea and the Arabian Gulf. Casualty types which are more likely to lead to higher loss of life are flooding, foundering and capsizing on vessels which are flagged with black listed flags. For pollution, most oil pollution occurred in the area of the British Isles, the North Sea, the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. High pollution quantities are more likely to be found due to collision and the vessel being wrecked, stranded and grounded than with other casualty types. maritime safety;ship risk profiles...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{shipping}} in Arctic regions is increasing, {{and with this}} comes an increased interest in ice-strengthened ships. Today there exist several class rules satisfying additional requirements for operation in geographical areas with ice-infested waters. Hence, it is crucial for classification societies, designers and ship-owners to understand how formulations of each rule-set impact on structural members {{to be able to}} design a ship that suits a certain operational purpose. The aim of this thesis is to perform a comparison study on structural properties and steel grades on mid-bodies with a constant cross section, regarding ice-strengthening requirements relevant in the icereinforced region. To provide an overview of fundamental differences of ice class rule-sets, a comparison is conducted through case studies in which three different fictitious ships are used. The rule formulations of Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Finnish-Swedish Ice Class Rules (FSICR), IACS Polar Class and the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RS) are compared with an emphasis on the local structure and material requirements. Since the comparison is focused on rule-sets, no numerical analysis on the strength is considered. To enable comparisons between class rules, a computer code is developed where the rule-sets are adopted. The computer code uses <b>ship</b> <b>particulars</b> together with rule formulations to calculate the outcome on the actual local strength of each rule-set. Main parameters, i. e. frame spacing, direction of frames, displacement and yield strength in the rule formulation are varied in order to find their influence on the weight and structural properties. In addition to this, issues in the results are identified together with recommendations of areas that need to be further looked into with a numerical analysis on the actual structure. The comparison shows that the direction of framing {{plays a major role in}} the reinforcements needed and the total weight outcome on mid-bodies with a constant cross section. Due to the shape of the ice load, transverse framing has favourable requirements on local design in the perspective of weight. The result has been validated with the DNV software Nauticus Hull. It is found that when designing a ship according to notations with higher requirements, “tailormade” beam profiles may result in a better distribution of structural safety margins and a lighter structure. The study also shows that requirements on steel grade depending on structural member and thickness vary between rule-sets. It is concluded that using steel with higher yield strength can be economical since it may result in a lower requirement on the grade and less material in the structure. The study shows a case with a weight-saving of 9 % and a cost-saving of 5 % when upgrading the yield strength. To be aware of these behaviours one can benefit from this and design an approved structure that fulfils the requirements with reduced weight and cost...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally the {{conceptual}} design phase of ships {{has focused on}} the technical analysis - the mapping from the design to the performance space. The performance of the vessel does not fully capture the value of the vessel, and it becomes necessary to perform a mapping from the performance to a value space. Static performance and value models are not suffi-cient to perform proper evaluation of a design in the early stages. There are likely to be major changes in the operating context of the vessel during its lifecycle, which will greatly influence the performance and value. The quality of a new vessel {{from the perspective of the}} ship owner is strongly associated with value robustness of the design. Value robustness is defined as the ability of a system to continue to deliver stakeholder value in the face of shifts in context and needs. This thesis investigates strategies to expand the boundaries of conceptual ship design. The overall goal has been to examine approaches to handle contextual uncertainties with the goal of achieving value robust designs of transportation vessels. We present an introduction to conceptual ship design, were the state of the art and motiva-tion for the research questions are presented. We further address the perception of value in ship design, and the influence of uncertainties. This is related to systems engineering ap-proaches to handle complexity in design, and Epoch-Era and the Responsive Systems Comparisons (RSC) method are introduced. In a case study the RSC method is used as framework for including Epoch-Era Analysis with traditional design methodologies. The basis for the case study is the container market. The case study incorporates some factors specific to the container industry, including the organization of liner services. The general approach demonstrated in the case study are believed to be applicable for most segments of merchant transportation vessels. We measure the utility as a combination of an objective measure of monetary transporta-tion cost and stakeholder perception of the value of operational flexibility. The number of ports capable of servicing the vessel is used as the basis for assessing the operational flexi-bility. We develop a cost model to calculate the building cost and capital expenditures, the operational cost and the fuel based voyage expenditures as a function of the design deci-sions and market situation. The primary datasource is several databases of <b>ship</b> <b>particulars</b> and historic market development. Regression analysis and other statistical methods are used to construct a model to perform the tradespace exploration and the form-function-value mapping. The model is used to evaluate the designspace across changing context to calculate a robust utility value. The Pareto front of the resulting value space identifies po-tential value robust design configurations. Multi-Epoch design space evaluation The model shows the ability to predict real-life observations and is to a certain degree aligned with findings of other research. The model is strongly influenced by assumptions made based on limited information. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine the Responsive Systems Compari-son method with Epoch-Era analysis to address the value robustness of transportation ves-sels. We believe the method developed is an interesting take to expand the boundaries of conceptual design of merchant vessels that can be used as a basis for further research and development...|$|E
40|$|Ship {{manoeuvrability}} {{is fundamental}} for the navigation safety of ships. Furthermore, through the equipment used for manoeuvring, it also affects investment, operation, and maintenance cost of these ships. Ships are primarily designed {{from an economic}} point of view. To ensure and improve the maritime efficiency, research on inland vessel manoeuvrability deserves more attention than the present situation. Most {{of the research on}} manoeuvrability has been performed for seagoing ships. Since sailing conditions and <b>ship</b> <b>particulars</b> between seagoing ships and inland vessels are different, the impacts of these differences on manoeuvring prediction and evaluation should be carefully considered. Inland vessels should be designed {{in such a way that}} they should always be capable of manoeuvring without significantly harming the cost-effectiveness of operations. One of the biggest differences between seagoing ships and inland vessels is the rudder configuration. Conventionally, seagoing ships have similar single-rudder configurations while inland vessels have more complex multiple-rudder configurations. Although multiple-rudder configurations can have a positive effect on manoeuvrability, they often have a negative effect on resistance and, therefore, also a negative effect on the fuel consumption. Quantitative impacts of the rudder configuration on ship manoeuvrability have not been fully understood, especially for multiple-rudder configurations with complex rudder profiles. These differences in the rudder configuration may significantly change the ship manoeuvring behaviours and, therefore, should require further research. Moreover, to compare and evaluate the manoeuvring performance of inland vessels with different configurations, the existing manoeuvring tests and standards for inland vessels are less elaborate than those for seagoing ships. The above-mentioned considerations formulate the following main research question: What are the proper rudder configurations to achieve well manoeuvrable inland vessels without significant loss of navigation efficiency? The main research question of this thesis can be answered through resolving four key research questions as follows: Q 1. What are the practical manoeuvres to evaluate and compare the manoeuvring performance of inland vessels? Q 2. How does the rudder configuration affect the rudder hydrodynamic characteristics? Q 3. How do changes in the rudder configuration affect the ship manoeuvrability in specific manoeuvres? Q 4. How to choose a proper rudder configuration according to the required manoeuvring performance? An accurate estimation of rudder forces and moments is needed to quantify the impacts of the rudder configurations on ship manoeuvring performance. This thesis applied Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations to obtain rudder hydrodynamic characteristics and integrated the RANS results into manoeuvring models. Additionally, new manoeuvres and criteria have been proposed for prediction and evaluation of inland vessel manoeuvrability. Simulations of ships with various rudder configurations were conducted to analyse the impacts of rudder configurations on ship manoeuvrability in different classic and proposed test manoeuvres. Accordingly, guidance on rudders for inland vessel manoeuvrability has been summarised for practical engineers to make proper design choices. Through the research presented in this thesis, it is clear that different rudder configurations have different hydrodynamic characteristics, which are influenced by the profile, the parameters, and the type of a specific configuration. New regression formulas have been proposed for naval architects to quickly estimate the rudder induced forces and moments in manoeuvring. Furthermore, an integrated manoeuvring model has been proposed and validated for both seagoing ships and inland vessels. Using the proposed regression formulas and manoeuvring model, the impacts of rudder configurations on inland vessel manoeuvrability have been studied. The manoeuvring performance of a typical inland vessel can be improved by 5 % to 30 % by changing the rudder configuration. The rudder configuration should be capable of providing sufficient manoeuvring forces and then optimised to reduce the rudder induced resistance. In general, well-streamlined profiles are good for efficiency but not as good as high-lift profiles for effectiveness. As a summary, the ship manoeuvring performance can be improved by using effective profiles, enlarging the total rudder area, accelerating the rudder inflow velocity, increasing the effective rudder aspect ratios, and enlarging the spacing among multiple rudders.
