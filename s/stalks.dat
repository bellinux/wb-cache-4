5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the <b>stalks</b> of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow <b>stalks</b> became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings. In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 <b>stalks,</b> leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the nature and lifetime prevalence of two types of victimization among Finnish university students: <b>stalking</b> and violence victimization (i. e. general violence). This study was a cross-sectional study using two different datasets of Finnish university students. The <b>stalking</b> data was collected via an electronic questionnaire and the violence victimization data was collected via a postal questionnaire. There were 615 participants in the <b>stalking</b> study (I-III) and 905 participants in the violence victimization study. The thesis consists of four studies. The aims regarding the <b>stalking</b> substudies (Studies I-III) were to examine the lifetime prevalence of <b>stalking</b> among university students and to analyze how <b>stalking</b> is related to victim and stalker characteristics and certain central variables of <b>stalking</b> (victim-stalker relationship, <b>stalking</b> episodes, <b>stalking</b> duration). Specifically, {{the aim was to}} identify factors that are associated with <b>stalking</b> violence and to factors contributing to the <b>stalking</b> duration. Furthermore, the aim was also to investigate how university students cope with <b>stalking</b> and whether coping is related to victim and stalker background characteristics and to certain other core variables (victim-stalker relationship, <b>stalking</b> episodes, <b>stalking</b> duration, prior victimization, and <b>stalking</b> violence). The aims for the violence victimization substudy (Study IV) were to examine the prevalence of violence victimization, i. e. general violence (minor and serious physical violence and threats) and how violence victimization is associated with victim/abuser characteristics, symptomology, and the use of student health care services. The present study shows that both <b>stalking</b> and violence victimization (i. e. general violence) are markedly prevalent among Finnish university students. The lifetime prevalence rate for <b>stalking</b> was 48. 5 % and 46. 5 % for violence victimization. When the lifetime prevalence rate was restricted to violent <b>stalking</b> and physical violence only, the prevalence decreased to 22 % and 42 % respectively. The students reported exposure to multiple forms of <b>stalking</b> and violence victimization, demonstrating the diversity of victimization among university students. <b>Stalking</b> victimization was found to be more prevalent among female students, while violence victimization was found to be more prevalent among male students. Most of the victims of <b>stalking</b> knew their stalkers, while the offender in general violence was typically a stranger. <b>Stalking</b> victimization often included violence and continued for a lengthy period. The victim-stalking relationship and <b>stalking</b> behaviors were found to be associated with <b>stalking</b> violence and <b>stalking</b> duration. Based on three identified <b>stalking</b> dimensions (violence, surveillance, contact seeking), the present study found five distinct victim subgroups (classes). Along with the victim-stalker relationship, the victim subgroups emerged as important factors contributing to the <b>stalking</b> duration. Victims of violent <b>stalking</b> did not differ greatly from victims of non-violent <b>stalking</b> in their use of behavioral coping tactics, while exposure to violent <b>stalking</b> had an effect on the use of coping strategies. The victim-offender relationship was also associated to a set of symptoms regarding violence victimization. Furthermore, violence victimization had a significant main effect on specific symptoms (mental health symptoms, alcohol consumption, symptom index), while gender had a significant main effect on most symptoms, yet no interaction effect was found. The present results also show that victims of violence are overrepresented among frequent health care users. The present findings add to the literature on the prevalence and nature of <b>stalking</b> and violence victimization among Finnish university students. Moreover, the present findings stress the importance of violence prevention and intervention in student health care, and may be used as a guideline for policy makers, as well as health care and law enforcement professionals dealing with youth violence prevention.
