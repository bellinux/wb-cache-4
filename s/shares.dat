5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's <b>shares</b> had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed <b>shares</b> cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining <b>shares</b> as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed <b>shares.</b> The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find <b>shares</b> elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E

First, whether the language used was sufficient to create a trust, and second, whether or not the trust failed to provide the three certainties {{because of the lack of}} segregation between the <b>shares.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT⎯In this letter, a new <b>sharing</b> mechanism, SRLG <b>sharing,</b> is proposed, {{which allows}} the links of the same <b>shared</b> risk link group (SRLG) in a primary light tree to <b>share</b> protections in WDM optical networks. In {{previous}} studies, how to <b>share</b> spare resources with SRLG constraints has not been studied in multicast optical networks. In this letter, considering SRLG <b>sharing,</b> we propose a novel algorithm –multicast with SRLG <b>sharing</b> (MSS) – to establish a protection light tree. Finally, the algorithm MSS and the algorithm multicast with no SRLG <b>sharing</b> (MNSS) are compared through a simulation to show that our new <b>sharing</b> scheme of SRLG <b>sharing</b> is more efficient than that of no SRLG <b>sharing</b> in terms of spare resource utilization and blocking probability.

How people <b>share</b> their photos in collocated settings using camera phones, with whom they <b>share,</b> and what factors influence their <b>sharing</b> experience were the themes explored in this study. Results showed that people exhibit different photo <b>sharing</b> behaviour depending on who they <b>share</b> photos with, where the <b>sharing</b> takes place and what value a picture represents to its owner. In this paper, we will explain what triggers the photo <b>sharing</b> activity and how the <b>sharing</b> takes place depending on who photos are <b>shared</b> with {{and where they are}} <b>shared</b> (e. g. restaurant, pub, home). The <b>sharing</b> experience is hindered by the difficulty of controlling which photographs are made available to particular people; <b>sharing</b> with a group of people at once; and ensuring appropriate privacy measures. These findings highlight requirements for novel mechanisms for organising, <b>sharing,</b> and displaying photos as well as provide a better understanding of photo <b>sharing</b> behaviour using camera phones in collocated settings...|$|R
