50|$|One {{aircraft}} (XR809) was leased to Rolls-Royce {{for flight}} {{testing of the}} RB211 turbofan between 1969 and 1975. On return to the RAF, {{it was discovered that}} the airframe was distorted, possibly due to the power difference between the RB211 {{on one side and the}} Conways on the other. It was considered uneconomical to repair and was partially <b>scrapped,</b> <b>part</b> of the airframe retained for load training.|$|E
5000|$|... "Resurrection Ship" [...] was {{originally}} written and shot {{as a single}} episode, with the assassination plots hatched {{at the end of}} the second act. After editing the episode was still about 20 minutes too long, so it was split. This allowed for more detail within each part and caused plans for a clip show later in the second season to be <b>scrapped.</b> <b>Part</b> 2 opens with several shots of Apollo imagining floating in water as he drifts in space; this would have opened the single episode. Director Michael Rymer came up with the specific imagery of Apollo floating on his back.|$|E
50|$|Process FMEA can be {{challenging}} for participants who have not completed many PFMEAS, often confusing FAILURE MODES with EFFECTS and CAUSES. To clarify, a Process FMEA shows how the process can go wrong. Using a detailed Process Map will aid the person filling in the worksheet to correctly list {{the steps of the}} process being reviewed. The FAILURE MODE is then simply how that step can go wrong. Example, Process Step 1. Pick Up right handed part. Can they pick up the wrong part? (some manufacturing centers have left and right handed parts etc.) FAILURE MODE put left hand part in, EFFECT could be wrecked CNC machine and <b>scrapped</b> <b>part,</b> or hole drilled in wrong location. The cause, keeping inventory of similar parts at the job. Why is it important to do a PFMEA with regard to the process? When a process is examined or if we ask what can go wrong with the process unknown issues are uncovered, solving problems before they occur and tackling root cause issues or at least 2 Y's deep on a 5 Y. Here the manufacturing engineer could possibly poke yoke the tooling to prevent a left handed part in the fixture when running the right handed parts or program a touch off probe in the CNC programming - all before ever making the mistake the first time. If a PFMEA is set up where the FAILURE MODE relates to the feature on the print, example FAILURE MODE drilled hole too big - no further understanding of what caused the problem is gained. Numerous PFMEA's have been examined and show that little to no value is gained when reviewing features off of a print as FAILURE MODES - little understanding of the cause is gained. New PFMEA practitioners often try to relate the PFMEA FAILURE MODE to the FEATURE, numerous authors list this as trying to inspect in quality rather than listing the process step determining how it can go wrong and building in quality through root cause evaluation.|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} above, {{this alternative}} to backflushing has a self-correcting property: the shop-floor stock is always {{related to a}} certain production order, onto which all the consumed materials were actually issued. On the other hand, backflushing by its very definition can never be self-correcting and should only be used when corrections are rarely needed. An objection {{can be made with}} the above described alternative that scrap is not reported with a reason code, or broken out separately from other forms of non-standard usage. But how accurate is scrap reporting in an environment without inventory accuracy? Better to settle for inventory accuracy and worry about scrap later as a separate issue. Option: implement a separate scrap analysis protocol unrelated to inventory transactions. <b>Scrapped</b> <b>parts</b> are segregated for subsequent inspection, quality data recording and possible rework. In both cases, <b>scrapped</b> <b>parts</b> are already removed from inventory {{at the end of the}} manufacturing cycle (presumably by returning fewer components to stores). Therefore, an inventory transaction is only needed when parts are deemed acceptable upon inspection, or after a rework operation is performed. Scrap reporting can also be done by using data from the Process control system and/or Manufacturing Execution System. Usually such a system exists to some degree in any firm, even if it is not called PCS or MES and even if it is used eventually only for keeping data regarding personnel performance and piecework, as a basis for calculating the salary of the workers. Such a system could be extended so that each worker reports also the <b>scrapped</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R

25|$|Chip {{handling}} and coolant management are interrelated. Over the decades {{they have been}} improved, {{to the point that}} many metalworking operations now use engineered solutions for the overall cycle of collecting, separating, and recycling both chips and coolant. For example, the chips are graded by size and type, tramp metals (such as bolts and <b>scrap</b> <b>parts)</b> are separated out, the coolant is centrifuged off the chips (which are then dried for further handling), and so on.|$|R

A Scarabax beetle watches as the Mask of Life creates a body for Mata Nui, who almost steps on the Scarabax. He picks up the Scarabax, who touches his mask.

40|$|Abstract—Identification {{of machine}} {{condition}} {{is crucial to}} reduce machine downtime and <b>scrap</b> <b>parts</b> in the manufacturing industries. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to identify life stage and estimate machine wear. The proposed framework is based on stage identification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and machine wear estimation using AutoRe-gressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX) models. Our proposed framework is evaluated on a high-speed industrial milling machine, {{and the effectiveness of}} the proposed methodology in tool wear stage identification and tool wear estimation is verified with experimental results.

40|$|Due to {{industrial}} automation of liquid composite molding processes and increasing geometrical complexity of composite components, dry-spots from flow front junctions {{have become increasingly}} difficult to avoid. The impact and behavior of voids (microscopic or small macroscopic gas entrapments) during preform impregnation is well known, but no attention is given to dry-spots (large macroscopic gas entrapments). Experiments show that formation of a dry-spot in {{an early stage of}} an injection process does not necessarily lead to <b>scrap</b> <b>parts.</b> Therefore, simulation-based predictions of dry-spots are no sufficient condition for identification of unsuitable injection strategies. In this paper, the resolution mechanisms of dry-spots under controlled process conditions are investigated and the resulting findings of fundamental formation- and dispersion-mechanisms are presented...|$|R
