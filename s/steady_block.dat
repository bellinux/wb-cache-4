40|$|SummaryPLK 4 is {{the major}} kinase driving {{centriole}} duplication. Duplication occurs only once per cell cycle, forming one new (or daughter) centriole that is tightly engaged to the preexisting (or mother) centriole. Centriole engagement is known to block the reduplication of mother centrioles, but the molecular identity responsible for the block remains unclear. Here, we show that the centriolar cartwheel, the geometric scaffold for centriole assembly, forms the identity of daughter centrioles essential for the block, ceasing further duplication of the mother centriole {{to which it is}} engaged. To ensure a <b>steady</b> <b>block,</b> we found that the cartwheel requires constant maintenance by PLK 4 through phosphorylation of the same substrate that drives centriole assembly, revealing a parsimonious control in which “assembly” and “block for new assembly” are linked through the same catalytic reaction to achieve homeostasis. Our results support a recently deduced model that the cartwheel-bound PLK 4 directly suppresses centriole reduplication...|$|E

40|$|The {{blocking}} action of 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) and 3, 4 -diaminopyridine (Di-AP) on transient potassium current (IA) in molluscan central neurons was studied in internal perfusion voltage-clamp experiments. Identical blocking effects were seen when the drugs were applied either externally or internally. It {{was found that}} aminopyridines have two kinds of effects on IA channels. The first involves block of open channels during depolarizing pulses and results in a shortening of the time to peak current {{and an increase in}} the initial rate of decay of current. This effect of the drug is similar to the block of delayed potassium current by tetraethylammonium (TEA). The other effect is a <b>steady</b> <b>block</b> that increases in strength during hyperpolarization, is removed by depolarization, and is dependent on the frequency of stimulation. The voltage dependence of steady state block approximates the voltage dependence of inactivation gating a changes e-fold in approximately 10 mV. These data suggest that the strength of block may depend on the state of IA gating such that the resting state of the channel with open inactivation gate is more susceptible to block than are the open or inactivated states.

In this paper, we fill in this gap by constructing a tractable search model of money with a non-degenerate distribution of money holdings. We assume search to be directed in the sense that buyers know the terms of trade before visiting particular sellers. Directed search makes the monetary <b>steady</b> state <b>block</b> recursive in the sense that individuals' policy functions, value functions and the market tightness function are all independent of the distribution of individuals over money balances, although the distribution affects the aggregate activity by itself.

We prove that a unique monetary steady state exists. Moreover, we provide conditions under which the steady-state distribution of buyers over money balances is non-degenerate and analyze the properties of this distribution.

Chelation of Ca 2 + by inclusion of 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid or EGTA in the patch pipette together with InsP 6 prevented the inhibition of IK,in, suggesting that the effect is Ca 2 + dependent.

Chemical encapsulation of steroidal NMBAs, such as rocuronium, by a cyclodextrin is a new concept in neuromuscular block reversal. The present study evaluates the capacity of nine synthetic cyclodextrin derivatives (Org 25288, Org 25289, Org 25467, Org 25168, Org 25169, Org 25555, Org 25166, Org 26142, and Org 25969) to reverse constant neuromuscular block of approximately 90 %, induced by rocuronium infusion in the Rhesus monkey, using single twitch stimulation. The ability of these cyclodextrin derivatives to reverse neuromuscular block was compared with the {{reversal of}} the same neuromuscular block by the commonly used combination of neostigmine and atropine. METHODS: After a bolus injection of rocuronium, continuous infusion was started to reduce twitch contractions to approximately 10 % of baseline values. After a <b>steady</b> state <b>block</b> of at least 10 min the infusion was stopped and the preparation was allowed to recover spontaneously.

METHODS: After a bolus injection of rocuronium, mivacurium or atracurium, a continuous infusion of these drugs was started to maintain the first twitch contraction of the train-of-four at approximately 10 % of its baseline value.

RESULTS: Sugammadex caused a rapid and complete reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. The recovery time to train of four ratio= 0. 9 after spontaneous recovery was 14. 4 min (sd= 3. 4 min; n= 14). This was reduced significantly (P< 0. 001) to 3. 7 min (sd= 3. 3 min; n= 4) with sugammadex 0. 5 mg kg(- 1) and to 1. 9 min (sd= 1. 0 min; n= 4) with sugammadex 1. 0 mg kg(- 1).

We have mutated Arg 148, which is perfectly conserved in all inward rectifiers, to His in the H 5 of IRK 1 (Kir 2. 1). Channel activity was lost by the mutation, but coexpression of the mutant (R 148 H) along with the wild-type (WT) mRNA revealed populations of channels with reduced single-channel conductances. Long-lasting and flickery sublevels were detected exclusively for the coexpressed channels. These findings indicated that the mutant subunit formed hetero-oligomers with the WT subunit. The permeability ratio was altered by the mutation, while the selectivity sequence (K+ > Rb+ > NH 4 + >> Na+) was preserved. The coexpression made the IRK 1 channel more sensitive to extracellular block by Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +, and turned this blockade from a voltage-independent to a -dependent process. The sensitivity of the mutant channels to Mg 2 + was enhanced at higher pH and by an increased ratio of mutant:WT mRNA, suggesting that the charge on the Arg site controlled the sensitivity. The blocking rate of open channel blockers, such as Cs+ and Ba 2 +, was facilitated by coexpression without significant change in the <b>steady</b> state <b>block.</b> Evaluation of the electrical distance to the binding site for Mg 2 + or Ca 2 + and that to the barrier peak for block by Cs+ or Ba 2 + suggest that Arg 148 is located between the external blocking site for Mg 2 + or Ca 2 + and the deeper blocking site for Cs+ or Ba 2 + in the IRK 1 channel.

It is generated apparently {{as a result of}} a non-uniform Cl- conductance (GCl), with GCl being lowest at the end-plate. We investigated the effects of denervation on this current. The current persisted with little change after denervation. This was somewhat unexpected, since GCl falls dramatically after denervation, and in acute experiments on normal muscles, the steady current is greatly reduced by agents which <b>block</b> GCl. The <b>steady</b> current was <b>blocked</b> in denervated muscle, as in normal muscle, by low-Cl- solutions, Na+-free and K+-free solutions, and treatment with furosemide and 9 -anthracene-carboxylic acid. The current in denervated muscle appears to be generated by the same general mechanism as in normal muscle. The results suggest that the [Cl-]i is significantly higher in denervated than in normal muscle fibres. Preliminary experiments with Cl- -selective micro-electrodes have confirmed this: [Cl-]i rises from about 12 mM to about 23 mM after denervation. This has the effect of moving the Cl- equilibrium potential (ECl) in a positive direction, so that the driving force for passive Cl- efflux is increased. The increased driving force compensates for the reduced GCl, allowing the steady current to persist in denervated fibres...|$|R

TMA+ was found to inhibit the <b>steady</b> state <b>block</b> of open Na channels {{by all of the}} compounds. The time-dependent, inactivation-like decay of Na currents in pronase-treated axons perfused with either PC, 9 -AA, or C 8 G was retarded by internal TMA+. The apparent dissociation constants (at zero voltage) for interaction between PC and 9 -AA with their binding sites were increased when TMA+ was substituted for Cs+ in the internal solution. The steepness of the voltage dependence of 9 -AA or PC block found with internal Cs+ solutions was greatly reduced by TMA+, resulting in estimates for the fractional electrical distance of the 9 -AA binding site of 0. 56 and 0. 22 in Cs+ and TMA+, respectively. This change may reflect a shift from predominantly 9 -AA block in the presence of Cs+ to predominantly TMA+ block. The depth, but not the rate, of frequency-dependent block by QX- 314 and 9 -AA is reduced by internal TMA+. In addition, recovery from frequency-dependent block is not altered. Elevation of internal Na produces effects on 9 -AA block qualitatively similar to those seen with TMA+. The results are consistent with a scheme in which the open channel blocking drugs, TMA (and Na) ions, and the inactivation gate all compete for a site or for access to a site in the channel from the intracellular surface. In addition, TMA ions decrease the apparent blocking rates of other drugs in a manner analogous to their inhibition of the inactivation process.

DC development progresses from multipotent progenitors (MPP) via common DC progenitors (CDP) into DC. Flt 3 ligand (Flt 3 L) signaling via the Flt 3 /Stat 3 pathway is of pivotal importance for DC development under steady state conditions. Additional factors produced during steady state or inflammation, such as TGF-β 1 or GM-CSF, also influence the differentiation potential of MPP and CDP. Here, we studied how gp 130, GM-CSF and TGF-β 1 signaling influence DC lineage commitment from MPP to CDP and further into DC. We observed that activation of gp 130 signaling promotes expansion of MPP. Additionally, gp 130 signaling inhibited Flt 3 L-driven DC differentiation, but {{had little effect on}} GM-CSF-driven DC development. The inflammatory cytokine GM-CSF induces differentiation of MPP into inflammatory DC and <b>blocks</b> <b>steady</b> state DC development. Global transcriptome analysis revealed a GM-CSF-driven gene expression repertoire that primes MPP for differentiation into inflammatory DC. Finally, TGF-β 1 induces expression of DC-lineage affiliated genes in MPP, including Flt 3, Irf- 4 and Irf- 8. Under inflammatory conditions, however, the effect of TGF-β 1 is altered: Flt 3 is not upregulated, indicating that an inflammatory environment inhibits steady state DC development. Altogether, our data indicate that distinct cytokine signals produced during steady state or inflammation have a different outcome on DC lineage commitment and differentiation...|$|R

Thereby, we apply the idealised, two-dimensional concept of point vortices considering two important issues in atmospheric dynamics. First, we propose this not widely spread concept in meteorology to explain blocked weather situations using a three-point vortex equilibrium. Here, a steady state is given if the zonal mean flow {{is identical to}} the opposed translational velocity of the vortex system. We apply this concept exemplarily to two major blocked events establishing a new pattern recognition technique based on the kinematic vorticity number to determine the circulations and positions of the interacting vortices. By using reanalysis data, we demonstrate that the velocity of the tripole in a westward direction is almost equal to the westerly flow explaining the <b>steady</b> state of <b>blocked</b> events. Second, we introduce a novel idea to transfer a stability analysis of a vortex equilibrium to the stability of the polar vortex concerning its interaction with the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Here, the point vortex system is built as a polygon ring of vortices around a central vortex. On this way we confirm observations that perturbations of the polar vortex during the QBO east phase lead to instability, whereas the polar vortex remains stable in QBO west phases.

Little or no outward current {{was measured in}} cell-attached patches. Inward currents reach their maximal value in two steps: an instantaneous phase followed by a time-dependent "activation" phase, requiring at least two exponentials to fit the time- dependent phase. After an activating pulse, the quasi-steady state current-voltage (I-V) relationship could be fit with a single Boltzmann equation (apparent gating charge, Z = 2. 0 +/- 0. 1, n = 3). Strong rectification and time-dependent activation were initially maintained after patch excision into high [K+] (K-INT) solution containing 1 mM EDTA, but disappeared gradually, until only a partial, slow inactivation of outward current remained. Biochemical characterization (Lopatin, A. N., E. N. Makhina, and C. G. Nichols, 1994. Nature. 372 : 366 - 396.) suggests that the active factors are naturally occurring polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine). Each polyamine causes reversible, steeply voltage-dependent rectification of HRK 1 channels. Both the blocking affinity and the voltage sensitivity increased as the charge on the polyamine increased. The sum two Boltzmann functions is required to fit the spermine and spermidine <b>steady</b> state <b>block.</b> Putrescine unblock, like Mg 2 + unblock, is almost instantaneous, whereas the spermine and spermidine unblocks are time dependent. Spermine and spermidine unblocks (current activation) can each be fit with single exponential functions. Time constants of unblock change e-fold every 15. 0 +/- 0. 7 mV (n = 3) and 33. 3 +/- 6. 4 mV (n = 5) for spermine and spermidine, respectively, matching the voltage sensitivity of the two time constants required to fit the activation phase in cell-attached patches. It is concluded that inward rectification in intact cells can be entirely accounted for by channel block. Putrescine and Mg 2 + ions can account for instantaneous rectification; spermine and spermidine provide a slower rectification corresponding to so-called intrinsic gating of inward rectifier K channels. The structure of spermine and spermidine leads us to suggest a specific model in which the pore of the inward rectifier channel is plugged by polyamines that enter deeply into the pore and bind at sites within the membrane field. We propose a model {{that takes into account}} the linear structure of the natural polyamines and electrostatic repulsion between two molecules inside the pore. Experimentally observed instantaneous and steady state rectification of HRK 1 channels as well as the time-dependent behavior of HRK 1 currents are then well fit with the same set of parameters for all tested voltages and concentrations of spermine and spermidine...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{blockade}} by {{quaternary ammonium}} (QA) molecules of many potassium channels is state dependent, where {{the requirement for}} channel opening is evidenced by a time-dependent component of block in the macroscopic record. Whether {{this is the case}} for Ca 2 +- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels, however, remains unclear. Previous work (Li, W., and R. W. Aldrich. 2004. J. Gen. Physiol. 124 : 43 – 57) tentatively proposed a state-dependent, trapping model, but left open the possibility of state-independent block. Here, we found BK channel blockade by a novel QA derivative, bbTBA, was time dependent, raising the possibility of state-dependent, open channel block. Alternatively, the observed voltage dependence of block could be sufficient to explain time-dependent block. We have used steady-state and kinetic measurements of bbTBA blockade in order to discriminate between these two possibilities. bbTBA did not significantly slow deactivation kinetics at potentials between − 200 and − 100 mV, suggesting that channels can close unhindered by bound bbTBA. We further find no evidence that bbTBA is trapped inside BK channels after closing. Measurements of <b>steady</b> state fractional <b>block</b> at + 40 mV revealed a 1. 3 -fold change in apparent affinity for a 33 -fold change in Po, in striking contrast to the 31 -fold change predicted by state-dependent block. Finally, the appearance of a third kinetic component of bbTBA blockade at high concentrations is incompatible with state-dependent block. Our results suggest that access of intracellular bbTBA to the BK channel cavity is not strictly gated by channel opening and closing, and imply that the permeation gate for BK channels may not be intracellular...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{requirement}} of Na channel inactivation for the action of local anesthetics, we investigated the inhibitory effects of quaternary and tertiary amine anesthetics on normally inactivating and noninactivating Na currents in squid axons under voltage clamp. Either the enzymatic mixture pronase, or chloramine-T (CT), a noncleaving, oxidizing reagent, was used to abolish Na channel inactivation. We found that both the local anesthetics QX- 314 and etidocaine, when perfused internally at 1 mM, elicited a "tonic" (resting) block of Na currents, a "time-dependent" block that increased during single depolarizations, and a "use-dependent" (phasic) block that accumulated {{as a result of}} repetitive depolarizations. All three effects occurred in both control and CT-treated axons. As in previous reports, little time-dependent or phasic block by QX- 314 appeared in pronase-treated axons, although tonic block remained. Time-dependent block was greatest and fastest at large depolarizations (Em greater than + 60 mV) for both the control and CT-treated axons. The recovery kinetics from phasic block were the same in control and CT-modified axons. The voltage dependence of the <b>steady</b> state phasic <b>block</b> in CT-treated axons differed from that in the controls; an 8 - 10 % reduction of the maximum phasic block and a steepening and shift of the voltage dependence in the hyperpolarizing direction resulted from CT treatment. The results show that these anesthetics can bind rapidly to open Na channels in a voltage-dependent manner, with no requirement for fast inactivation. We propose that the rapid phasic blocking reactions in nerve are consequences primarily of channel activation, mediated by binding of anesthetics to open channels, and that the voltage dependence of phasic block arises directly from that of channel activation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: This study {{investigates the}} role of various flow {{conditions}} on maternal hemodynamics during fetal cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: Normothermic fetal bypass was conducted under pulsatile, or steady flow, for a 60 -minute period. Fetal lamb preparations {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of the 3 groups: steady flow (n = 7), pulsatile flow (n = 7), or pulsatile blocked flow bypass (n = 7), where fetuses were perfused with Nω-nitro-l-arginine after the first 30 minutes of pulsatile flow to assess the potential role of endothelial autacoids. Results: Maternal oximetry and pressures remained unchanged throughout the procedure. Under fetal pulsatile flow, maternal cardiac output increased after 20 minutes of bypass and remained significantly higher than under steady flow at minute 30 (8. 8  ± 0. 7 L · min- 1 vs 5. 9  ± 0. 5 L · min- 1, P =. 02). Maternal cardiac output in the pulsatile group also remained higher than in both <b>steady</b> and pulsatile <b>blocked</b> flow groups, reaching respectively 8. 7  ± 0. 9 L · min- 1 vs 5. 8  ± 0. 4 L · min- 1 (P =. 02) and 5. 9  ± 0. 3 L · min- 1 (P =. 01) at minute 60. Maternal systemic vascular resistances were significantly lower under pulsatile than under steady flow after 30 minutes and until the end of bypass (respectively, 9. 1  ± 0. 6 IU vs 12. 7  ± 1. 1 IU, P =. 02 and 8. 9  ± 0. 5 IU vs 12. 9  ± 1. 2 IU, P =. 01). Infusion of Nω-nitro-sc-arginine was followed by an increase in systemic vascular resistances from 9. 3  ± 0. 7 IU, {{similar to that of the}} pulsatile group, to 13. 5  ± 1 IU at 60 minutes, similar to that of the steady flow group. Conclusions: Maternal hemodynamic changes observed under fetal pulsatile flow are counteracted after infusion of Nω-nitro-l-arginine, suggesting nitric oxide release from the fetoplacental unit under pulsatile fetal flow conditions.

40|$|The master {{thesis is}} a further {{investigation}} of the steady state performance of the direct connection of the permanent magnet generators and motors, used for the ship propulsion; as proposed in the specializing project study conducted in autumn 2014. The challenge is how to implement {{the possibility of the}} salient rotor machines in the power flow calculations. Another task is to start the investigation of dynamic system behavior. In order to cope with the tasks the mathematical models of the steady state systems have been developed, as well as the introductory system for the dynamic studies. Matlab software has been used for both models. Source code functions implementing developed the mathematical algorithm for the <b>steady</b> state, and <b>block</b> diagram form in the Simulink environment for the dynamic model. A theoretical review is conducted {{in order to understand the}} physics behind the complex mathematical equations. Using the attained theoretical background, an algorithm for solving power flow equations with possibility to include saliency has been developed. In addition the theoretical study of the dynamic system has been presented, explaining in details the usage of blocks in the Simulink model. In general words, a study case consists of a diesel engine which has a permanent magnet synchronous generator on its shaft, which is directly connected with a three phase alternating current transmission line to the permanent magnet synchronous motor. The motor has a propeller on its shaft which is providing the propulsion of the ship. Ships static load has also been taken into account while modeling, as an adjustable power demand on the terminal bus. The system main difference to the convenient electrical ship propulsion systems is the lack of power electronics in the circuit, thus the system is operating with variable frequency and voltage. The simulations of the steady state mathematical models show stable results in all range of operation points. The desired accuracy of convergence of the iterative solutions for the nonlinear equations is achieved. The results comparison with a real world tests on board the ship show close values of current for the high frequencies and high power, while for the low frequencies the simulation results are driven away from the tests. The dynamic system model works as intended and has highlighted the problems of synchronization of the motor and the problem of the torque oscillations on the motor shaft with a fast enough change in load. Both systems gave insight information and valuable experience of the permanent magnet synchronous machine modeling, starting from the very basic level and avoiding usage of the commercial available software...|$|R

40|$|Mandoline by Claude Debussy (1862 - 1918), Poetry by Paul Verlaine (1844 - 1896) Performed by Sophie Emmons Faculty Mentor: Dr. Louise Lofquist Mandoline is a {{short and}} simple French Melodie. The poem, written by the famous French poet Paul Verlaine, is set to music by French composer, Claude Debussy. It is about a {{painting}} by the famous eighteenth century French painter, Antoine Watteau, which depicts people listening happily to a mandolin player. Debussy sets this poem perfectly to music by mimicking a mandolin with playful chords of the piano, introducing each character with different musical themes and using a descending scale to sound like the breeze. The piece maintains an upbeat rhythm, bringing the audience in and making them {{feel as if they}} are actually in the crowd, watching a mandolin player. Then the piece changes keys and slows down to suggest the beauty {{of the women in the}} crowd and their clothing. Finally, the music returns back to the rhythm of the mandolin and ends with the singer singing happy “la la las,” ending the piece on a playful note. Prison by Gabriel Fauré (1845 - 1924), Poetry by Paul Verlaine (1844 - 1896) Performed by Nathan Thompson Faculty Mentor: Dr. Melanie Emelio One of Gabriel Fauré 2 ̆ 7 s most powerful pieces, Prison tells a sad tale of longing and wasted youth. The text was penned by Paul Verlaine, who, after attempting to murder his friend and fellow poet, Arthur Rimbaud, was sentenced to prison for two years. While paying his debt to society, Verlaine wrote this poem from his cell. Fauré brings this text to life with a melancholic and <b>steady</b> march of <b>blocked</b> chords throughout the piece. The texture of the harmonies begins thin and soft, expressing a sense of quiet sadness as the speaker looks out into the world he is kept from. Suddenly the piano bursts with thick, dissonant chords as the speaker cries out their regret, asking himself, 2 ̆ 2 What have you done, you, with your youth? 2 ̆ 2 The piece ends with a chromatic melody and the steady march of the piano as the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s sorrow sinks in, and his hope evaporates.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{implement}} a Power System Stabilizer (PSS) and incorporate it to a Generator to enhance its dynamic performance. When a generator is connected to a power system the rotor angle oscillations due to small load changes can be observed This is due to fact that once a generator is constructed the damping effect of it is fixed and it is unable to offer additional damping to damp down these rotor angle oscillations. The power system stabilizer (PSS) provides supplementary damping for low frequency rotor angle oscillations ranging from 0. 1 Hz to 3 Hz which covers local mode, Inter area mode and inter unit mode power system oscillations. Here the PSS output is fed back to the excitation system summing point to damp down rotor angle oscillations. // In general, small load changes in a power system cause rotor angle oscillations. In order to damp down these oscillations an electrical torque should be produced on the rotor shaft, in phase with the speed deviation. Power system stabilizer adds a closed loop auxiliary feedback signal to the reference voltage of Automatic voltage regulator (AVR) in proportion to either speed deviation, frequency deviation or power deviation. // Normally the terminal voltage of a generator is adjusted by the AVR after computing the difference between reference voltage and feedback terminal voltage. In my project the PSS is designed to operate as follows. A voltage signal {{in proportion to the}} frequency deviation caused by small load changes is first produced. This voltage signal which represents the frequency deviation is then added to the reference voltage of AVR. This in turn causes an electrical torque to be added on the rotor shaft to enhance the small signal stability performance. // The developed PSS consists of a High pass filter (HPF), a Zero crossing detector (ZCD), a Frequency to voltage conveitor (F/V), a Summer I and a Summer 2. The frequency deviation is filtered by using the HPF in order to <b>block</b> <b>steady</b> changes in frequency. The filtered signal is sent through the ZCD to maintain a constant amplitude signal to the F/V converter because it responds to amplitude of input signal. The output of F/V converter and the voltage corresponding to base load frequency which is injected separately using a Calibration instrument, are summed in summer 1 to obtain a voltage deviation corresponding to frequency deviation. The output of summer I and reference voltage of AVR are summed in summer^ and fed back to LM 723, which is the main control chip of the AVR. // In order to analyze the effect of PSS, following parameters were observed. 1 Output of frequency to voltage convertor 2 Generator Current 3 Induction Motor Current Finally two MATLAB routines are used to extract actual low frequency oscillations from observed signals. 1 A low pass filter is designed using ellip() and filter() functions and observed signals are filtered with a cutoff frequency of 3 Hz. The outputs of the filter clearly show the effect of PSS in enhancing the dynamic performance of the generator. 2.
