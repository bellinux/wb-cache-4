500|$|Universal spent $1.8 million {{promoting}} Jaws, {{including an}} unprecedented $700,000 {{on national television}} spot advertising. The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film's opening two days later. Beyond that, {{in the description of}} film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal [...] "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" [...] for the picture's marketing. As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film. The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film. The centerpieces of the joint promotion strategy were John Williams's theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer. The poster was based on the paperback's cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel. The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that [...] "no matter what we did, it didn't look scary enough". Seiniger ultimately decided that [...] "you had to actually go underneath the shark <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E

When Mr. Walpole {{had to take}} a {{splinter}} out of the mastiff's paw, I had to hold the poor dog myself; and Mr Walpole had to turn Sir Ralph out of the room. And Mrs. Walpole has to tell the gardener not to kill wasps when Mr. Walpole is looking. But there are doctors who are naturally cruel; and there are others who get used to cruelty and are callous about it. They blind themselves to the souls of animals; and that blinds them to the souls of men and women.

60|$|Of course, I {{meant to}} take the train for Camelot. Train! Why, the station was as vacant as a cavern. I moved on. The journey to Camelot was a {{repetition}} of what I had already seen. The Monday and the Tuesday differed in no way from the Sunday. I arrived far in the night. From being the best electric-lighted town in the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever saw, it was become simply a blot--a blot upon darkness--that is to say, it was darker and solider {{than the rest of}} the darkness, and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it a little better; it made me feel as if maybe it was symbolical--a sort of sign that the Church was going to keep the upper hand now, and snuff out all my beautiful civilization just like that. I found no life stirring in the somber streets. I groped my way with a heavy heart. The vast castle loomed black upon the hilltop, not a spark visible about it. The drawbridge was down, the great gate stood wide, I entered without challenge, my own heels making the only sound I heard--and it was sepulchral enough, in those huge vacant courts.|$|E

5000|$|I saw {{the most}} gruesome sight I’ve ever seen. Lying on a blood stained brancard was a man—not older than twenty I {{afterwards}} ascertained—suffering the agonies of hell.

Blood was streaming all over. Under his eyes the skin was just dead blue.... It took us an hour driving between two or three miles per hour {{to get him to}} his destination. Of course he couldn’t yell as his mouth or what was left of it was a mere mass of pulp. For a while I was afraid our ambulance was to be turned into a hearse, but he was still alive when we got him there. Of course in typical French fashion the doctors held their usual debate of questioning whether it was the right hospital or where his papers were.|$|E

You had naval artillery and mortars and heavy and light small arms fire as well. It was terrifying, to be honest. I don’t know how my colleagues felt.

40|$|Background: Individuals with {{impaired}} glucose tolerance (IGT) have a {{high risk}} of developing both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and cardiovascular disease. T 2 DM is a common chronic disease in a global perspective, and it is estimated to continue to grow, which is a serious health problem. It is of significance to increase knowledge about persons with IGT to direct preventive activities more efficiently thus to limit its progression to T 2 DM. Aim: The overall aim was to describe experiences of living with the increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and to identify self-reported symptoms and bodily sensations associated to prediabetes by the persons themselves. Specific aim were to explore the associations between experiences of sleep, vitality and self-rated health, respectively, and IGT. Methods: The design was explorative and descriptive. Participants were randomly selected from a cross-sectional population-based survey in two municipalities in South-western of Sweden. Data were collected by means of interviews and a questionnaire about life-style and health. Results: Living with prediabetes means living in the borderline between health and type 2 diabetes. Living in the borderline and the balance between opportunities and obstacles were interpreted as a burdensome sense of living with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, although this feeling could be changed <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> either opportunities or obstacles. Persons with IGT are experiencing symptoms, which they relate to their elevated plasma glucose level associated with IGT. The diagnosis in itself gave them something to relate to because they received confirmation and a possible explanation for their symptoms. In men a statistically significant age-adjusted association was found between self-reported lack of sleep and IGT: It did not weaken after further adjustment for BMI, smoking, education, and leisure time physical activity No such associations were found in females. Corresponding age-adjusted statistically significant associations between low vitality and IGT in both men and women were successively lost with multivariate adjustments. Both men and women with low self-rated health had a worse risk factor profile than those with high self-rated health and a statistically significant crude association between self-rated health and IGT. After controlling for major lifestyles factors and biomedical variables the association remained only in men. Conclusions: A special focus must be directed towards persons with prediabetes as they experience both opportunities and obstacles. Although prediabetes is often described as a condition without symptoms, persons with IGT experienced many symptoms, which they related to their IGT. Insufficient sleep and low self-rated health may be a risk factor for IGT in men. A generous sampling of plasma glucose, Hba 1 c and oral glucose tolerance tests is suggested, even in vague symptoms. There is a link between the measurable (signs) and the perceived in form of symptoms, interpreted as “the guiding feeling”. This should be considered in pedagogical encounters with patients to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes...|$|E
