This study involved 66 subjects who were observed in four conditions (i.e., 3, 5, 7 and 9 hours in bed) for 7 days. PVT testing showed severe impairments in reaction time under the 3-hour condition, with lapses in responses increasing steadily across the 7 days of sleep restriction.

30|$|Bordenave and Hegre (2005) has {{discussed}} the relative timing and chronology of oil expulsion from the Kazhdumi {{and the formation}} of the Zagros trap in the Dezful Embayment, and concluded that both hydrocarbon generation peak periods of Kazhdumi and Zagros trap formation stage happened during the period 3 – 8  Ma, showing a compatible matching relation. Therefore, close range migration is dominant in the Dezful Embayment. However, some studies (Bordenave and Hegre 2005) also proved that parts of the Kazhdumi in the Dezful Embayment also reached the oil window and the expulsion stage commenced before 10  Ma due to the rapid subsidence caused by the early folding, like the Karanj and Paris oil field areas (Fig.  11), which is earlier than the formation time of the Zagros trend trap. Consequently, during that period, there were only Arabian trend traps in the west of Dezful Embayment, and the Zagros trend trap was not formed; nevertheless, parts of Kazhdumi source <b>bed</b> <b>reached</b> the oil window, and the low-maturity heavy crude oil was expelled and migrated long distances along the gently dipping ramps or the unconformity surface towards the western Arabian platform (Zagros Basin margin), charging the Arabian trend traps first. Afterwards, the source <b>bed</b> <b>reached</b> its peak time of hydrocarbon generation, while the Zagros traps were formed simultaneously. Thereafter, a short-range migration to the nearby Zagros trend traps took place. That is a valid explanation why the oil properties of Sarvak reservoir of Arabian trend traps show low API°, while Zagros trend traps have relatively low oil gravity with high source bed maturity.|$|R

40|$|A {{flood routing}} and stage {{prediction}} model is developed using {{the techniques of}} State Space and Kalman filtering.

With the deterministic inputs at Mayfield Dam on the Cowlitz and Tower Road on the Toutle, the optimal output of stage is predicted at Castle Rock on the Cowlitz River.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of the addition of recycled cellulose on the quality and temperature of the straw bedding. Starting from week 2 of the production cycle temperatures were registered and the degree of encrustation of both the cellulose and straw bedding was determined. The cellulose bedding was characterized by higher temperatures throughout the production cycle except for weeks 10., 12., 13. and 14. The warmer bedding meant that the appearing encrustation did not restrict the diffusion of vapour and gases. It exhibited more beneficial, aerobic conditions for exothermic processes. The narrower span of temperatures indicates a more uniform temperature of the cellulose bedding.

40|$|A novel reactor named Gas-Driven Inverse Liquid-Solid Fluidized Bed (GDFB for short) was {{developed}} in this research. A vertical baffle divides the column into a riser and a downer.

In the solid-baffle system, four fluidization regimes were observed, including the packed bed, semi-fluidized bed, fully-fluidized bed, and circulating bed. Bed expansion ratio was higher for particles with a higher density and a smaller solids loading. Moreover, the average particle velocity was proportional to superficial gas velocity and higher for denser particles. In the meshed-baffle system, the <b>shifted</b> <b>bed</b> was found between the fully-fluidized bed and the circulating bed, and some hydrodynamics differed from that in the solid-baffle system.

40|$|Meiofaunal {{community}} {{structure in}} coastal sediments of Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea) {{was related to}} quantity and biochemical composition of sedimentary organic matter.

Sediments with high densities of the scallop had low meiofaunal densities especially in the top 2 cm, suggesting that scallop clapping contributed to meiofauna resuspension. However, {{it is not possible}} to exclude the probability that meiofauna are part of the scallop diet.
