5|$|As {{one of the}} Crown dependencies, Jersey is {{autonomous}} and self-governing, {{with its}} own independent legal, administrative and fiscal systems. In 1973, the Royal Commission on the Constitution <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> duties of the Crown as including: ultimate responsibility for the 'good government' of the Crown dependencies; ratification of island legislation by Order in Council (Royal Assent); international representation, subject to consultation with the island authorities before concluding any agreement which would apply to them; ensuring the islands meet their international obligations; and defence.|$|E

The bill <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> changes {{to be made}} to legislation if the proposed amendment was approved. These changes included removing the existing legislative bar on same-sex couples marrying (though the wording of the amendment is self-executing and designed to invalidate it irrespective of legislative delay), addressing the situation of civil partnership, and updating terminology of existing legislation to reflect the new provision.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, 7 October, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon {{stated that}} the UN-OPCW joint mission would {{eventually}} have about 100 personnel in Syria, with a support base in Cyprus. In {{a letter to the}} Security Council, Ban <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> mission's three phases: establish an initial presence and verify Syria's stockpiles declaration; oversee chemical weapons destruction; and verify destruction of all chemical arms related materials and programs. On 13 October Ban announced that veteran UN diplomat Sigrid Kaag would head the joint UN-OPCW mission.|$|E
5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> detailed instructions. The first requirement was {{to resolve}} disagreements {{in the earlier}} surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E

5|$|From 1357 onwards parliaments {{began to}} be {{referred}} to as the Three Estates, adopting the language of social organisation that had developed in France in the eleventh century. It was composed of the clergy, nobles and burgesses, (those that pray, those that fight and those that work). This marked the adoption of a commonplace view of Medieval society as composed of distinct orders. Within these estates there were ranks for which the terminology was increasingly dominated by the Scots language and as a result began to parallel that used in England. This consciousness over status was reflected in military and (from 1430) sumptuary legislation, which <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> types of weapons and armour that should be maintained, and clothes that could be worn, by various ranks.|$|E
5|$|In February 2006 Band {{took over}} the {{positions}} of First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff from Admiral Sir Alan West and in a press statement <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Navy's priorities in the 21st century. Upon taking up the post of First Sea Lord he became the professional head of the Royal Navy. Band is a proponent for the Sustained surface combatant capability {{and the creation of}} new ships to maintain the Royal Navy as one of the world's leading navies. These include the new Type 45 destroyer and the Royal Navy CVF programme, designed to replace the UK's current aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Enlightenment histories, {{which have been}} seen as attempting to draw general lessons about humanity from history, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder in his Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind (1784), <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> concept of Volksgeist, a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a key element in the influence of Romanticism on intellectual life was the production of national histories. The nature and existence of a national Scottish historiography has been debated among historians. Those authors who consider that such a national history did exist in this period indicate that it can be found outside of the production of major historical narratives, in works of antiquarianism and fiction.|$|E

5|$|On February 11, 1789, Allen {{traveled}} to South Hero, Vermont {{with one of}} his workers to visit his cousin, Ebenezer Allen, and to collect a load of hay. After an evening spent with friends and acquaintances, he spent the night there, and <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> next morning for home. While accounts of the return journey are not entirely consistent, Allen apparently suffered an apoplectic fit en route, and was unconscious by the time they returned home. Allen died at home several hours later, without ever regaining consciousness. He was buried four days later in the Green Mount Cemetery in Burlington. The funeral was attended by dignitaries from the Vermont government, and by large numbers of common folk who turned out to pay respects to a man many considered their champion.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{is divided}} into {{departments}} known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries. Each covers a specific policy area such as Agriculture or Justice and citizens' rights or internal services such as Human Resources and Translation and is headed by Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner. A Commissioner's portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs, they prepare proposals for them and if approved {{by a majority of}} Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration. The Commission's civil service is headed by a Secretary General, currently Alexander Italianer. The rules of procedure of the European Commission <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Commission's operation and organisation.|$|E

5|$|The Parliamentary Elections Act and Presidential Elections Act {{regulate}} {{the exercise of}} the vote and <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> procedures for parliamentary and presidential elections in Singapore. These are ordinary statutes which can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament. All Singapore citizens not less than 21 years old on the cut-off date for the registration of electors (1 January of a particular year), and ordinarily resident in the country, are entitled to vote in both parliamentary and presidential elections. A one person, one vote system is currently in operation, though in 1994 Senior Minister and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew suggested that people aged between 35 and 60 who were married with children should be given two votes each due to their greater responsibilities and contributions to society. Overseas voting was introduced in 2001, and first carried out during the 2006 general election.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the new Knights Companions were knighted by the King and invested with their ribands and badges on 27 May 1725. Although the statutes <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> full medieval ceremony {{which was to be}} used for creating knights, this was not performed, and indeed was possibly never intended to be, as the original statutes contained a provision allowing the Great Master to dispense Knights Companion from these requirements. The original knights were dispensed from all the medieval ceremonies {{with the exception of the}} Installation, which was performed in the Order's Chapel, the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey, on 17 June. This precedent was followed until 1812, after which the Installation was also dispensed with, until its revival in the twentieth century. The ceremonies however remained part of the Statutes until 1847.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} {{philosophy}} of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle who distinguished {{the forms of}} approximate and exact reasoning, <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy. The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of light. Roger Bacon (1214â€“1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized {{by many to be}} the father of modern scientific method. His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.|$|E

J. C. Smart. One of the book's thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.|$|E
5|$|Rand {{was portrayed}} by American actress Grace Lee Whitney, who had {{previously}} worked with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in both The Lieutenant and a pilot for a show he created called Police Story. Whitney as Rand was involved in promoting Star Trek before it aired, but did {{not appear in the}} first two pilots. Roddenberry <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> role of Rand to Whitney, saying that she and Kirk were meant to have feelings for one another, but should never act on them. Part way through the first season, Whitney was released from her contract. The official explanation was that the production team wanted to free up Kirk to have relationships with other women, but it was actually necessitated because the series was over budget and was looking to cut costs. It is unclear as to who suggested that her contract should be terminated, or who made the final decision. Roddenberry later blamed NBC for her release and said he regretted it. Whitney later directly linked her departure from the show to her alcoholism.|$|E
