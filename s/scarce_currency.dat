40|$|Timothy Canova, Banking and Financial Reform at the Crossroads of the Neoliberal Contagion, 14 American University International Law Review 1571 (1999). At {{the time}} of publication, this article {{provided}} the most in-depth critique of capital account liberalization in any U. S. law journal. The article stemmed from a paper presented by the author to the Seventh Annual Conference of the United States-Mexico Law Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico on October 3, 1998, during the climax {{of one of the}} most volatile periods in the global financial markets. The Russian ruble was in free fall, and so was Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that was threatening to bring down its own large creditors. The crisis was averted only by an emergency multi-billion dollar bailout brokered at the offices of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. This article situates that financial volatility within the context of the 19902 ̆ 7 s global currency contagion that had spread from Mexico and Latin America to East Asia. Canova identified a recurring pattern associated with the liberalization of portfolio capital. The initial dependence on short-term foreign investment requires a restrictive monetary policy and higher interest rates to maintain the inflow. The inflow, however, contributes to overvalued exchange rates that in turn contribute to unsustainable trade and current account deficits. What follows is an inevitable panic sell-off and flight to foreign-denominated assets. The sudden outflow of capital then leads to fiscal austerity and other disciplines imposed as conditions for International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance. After describing the dynamics of contagion, Canova inventories the range of legal instruments and institutions prematurely pushing capital account liberalization on developing countries. From the IMF Articles of Agreement to IMF loan conditions, from Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) to provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Canova demonstrates that the program of capital account liberalization is part of a Wall Street agenda. The symbiotic relationship between regulators and private financial actors raises fundamental constitutional questions about accountability in a representative democracy. The article concludes by proposing several reforms of the international monetary system, including various restrictions on short-term capital flows, the recycling of surpluses through foreign aid flows, and the issuance of global currency in the form of Special Drawing Rights. The analysis synthesizes various methodological approaches, including comparative, historical and institutional approaches: prudential restrictions on portfolio inflows (such as the Chilean ¿encage¿); a global turnover tax on currency transactions (such as the Tobin Tax proposal, named after former Nobel economist, the late James Tobin); reform of the burdens of adjustment (modeled on the Marshall Plan); and use of the dormant <b>Scarce</b> <b>Currency</b> clause in the IMF Articles of Agreement.

But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive. In the 1917 King's Birthday Honours, Keynes was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath for his wartime work, and his success led to the appointment that would have a huge effect on Keynes's life and career; Keynes was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 Versailles peace conference.

The lack of <b>scarce</b> foreign <b>currency</b> result in an inability to properly replace lost soil Nitrogen, locking such dirt poor farmers into a perpetual poverty cycle. Tree Lucerne as a Nitrogen Fixing tree is able to harvest {{more than half a}} ton of Free Atmospheric Nitrogen, per hectare, per year, if planted at plantation density in alley crop rows on 1/3 of a hectare, with 2/3 if the hectare planted to cash crops in the interrows.

The intercropping using Tree Lucerne result in potential production increases to commercial production levels, although the biological fertilisation benefits typically only kicks in from month 24 onwards, with the first substantial commercial crop yield benefit at the end of year 3. Tree Lucerne is a sustainable biological approach to soil fertility, especially if combined with Terra Preta. 40 kg of Nitrogen per hectare per year typically yields 1 ton of Maize, 200 kg of N yields 4 tons and 400 kg of N close to 8 tons, per hectare, per year. The ability of Tree Lucerne to fix 587 kg of free Atmospheric Nitrogen per ha/year is thus very attractive to remote rural farmers locked in a soil poverty cycle.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 118 - 127). Zimbabwe {{is facing}} very serious economic challenges including hyperinflation, poor international relations, <b>scarce</b> foreign <b>currency</b> and a crumbling infrastructure. This situation has adversely affected {{all sectors of}} the economy, including health care. Resources for health care have significantly dwindled and the population's disposable incomes are very low. However, the burden of disease due to HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria and Diabetes is increasing unabated. Thus, the current study seeks to determine whether public sector diabetes care services are available, affordable, acceptable and also whether access to care is equitable or not. A cross sectional design was adopted for this study. Questionnaires were administered to 179 patients who presented at public health facilities in Harare, 15 provider interviews were done, 15 health facility checklists were completed, one Provincial Medical Director completed a questionnaire and three focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted. Purposive sampling was used for key informant interviews (PMDs) and also, {{in the selection of}} FGD participants. For provider interviews, nurses who attended to Diabetics were selected as respondents. All Diabetic patients who presented for care at selected health facilities were interviewed. The study also conveniently selected 10 facilities from high density areas, three from the medium and two from the low density areas for checklists. Study findings show that the major challenges lie with availability and affordability of care. In summary, {{there is a shortage of}} resources such as staff, drugs, equipment and supplies. Patients also face high direct and indirect costs of care due to high drug, food and transport costs. Membership of medical aid seems to be restricted to the richest patients. Moreover, poorest the patients do not belong to any support groups. However, the interaction between patients and their providers is reported to be good.

50|$|Alla ricerca del tempo sprecato: L’idillio tumultuoso di Marcel Proust e Lionel Hauser {{tells of}} the innumerable {{financial}} and sentimental vicissitudes that turned Proust into an extraordinary writer. Lionel Hauser was Proust’s closest financial advisor {{and one of his}} most devoted friends. Through the years, this friendship was put to a harsh test by the banker’s disapproval of Proust’s risky financial transactions and conspicuous expenses. To this day, Hauser’s negative opinion is shared by the writer’s biographers; they argue unanimously that Proust squandered his money, either on reckless speculations or on extravagant gifts to men and women who struck his fancy, and they draw incorrect biographical conclusions from it. Dagnese’s book describes and documents in solid details the Phoenix-like rebirth of Proust’s finances after the First World War, when, year after year, both his portfolio and his royalties turned a substantial profit. Lionel Hauser had a profound dislike for wasted time; to him, time came in <b>scarce</b> quantities, like <b>currency,</b> liquidity, gold, and rare merchandises, and should therefore be either frugally saved or profitably invested. In Hauser’s eyes, Proust, who {{spent most of his time}} in bed, was the personification of wasted time; he even became its eulogist once he began publishing volume after volume of a massive novel, In Search of Lost Time, devoted, precisely, to the ineffectual passing of time. In contrast, Proust conceived of the “lost time” that is the subject of his novel as the sextant of human existence, the measure of our adjustment to its transiency. To the writer, the passing of time was not ineluctable but rather reversible, because the future offered him the opportunity to turn the disjointed events from his past into a new cohesive whole. The polemic about wasted time affected the harshest conflicts between Proust and Hauser. In the end, Hauser had to face the evidence that his zero-sum-game theory was inadequate to explain Proust’s resourceful usage of time and money.|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} sector development history of Zimbabwe {{has been dominated}} by episodes of financial repression. The main instruments of financial repression have included interest rate ceilings, selective credit rationing policies, restrictions on the remittance of capital, exchange controls and taxes on financial assets, zero-interest reserve requirements and a mesh of liquidity ratios. Inflation tax has also been used as a subtle form of financial repression. The rationale for financial repression has been {{based on the premise that}} government intervention would remedy the existing structural weakness of the market, channel resources to priorities sectors, which were considered as the engines of growth. Thus, the targeted sectors or companies that received subsidised credit (especially public enterprises) had easy access to <b>scarce</b> foreign <b>currency</b> (through import licences) and/or government guarantees (Chigumira, 2000). The episodes of financial repression have been accompanied by low savings, excessive credit rationing and low investment. This adversely affected the quality and quantity of investment as bankers adopted credit-rationing policies and practices that encouraged inefficient and/or capital intensive projects. Banks are also likely to have invested less in risk assessment and monitoring systems especially where banks were forced to lend to targeted sectors. There has been a burgeoning literature that questioned the wisdom of financial repression and provided financial liberalisation as an alternative framework for managing the {{financial sector}}. Within this literature financial repression has been considered as a second best strategy that is adopted when institutional constraints prevented Governments from collecting enough tax revenue to finance expenditure. Asset price distortions caused by financial repression have inhibited the development of the financial sector and undermined the sectorâ€™s contribution to economic development. In particular, administered deposit rate ceilings in an environment of high nominal inflation rates resulted in negative real interest rates, which curtailed savings mobilisation. In this regard measures that repress the financial sector consequently reduce the size of the banking system and stifle financial intermediation. The emergence and perpetuation of financial dualism (the co-existence of the formal and informal financial sectors), has in part been attributed to repressive financial sector policies among other factors. The financial price differentials and market segmentation caused by this dualistic structure caused further distortions in the economy. The main policy recommendation by McKinnon (1973) and Shaw (1973) and more recently from the endogenous financial development literature is to liberalise the financial sector. This entails decontrolling of interest rates, removing other controls that inhibited the development of the money and capital market. It was envisaged that positive real rates of interest would stimulate financial savings and thus expand real supply of credit within the financial sector. The increase in credit would consequently increase the volume of investment in productive sectors of the economy. This would ultimately stimulate growth not only through increased volume of investment but also due to increases in the average productivity of capital (see King and Levine 1993). Increase in productivity will arise because market determined interest rates, based on appropriate risk assessment will eliminate low risk and low-yielding investments in favour of high risk and high return investments. Financial liberalisation featured as a major component of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank supported structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) that were adopted and implemented in a number of African countries in the 1980 s. Country experiences with financial liberalisation have been varied and wide depending on a number of factors including the initial conditions; market failures and sequencing of the reforms, among others. In some instances, financial liberalisation induced financial sector deepening and in others financial crisis. This paper provides a synopsis of the international and countryâ€™s experience with financial liberalization/reform. The ultimate objective is to draw lessons from cross-country experiences on the design and implementation of financial reforms.,Government of Zimbabwe, African Capacity Building Foundation and USAID...|$|R
40|$|The Government of Syria is {{determined}} to become less dependent on the imports of large volumes of concentrates for ruminant livestock feeding for which {{a large amount of}} <b>scarce</b> foreign <b>currency</b> is required. For this reason there is an increased interest in the incorporation of a variety of agricultural residues and animal wastes in ruminant livestock diets, without having any adverse effects on performance. Therefore, this project was designed to provide national staff with the requisite training on by-product processing and feeding aimed at applying on private farms technology that has proved safe, simple and economical. The project also provided the institutions/stations participating in the work it's full support in terms of technical assistance and of equipment to implement project activities. A major goal of the project was to develop simple, safe and low cost technology for processing and storing agricultural by-products and feeding them to ruminants. The crop residues and by-products most widely studied were cereal straws (wheat and barley), poultry excreta, grape marc, fresh sugarbeet pulp and olive cake. Some studies were also done on preservation methods and the nutritional values of corn stalks and cottonseed hulls. In {{the first year of the}} project the new technology was developed/tested on state farms before applying the promising aspects in on-farm-tests (OFT) using the facilities of private farmers. On state farm demonstrations resulted not only in the development of the new technology but also in reliable data collection under local conditions. Counterpart staff gained valuable knowledge and experience through instruction, demonstration and supervised participation in the work programme. Technology found to be simple, safe and economical was applied on private farms (46) during the second year. A work plan for year 3 was jointly prepared by the NPD and the CTA and was presented at the second TPR meeting held in March 1992. Unfortunately, only part of the proposed work plan was implemented. In the Interim report it was stated that, concerning the Development Objectives, it was too early to assess the project's achievements. But the expressed interest by companies/organisations and farmers to invest in the new technologies and the fact that all farmers who adopted the project's products/technologies were willing to continue applying them indicated that the project could meet its Development Objectives. The implementation of the work plan of the 3 rd year is certainly an obstacle to the project achieving its development objectives and, if no corrective action is taken, there is a danger of loosing what the project has so far achieved. The outputs were realised for meeting the immediate objectives of the project document. The project developed during the first two years safe, simple and low cost methods of processing and upgrading agricultural by-products. Despite the fact that the project's promising findings were applied on private farms from the second year and the continued interest of farmers and state organisations to apply the new knowledge there has been a disappointing discontinuation of project activities in year 3. Urea-treatment of straw was more widely applied compared to the other technology due to the promotion of this technique by other sources (Mashreq project, Regional Network) demonstrating the promotional benefits of project findings Despite the discontinuation of work in the third year and limited contacts between project personnel and farmers/ organizations/ agricultural companies there is still interest in investing in the technology developed by the project. Several useful technologies generated and/or introduced by the project should be further extended to farmers: Every effort should be made to implement the work plan presented in February - March 1992. The Government of the SAR should appoint a new project manager, preferably experienced in extension work, who, in close co-operation with the of the APRD, will supervise/promote the commercial introduction of UB/MUB, ammonification of straw and pre-processing (mixing of litter with pulp prior to ensiling) poultry excreta/high moisture content by-products (i. e. sugarbeet pulp). The MAAR should encourage farmers to collect/store straw surpluses in good years for subsequent use during bad years; this operation should start in areas where the straw is produced and/or in neighbouring provinces. Project findings show that the additional expenses due to treatment are more than covered by the improved animal productivity; it is recommended, therefore, to promote ammonification of straw. Ammonia-gas can be the choice of treatment for large scale operations; the establishment of mobile straw treatment units that will visit private/state farms to process and treat straw with ammonia gas should be among the priorities of a follow-up phase. Urea treatment, on the other hand, should be the choice of smal...|$|R
40|$|Although {{trees and}} {{livestock}} are not closely-linked components of modem western agricultural systems, {{this was not}} always the case. Traditional 'woodpasture' systems were widespread in Europe and allowed production of meat, firewood and building timber from the same area of land. What are the benefits of such systems today in the Tropics? In recent years, increasing pressure on land in tropical countries has resulted in massive deforestation with consequent erosion and reduction in soil fertility as well as serious shortages of fuelwood. This has convinced many agricultural scientists that trees have a crucial {{role to play in}} tropical agriculture and that they should not be confined to intensive plantations but should instead be integrated with arable agriculture and livestock husbandry. Integration of livestock and trees makes excellent sense for farmers in tropical countries, both in terms of intensification of land use and economic security. Because animals provide traction and manure in addition to meat, milk and hides, their inclusion in the farming system actually increases crop production. They need not compete for land with crops, so long as adequate forage is available throughout the year. In addition to the advantages mentioned above leguminous trees, which fix nitrogen, can provide protein-rich leaves as supplements for ruminants and pigs, and nutritious browse during periods when other feeds are unavailable. (See CTA Activities, Spore 31 'Caribbean livestock: improving health and nutrition'). Farming systems that integrate trees with livestock In the semi-arid areas of Africa both pastoralists and farmers encourage the growth of acacia trees; the highly nutritious foliage and pods provide an important source of dry fodder for their animals. In the Sahel one species, Acacia albida, is particularly important since it produces green foliage throughout the dry season when other sources of forage are scarce. An abundant crop of nutritious pods is also produced {{at the end of the}} dry season, when the need for fodder is greatest, and a single tree will produce between 50 and 150 kg of pods per year. Similarly, in the semi-arid highlands of the Haraghe region of Ethiopia a traditional agroforestry system based on A. albida has evolved. Estimates of the additional income resulting from growing the trees in the farmers' gelds suggest that the value of produce (cereal grain and stover, fuel-wood and fodder) increases in proportion with the cover of the tree canopy. At a planting rate of 20 trees per hectare, the additional value of the produce (compared with fields without trees) was equivalent to US$ 230 per hectare per year and the total value of the fodder produced was about $ 370 per hectare per year. To date, tree-planting in semi-arid areas has mainly been done in the context of fuelwood and erosion control programmes and the benefits to agriculture are poorly documented. Nevertheless, species suitable for semi-arid areas of the highlands of East Africa have been identified by the International Council for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) at Machakos in Kenya. They include Leucaena, Acacia albida, A. tortilis, Sesbania sesban, S. bispinosa, Prosopis juliflora and P. pallida. Not all of these have been tested in farmers' fields but recent experiments in a semi-arid region of India using leucaena in mixed sorghum and livestock smallholdings gave remarkable improvements in sorghum yields and provided a valuable source of fodder and firewood. Here, leucaena was planted in rows 6 m apart with sorghum planted between. The trees were pollarded at 2 m height immediately before planting the sorghum, and the leaves were fed with sorghum stover to cattle. The researchers found that the value of produce from the leucaena/sorghum combination was about one third greater than that from sorghum alone and that income from the forage accounted for about 20 % of the total value. Another way in which trees and livestock can be integrated is by growing forage under tree plantations. This is widely practised in Goats browsing on leucaena the Pacific region, where both cattle and small ruminants are grazed under coconut plantations; in S. E. Asia, in rubber and coconut plantations; and, to a smaller extent, in West Africa in oil palm plantations. Grazing animals in plantations has a number of advantages for smallholder farmers. Under-utilized land and labour are made more productive and farm income is increased. With careful management, improvements in growth and yield of the tree crop can be achieved and considerable savings can be made in costs of herbicides to control ground-cover herbage. Because the market price of the produce from tree crops (particularly copra and coconut oil) fluctuates widely, inclusion of livestock in the system provides a buffer against falling prices. Since tree crops take a minimum of 6 to 7 years before coming into economic production, a combination of forage and food crops intercropped with young trees can help to offset the costs of establishing plantations. Finally, the cooler temperatures under tree plantations can provide a better microclimate for animal production than unshaded areas. Studies carried out in S. E. Asia and the Pacific illustrate the benefits of integrating livestock with coconut production. In southern India, the net return from smallholder coconut plantations was calculated as approximately US$ 350 per hectare per year, but when milk cattle were included net returns increased to $ 942 per year. Likewise, in the Philippines a recent comparison of the relative returns to coconut plantations alone and coconuts with beef cattle showed that inclusion of cattle more than doubles net returns, from $ 159 to $ 327 per farm per year. Inclusion of improved forages can often dramatically increase liveweight gains and profits from livestock in plantations. In the New Hebrides, planting guinea grass (Panicum maximum) and forage sorghum under coconut resulted in a ninefold increase in profits from livestock as compared with unimproved native pasture species. In much of humid S. E. Asia the creeping legumes calopo and puero (originally introduced to plantations as ground cover to control weeds) provide nutritious fodder for animals and there is considerable scope for improving pastures under plantations with these and other forage legumes. Alley cropping The third example of integrating trees with agriculture is a more recent development which has not yet been widely adopted by farmers in the Tropics. However, many agriculturalists think alley cropping has immense potential for stabilizing and improving smallholder farming. Traditional agriculture in the Tropics relies on the bush fallow system of shifting cultivation to restore soil fertility. Following forest clearance and cultivation, the litter from the dense growth of shrubs which develops on fallow land restores soil organic matter, the key to maintaining fertility. This system has maintained crop yields and soil fertility on the fragile soils of the humid tropics for millennia, but more recently growing populations have led to increasing demand for food, resulting in shortened fallow periods. The consequences for soil fertility and crop yields have been disastrous. Within living memory, average crop yields in parts of humid West Africa have almost halved, and in some areas cultivated land has even been abandoned as a result. Scientists from the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), at Ibadan in Nigeria, have tested a system to replace shifting cultivation that would allow continuous cropping without the resulting loss in soil fertility. Alley cropping consists of hedges of fast-growing shrubs interplanted with food crops. Using nitrogen-fixing leguminous shrubs such as leucaena or gliricidia, crop yields have been maintained at reasonable levels over several years, without the need for a fallow period. The system has several advantages. The shrubs provide green manure or mulch for companion crops, a source of stakes and firewood and, most importantly, biologically-fixed nitrogen to maintain and enhance soil fertility. Additionally, alleys planted along the contours on sloping ground can help to prevent soil erosion. Researchers from the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA), who also worked at Ibadan, realized that this system might also provide a means of improving productivity of sheep and goats in humid Africa, where forest sheep and dwarf goats are traditionally raised. Because they are fed only on kitchen refuse and agricultural by-products, such as cassava leaves, their productivity is low and surplus meat is rarely produced. Demand for fresh meat in the towns of West Africa is increasingly met largely by expensive beef. If the productivity of local small ruminants could be raised, a large and easily accessible market for meat would be available to farmers. Problems and outlook for integrating livestock and trees The leaves of both leucaena and gliricidia are highly nutritious for small ruminants and are produced throughout the dry season in humid regions, a period when other forages are scarce. Trials in which grass supplemented with varying quantities of leucaena or gliricidia leaves was fed to West African dwarf sheep show that inclusion in the diet of only 800 grammes of leaves per day increased liveweight gain by 30 % and survival of the young by 26 %. After some initial reluctance, many local farmers have adopted the idea of feeding browse from alleys to their animals, so that in only five years over 60 farmers in the Ibadan region established new alley farms. One of the advantages of the system is that it allows farmers freedom of choice as to how they use browse, either as fertilizer for crops or feed for animals, according to their own needs and the relative price of meat versus food crops. Following the initial success of alley farming in the Ibadan region, ILCA has started a network throughout West Africa to promote integration of trees and livestock. The examples that have been described suggest that integration of livestock husbandry with trees could provide major benefits for farmers in ACP countries. But it would be wrong to assume that there are no problems to be overcome and that the future of agroforestry in the Tropics is guaranteed. One general problem, particularly in Africa, is that of communal land tenure. Where farmers do not have individual tenure rights, the incentive to plant trees, which have long-term production cycles, is very low. This is probably one of the reasons for the relatively slow uptake of alley farming in West Africa, where much land is held communally or by tenant farmers. Likewise, in humid areas where the natural regrowth is dense bush, there may be considerable reluctance by farmers to plant shrubs or trees on land which they have recently spent much effort on clearing for food crops. Furthermore, in densely populated areas, such as the highlands of East Africa, land is already intensively used and any new management system needs careful on-farm testing to ensure that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages in actual practice. Also, where a completely new system such as alley farming is introduced, farmers may lack the management skills in both agroforestry and animal husbandry which are necessary to maintain productivity. Apart from such social and economic constraints, technical problems may also restrict opportunities for integrating livestock with trees. In many tropical areas animal diseases are a major problem. Much of the humid forest region of Africa is infested with tsetse fly, and only trypanosomiasis-resistant animals can be raised. In the same area, the disease PPR ('Peste des petite ruminants') causes serious weight loss and abortion in sheep and goats and the advantages of alley farming can only be fully exploited if animals are regularly vaccinated against the disease. When livestock are grazed in tree plantations, competition for nutrients and water between the trees and the pasture may result in poor establishment of one or other of the two components. There is often initially a considerable problem in preventing animals damaging young trees and then, as the tree canopy develops, in preventing overgrazing and maintaining a healthy sward in the heavily-shaded conditions. In this situation, careful regulation of stocking rates is essential and requires considerable livestock management skills. In the drier areas of the Tropics, competition between trees and pasture for limited soil moisture can also be a problem. There is also a pressing need to identify tree species that can grow well under the poor and erratic rainfall conditions encountered in such areas. Despite all these problems, the integration of livestock farming with trees in the Tropics is likely to expand for a variety of reasons. In many areas, deforestation has resulted in critical shortages of fuel and timber as well as serious soil erosion. While the conventional response of establishing fuel-wood plantations can provide a partial solution, shortage of land for food crops places a limit on the area that can be planted. Integration of trees in farmland simultaneously provides fuel and helps to control erosion. Including an animal component in the system not only provides meat, milk and hides but manure and traction as well. In many areas of the tropics, demand for meat and milk products far outstrips supply and the deficit is met by expensive imports paid for with <b>scarce</b> foreign <b>currency.</b> Self-sufficiency in livestock products should be seen as a national goal as well as an important source of farm income. However, as was stressed in the introduction, integration of livestock and trees should not be seen in isolation from the farming system as a whole. Only if the new technologies are carefully tailored to the particular requirements of individual farming communities are they likely to prove acceptable. It is in this respect that agroforestry is likely to provide the major challenge to agricultural scientists and extension workers alike in the 21 st century. Although trees and livestock are not closely-linked components of modem western agricultural systems, this was not always the case. Traditional 'woodpasture' systems were widespread in Europe and allowed production of meat, firewood and building [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Subsidies are policy {{tools that}} support {{specific}} sectors {{of an economy}} {{with the intention of}} revamping performance or protecting a sector. They are often criticized as ineffective policy tools since they can lead to dependency or even crowd out the private sector. Depending on the implementation strategy and the situation, policies can be beneficial, destructive, or have no apparent impact. Despite the debate about their appropriateness as policy tools, input subsidies have been re-introduced in sub-Saharan Africa with the initial intention of mitigating the effect of global food price hikes, which peaked in 2008. The new generation of subsidy programs are expected to improve access and use of fertilizers, increase agricultural production and productivity, and ultimately improve the well-being of arable crop farmers. So far, evidence only available for countries in eastern Africa, suggests that the programs have largely succeeded in increasing productivity, production, incomes, and food security. Between 2008 and 2013, the Government of Ghana spent over United States Dollar (USD) 215 million on 724, 005 metric tons (MT) of subsidized fertilizers. Justification of these expenditures is therefore necessary. This research is motivated by the quest to provide evidence on the impacts the new subsidy programs in Western Africa. The research identifies and assesses the impacts of the Fertilizer Subsidy Program of Ghana on farm-level performance and food security of rice-producing households {{in the northern part of}} the country. Rice-producing households are the focus since rice is a commodity of strategic economic importance in Ghana, as well as in Africa as a whole. This is because domestic demand for rice in Ghana is far higher than domestic supply, causing a gap which is filled by imports. The cost of importing rice is paid for with <b>scarce</b> foreign <b>currency.</b> This situation may threaten national food security. The fertilizer subsidy is an imperative component of the national rice development strategy as it seeks to improve access to fertilizers with the aim to enhance productivity and production. Northern Ghana contributes about 30 % of the nations rice production and has the potential to increase this share. Meanwhile, agriculture in northern Ghana is rain-fed and farmers struggle with declining soil fertility, which negatively impacts productivity and food security. Increasing fertilizer use through the subsidy could greatly improve the livelihoods of rice-producing households in northern Ghana. This research begins with an exploratory study on determinants of fertilizer adoption among 330 smallholder farmers. This exploratory study is, however, less robust since the sampled households were likely to be beneficiaries of a soil health project from the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) and, selectivity bias associated with participation in the subsidy program was not accounted for. The study however shows that fertilizer adoption decisions are in two stages. It recommends the need for regular training of members of farmer based organizations as a way of improving farm-level performance through the adoption of fertilizer. This recommendation is more general as it does not analyze any specific agricultural production system. The study provides useful insights on the design of activities and on analytic procedures which address the core questions of this research. Chapter 3 contains a more in-depth study of fertilizer use in rice-growing households. It examines the role of the fertilizer subsidy program in fertilizer adoption decisions based on data from a cross-section of 820 systematically selected rice-producing households. The analyses show that these rice-producing households use different combinations of fertilizers. Overall, nearly 67 % use at least one type of fertilizer and 44 % use a combination of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) and ammonium (NH 4) fertilizers. Using Craggs two-step regression models, the fertilizer subsidy program is shown to increase the probability and intensity of fertilizer adoption. The study shows that effective adoption of the recommended combination of NPK and NH 4 fertilizers can be achieved by linking farmers to training programs on good agricultural practices. Moreover, enhancing access to information and complementary technologies can improve adoption of the recommended fertilizer combination. Chapter 4 assesses the impact of the program on farm-level productivity and computes partial factor productivity of land and labor using the same database as the previous chapter. The average land productivity of rice, 1, 309 kg/ha, is still below the national and global average of 2, 539 kg/ha and 4, 548 kg/ha, respectively. Correcting for endogeneity of participation in the fertilizer subsidy program, the estimated local average treatment effect (LATE) impact parameters show that the fertilizer subsidy increases land productivity modestly and decreases labor productivity. Increased access to fertilizers requires the use of additional labor for fertilizer application. The negative impact of the subsidy program on productivity may be because yield increases are not enough to compensate for the extra labor employed. Including the provision of labor saving technologies and intensive training in productivity enhancing techniques as part of fertilizer subsidy programs may help unleash the full benefits of the program. Chapter 5 examines the impact of the program on food security. More specifically, a sample of 740 rice-producing households is used to compute the amount of calories, proteins, and fats consumed in the abundant, normal, and lean periods of the year. The results show that at any point in time, some households are food insecure. The incidence of food insecurity is highest during lean periods and lowest during periods of abundance, implying instability in household food security throughout the year. Most households have adequate access to calories and proteins, although the majority does not have access to an adequate amount of fats. Improving the crop mix to include crops that can provide adequate access to these nutrients is recommended to improve food security. This part of the research also used the LATE procedure to estimate the impact of the subsidy program on food security. The results show a positive impact of the subsidy program on the nutritional value consumed food and the effect is highest during the lean period. In conclusion, this thesis shows that the fertilizer subsidy program is effective at increasing the adoption of fertilizers. The program increases the land productivity of rice, but decreases labor productivity. The subsidy leads to significant improvements in the food security of rice-producing households. Linking fertilizer subsidy programs to productivity enhancing interventions and the availability of complementary technologies is necessary to maximize its impact. Technology adoption studies should endeavor to consider technologies as a package, instead of individual components. Going forward, it is recommended that the Government should compare the cost effectiveness of the subsidy program to alternative policy options, such as rice importation, to guide the allocation of scarce financial resources. The focus of this study on lowland rice-ecologies in northern Ghana limits the ability to extend the recommendations to other rice ecologies and to the country as a whole. Nevertheless, the recommendations may be useful for neighboring countries which have similar ecologies, such as Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria. Subventionen sind wirtschaftspolitische Maßnahmen, die eingesetzt werden um spezifische Sektoren eines Wirtschaftssystems zu unterstützen; entweder mit der Absicht, die wirtschaftliche Leistung des Sektors umzugestalten oder um den Sektor zu schützen. Allerdings werden häufig Subventionen als ineffiziente Maßnahmen kritisiert, da sie in die Abhängigkeit führen oder gar den Privatsektor verdrängen könnenoften. Tatsächlich können sich Subventionsmaßnahmen, abhängig von ihrer Implemetierungsstrategie, sehr förderlich oder sehr destruktiv auswirken. Trotz der bestehenden Auseinandersetzungen über die Zweckmäßigkeit von Betriebsmittelsubventionen wurden diese in Subsahara-Afrika mit der ursprünglichen Absicht wiedereingeführt, die Auswirkungen der weltweiten Lebensmittel Preissteigerungen abzumildern, die im Jahr 2008 den Höchststand erreichten. Es wird erwartet, dass die neue Generation von Subventionsprogrammen, auch intelligente Subventionen genannt, den Zugriff auf und die Nutzung von Düngemitteln verbessern wird, womit eine Steigerung der landwirtschaftlichen Produktion und Produktivität erreicht würde. Letztendlich würde dies in einer Steigerung des Wohlbefindens der Begünstigten resultieren. Bislang zeigen die vorliegenden Daten, dass die Programme im östlichen und südlichen Afrika größtenteils erfolgreich waren, was die Steigerung der Produktion und Produktivität, sowie Einkommen und Nahrungssicherheit betrifft. Seit dem Inkrafttreten der Programme im Jahr 2008 bis ins Jahr 2013 hat der ghanaische Staat 215 millionen USD für insgesamt 714. 005 Mt subventionierter Düngemittel ausgegeben. Es besteht daher die Notwendigkeit, diese hohen Ausgaben zu rechtfertigen. Die vorliegende Forschungsarbeit möchte Nachweise für die Auswirkungen der neuen Subventionsprogramme in Westafrika erbringen. Im Wesentlichen werden die Auswirkungen des Düngemittel-Subventionsprogrammes in Ghana auf Betriebsebene sowie die Nahrungssicherheit von Reisproduzenten im Norden des Landes untersucht. Dieser Schwerpunkt ergibt sich aus der Tatsache, dass Reis ein Rohstoff von hoher wirtschaftsstrategischer Relevanz in Ghana und in ganz Afrika ist. Die heimische Nachfrage nach Reis ist bedeutend höher als das heimische Angebot, und um die Angebotslücke zu schließen, ist es notwendig, knappe Devisen darauf zu verwenden um Reis zu|$|R
