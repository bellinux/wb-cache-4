Purpose: The {{aim of this}} study is to identify and describe the perception of Thai consumers toward <b>sugar</b> <b>confectionery</b> <b>products</b> with the concept of loose candy (lösgodis) by putting an emphasis on the preferences of product features and the choices of product as well as explore the similarities and differences of each demographic and psychographic group. Method: Method included a collection of information concerning theories. model and confectionery market information from different sources; interview with the candy store owner to figure out market insight as well as related information and the survey with a sample of respondents in order to investigate their perception and preferences of the <b>sugar</b> <b>confectionery</b> <b>products.</b> The retrieved data was analyzed statistically and theoretically in accordance with the conceptual framework. Result: The findings indicated that the majority of Thai people like to consume candy. By allowing consumers to perceive and evaluate candy features through different senses, the result revealed that colorful soft gummy fruity flavors candy with a shape of eatable product together with a uniquely stand-out sweets smell are most preferable.

40|$|International audienceA {{method has}} been {{developed}} for estimating the content in foods of the emulsifying additive E 473, sucrose esters of fatty acids. The analytical approach taken to estimate the complex mixtures that comprise this additive involved, selective solvent extraction of the intact esters using a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and ethyl acetate, alkaline hydrolysis of the esters to liberate sucrose, and then GC-MS measurement of the liberated sucrose using GC-MS after acidic hydrolysis to glucose and fructose and then silylation. The method was developed to aid future estimates of intake of this food additive. The method determines the total sucrose esters content of a food sample and does not attempt to discrimination between individual sucrose esters when present as a mixture in a food sample. A single (average) factor is used to convert the liberated sucrose content into sucrose ester content. The method was applied to analysis of 8 different food types (including bakery wares, <b>sugar</b> <b>confectionery,</b> dairy <b>product,</b> margarine, meat pies and a sauce) spiked with 0. 5 to 1 % of a mixture of 3 sucrose esters that spanned the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) range 1 - 16. The limit of quantification was around 50 mg/kg, {{which is more than}} adequate for these additives. The analytical recovery was 73 - 106 % with an average of 91 %. The precision of the method (RSD) was 6 - 18 % (n= 3 to 20 for each food type) with an average RSD of 11 %. The main analytical uncertainty is the conversion factor used to express sucrose ester content from the amount of sucrose liberated. The method is also applicable to sucroglycerides (E 474) ...|$|R

Important advantages of this group of products are relatively large periods of storage and good portability, which expands the geographical possibilities of its use. However, the use of sucrose as a main flavor component and preservative, is an unfavorable factor for a healthy diet as a whole, and particularly for certain groups of the population for health.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first environmental life cycle analysis {{for a range}} of different <b>confectionery</b> <b>products.</b> A proposed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was developed to characterise and identify the environmental profiles and hotspots for five different confectionery products; milk chocolate, dark chocolate, sugar, milk chocolate biscuit and milk-based products. The environmental impact categories are based on Nestle's EcodEX LCA tool which includes Global Warming Potential (GWP), Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP), ecosystems quality, and two new indicators previously not considered such as land use and water depletion. Overall, it was found that <b>sugar</b> <b>confectionery</b> had the lowest aggregated environmental impact compared to dark chocolate confectionery which had the highest, primarily due to ingredients. As such, nine key ingredients were identified across the five <b>confectionery</b> <b>products</b> which are recommended for confectionery manufacturers to prioritise e. g. sugar, glucose, starch, milk powder, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk liquid, wheat flour and palm oil. Furthermore, the general environmental hotspots were found to occur at the following life cycle stages: raw materials, factory, and packaging. An analysis of five improvement strategies (e. g. alternative raw materials, packaging materials, renewable energy, product reformulations, and zero waste to landfill) showed both positive and negative environmental impact reduction is possible from cradle-to-grave, especially renewable energy. Surprisingly, the role of product reformulations was found to achieve moderate-to-low environmental reductions with waste reductions having low impacts. The majority of reductions was found to be achieved by focusing on sourcing raw materials with lower environmental impacts, product reformulations, and reducing waste generating an aggregated environmental reduction of 46 %. Overall, this research provides many insights of the environmental impacts {{for a range of}} different <b>confectionery</b> <b>products,</b> especially how actors across the confectionery supply chain can improve the environmental sustainability performance. It is expected the findings from this research will serve as a base for future improvements, research and policies for confectionery manufacturers, supply chain actors, policy makers, and research institutes towards an environmentally sustainable confectionery industry...|$|R
