40|$|Background Turning {{while walking}} {{is a crucial}} {{component}} of locomotion that is performed using an outside (step) or inside (spin) limb strategy. The aims of this paper were to determine how children with cerebral palsy perform turning maneuvers and if specific kinematic and kinetic adaptations occur compared to their typically developing peers. Methods Motion capture data from twenty-two children with cerebral palsy and fifty-four typically developing children were collected during straight and 90 Â° turning gait trials. Experimental data were used to compute spatio-temporal parameters, margin of stability, ground reaction force impulse, as well as joint kinematics and kinetics. Findings Both child groups preferred turning using the spin strategy. The group of children with cerebral palsy exhibited the following adaptations during turning gait compared to the typically developing group: stride length was decreased across all phases of the turn with largest effect size for the depart phase (2. 02), stride width was reduced during the turn phase, but with a smaller effect size (0. 71), and the average margin of <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> the <b>approach</b> phase of turning was reduced (effect size of 0. 98). Few overall group differences were found for joint kinematic and kinetic measures; however, in many cases, the intra-subject differences between straight walking and turning gait were larger {{for the majority of}} children with cerebral palsy than for the typically developing children. Interpretation In children with cerebral palsy, turning gait may be a better discriminant of pathology than straight walking and could be used to improve the management of gait abnormalities. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} hydrocolloids on the gelatinisation behaviour of hard wheat flour were investigated. Influence of guar, xanthan, Arabic, {{carboxy methyl cellulose}} (CMC) and tragacanth gums on wheat flour was studied using micro viscoamylograph. It was found that all hydrocolloids except tragacanth greatly modified the gelatinisation properties of wheat flour. Guar and xanthan significantly lowered the gelatinisation temperature, enhanced peak viscosity, increased the breakdown during cooking, promoted the <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> cooling and thus decreased the tendency to setback. Gum Arabic lowers the peak viscosity, reduces breakdown during heating and thus provides increased <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> cooking. The addition of CMC to the wheat flour resulted in maximum <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> cooling. It also produced large breakdown during heating which provided maximum destabilization and made the cooking easier. These results suggest that by adding gums gelatinisation properties of wheat flour can be greatly modified and this {{could be used for}} the improvement of different wheat products...|$|R

Postural stability was measured as anteroposterior torque variance in Young (n = 25, average age = 25. 1 years) and Elderly subjects (n = 16, average age = 71. 5 years) during repeated calf vibrations while standing with eyes open and closed. Sensation, recorded using vibration perception and tactile sensitivity, was poorer in elderly than young subjects. Sensation was of low importance for <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> quiet stance and the first 50 s of repeated vibrations, but was associated with <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> the last three 50 s periods of balance perturbations, suggesting that the mechanoreceptive sensation affected how well postural control could adapt to repeated balance perturbations. The findings suggest that clinicians should investigate whether patients with balance problems and poor adaptation have mechanoreceptive sensation deficits...|$|R

It is essential for human and animal health, but only synthesized in photosynthetic organisms, where it is localized in chloroplast membranes. While many studies have investigated non-antioxidative effects of tocopherol on phospholipid membranes, nothing is known about its effects on membranes containing chloroplast glycolipids. Here, liposomes resembling plant chloroplast membranes were used to investigate the effects of α-tocopherol on vesicle <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> freezing and on lipid dynamics. α-Tocopherol had a pronounced influence on membrane dynamics and showed strong interactions in its effects on membrane <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> freezing with the cryoprotectant sucrose. α-Tocopherol showed maximal effects at low concentrations (around 2 mol%), close to its contents in chloroplast membranes...|$|R
