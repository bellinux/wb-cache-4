5000|$|In 1999, Garvey {{completed}} a Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science (Hons) with a joint thesis between the Departments of Archaeology and Zoology at La Trobe University. The focus of her thesis was {{in identifying the}} fossilized history of a late Holocene assemblage of small mammals in Tasmania. This project involved studying the dietary selectivity of predators and [...] "included the role in which <b>Strigiformes</b> (<b>owls)</b> play in the accumulation of small animals in these faunal assemblages". [...] "Experimental feeding trials of the three owl taxa known to currently inhabit Tasmania" [...] were conducted {{as part of the}} research in the investigation of regurgitated owl-pellets in determining the source of small animal bones. In 2005, her PhD in Palaeontology [...] "investigated the vertebrate taphonomy, palaeoecology and the depositional environment of an Early Carboniferous (Tournaisian) fossil fish locality, Fish Hill, in the Home Station Member of the Snowy Plains Formation, Mansfield Basin, Australia. This project combined research on the vertebrate fish assemblage, micro vertebrates, ichnology, taphonomy and geology of the locality to develop an overall understanding of the palaeoecology and palaeocommunity". Research from her thesis contributed to increase knowledge on new fish species from the Early Carboniferous in the Mansfield Basin locality.|$|E

40|$|The monophyly of the Coliiformes (Sandcoleidae + Coliidae) is well corroborated {{with the}} {{recognition}} of len osteologieal synapomorphies. So far, four species of coliiform birds are known from the Middle Eocene of Grube Messel (Hessen, Germany). Members of both the Sandcoleidae and of the Cotiidae have been identified. Eoglaucidium pallas FISCHER 1987, originally assigned to the <b>Strigiformes</b> (<b>owls),</b> is referred to the Sandcoleidae {{and for the first}} time complete skeletons of this species are described. A second species of the Sandcoleidae with excellently preserved feather remains, has also been tentatively assigned to the genus Eoglaucidium. The monophyly of the four genera Eoglaucidium, Sandcoleus, Eobucco and Anneavis is define & Masillacolius brevidactylus n. g., n. sp. is the earliest record of the Coliidae known so far. It was not possible to assign the fourth species of coliiform bird (which is described elsewhere) to one of the two families with certainty. The resemblances that exist between the Reeent mousebirds and the "higher " non-passeriform and the passeriform birds respectively, most likely are due to convergenee...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{evolution}} of birds began about 150 years ago with the finding of Archaeopteryx. Yet, many unsolved questions about avian evolution remain to be answered. This thesis aims at addressing some of these questions. The Early Cretaceous Confusiusornis is the most well-represented Mesozoic bird in the fossil record. The abundance of fossils facilitates a {{study of the}} preservation of specimens in the two geological formations in which this taxon is found. It was demonstrated that specimens in the Yixiang Formation always are represented by complete, articulated skeletons, while those in the Jiofutang Formation often lack the pectoral girdle and the wings. Despite the many specimens available of Confusiusornis few clues to the diet of this taxon have been found. We describe a Confusiusornis specimen with a pellet of fish remains preserved in the throat region. The enantiornithid birds probably constituted the most species-rich and diverse bird group during the Cretaceous. Several well-preserved specimens have been found in China, e. g. Grabauornis lingyuanensis described herein. The mass extinction {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous probably gave the only surviving group of birds,Neornithes,chance to radiate and evolve into new niches. One such group is the <b>Strigiformes</b> (<b>owls).</b> We describe a new species from the Eocene Green River Formation in USAthat we suggest is closely related to the contemporary European Prosybris antique and P. medius. Although birds are known from several Miocene localities in Europe, the discovery of vertebrate fossils in the Hambach opencast lignite mine was thus unexpected and remarkable. The most significant bird found in Hambach is a specimen of darter, genus Anhinga. It agrees in size, proportions and morphology the fossil species Anhinga pannonica to which we refer the Hambach specimen. Fossils of ducks and galliforms have also been found in deposits at Hambach dated to the Pliocene. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 1 : Submitted. Paper 4 : Submitted. </p...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIV) are {{prevalent in}} birds, several mammals and in humans. Low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) of subtypes H 5 and H 7 can become highly pathogenic {{due to the}} high frequency of mutation. Certain virus strains have zoonotic potential. Infections with highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) of subtype H 5 N 1 have caused hundreds of cases of illness and deaths in humans in recent years. LPAIV are widely distributed among wild birds, especially wild waterfowl. However, since {{the emergence of the}} HPAIV subtype H 5 N 1 in the year 2005, numerous infections have occurred in wild birds, with different susceptibility of certain species. Although the role of wild birds in HPAIV is still controversial, this host reservoir poses a risk for AIV infections to occur among commercial poultry which then results in extensive epizootic disease control activities and enormous economic consequences. Besides HPAIV infections, it is also mandatory to control LPAIV infections of subtypes H 5 and H 7 throughout Europe. To acquire data for risk assessment, first voluntary and later obligatory specifications for monitoring the prevalence of AIV in wild birds were developed. According to refined risk assessment certain species, especially of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriformes, were preferentially included in the monitoring program. Through implementation of these specifications wild bird monitoring was performed in the federal state of Brandenburg. This work evaluates the resulting data from the period of 2006 to 2010. In total, 8. 290 wild birds of 139 domestic species and 43 families have been examined for AIV by testing organs from bird remains, pharyngeal or cloacae swabs as well as excrement. The largest fraction of the investigated species were geese and ducks (Anseriformes) forming 35 % of total. 21 birds, predominantly swans, tested positive for HPAIV subtype H 5 N 1 infection with the “Asia” strain in combination with Europe-wide outbreaks of the virus in wild birds during spring-time 2006. Subsequently, there was no further evidence for HPAIV infection in the federal state of Brandenburg. During the period of five years (2006 - 2010) 90 cases of LPAIV have been diagnosed, among them the subtypes H 5 and H 7. The species with the highest prevalence was Mallard followed by Eurasian Coot. Orders with LPAIV infections have been Anseriformes, Podicipediformes (Grebes), Gruiformes (cranes and relatives), Accipitriformes (raptors) und <b>Strigiformes</b> (<b>owls).</b> Significant differences in the distribution pattern of LPAIV have been detected within individual years and between different years, as well as differences in geographic distribution. Numbers of AIV infections showed a peak in late summer to early winter, especially in the Ramsar Site Peitzer Teiche located in the administrative district Spree-Neiße. The wild bird monitoring was completed by the investigation of Mallards (Anas plathyrhynchos) which were kept in a facility at the Lake Felchowsee in the administrative district Uckermark. These sentinel animals lived in a permanent contact with the local wild birds for the period of October 2008 to October 2010. A sampling of the sentinels was performed every two weeks by taking swabs for AIV detection and every four weeks with blood tests for AIV antibody detection. Compared to the comprehensive wild bird monitoring, the detection rate among the sentinels was significantly higher and several subtypes were detected. AIV antibodies were found in the Mallards two weeks after beginning testing with a positive serological response lasting from two weeks to several months. However, the subtype specificity of the antibodies (H 7) could only be determined for a single animal by hemagglutination inhibition reaction. From the wild bird monitoring an overview of the AIV prevalence in the federal state of Brandenburg could be achieved. However, for some species the number of investigated animals was not sufficient to confirm AIV infection’s significance in certain months and areas. Examination of data clearly shows that sampling of carcasses (passive monitoring) is superior to sampling of live animals (active monitoring) in confirmation of HPAIV infection in wild birds. However, active monitoring seems to be more suitable for the detection of LPAIV. Focusing on certain species (Mallard, Eurasian Coot), certain areas (wetlands, especially Lakes Peitzer Teiche and Lakes Havelseen), certain months (September, October and January to March) and a certain sampling specification (hunted Mallards) could increase efficiency of surveillance. Sentinel facilities seem to provide a cost-efficient alternative to conventional monitoring in order to provide data, including serology, to follow the course of AIV infections over long time periods in a particular ecosystem...|$|E
25|$|Some known predators of the rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum are the Dingo (Canis lupus dingo), the Oenpelli Python (Morelia oenpelliensis), the Olive Python (Liasis olivaceous), quolls (Dasyurus spp.), <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigiformes),</b> feral cats (Felis catus), domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) {{and humans}} (Homo sapiens). The rock-haunting ringtail possum spends {{a large amount}} of time participating in sentinel behaviour to avoid predators. It perches on branches or ledges and scans the area for danger. In an attempt to deter predators and to warn others, this possum beats its tail against tree branches vigorously causing the entire tree to shake.|$|R

50|$|The {{systematic}} {{placement of}} owls is disputed. For example, the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy finds that, based on DNA-DNA hybridization, owls are {{more closely related}} to the nightjars and their allies (Caprimulgiformes) than to the diurnal predators in the order Falconiformes; consequently, the Caprimulgiformes are placed in the <b>Strigiformes,</b> and the <b>owls</b> in general become a family, the Strigidae. A recent study indicates that the drastic rearrangement of the genome of the accipitrids may have obscured any close relationship of theirs with groups such as the owls.In any case, the relationships of the Caprimulgiformes, the owls, the falcons, and the accipitrid raptors are not resolved to satisfaction; currently, a trend to consider each group (with the possible exception of the accipitrids) as a distinct order is increasing.|$|R
40|$|So far, the {{identity}} of Cyathostoma (Hovorkonema) nematodes collected from respiratory tracts of birds of prey (Accipitriformes, Falconiformes) and <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigiformes)</b> in Europe and North America is extremely inconsistent. Our results, based on analyses of ITS- 2 sequences suggest that the Cyathostoma (Hovorkonema) nematodes found in the birds of prey and owls from Central Europe and North America probably {{belong to the same}} species, C. (Hovorkonema) americana Chapin, 1925. We are convinced, that described in recent literature high ITS- 2 divergence among C. (Hovorkonema) nematodes collected from Europe, has occurred as a result of invalid synonimisation of some C. (Hovorkonema) species. In our opinion C. (Hovorkonema) americana (typically parasites of tracheae and air sacs of raptors) and C. (Hovorkonema) variegatum (Creplin, 1849) (typically parasites of tracheae of cranes and storks) are valid molecular and morphologically distinct species...|$|R
5000|$|The hairy-eared dwarf lemur {{is likely}} to be {{critically}} endangered and the population is estimated anywhere from 100-1000 individuals. In 2008, the species was ranked as [...] "data deficient" [...] by the IUCN Red List, but is now classified as [...] "vulnerable" [...] according to the 2012 IUCN Red List. Research has shown that the distribution of this lemur is patchy, restrictive and they all live in a single location in specific parts of Madagascar, but the species may be more widely distributed than previously thought. All of the species that have been located in eastern Madagascar were found at the edge of primary highland rain forest at elevations anywhere from 680 to 1235 meters and all of the species located in northeast Madagascar were located in primary lowland rain forests.

40|$|The {{fossiliferous}} Upper Varswater Formation at Langebaanweg (South Africa) produced {{remains of}} at least five species of <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigiformes).</b> Tyto richae sp. nov. is the first palaeospecies of Tytonidae described from an African fossil site, though indeterminate remains referable to the genus Tyto are known from the Middle Miocene of Morocco, the early Pliocene of Ethiopia, and the Pliocene of Tanzania. Athene inexpectata sp. nov. {{is not only the}} earliest documented fossil evidence for the genus worldwide, but also the first record of a species of Athene in Africa south of the Sahara. Proportions of its hind limb indicate that At. inexpectata sp. nov. probably has been as terrestrial as its modern relative At. cunicularia. A few additional remains represent the earliest fossil evidence for the genera Asio and Bubo on the African continent, though the poor preservation of these bones prevents more detailed identifications. A distal tibiotarsus of a small owl about the size of At. inexpectata sp. nov. indicates the presence of a fifth, as yet indeterminate, species of owl at Langebaanweg. Biogeographical and palaeoecological implications of this assemblage of owls are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bird species show a {{high degree}} of {{variation}} in the composition of their preen gland waxes. For instance, galliform birds like chicken contain fatty acid esters of 2, 3 -alkanediols, while Anseriformes like goose or <b>Strigiformes</b> like barn <b>owl</b> contain wax monoesters in their preen gland secretions. The final biosynthetic step is catalyzed by wax synthases (WS) which have been identified in pro- and eukaryotic organisms. Results Sequence similarities enabled us to identify six cDNAs encoding putative wax synthesizing proteins in chicken and two from barn owl and goose. Expression studies in yeast under in vivo and in vitro conditions showed that three proteins from chicken performed WS activity while a sequence from chicken, goose and barn owl encoded a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both wax ester and triacylglycerol synthesis. Mono- and bifunctional WS were found to differ in their substrate specificities especially with regard to branched-chain alcohols and acyl-CoA thioesters. According to the expression patterns of their transcripts and the properties of the enzymes, avian WS proteins might not be confined to preen glands. Conclusions We provide direct evidence that avian preen glands possess both monofunctional and bifunctional WS proteins which have different expression patterns and WS activities with different substrate specificities. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Owls</b> (<b>Strigiformes)</b> are {{particularly}} difficult {{to study and}} the existing information is still scarce. In PNPG area there are records of the seven species present in Portugal; the Long-eared Owl and the Short-eared Owl are here occasional species. This work aims to determine the distribution, density and abundance of Strigiformes in PNPG (Northwest of Portugal). Between December 2007 and June 2008, 106 passive hearing point counts of 15 minutes each were done in the centre of each of 106 squares (2 x 2 km). Distribution maps for each species were obtained. Therefore, we recorded a total of 98 contacts for Tawny Owl and 67 contacts for Scops Owl. We also obtained 7 contacts of Little Owl, 2 contacts of Barn Owl and one of Eagle Owl. The habitat selection by Scops Owl and Tawny Owl was also studied. Scops Owls seems to avoid low shrub and preferred forested areas. Tawny Owls also avoid low shrub areas, preferring forested areas, and were found in urban areas. The populations of these two species in PNPG show a considerable expansion, while the other ones reveal a marked decline regarding the previous situation. The implementation of monitoring and conservation measures is suggested to stop the decline of these three species...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{artificial}} nest boxes {{has led to}} significant progress in bird conservation and {{in our understanding of}} the functional and evolutionary ecology of free-ranging birds that exploit cavities for roosting and reproduction. Nest boxes and their improved accessibility have made it easier to perform comparative and experimental field investigations. However, concerns about the generality and applicability of scientific studies involving birds breeding in nest boxes have been raised because the occupants of boxes may differ from conspecifics occupying other nest sites. Here, we review the existing evidence demonstrating the importance of nest box design to individual life-history traits in three falcon (Falconiformes) and seven <b>owl</b> (<b>Strigiformes)</b> species, as well as the extent to which publications on these birds describe the characteristics of exploited artificial nest boxes in their "Methods" sections. More than 60 % of recent publications did not provide any details on nest box design (e. g. size, shape, material), despite several calls > 15 years ago to increase the reporting of such information. We exemplify and discuss how variation in nest box characteristics can affect or confound conclusions from nest box studies and conclude that it is of overall importance to present details of nest box characteristics in scientific publications...|$|R
40|$|In {{literature}} it {{is established}} that the iris musculature consists of striate muscle fibers in birds while in mammals it consists of smooth muscles. Some authors report the presence of smooth muscle tissue also in the iris of some species of birds. In the present study {{we report on the}} iris muscle tissues (type of tissue, direction and mean diameter of muscle fibers or cells) in five species of Accipitriformes (diurnal raptors) and four species of Strigiformes (nocturnal raptors) because they show different way of life depending of their predatory behavior. This morphological study was carried out from raptors died or euthanized at the Wild Life Rescue Centre of Sea and Water birds in Livorno (Italy). From histological examination of iris serial radial sections we find both striated and smooth musculature even if with marked differences among analyzed species, not directly correlated with diurnal or nocturnal lifestyle. Striated fibers are always present, mainly with cross direction, throughout the iris stroma, while the histological differences concern the smooth cells. Indeed, harrier and sparrow hawk (Accipitriformes) and great horned owl and little <b>owl</b> (<b>Strigiformes)</b> show a compact layer of cross smooth muscle cells throughout the iris stroma. In the other species analyzed smooth muscle cells are slightly detectable as scattered or not detectable. Since the cross smooth muscle tissue allows to maintain a myotic state for extended periods of time, our results might be correlated more to the predatory behavior than the taxonomic order...|$|R
40|$|Located {{in southwestern}} Transylvania, Romania, the {{uppermost}} Cretaceous continental deposits of the Hat¸eg Basin are widely {{known for their}} well-preserved and diverse vertebrate fauna (e. g., Bojar et al., 2010; Grigorescu, 2010). Since {{the end of the}} 19 th century, investigations of the fossiliferous continental deposits within the Hat¸eg Basin have revealed a wide range of preservation modes and taxa, including a large variety of small non-avian theropods (Weishampel and Jianu, 1996; Csiki and Grigorescu, 1998; Codrea et al., 2002; O? si and Fo? zy, 2007), several sites with dinosaur egg clutches and hatchlings (Grigorescu et al., 1990; Grigorescu, 1993; Weishampel et al., 1993; Codrea et al., 2002), a large pterosaur (Buffetaut et al., 2002), mammals (Grigorescu and Hahn, 1987; Csiki and Grigorescu, 2000; Codrea et al., 2002), and numerous other vertebrates (Folie and Codrea, 2005; Martin et al., 2006). It is thus surprising that bird remains have proved extremely rare within the Hat¸eg fauna. So far, only inconclusive records have been reported: Andrews (1913) first referred the proximal end of a femur and two distal tibiotarsi to Elopteryx nopcsai, a supposed pelecaniform bird. These tibiotarsi were later redescribed by Harrison and Walker (1975), who suggested that they belonged to two new taxa of Cretaceous <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigiformes)</b> —Bradycneme draculae and Heptasteornis andrewsi. However, the affinities of these bones have been much disputed and they are now generally regarded as belonging to non-avian theropods (Brodkorb, 1978; Elzanowski, 1983; Olson, 1985; Naish and Dyke, 2004; Kessler et al., 2005). Here, we present the first unequivocal evidence for a fossil bird in the Maastrichtian of the Hat¸eg Basin, a partial left tibiotarsus from the ‘middle member’ of the Densus¸-Ciula Formation (Fig. 1). The Maastrichtian age of these continental deposits is rather poorly constrained, as they overlie uppermost Campanian marine deposits (Melinte-Dobrinescu, 2010) and have yielded palynological assemblages indicative of a latest Cretaceous age (Antonescu et al., 1983; Csiki et al., 2008). The specimen (FGGUB [Faculty of Geology and Geophysics, University of Bucharest] R. 1902) was discovered in the rich microvertebrate bonebed at Fˆantˆ anele, nearV? alioara (seeGrigorescu et al., 1999), in the northwestern part of the Hat¸eg Basin, preserved in drab, fine-grained deposits suggestive of a poorly drained floodplain environment...|$|R
