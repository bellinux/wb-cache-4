5000|$|In the 2010 book, Sport Bikes, Hans Hetrick {{wrote that}} [...] "throughout the 1970s, the Japanese {{companies}} experimented with {{different types of}} engines and frame designs. Their ideas soon came together in a rock-solid package. This design {{became known as the}} Universal Japanese Motorcycle, or UJM." [...] Subsequently, in the 1980s and 1990s, the Japanese manufacturers diversified their ranges, producing faired <b>sportsbikes,</b> race-replicas, dual-sport bikes and muscle bikes.|$|R
2500|$|Many of the Ducatis Galluzzi {{originally}} styled {{were later}} revised and updated by Pierre Terblanche, including the ST series and the Monster 696 update of 2008. Terblanche later joined Galluzzi at Aprilia, {{where they have}} worked together on several new and revised models for Aprilia subsidiary Moto Guzzi. The two collaborated on the Moto Guzzi V12 series, with Le Mans, Strada, and X variants, displayed at EICMA in 2009. Galluzzi described the challenge he and Terblanche faced revising the Moto Guzzi image by saying, [...] "The Guzzi crowd is extremely conservative, but if we only concentrate on those, {{we are going to}} lose eventually. So these bikes are looking into the future." [...] This is similar to the balance sought with earlier Ducati designs, but, [...] "the advantage Guzzi has versus Ducati is that Ducati makes <b>sportsbikes,</b> Guzzi can do anything it wants because they’ve been doing it a long time and on all sorts of bikes." ...|$|R

Although initially offered only in red, by 1988 it was offered in red, blue and pearl white.

50|$|Hyde joined Triumph {{motorcycles}} as {{an apprentice}} in 1964. Following {{the closure of the}} factory at Meriden in 1973, Norman moved to the Kitts Green site run by Norton Triumph International. When that shut down in 1975 he used his redundancy payment to establish his own business, designing and selling performance parts for Triumph twins and triples. Having passed his mechanical engineering diploma with flying colours in 1968 Norman secured a position in Triumph’s racing development department, working under Doug Hele, the legendary Chief Development Engineer. As a result, Norman was directly involved {{in the development of the}} T120, T140, T150, T160 and T180 twins and triples, as well as projects that never made it into production, like the four-cylinder Quadrent, OHC Triple and 350cc Bandit twin. He and his colleagues also supported the factory’s racers, including Percy Tait. Hyde is particularly proud of the Triumph Trident triple, launched in 1969, which, along with the Honda 750/4, redefined the <b>sportsbike</b> sector of that era.|$|E
5000|$|Product planner Hennes Fischer remembers: [...] "It {{all started}} {{back in the}} {{beginning}} of the nineties, when we wanted to create a bike, which would be ultimate fun on bumpy small roads. Most of us loved touring trips using tiny alpine pass roads. But most bikes at that time either needed full concentration on these small roads or simply could not cope with the constantly changing surface properly. Something in between a big Enduro and a streetbike seemed ideal for this purpose. [...] "The answer was TDM 850 launched in 1992. The bike instantly hit the heart of the French bikers, who were already customizing their Enduros with street tyres and better brakes. In the years to come TDM convinced the motorcyclists all over Europe of its benefits. Yamaha product planners often hear sentences like : [...] "TDM is many bikes in one: a <b>sportsbike</b> on small roads, a tourer on longer trips and a powerful commuter in city traffic." ...|$|E
