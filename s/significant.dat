2500|$|Act 2, Scene 4 {{is perhaps}} the most {{important}} scene in the play in terms of language, as it is in this scene where Richard introduces the notion of what he calls [...] "dumb significants," [...] something that carries resonance throughout the trilogy. During his debate with Somerset, Richard points out to the lords who are unwilling to openly support either of them, [...] "Since you are tongue tied and loath to speak,/In dumb <b>significants</b> proclaim your thoughts."(ll.25–26) The dumb <b>significants</b> he refers to are roses—a red rose to join Somerset, a white rose to join Richard. As such, the roses essentially function as symbols, replacing the very need for language. Once all the lords select their roses, these symbolize the houses they represent. Henry chooses a red rose—totally unaware of the implications of his actions, as he does not understand the power the “dumb significants” have.|$|R
