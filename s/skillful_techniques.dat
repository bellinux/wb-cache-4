40|$|Background: The use of {{percutaneous}} vertebroplasty (PV) {{to treat}} osteoporotic vertebral fractures is increasing. This investigation assesses the efficacy {{and safety of}} PV for refractory pain owing to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Methods: A retrospective investigation of PV was conducted with a minimal of 1 year follow up. PV with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was performed on 75 patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that responded poorly to the conservative therapy. Patients were asked to quantify their degree of pain using Huskisson’s visual analogue scale to assess the clinical results. Results: Eighty-seven vertebrae treated using PV in 70 patients were evaluated with a minimal of 1 year follow up. Pain, as assessed on the VAS, decreased from 80 Ų 16 mm before PV to 36 Ų 28 mm at 1 month after PV and 30 Ų 19 mm at the most recent follow up. The reduction in pain from the baseline to 1 month (p = 0. 031) and to final follow up (p = 0. 023) were both statistically significant. Sixty-two patients (85. 5 %) quickly returned to their pre-injury activity level and achieved better quality of life. Conclusions: PV is effective in pain reduction for painful vertebral compression fractures.

40|$|AbstractBecause of the {{potential}} roles of the primo vascular system (PVS) in cancer metastasis, immune function, and regeneration, understanding the molecular biology of the PVS is desirable. The current state of PVS research is {{comparable to that of}} lymph research prior to the advent of Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE- 1). There is very little knowledge of the molecular biology of the PVS due to difficulties in identifying and isolating primo endothelial cells. Present investigations rely on the morphology and the use of differential staining procedures to identify the PVS within tissues, making detailed molecular studies all but impossible. To overcome such difficulties, one may emulate the explosive development of lymph molecular biology. For this purpose, {{there is a need for}} a reliable method to obtain PVS specimens to initiate the molecular investigation. One of the most reliable methods is to detect the primo vessels and primo nodes afloat in the lymph flow. The protocols for observation of the PVS in the large lymph ducts in the abdominal cavity and the thoracic cavity were reported earlier. These methods require a laparectomy and <b>skillful</b> <b>techniques.</b> In this work, we present a protocol to identify and harvest PVS specimens from the lymph ducts connecting the inguinal and the axillary nodes, which are located entirely in the skin.

Therefore, {{it is very important}} to reduce the stress on the bone. In this study, the SI disseminated the stress more effectively than the CI. During implant treatment, surgeons encounter various situations restricting the implant. Especially when the alveolar bone is resorbed severely, only short implants can be used. However, because short implants are not very good at bearing occlusal force, wider implants are used. When wide and short implants are used, the remaining bone around the implant is reduced, and also, the crown implant ratio is increased, and longer leverage of superstructure can play a role in causing implant failure (fracture of implants, screw loosening or screw fracture, resorption of alveolar bone around the implant, etc.). To resolve such unfavorable conditions, the GBR technique is usually used for lateral and vertical bone augmentation.

40|$|A simple, fully automated, and {{efficient}} method {{to determine the}} structural properties and evolution (tracking) of cloud shields of convective systems (CS) is described. The method, {{which is based on}} the maximum spatial correlation tracking technique (MASCOTTE), is a new alternative to the existent techniques available for studies that monitor the evolution of CS using satellite images. MASCOTTE provides as CS structural properties the following parameters: mean and variance of brightness temperature, horizontal area, perimeter, minimum bright-ness temperature, fractional convective area, center of gravity, and fragmentation. The fragmentation parameter has the potential to monitor the evolution of the CS. A new way of estimating the orientation and eccentricity of CS is proposed and is based on the empirical orthogonal function analysis of CS pixel coordinates. The method includes an accurate detection of splitting and merging of convective systems, which is a critical step in the automated satellite CS life cycle determination. Based on the magnitudes of the spatial correlation between consecutive satellite images and the changes in horizontal areas of CS, MASCOTTE provides a simple and <b>skillful</b> <b>technique</b> to track the evolution of CS life cycles.

Surgery was performed. Well-circumscribed adhesion to cranial nerves, the cerebellum, or the brain stem was noted during surgery. The lesion was totally resected. Pathological examination suggested the lesion to be a CM. At 1 -year follow-up, the symptoms at presentation had resolved and no complications had occurred. Conclusion Although cystic CMs of the CPA have no established imaging features, a diagnosis of CMs may be suspected when a cystic lesion {{is present in the}} CPA and does not involve internal acoustic meatus or dura mater of the skull base. <b>Skillful</b> microsurgical <b>techniques</b> and monitoring of cranial nerves will secure good outcomes for patients with cystic CMs in the CPA. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Detecting {{the origin}} of a {{stepping}} stone attack has been difficult, due {{to the use of}} <b>skillful</b> evasion <b>techniques,</b> such as encrypting attack traffic, introducing random delays or jitter at the stepping stones, etc. Timing-based active watermarking schemes, which embed a watermark by manipulating packet timing, are designed to resist such evasion techniques. However, previously-described schemes that use a fixed watermark require a high degree of redundancy (i. e., many packets) in order to survive the distortion introduced by large amounts of jitter. In this paper, we propose an adaptive watermarking scheme which requires fewer packets to embed, and which is more tolerant of the distortions of deliberate timing jitter. In essence, the watermark is adapted to the timing characteristics of the traffic being traced. There are two versions of the proposed scheme: to control the adaptation of the watermark, one of them uses measured traffic timing while the other uses measured packet sizes. Each version has been evaluated using real SSH traffic. The results demonstrate that an adaptive watermark can survive two to three times more timing jitter than any previous watermarking method using the same amount of traffic, or that it uses half as many packets with similar survivability. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{descriptive}} {{case study}} examined the nature of talk a literacy coach used during coaching conversations to guide collaborative inquiry to support teachers' needs. The study provided a rich description {{of the type of}} talk used in the coach's conversations with three kindergarten classroom teachers by analyzing the content of conversation, levels of support provided by the coach to scaffold teacher understanding about instructional practices, and the types of questions posed by the coach to prompt teacher thinking about instructional practices. Analysis of data revealed that the literacy coach was intentional in the approaches she used to differentiate her conversations with teachers. Moreover, the coach exemplified the characteristics that enabled her to hold effective coaching conversations: content knowledge, effective listening abilities, and <b>skillful</b> questioning <b>techniques.</b> Specific factors that influenced the nature of the coaching conversations included the relationships between the coach and teachers, teachers' experiences and their knowledge of literacy instruction and assessment, and the teachers' willingness to be coached. Analysis showed that both the content and scaffolding support differed in the coaching conversations between the literacy coach and teachers. Furthermore, student data provided the basis for the job-embedded professional development or coaching. It served as the impetus for the conversations held between the coach and teachers...|$|R
