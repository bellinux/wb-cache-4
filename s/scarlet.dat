5|$|The regular puppet cast of Captain <b>Scarlet</b> was {{the largest}} of all the Anderson Supermarionation series. While earlier {{productions}} had emphasised the benefits of futuristic technology, for Captain <b>Scarlet</b> {{it was decided to}} develop and deepen the cast of characters. Further to the enhanced realism of the puppet design, voice roles for Captain <b>Scarlet</b> were, as opposed to Thunderbirds and other predecessors, also intended to be less caricatured. Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn note that, between Thunderbirds and Captain <b>Scarlet,</b> a proliferation of English-accented voices altered the sound of the Supermarionation production and its impression on the viewer.|$|E
5|$|Captain <b>Scarlet</b> also {{formed the}} basis of three comic strips drawn for the weekly children's comic, TV Century 21. Spanning 17 issues (numbers 141–157) from September 1967 to January 1968, the strip adventures were written by Angus P. Allan with artwork by Ron Embleton, and were titled We Will Destroy Unity City, We Will Destroy the Observatory Network and We Shall Make Earth a Planet of Silence. Following the end of the TV series, the comic {{continued}} the story of the Captain <b>Scarlet</b> universe, with later strips revealing that the Mysterons deactivate their Martian complex and relinquish their control over Captain Black, while <b>Scarlet</b> himself leaves Spectrum to make use of his powers in the fight against Earth-bound criminals and threats. The Mysterons ultimately re-awaken, prompting <b>Scarlet</b> and Spectrum to resume their struggle. Keith Watson also worked on these comic book adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Captain <b>Scarlet</b> becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain <b>Scarlet</b> is {{killed in a car accident}} engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain <b>Scarlet</b> duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain <b>Scarlet</b> fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain <b>Scarlet</b> repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he will recover to face the Mysterons again.|$|E

5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea, {{commonly}} known as the <b>scarlet</b> elf cup, <b>scarlet</b> elf cap, or the <b>scarlet</b> cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcoscyphaceae of the order Pezizales. The fungus, widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, has been found in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Australia. The type species of the genus Sarcoscypha, S.coccinea has been known by many names since its first appearance in the scientific literature in 1772. Phylogenetic analysis shows the species to be most closely related to other Sarcoscypha species that contain numerous small oil droplets in their spores, such as the North Atlantic island species S.macaronesica. Due to similar physical appearances and sometimes overlapping distributions, S.coccinea has often been confused with S.occidentalis, S.austriaca, and S.dudleyi.|$|E

5|$|The Supermarionation puppets {{featured}} in Joe 90 {{are of the}} more accurately proportioned kind introduced for Captain <b>Scarlet,</b> and which would {{also be used for}} the Andersons' final puppet series, The Secret Service. Simultaneously, the drive for enhanced realism across all major design aspects which started with the preceding series continued for Joe 90. Main character puppets from Captain <b>Scarlet</b> were re-used for Joe 90 with the exceptions of the Captain <b>Scarlet</b> and Captain Blue marionettes. Few new puppets were constructed, the only notable exceptions being Professor McClaine (sculpted by Mary Turner), Joe (sculpted by Tim Cooksey), and Mrs Harris.|$|E
5|$|The colour {{alone is}} not a {{reliable}} guide to determine the species, as some <b>scarlet</b> robins (P.boodang) take on an orange hue, but while male <b>scarlet</b> and red-capped robins (P.goodenovii) have red breasts and black throats, the flame robin's breast plumage extends {{right up to the}} base of the bill. It is also a little slimmer and has a smaller head than the <b>scarlet</b> robin, and is clearly larger than the red-capped. Females of the respective species are harder to tell apart. Those of red-capped, rose and pink robins are all smaller, with wing lengths less than , smaller than the smallest flame robin. The female <b>scarlet</b> robin has a more pronounced red flush to the breast and the spot on the crown above the bill is more prominent and white rather than off-white.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} very similar to A.barbiger. There are obvious {{differences}} in typical leaf shape, with leaves of most populations of A.barbiger being very much longer and narrower than those of A.obovatus. However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of A.barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A.obovatus. The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb, which is rounded in A.obovatus and pointed in A.barbiger; the bracts, glabrous versus hirsute; and the style-ends, which are green and <b>scarlet</b> respectively. The species also differ slightly in range of flower colours: A.barbiger has <b>scarlet</b> to bright red flowers, whereas A.obovatus flowers are <b>scarlet</b> to orange.|$|E
5|$|A manga {{adaptation}} of the series, titled Captain <b>Scarlet,</b> ran in the Japanese Shōnen Book anthology from January to August 1968. Century 21 published annuals based on the series between 1967 and 1969, while the original Captain <b>Scarlet</b> comic strips were reprinted in the 1968 and 1969 editions of TV21 Annual. Further annuals, published in 1993 and 1994 by Grandreams, coincided with the BBC2 repeats of the TV episodes. In 2002, Carlton Books released a new edition to accompany the digitally remastered broadcasts that had started in 2001.|$|E
