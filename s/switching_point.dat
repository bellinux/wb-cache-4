40|$|The Karnik-Mendel {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} compute the centroid of interval type- 2 fuzzy sets, determining the <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> needed for the lower and upper bounds of the centroid, through an iterative process. It is commonly acknowledged {{that there is no}} closed-form solution for determining such <b>switch</b> <b>points.</b> Many enhanced algorithms have been proposed to improve the computational efficiency of the Karnik-Mendel algorithm. However, all of these algorithms are still based on iterative procedures. In this paper, a direct approach based on derivatives for determining the <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> without multiple iterations has been proposed, together with mathematical proof that these <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> are correctly determining the lower and upper bounds of the centroid. Experimental simulations show that the direct approach obtains the same <b>switch</b> <b>points,</b> but is more computationally efficient than any of the existing (iterative) algorithms. Thus, we propose that this algorithm should be used in any application of interval type- 2 fuzzy sets in which the centroid is required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Adaptive {{switching}} between multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission schemes like {{diversity and}} spatial multiplexing yields significantly higher capacity gains over fixed transmission schemes. Previous work {{has shown the}} impact of channel correlation and SNR on the switching between different schemes like beamforming and spatial multiplexing. This paper explores the influence of antenna geometry on the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> between these transmission schemes. Closed-form expressions for the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> for a two element uniform linear array (ULA) {{as a function of}} antenna geometry and channel statistics are derived. The impact of the channel parameters and antenna geometry on the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> is also shown by simulations. The paper is concluded with a discussion on the impact of varying antenna array configurations on the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> between beamforming and spatial multiplexing. I...|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the path}} {{followed}} by the video and Hi-Fi audio heads being striped and discontinuous—unlike that of the linear audio track—head-switching is required to provide a continuous audio signal. While the video signal can easily hide the head-switching point in the invisible vertical retrace section of the signal, so that the exact <b>switching</b> <b>point</b> is not very important, the same is obviously not possible with a continuous audio signal that has no inaudible sections. Hi-Fi audio is thus dependent on a much more exact alignment of the head <b>switching</b> <b>point</b> than is required for non-HiFi VHS machines. Misalignments may lead to imperfect joining of the signal, resulting in low-pitched buzzing. The problem is known as [...] "head chatter", and tends to increase as the audio heads wear down.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that computer users placed in a deferrable multitasking situation generally postpone secondarytask interruptions until points of low mental workload in the primary task. Studies examining this phenomenon have relied on empirical data that explicitly show user <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> in the course of multitask performance. This paper addresses a related question: Can these same <b>switch</b> <b>points,</b> found empirically in a multitasking context, be inferred solely from single-task data? We investigate this question and propose an approach that analyzes a particular behavioral signature in single-task data—outliers in the distributions of time between task actions—to infer multitasking breakpoints.
