50|$|Differently sensitised {{materials}} require different safelights. In traditional black-and-white photographic printing, photographic papers normally {{are handled}} under an amber or red safelight, as such papers typically are sensitive only to {{blue and green}} light. Orthochromatic papers and films are also sensitive to yellow light and must be used only with a deep red safelight, not with an amber one. Panchromatic films and papers, nominally sensitive to the entire spectrum, sometimes have a region of minimum in their range of sensitivity that allows the careful use of safelight confined {{to that part of}} the spectrum. For example, Kodak Panalure panchromatic paper is tolerant of limited exposure to light filtered through a Kodak 13 <b>Safelight</b> <b>Filter.</b> Other panchromatic materials must be handled only in total darkness.|$|E
