For example, if you see a hand in the door, you expect a human behind the door. Therefore, a cognitively motivated shape similarity measure for recognition applications should be based on visual parts. This cognitive assumption leads to two related problems of scale selection and subpart selection.

Gentiva Health Services (2014), much of the Alabama district court’s dismissive language was traceable to the unfavorable facts of the case. 15 The plaintiff, a former account executive for a hospice provider, only pled the first type of ADA liability in her complaint, claiming that she was limited in a major life activity under 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (1)(A). (She did not claim that her former employer regarded her as substantially limited or that she had a record of a limiting impairment under <b>subparts</b> (B) and (<b>C).)</b> Contrary to her claims, however, the plaintiff referred to herself in the deposition as merely “overweight”; she also testified that she exercised regularly and that she did not have any health conditions or limitations {{as a result of her}} obesity.

40|$|This Article {{seeks to}} support that {{position}} with an argument in three parts. Part I describes the conventional historical picture of the period and the major weaknesses of that picture. The received account—which sees a “critical period” of chaos brought {{to an abrupt end}} by the Constitution—is not just a selective rendering of the facts, but also constricting to both historical and legal insights in a variety of areas. By obscuring institutional continuities and interpreting political debates primarily as ideological contests, the conventional view has (1) limited the ability of historians to draw useful connections between related events (like the compromises in the Continental Congress and the ones at the Philadelphia Convention), and (2) wholly blinded constitutional lawyers to the extent of important data that the Confederation period offers for the interpretation of the Constitution. Some of the most familiar parts of the Constitution, including the Supremacy Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Full Faith and Credit Clause, were drawn directly from the Articles of Confederation, while many of the additional textual powers granted to the new government were ones that the old government had been exercising in practice. Yet the resulting interpretive possibilities have been largely ignored, because the conventional account has been unable to accommodate these facts. Part II of the Article illustrates some of the weaknesses of the existing paradigm through a new consideration of the drafting of the Articles of Confederation. Subpart II. A sets forth a brief chronology of the proceedings as the Articles passed through the Continental Congress. Subpart II. B describes the interpretations that prior authors have given to these events and critiques them as inadequate to account for the known facts. <b>Subpart</b> II. <b>C</b> puts forward a new interpretation, supported by a detailed examination of the congressional debates and roll calls on the Articles. This account challenges both those previous writers who have seen the drafting process as the collision of coherent, opposed factional blocs, defined by either ideology or region, and those who have seen it as wholly incoherent. If one examines the debates on an issue-by-issue basis, a repeated pattern appears: the delegates divide initially {{on the basis of the}} interests of their states, and then unite, on the basis of shared ideological premises and the practical need for consensus, to reach pragmatically acceptable compromises. The modest conclusion, set forth in Part III, is that the more accurately we recapture the full texture of the circumstances under which the Constitution was written, the better we will be able to understand it...|$|R
40|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency`s (EPA) {{proposed}} rule {{to certify}} that the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) meets {{compliance with the}} long-term radiation protection standards for geologic repositories (40 CFR 191 <b>Subparts</b> B and <b>C),</b> {{is one of the}} most significant milestones to date for the WIPP project in particular, and for the nuclear waste issue in general. The Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG) has provided an independent technical oversight for the WIPP project since 1978, and is responsible for many improvements in the location, design, and testing of various aspects of the project, including participation in the development of the EPA standards since the early 1980 s. The EEG reviewed the development of documentation for assessing the WIPP`s compliance by the Sandia National Laboratories following the 1985 promulgation by EPA, and provided many written and verbal comments on various aspects of this effort, culminating in the overall review of the 1992 performance assessment. For the US Department of Energy`s (DOE) compliance certification application (CCA), the EEG provided detailed comments on the draft CCA in March, 1996, and additional comments through unpublished letters in 1997 (included as Appendices 8. 1 and 8. 2 in this report). Since the October 30, 1997, publication of the EPA`s proposed rule to certify WIPP, the EEG gave presentations on important issues to the EPA on December 10, 1997, and sent a December 31, 1997 letter with attachments to clarify those issues (Appendix 8. 3). The EEG has raised a number of questions that may have an impact on compliance. In spite of the best efforts by the EEG, the EPA reaction to reviews and suggestions has been slow and apparently driven by legal considerations. This report discusses in detail the questions that have been raised about containment requirements. Also discussed are assurance requirements, groundwater protection, individual protection, and an evaluation of EPA`s responses to EEG`s comments...|$|R
40|$|Workers {{are at risk}} {{of death}} from cave-ins during {{trenching}} and excavation activities. NIOSH recommends engineering controls, protective equipment, and safe work practices to minimize hazards for workers. Workers who dig or excavate trenches {{are at risk of}} death if they enter an unprotected trench and the walls collapse. However, hazards associated with trench work and excavation are well defined and preventable. The OSHA standard for excavation and trenching, known as 29 CFR* 1926 Subpart P, describes the precautions needed for safe excavation work. There is no reliable warning when a trench fails. The walls can collapse suddenly, and workers will not have time {{to move out of the}} way. Even though small amounts of dirt may not seem treacherous, a single cubic yard of dirt can weigh more than 3, 000 pounds, which can fatally crush or suffocate workers [Deatherage et al. 2004]. Even small, solid pieces of dirt can cause serious injuries. From 2000 - 2009, 350 workers died in trenching or excavation cave-ins-an average of 35 fatalities per year [BLS 2010]. Most incidents involve excavation work or 'water, sewer, pipeline, and communications and power-line construction' [CDC 2004]. An analysis of OSHA data from 1997 - 2001 showed that 64 % of fatalities in trenches occurred at depths of less than 10 feet [Arboleda and Abraham 2004]. Lack of a protective system was the leading cause of trench-related fatalities in a review of OSHA inspections [Deatherage et al. 2004]. OSHA requires that all excavations 5 feet deep or greater make use of one of the following protective system options (see Figure 1) : (1) sloping the ground; (2) benching the ground; (3) shoring the trench with supports such as planking or hydraulic jacks, or (4) shielding the trench (using a trench box). Workers should never enter a trench that does not have a protective system in place designed and installed by a competent person. Factors such as type of soil, water content of soil, environmental conditions, proximity to previously backfilled excavations, weight of heavy equipment or tools, and vibrations from machines and motor vehicles can greatly affect soil stability and the hazards that workers face. When the sides of trenches are shored, the type of soil and width and depth of the trench affect how far apart the supports should be spaced. Different OSHA regulations apply to the different types of supports used for shoring. Consult 29 CFR 1926 <b>Subpart</b> P Appendices <b>C</b> and D for more information. Appendix F provides a flow diagram for making decisions. Section V, Chapter 2 of the OSHA Technical Manual provides a guide on recognizing and preventing trenching and shoring hazards.

A labeling age statement on American blended whiskey that contains neutral spirits (per Title 27, Part 5, <b>Subpart</b> <b>C,</b> Section 5.40) ordinarily refers only to the age of the 20% content of the product that is the straight whiskey used within the blend, and the neutral grain spirits used in the blend may not have been aged.

40|$|The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Ethical Considerations for Revisions to DHHS Regulations for Protection of Prisoners Involved in Research {{published}} {{its report}} in 2006. It {{was charged with}} developing an ethical framework {{for the conduct of}} research with prisoners and identifying the safeguards and conditions necessary to ensure that research with prisoners is conducted ethically. The recommendations contained in the IOM report differ from current European regulations in several ways, some being more restrictive and some less so. For example, the IOM report suggests limiting the percentage of prisoners that should be involved in a biomedical study to 50 %, a limit that does not exist in Europe. However, the report does not specifically advise against research without a direct benefit to an individual prisoner: the European regulations are more restrictive than the IOM committee recommendations in this respect. The definition of minimal risk varies, as well as the proposed role of the minimal risk requirement and of the principle of subsidiarity (research that can only be done effectively in prisons). The IOM report proposes a number of thoughtful suggestions, which it would be beneficial to implement everywhere, such as registers of research on prisoners. The European regulations offer pragmatic solutions to several thorny issues. In summary, the IOM committee report represents an admirable effort to tackle the present inconsistencies and deficiencies of federal regulations in the US on research on prisoners (45 CFR 46 <b>Subpart</b> <b>C).</b> Nonetheless, before acting on the recommendations, US regulators might consider revisiting international guidelines such as those published by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) and the Declaration of Helsinki...|$|E
40|$|In 1986, 21 m{sup 3 } of {{transuranic}} (TRU) {{waste was}} inadvertently {{buried in a}} shallow land burial trench at the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site on the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office is considered five options for management of the buried TRU waste. One option is to leave the waste in-place if the disposal can {{meet the requirements of}} Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 191, 'Environmental Radiation Protection Standard for Management and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-Level, and Transuranic Radioactive Wastes'. This paper describes analyses that assess the likelihood that TRU waste in shallow land burial can meet the 40 CFR 191 standards for a geologic repository. The simulated probability of the cumulative release exceeding 1 and 10 times the 40 CFR 191. 13 containment requirements is estimated to be 0. 009 and less than 0. 0001, respectively. The cumulative release is most sensitive to the number of groundwater withdrawal wells drilled through the disposal trench. The mean total effective dose equivalent for a member of the public is estimated to reach a maximum of 0. 014 milliSievert (mSv) at 10, 000 years, or approximately 10 percent of the 0. 15 mSv 40 CFR 191. 15 individual protection requirement. The dose is predominantly from inhalation of short-lived Rn- 222 progeny in air produced by low-level waste disposed in the same trench. The transuranic radionuclide released in greatest amounts, Pu- 239, contributes only 0. 4 percent of the dose. The member of public dose is most sensitive to the U- 234 inventory and the radon emanation coefficient. Reasonable assurance of compliance with the <b>Subpart</b> <b>C</b> groundwater protection standard is provided by site characterization data and hydrologic processes modeling which support a conclusion of no groundwater pathway within 10, 000 years.

40|$|This Comment {{focuses on}} two main issues: {{environmental}} justice 2 ̆ 7 s procedural limitations following Alexander v. Sandoval, and the loopholes within existing environmental legislation as {{they apply to}} military activities. In this respect, Richard Armour 2 ̆ 7 s famous idiom 2 ̆ 2 hindsight is 20 / 202 ̆ 2 is telling. As long as the military has carte blanche to ignore environmental laws, environmental justice will continue to remain a legal mirage beholden to the government 2 ̆ 7 s pecking order of judicial deference. Vague notions of national security and deference to the military wrinkle the fabric of environmental laws that are intended to create safe and healthy communities. Legislators must close loopholes in environmental laws, codify the Order, and explicitly create a private cause of action for disparate-impact plaintiffs so that environmental justice can finally be achieved. Subpart A of the Argument describes existing military exceptions from environmental laws. Of particular concern is the military 2 ̆ 7 s invocation of 2 ̆ 2 national security 2 ̆ 2 {{to opt out of}} environmental laws. Despite congressional intent to limit national security waivers to exceptional and emergency contexts, courts interpret security needs broadly. Subpart A also highlights the concern for environmental justice proponents when faced with national security waivers. Subpart B examines the procedural limitations that environmental justice advocates experience through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Then, <b>Subpart</b> <b>C</b> discusses why super-deference to the military under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) is of particular concern to environmental justice proponents. Subpart D focuses on Alexander v. Sandoval, a Supreme Court case that limited private causes of action for disparate-impact claims. Following Alexander v. Sandoval, there are three ways for communities to fight environmental justice. First, communities facing disproportionate environmental hazards must prove that the government intentionally discriminated against them. Second, claimants may seek redress through Title VI 2 ̆ 7 s administrative review process. However, because intentional discrimination is so difficult to prove and Title VI 2 ̆ 7 s administrative review process rarely results in a finding for the claimants, these options are inadequate. Third, claimants may seek alternatives to the court and administrative systems to combat disparate impacts of environmental hazards facing their communities. Finally, Subpart E discusses these alternatives, which include avoiding 2 ̆ 2 lawyer-centered 2 ̆ 2 models by advocating grassroots activism and community partnerships with the military...|$|E
40|$|The {{law is a}} many splendored thing, but {{one thing}} is clear, that certain kinds of {{contracts}} and rights embodied within contracts can be confusing, especially for attorneys. True to form then, where even lawyers practicing in a particular area of law find something difficult to deal with, or they find that the law itself is unclear or that it has many ways to say the same thing, clarity is a welcome thing. In relation to real estate law in particular and specifically about the law of options and rights embodied within real estate contracts (whether purchase/sale documents or leases), much should be desired {{in the state of the}} United States “body of law” on this topic. Because of the difficulty in deciphering what is actually occurring in live transactions which often spawn years of litigation, the author proposes black-letter clarity on these kinds of clauses, and a uniformity across the United States, in order that the laws affecting the sale or rental of real estate be easier to digest, common in its understanding and application, and uniform in its laws. This Article reviews the many different kinds of rights, options and terms that are commonly used in the U. S., and explores many popular issues that arise out of the use of options and rights, in addition to their impact on other legal concepts in Property Law. Part II provides an introduction into the overall context of the Article and provides insight into the problems attendant to the mixup between rights and options in general. Part III opens up the proverbial Pandora’s Box and identifies and explains the different kinds of rights and options that are used in U. S. real estate transactions commonly within Subpart A. Subpart B identifies concerns over priority in rights and options when two kinds of things are simultaneously announced or exercised by one or more parties or third parties involving real estate. <b>Subpart</b> <b>C</b> discusses the assignability of rights and options and explores the complications that arise when original parties to a real estate contract or lease assign or are the recipients of an assignment and lay a claim to a right or option. Part IV discusses issues in exercising rights and options and Subparts A through C discuss Landlord/Tenant (and vendor/vendee), Tender, Doctrines of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Restraints and Perpetuities, and the issues of contiguous and unrelated parcels. Part V rounds out the discussion with thoughts and reflections on how the law might be shaped through modification of existing frameworks, crafting of a uniform statute governing rights and options, in consideration of the “boots on the ground confusion” that is being displayed in courtrooms across America. While not a comparison of every kind of right vs. option case that ever was, the sum of the parts is intended to provide a jumping off point for a dialogue in the halls of those drafting model and uniform rules, and to spurn more critical examination of the issues that truly affect the parties and their counsel when things are left in a confused state, such as whether we have an option, a right, or merely a question about what is what...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the Study: The {{document}} {{on which}} this thesis is based was created {{under the terms of}} a cooperative agreement between the National Park Service (NPS) and Sonoma State University (SSU) to create a cultural resource appendix to the Fire Management Plan (FMP) of Redwood National and State parks (RNSP). The NPS is currently in the process of updating the RNSP FMP and Environmental Assessment (EA) that was originally prepared in 2004. This plan addresses activities related to fuels management, prescribed burning, and wildland fire suppression. The park's existing 5 year FMP and EA will be expanded to include new fuel treatment areas within the park and will address any new national fire management policies that have been adopted since the original FMP. A confidential cultural resource appendix to the FMP is needed to identify: historic property types found at the park, fire program impacts related to fuels management activities and wildfire suppression, proposed programmatic actions needed to identify historic properties, and how NPS proposes to negate or minimize potential adverse effects to historic properties eligible for or listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The cultural resource appendix {{on which this}} thesis is based will be used as an appendix to the FMP and is also intended to assist NPS to develop a Programmatic Agreement (PA) with the California State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) to stream-line the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Section 106 process under implementing Federal Regulations 36 CFR 800. 14 (Federal Agency Program Alternatives). Federal land managing agencies are required to consider the effects that their proposed actions have on properties listed in, or determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (Le., historic properties), and allow the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) a reasonable opportunity to comment (NHPA, as amended). Agencies are required to consult with Federal, state,local, and tribal governments/organizations and the public to identify historic properties, assess adverse effects to historic properties, and negate, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects to historic properties while engaged in any Federal or federally assisted undertaking (36 CFR Part 800). Federal land managing agencies can streamline this process for undertakings that have the same potential impacts on the same types of historic properties in a programmatic fashion under <b>Subpart</b> <b>C</b> (Program Alternatives) of the implementing NHPA, Section 106 regulations (36 CFR 800. 14). Procedure: An extensive literature review based on fire behavior, the effects of fire on cultural resources, and on fire management practices was conducted and compiled to form the basis for this thesis. After the literature review was completed, a comprehensive guide of information and recommendations for the NPS was written to aide in the avoidance of adverse effects to cultural resources during wildfires, prescribed fires, fuels management, and other fire management activities. Findings: This thesis presents the results and conclusions based on the literature concerning the prehistoric cultural context, the historic-era context of logging and sheep ranching in RNSP, the direct effects of fire on cultural resources from fire and fire management activities, as well as the indirect and operational effects due to the same fire related activities. This report offers recommendations to the NPS for the compliance with federal law and the protection of cultural resources during fire and fire management activities. Finally, this report features three matrices to be used by the NPS in order to aid in the quick assessment to the types of damage and risk for specific cultural materials and resources which can occur during fires in three separate fuel types: 1) grassland, 2) brush, and 3) timbe...|$|E
