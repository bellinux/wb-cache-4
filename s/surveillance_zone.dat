In the past years, only sporadic incursions of certain serotypes of the bluetongue virus were recorded in EU. However, after the adoption of the Directive, and particularly after the introduction into the Union of bluetongue viruses serotypes 1 and 8 in the years 2006 - 2007, the infection has become more widespread in EU, with the potential of becoming endemic in certain areas. The rules of vaccination against bluetongue laid down in Directive 2000 / 75 /EC are based on the experience of the use of so-called “modified live vaccines”, or “live attenuated vaccines” that were the only available vaccines when the Directive was adopted. The use of those vaccines may lead to an undesired local circulation of the vaccine virus, also in unvaccinated animals. In recent years inactivated vaccines against bluetongue, which does not pose a risk for unvaccinated animals, have been introduced. The widespread use of these vaccines, during a vaccination campaign, led to a significant improvement in the disease situation. It‟s now widely accepted that vaccination with inactivated vaccines is the preferred tool for the control of bluetongue and prevention of this clinical disease in EU.

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} pathogen of cloven-hoofed mammals {{and one of the}} biggest concerns for veterinary authorities. The control measures to be applied in case of an outbreak vary in function of the disease-free or disease-enzootic status. Vaccination depends on the prior identification of the involved viral serotype and subtype, it confers an immunity limited to 6 months and it requires between 4 to 7 days to trigger the immune response (i. e. immunity-gap). The use of anti-FMD drugs has been discussed as an alternative or supplementary method to be used in previously FMD-free countries/zones. Such an antiviral treatment could protect against the viral dissemination to fill the gap between vaccination and the rise of a protective immunity. Apart from broad spectrum antiviral agents, such as ribavirin, specific anti-FMDV molecules have been identified in vitro, but none of them has been used in clinical studies involving ruminants or pigs. Next to the anti-FMDV activity, the absence of toxicity and the withdrawal period influencing the food safety, the cost of the treatment would be another important parameter influencing the potential use of an antiviral agent in the control of a FMD outbreak. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the economic impact of using an antiviral in the control of a FMD epizootic in southern Belgium (Walloon Region). This work was based on the results of previous investigations concerning the epidemiological and economic data of a FMD outbreak in Southern Belgium. In the considered scenario, the epizootic was caused by the introduction of an infected cow (during the incubation time) in a beef cattle farm during winter. During the two weeks between the brood cow introduction and the official declaration of the outbreak, animal movements occurred between other beef cattle farms. The economic effects of the epidemic were evaluated taking into account the air-borne transmission of FMDV, the occurrence of animal movements (two scenarios were considered, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 17 movements), the presence of bovine and small ruminant farms, as well as pig farms in the protection and <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> around the initial and secondary outbreaks. The wild fauna was not involved in the epidemic. In order to integrate in the above scenario the application of an antiviral agent in the control of the disease, it was assumed that the efficacy of the anti-FMDV drug was proven by reducing viral excretion in infected animals as well as by preventing the infection in animals at risk. Two hypothetical prices were used to introduce in the model the costs related to the administration of the antiviral drug (5 € and 10 € per dose). Furthermore, different strategies of control could be envisaged, such as the administration of the drug to both domestic ruminants and pigs, or depending on the epidemiological role of these species in the FMD transmission and their density in the territory, the administration of the drug to only one of them. Other scenarios could be characterized by the use of the antiviral in the control of the epizootic within the protection and <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> or in only one of them. The costs associated with the use of antivirals in the different proposed scenarios are compared to the costs and socio-economic losses associated with the FMD outbreak and the implementation of control measures.

Africhol was implemented in enhanced <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones</b> located in the provinces of Sofala (Beira), Zambézia (District Mocuba), and Cabo Delgado (Pemba City). Data were also analyzed from the three outbreak areas that experienced the greatest number of cases during the time period under observation (in the districts of Cuamba, Montepuez, and Nampula). Rectal swabs were collected from suspected cases for identification of Vibrio cholerae, as well as clinical, behavioral, and socio-demographic variables. We analyzed factors associated with confirmed, hospitalized, and fatal cholera using multivariate logistic regression models. A total of 1, 863 suspected cases and 23 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR), 1. 2 %) were reported from October 2011 to December 2015. Among these suspected cases, 52. 2 % were tested of which 23. 5 % were positive for Vibrio cholerae O 1 Ogawa.

40|$|Outbreaks {{of highly}} {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI) can cause large losses for the poultry sector and for animal disease controlling authorities, {{as well as}} risks for animal and human welfare. In the current simulation approach epidemiological and economic models are combined to compare different strategies to control highly pathogenic avian influenza in Dutch poultry flocks. Evaluated control strategies are the minimum EU strategy (i. e., culling of infected flocks, transport regulations, tracing and screening of contact flocks, establishment of protection and <b>surveillance</b> <b>zones),</b> and additional control strategies comprising pre-emptive culling of all susceptible poultry flocks in an area around infected flocks (1. km, 3. km and 10. km) and emergency vaccination of all flocks except broilers around infected flocks (3. km). Simulation {{results indicate that the}} EU strategy is not sufficient to eradicate an epidemic in high density poultry areas. From an epidemiological point of view, this strategy is the least effective, while pre-emptive culling in 10. km radius is the most effective of the studied strategies. But these two strategies incur the highest costs due to long duration (EU strategy) and large-scale culling (pre-emptive culling in 10. km radius). Other analysed pre-emptive culling strategies (i. e., in 1. km and 3. km radius) are more effective than the analysed emergency vaccination strategy (in 3. km radius) in terms of duration and size of the epidemics, despite the assumed optimistic vaccination capacity of 20 farms per day. However, the total costs of these strategies differ only marginally. Extending the capacity for culling substantially reduces the duration, size and costs of the epidemic. This study demonstrates the strength of combining epidemiological and economic model analysis to gain insight in a range of consequences and thus to serve as a decision support tool in the control of HPAI epidemics. </p...|$|R
