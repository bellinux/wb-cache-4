Four types of storage devices are identified:- electro-chemical (batteries) - hydrogen- electro-mechanical (flywheels) - Molten salt heat storage A high speed flywheel {{with a small}} permanent magnet motor/generator has more advantages {{than any of the}} other systems and might become a real competitor to the internal combustion engine. A flywheel/motor/generator system for automobiles becomes now practical, because of the technological advances in materials, bearings and <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>control</b> circuits. The motor of choice is the squirrel cage induction motor, specially designed for automobile applications. Some of the special design considerations are: high speed (up to 16000 rpm), high break-down torque, 83 % coil pitch, stranded stator copper wire, and special cooling arrangements. The preferred controller for the induction motor is a forced commutated cyclo-converter, which transforms a variable voltage/variable frequency source into a controlled variable-voltage/variable-frequency supply. A modulation strategy of the cyclo-converter elements will be selected to maintain a unity input displacement factor (power factor) under all conditions of loads voltages and frequencies.

50|$|Snap action {{thermostats}} are {{the most}} common control used in heavy duty commercial griddles with medium-to-heavy production demands. These controls are called “snap action” because the control mechanism will turn the burner valve or electrical element fully on or completely off, with no modulation or intermediate heat source operation - effectively ‘snapping’ the heat source on or off. While not as responsive as <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>controls,</b> snap action controls can maintain a griddle surface temperature within +/- 15°F (8°C) of set point if the thermostat bulb is embedded assuming a 1-inch (25mm) thick steel plate.

These power converters behave as nonlinear loads to ac supply system and cause harmonic injection, lower power-factor, poor voltage regulation, and utilization of ac network. There is a great need to mitigate these harmonic and reactive current components. Active Power Filters are a viable solution to these problems. In this project work a three-phase shunt active filter is used to eliminate supply current harmonics, correct supply power-factor, and balance the nonlinear/linear loads. A three-phase {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} based current controlled voltage source inverter with a dc bus capacitor is used as an active filter. The firing pulses to the shunt active filter will be generated by using Indirect current control technique. In the indirect control algorithm of the Active filter, the three-phase reference supply currents are obtained using a closed loop PI controller. A Hysterisis PWM current controller is employed over the reference and sensed supply currents to generate gating pulses of IGBT's of the Active filter. But Hysterisis current control having disadvantage like the switching frequency varied during fundamental period, this may be results in increased switching losses and phase angle errors. To overcome problems in the Hysterisis current control, a Ramp-comparator current controller is used.

This is due to the nature of the temperature control mechanism, which consists of a fluid-filled bulb (typically an oil) connected to the thermostat control via a long narrow capillary tube. The fluid in the bulb expands and contracts with temperature, activating a control response from the thermostat. There is a time lag between sensing the temperature change from the surface of the griddle plate to the response of the fluid within the bulb, to the thermostat control and turning the heat source on or off, up or down. This lag is referred to as hysteresis, and is a primary aspect of recovery time - an important griddle performance metric.|$|R

The electron and nuclear spins of dopant atoms implanted in silicon crystals, that already lie at the core of commercial diodes and the photovoltaic industry, are able to store quantum information longer than anything else in the <b>solid</b> <b>state.</b> <b>Controlled</b> manipulations of silicon qubits depend on the ability to tune the nanoscopic donor electron state: we provide a complete theoretical picture that includes, within the insightful and analytic framework of effective mass theory, the effects of the non-trivial silicon conduction band and the different lattice distortions caused by the implantation of the donor species. Calibration of the multi-valley bulk theory to account for binding energies and electron-nuclear hyperfine couplings allows improved estimates of the exchange splittings between two neighbouring donors, that provide the simplest handle for tuning two-qubit operations. Further refinements to our approach lead to exceptional agreement with experimental measurements of Stark effects, where an external electric field is used to enable local single qubit manipulations within global driving fields: we set reliable thresholds on such gating speeds across all group V donors. Finally, we propose a scalable scheme for silicon quantum computing that relies on the coherent transfer of information from Si:Bi donors, that are established as excellent memory qubits, to surface quantum dots that are easier to manipulate, within a topological surface code which enables outstanding tolerance to errors.
