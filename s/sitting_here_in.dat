500|$|In April 1959, Simpson {{left for}} France with £100 savings and two Carlton bikes, one road and one track, given in {{appreciation}} of his help promoting the company. His last words {{to his mother}} before the move were, [...] "I don't want to be <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> twenty years' time, wondering {{what would have happened}} if I hadn't gone to France". The next day, his National Service papers were delivered; although willing to serve before his move, he feared the call-up would put his potential career at risk. His mother returned them, with the hope they would understand this.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 2003 and 2008 elections, {{which both}} {{required}} multiple ballots, {{some in the}} Czech political community expressed dissatisfaction with this method of election. In 2008, Martin Bursík, leader of the Czech Green Party, said of the 2008 vote, [...] "We are <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> front of the public somewhat muddied by backstage horse-trading, poorly concealed meetings with lobbyists and intrigue." [...] There were calls to adopt a system with a direct election, in which the public {{would be involved in}} the voting. However, opponents of this plan pointed out that the presidency had always been determined by indirect vote, going back through several predecessor states to the presidency of Tomáš Masaryk. Charles University political scientist Zdeněk Zbořil suggested that direct voting could result in a president and prime minister who were hostile to each other's goals, leading to deadlock. A system of direct elections was supported by figures including Jiří Čunek (Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party) and Jiří Paroubek (Czech Social Democratic Party), whereas the ruling Civic Democratic Party, under both President Václav Klaus and Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, was more skeptical. Topolánek commented that it was an advantage that [...] "our presidential elections are not preceded by some campaign, that is unavoidable in a direct election and causes rifts among citizens". Using Poland as an unfavourable example, he said that [...] "when someone talks about how our method of selecting the head of state is undignified, he should first weigh the consequences of a direct vote".|$|E
6000|$|... “What {{can we do}} now?” asked Arthur pleadingly. “I {{feel guilty}} to be <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> comfort while my darling may be {{suffering}} privations, or—or—” ...|$|E
60|$|And as we listen, the cry grows fainter and fainter in {{our ears}} {{and we are}} <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> again <b>in</b> the leather chairs of the Mausoleum Club, talking of the little Town in the Sunshine that once we knew.|$|R
6000|$|I apologised for {{the strong}} {{expression}} I had used; then added, [...] "Señora, I am {{a young man}} full of energy and accustomed to take {{a great deal of}} exercise every day, and I am getting very impatient <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> basking <b>in</b> the sunshine, like a turtle on a bank of mud." ...|$|R
6000|$|Robin also gaped {{and stared}} in a {{wondering}} way, {{just as the}} Cobbler would have done in his place. [...] "Alack-a-daisy, me," [...] quoth he. [...] "I know not whether I be <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> or <b>in</b> No-man's-land! What meaneth all this stir i' th' pot, dear good gentlemen? Surely this is a sweet, honest fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going out}} somewhere!" [...] I cried. [...] "Almost {{anything}} {{is better than}} <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> suspense, when {{it may be that}} he has simply fallen into difficulties from which we might extricate him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! my lord," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "pardon your servant. I was <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the cool, as {{you gave}} me leave to do, and the moon was so bright--that--I wished to be see if by it I could read the writing on this scarab." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, monsieur!" [...] {{she said}} in broken English, [...] "it is dreadful to hear all that--and my poor husband still in that awful country. It is terrible {{for me to be}} <b>sitting</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> a theatre, all safe and in peace, whilst he is in such peril." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ho, is it?" [...] ses Henery Walker. [...] "You 'ad {{as much to}} do with it as I 'ad, {{excepting}} {{that you}} was <b>sitting</b> up <b>'ere</b> <b>in</b> comfort while I was doing all the work. It's a wonder to me I got off as well as I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|Both men felt rebuked and {{the group}} again settled into silence. Suddenly, Kate began to laugh, [...] "Isn't it childish? Really, Morton, if our friends could see us <b>sitting</b> around <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the dark, as we are now, they would roar. Why should it all be so silly, Mr. Clarke?" ...|$|R
60|$|She lingered <b>here,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> {{the chair}} {{where he had}} sat and heard. She could not cry, she would not give way, for she wished to think. Therefore she lingered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Knickerbocker," [...] I said earnestly, [...] "Father Knickerbocker, don't {{you know}} that {{something}} is happening, that this very evening as we are <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> all this riot, the President of the United States is to come before Congress on the most solemn mission that ever--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will really}} {{be kind of}} you if you will," [...] he said, [...] "for I shall feel like a {{fish out of water}} <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> solitary state." [...] And as he had drawn {{something}} on account of his prize-money and kept an excellent table, the two officers willingly agreed to the suggestion.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is an {{extraordinary}} thing to ask you, I know," [...] he went on; [...] "but {{it seems as if}} I had known you a long time, and then <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the midst of Nature with the insects singing all about us--well, conventions are not so vital as in drawing rooms. Remember your Browning." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here it {{is a whole}} {{month since}} my last entry. I am <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> decked out <b>in</b> [...] "gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls" [...] for Mrs. Currie's dance. These few minutes, after I emerge {{from the hands of}} my maid and before the {{carriage}} is announced, are almost the only ones I ever have to myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{kiss your}} hands, most illustrious: but I do not sit in an enemy's camp. Ha, my friend Zouch! How has your signoria fared since we fought {{side by side}} at Lepanto? So you too are <b>here,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> council on the hanging of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|She was {{extremely}} unwilling {{to go into}} the prison. As they approached the part of the edifice where she was to be confined, through the court-yard of the Tower, she stopped and sat down upon a stone, perhaps a step, or the curb stone of a walk. The lieutenant urged her to go in out of the cold and wet. [...] "Better <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> than <b>in</b> a worse place," [...] she replied, [...] "for God knoweth whither you are bringing me." [...] However, she rose and went on. She entered the prison, was conducted to her room, and the doors were locked and bolted upon her.|$|R
6000|$|I've been <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> {{my bedroom}} {{writing to you}} ever since, till my candle's almost gone. I keep {{thinking}} what {{the end of it}} is to be; and reproaching myself for doing nothing. And yet, what could I have done? I'm sorry for her--sorrier than I can say. The night is so quiet--I haven't heard a sound; is she asleep, awake, crying, triumphant? ...|$|E
6000|$|After he {{went away}} Berrie turned to her mother with a look in which humor and awe were blent. [...] "Am I dreaming, mother, or am I {{actually}} <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the city? My head is dizzy with it all." [...] Then, {{without waiting for an}} answer, she fervently added: [...] "Isn't he fine! I'm the tenderfoot now. I hope his father won't despise me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Last night I was <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> my room {{at eleven}} o'clock {{writing a letter}} to Shirley. Every one else was in bed, except father, who was out. I heard the {{telephone}} ring and I ran out to the hall to answer it, before it should waken mother. It was long-distance calling, and when I answered it said 'This is the telegraph Company's office in Charlottetown. There is an overseas cable for Dr. Blythe.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, U.S. Senator John Cornyn {{objected to}} John McCain's {{perceived}} intrusion upon a Senate meeting on immigration, saying, [...] "Wait a second <b>here.</b> I've been <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> {{for all of}} these negotiations and you just parachute <b>in</b> <b>here</b> on the last day. You're out of line." [...] McCain, known for his short temper, replied, [...] "Fuck you! I know more about this {{than anyone else in the}} room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn’t like {{to think}} that of Mrs. Driver," [...] said his niece, shaking her head; [...] "but then in these days one never knows what might happen. Never. I’ve given up {{thinking}} about it. However, when I came back, Mrs. Driver was <b>here,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> that very chair you are sitting in now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will make}} a clean breast of it, Arthur. Men can talk <b>here,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the desert, who would be as mute as death at home in England. Yes; {{there was once a}} moment, once one moment, in which I would have married her--a moment in which I flattered myself that I could forget Caroline Waddington. Ah! if I could tell you how Adela behaved!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{opened a}} third and fourth letter, and read. This time he {{approached}} the conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest. But again he stopped short. The truth was that, as may be divined, he had quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe {{at the end of}} this drama by reading out the name, he had come to the house with no other thought. But <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> cold blood he could not do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Must I {{then put}} your {{thoughts}} in words?" [...] said {{this man in}} a clear quick whisper. [...] "Well, so be it; for I weary of <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the dark waiting for water that will not flow. Listen, Prince; you come {{to talk to me}} of the death of a king--is it not so? Nay do not start. Why are you affrighted when you hear upon the lips of another the plot that these many months has been familiar to your breast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{am still}} here--no very mark'd or {{significant}} change or happening--fairly buoyant spirits, &c.--but surely, slowly ebbing. At this moment <b>sitting</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> my den, Mickle street, by the oakwood fire, {{in the same}} big strong old chair with wolf-skin spread over back--bright sun, cold, dry winter day. America continues--is generally busy enough all over her vast demesnes (intestinal agitation I call it,) talking, plodding, making money, every one trying to get on--perhaps to get towards the top--but no special individual signalism--(just as well, I guess.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must think}} it over," [...] {{interrupted}} Mr. Letts, {{with a wave}} of his hand. [...] "Betty is only nineteen, and, as head of the family, I don't think she can marry without my consent. I'm not sure, but I don't think so. Anyway, if she does, I won't have her husband <b>here</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> my chairs, eating off my tables, sleeping in my beds, wearing out my stair-rods, helping himself----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{concert was}} my idea, Father," [...] said Faith, afraid that Mr. Meredith might blame Jerry too much. [...] "You know the Methodists {{themselves}} had a sacred concert in their church three Sunday nights ago. I {{thought it would}} be good fun to get one up in imitation of it. Only they had prayers at theirs, and we left that part out, because we heard that people thought it awful for us to pray in a graveyard. YOU were <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> all the time," [...] she added, [...] "and never said a word to us." ...|$|R
5000|$|I am <b>sitting</b> <b>here.</b> → Am I <b>sitting</b> <b>here?</b> (inversion {{of subject}} I and copula am) ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{very best}} letter I can {{write in the}} half-hour before the [...] {{carriage}} {{will be at the}} door to take me to Mrs. Braddon's [...] dance shall be yours tonight. I am <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the library [...] arrayed in my smartest, newest, whitest, silkiest gown, with a [...] string of pearls which Uncle James gave me today about my [...] throat--the dear, glistening, sheeny things! And I am looking [...] forward to the [...] "dances and delight" [...] of the evening with keen [...] anticipation.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{the time}} comes," [...] Mr. Jarvis said, [...] "don't you go poking about in any foreign islands or places. If only the {{governor}} had left those smelly European cheeses {{to take care}} of themselves, he'd be <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> his chair at this moment, smoking a cigar and handing me out the orders. You and I are, so to speak, in a confidential position now, Chetwode, and I am able to say things to you about which I might have hesitated before. Do you know how much the governor has spent during the last year?" ...|$|E
6000|$|To-day Campbell called, {{and while}} <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> came Merivale [4]. During our colloquy, C. (ignorant that Merivale was the writer) abused the [...] "mawkishness of the Quarterly Review of Grimm's Correspondence." [...] I (knowing the secret) changed the {{conversation}} {{as soon as}} I could; and C. went away, quite convinced of having made the most favourable impression on his new acquaintance. Merivale is luckily a very good-natured fellow, or God he knows {{what might have been}} engendered from such a malaprop. I did not look at him while this was going on, but I felt like a coal--for I like Merivale, as well as the article in question.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first task}} of this Assembly is to free India {{through a new}} constitution, to feed the {{starving}} people, and to clothe the naked masses, and to give every Indian the fullest opportunity to develop himself according to his capacity. This is certainly a great task. Look at India today. We, are <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> and there <b>in</b> despair in many places, and unrest in many cities. The atmosphere is surcharged with these quarrels and feuds which are called communal disturbances, and unfortunately we sometimes cannot avoid them. But at present the greatest and most important question in India is how {{to solve the problem}} of the poor and the starving. Wherever we turn, we are confronted with this problem. If we cannot solve this problem soon, all our paper constitutions will become useless and purposeless. Keeping this aspect in view, who could suggest to us to postpone and wait? Jawaharlal Nehru ...|$|R
60|$|Well, I was smarting under a {{sense of}} defeat. Undeserved defeat, but what of that? That didn't soften the smart any. And {{to think of the}} circumstances! the first statesman of the age, the capablest man, the best-informed man in the entire world, the loftiest uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any {{political}} firmament for centuries, <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> apparently defeated <b>in</b> argument by an ignorant country blacksmith! And I could see that those others were sorry for me--which made me blush till I could smell my whiskers scorching. Put yourself in my place; feel as mean as I did, as ashamed as I felt--wouldn't you have struck below the belt to get even? Yes, you would; it is simply human nature. Well, that is what I did. I am not trying to justify it; I'm only saying that I was mad, and anybody would have done it.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, McCain {{screamed at}} Senator Richard Shelby {{an inch from}} his face, during a heated cabinet {{nomination}} battle for McCain's friend John Tower. [...] In 1992, McCain and Senator Chuck Grassley got into a heated argument, with shoving and profanities, over a POW/MIA committee issue and did not {{speak to each other}} for two years, before reconciling. At a meeting in 2007 on immigration legislation, fellow Republican Senator John Cornyn objected to McCain: [...] "Wait a second <b>here.</b> I've been <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> for all of these negotiations and you just parachute <b>in</b> <b>here</b> on the last day. You're out of line," [...] to which McCain replied, [...] "Fuck you! I know more about this {{than anyone else in the}} room." ...|$|R
