Stanley worked in his father's {{unsuccessful}} building business, becoming adept at working with metal and wood, later to obtain employment as a plumber/drainage contractor and joiner in London. He joined his father in 1849 at an engineering works at Whitechapel, working as a Pattern Maker's Improver where he invented the <b>steel</b> <b>wheel</b> spider-spokes. His father discouraged him from seeking a patent for this invention. For the following five years, he was in partnership with his maternal uncle (a Mr Warren), a builder, at Buntingford.|$|E

It was directed by Travis Preston, composed by Ellen Reid and Vinny Golia, and choreographed by Mira Kingsley.

25|$|A wheellock, wheel-lock or wheel lock, is a friction-wheel {{mechanism}} {{to cause a}} spark for firing a firearm. It was the next major development in firearms technology after the matchlock and the first self-igniting firearm. Its name is from its rotating <b>steel</b> <b>wheel</b> to provide ignition. Developed around 1500, it was used alongside the matchlock and was later superseded by the snaplock (1540s), the snaphance (1560s) and the flintlock (c. 1600).|$|E
25|$|The wheellock {{works by}} {{spinning}} a spring-loaded <b>steel</b> <b>wheel</b> against {{a piece of}} pyrite to generate intense sparks, which ignite gunpowder in a pan, which flashes through a small touchhole to ignite the main charge in the firearm's barrel. The pyrite is clamped in vise jaws on a spring-loaded arm (or 'dog'), which rests on the pan cover. When the trigger is pulled, the pan cover is opened, and the wheel is rotated, with the pyrite pressed into contact.|$|E

25|$|The WC was {{the first}} farm tractor to have rubber tires as {{standard}} equipment, and the first tractor tested on rubber in the Nebraska tractor tests. The pneumatic-rubber-tire-on-steel-wheel combination was more expensive to make than a <b>steel</b> <b>wheel</b> with cleats. To make rubber tires standard equipment while also keeping {{the cost of the}} tractor low, the WC's designers, C.E. Frudden and Walter Strehlow, gave the WC drop gearing at the rear (bull-gear-with-pinion final drives), which allowed row-crop ground clearance while having smaller-diameter drive wheels. Drop gearing had appeared many times before on earlier tractors, but never yet for this new reason—to minimize the amount of rubber needed for the tires.|$|E

500|$|MY09.5: {{upgrades}} affected models {{ordered from}} 21 October 2008 and produced from November. Instrument cluster illumination was commonised to white. The turn-by-turn navigation and Berlina V8 options were removed. Engine wise, the [...] "premium" [...] {{version of the}} Alloytec V6 was now fitted to the Omega and Berlina, bringing improved fuel consumption and a slight reduction in engine output (see above). A range of safety upgrades were also introduced (see above). Further MY09.5 changes were introduced in March 2009. The space-saver spare wheel were discontinued and replaced by two no-cost options: either a lightweight tyre inflator kit or a full-size spare wheel (previously an extra cost). Sportwagon variants of the Calais V and SS V receive an alloy spare wheel if the full-size spare is chosen, while {{the remainder of the}} line-up receives a <b>steel</b> <b>wheel</b> spare. March also signalled an opportunity for Holden to replace the dark-grey horizontal dashboard strip and steering wheel spokes as used on the SV6, SS and SS V to a matte silver type. The safety improvements made to the Omega sedan from October production onwards were also introduced for the Omega Sportwagon (see above), and the [...] "V-Series" [...] insignia used on SS V and Calais V models was removed, replaced by a single [...] "SS V" [...] or [...] "Calais V" [...] badge.|$|E

5000|$|The massive, {{worldwide}} <b>Steel</b> <b>Wheels</b> Tour {{was launched}} in late August 1989, concurrently with <b>Steel</b> <b>Wheels</b> arrival {{and the release of}} lead single [...] "Mixed Emotions", a partially biographical reference to Jagger and Richards recent woes that proved to be the Rolling Stones last major hit single in the US, reaching No. 5. Critical reaction was warm, with <b>Steel</b> <b>Wheels</b> reaching No. 2 in the UK and No. 3 in the US where it went double-platinum. Follow-up singles were [...] "Rock and a Hard Place", [...] "Almost Hear You Sigh" [...] and [...] "Terrifying". Overall sales were strong worldwide, selling over 5.5 million copies. The mammoth <b>Steel</b> <b>Wheels</b> Tour, which finished in mid-1990 after being re-titled the Urban Jungle Tour, was an enormous financial success. In 1990, FOX aired a 3-D television special of the <b>Steel</b> <b>Wheels</b> tour. Unlike anaglyphic 3-D which requires the familiar red and green glasses, the method used was the Pulfrich Effect which permitted full-color video. The film was shot by Gerald Marks of PullTime 3-D in NYC. An IMAX film of the tour was released the next year, which still plays sporadically at IMAX venues around the world.|$|R

2500|$|The dog is a {{spring-loaded}} arm pivoted on {{the outside}} of the lock plate. A sparking material, usually a small piece of iron pyrite, is clamped and held by vice-like jaws at the swinging end of the arm. The dog has two possible positions to which it can be pivoted by hand: a [...] "safe" [...] position, in which the dog is pushed towards the muzzle of the firearm, and an [...] "operating" [...] position, where the dog is pulled towards the operator so that the pyrite in its jaws can engage either the top of the pan cover (see below), or (in the absence of the pan cover) the edge of a <b>steel</b> <b>wheel</b> bearing longitudinal grooves around its circumference. Flint is not suitable as a sparking material in the wheellock because it is too hard and would quickly wear away the wheel grooves.|$|E
2500|$|Metros, {{short for}} {{metropolitan}} railways, {{are defined by}} the International Association of Public Transport (L'Union Internationale des Transports Publics, or UITP) as urban guided transport systems [...] "operated on their own right of way and segregated from general road and pedestrian traffic. They are consequently designed for operations in tunnel, viaducts or on surface level but with physical separation {{in such a way}} that inadvertent access is not possible. In different parts of the world Metro systems are also known as the underground, the subway or the tube. Rail systems with specific construction issues operating on a segregated guideway (e.g. monorail, rack railways) are also treated as Metros as long as they are designated as part of the urban public transport network." [...] Metropolitan railways are used for high capacity public transportation. They can operate in trains of up to 10 cars, carrying 1800 passengers or more. In Germany, the terms U-Bahn and S-Bahn are used. Some metro systems run on rubber tires but are based on the same fixed-guideway principles as <b>steel</b> <b>wheel</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} some {{problems}} with early 2003 Police Interceptors.

The Hydramatic automatic transmission gear selector had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in the 98 series. The 4-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total 98 sales set a new record of 118,626.|$|E
2500|$|The 1950 Oldsmobile 98 {{repeated}} its 1948 precedent of previewing some of next years styling cues for the 88. The 98 was restyled {{after only}} two years.

A 4-door 98 fastback appeared for one year only in 1950 and was called the Town Sedan, selling only 1,778 units. Standard equipment included bumper guards, dual horns, parking lamps, dome light, rubber floor mats, aluminum sill plates, foam rubber seat cushions, chrome interior trim, lined luggage compartment and counterbalanced trunk lid. Deluxe 98 equipment included rear seat armrest, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel and horn button, special door trim and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>wheel</b> trim rings.

Sales of the 98 Holiday nearly tripled to 8263, approaching the 11,989 sold of the Club coupe. Given the rapidly growing popularity of the 2-door Holiday hardtop, 1950 was the last year for the pillared Club coupe. Total sales set yet another record of 106,220.|$|E
