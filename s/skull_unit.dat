40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} pelvic tilt on commonly performed measurements on radiography in primary protrusio acetabuli and developmental dysplasia of the hip. Materials and methods: A dry assembled pelvis and spine skeleton was positioned in an isocentric <b>skull</b> <b>unit</b> and films exposed with increasing degrees of angulation of pelvic tilt. The films were then read by two independent readers for seven different measurements used to evaluate the hips and acetabular: acetabular line to ilioischial line, teardrop appearance, intercristal/intertuberous ratio, co-ordinates of femoral head, centre edge angle, acetabular depth/width ratio and acetabular angle. Results: There was so much variation in the protrusio results that no formal recommendation of any standard radiographic test can be given. Only the inter tuberous distance is not effected by pelvic tilt. The acetabular angles for developmental dysplasia of the hip showed the most potential with pelvic tilt below 15 °. Conclusion: As pelvic tilt increases, measurements used in protusio become unreliable, and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging are probably going to be more accurate as one can directly visualise pelvic intrusion. We recommend a lateral view to assess the degree of pelvic tilt in patients with protrusion to ensure these measurements are valid...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the [...] "Röhm-Putsch", the SS officially took over the {{concentration}} camps from the SA and police. Soon thereafter, camp guards began wearing the Totenkopf ("skull") on the right collar patch, to distinguish themselves from the numbered Allgemeine-SS Standarten. This was inconsistent in the early days; some guards instead wore tabs with the initial of their camp (e. g. [...] "D" [...] for Dachau), and some wore blank tabs. About 1935, the black uniform proving impractical for daily service wear, the Inspectorate of Concentration Camps adopted a working uniform in [...] "earth-brown" [...] (erdbraun), which was identical in cut to the black tunic except for shoulderboards on both sides. In March 1936, the camp [...] "service" [...] was formally established as the third branch of the SS, the Totenkopfverbände or <b>skull</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{skull base}} {{is one of}} the most complex {{anatomical}} regions and forms the floor of the cranial cavity. Skull base surgery involves open, microscopic, and endoscopic approaches to the anterior, middle, or posterior cranial fossa. A multispecialty team approach is essential in treating patients with skull base lesions. Traditionally, rhinologists are involved in providing access to anterior skull base lesions while otologists are involved in the treatment of lesions of the posterior skull base. This is the case in most skull base centers today. In this article, we share a new perspective of an integrated <b>skull</b> base <b>unit</b> where a team of otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons treat anterior, middle, and posterior skull base pathologies. The rationale for this approach is that most technical skills required in skull base surgery are interchangeable and apply whether an endoscopic or microscopic approach is used. We show how the different skills apply to the different approaches and share our experience with an integrated <b>skull</b> base <b>unit...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Death camps {{differed}} from concentration camps located in Germany proper, such as Bergen-Belsen, Oranienburg, Ravensbrück, and Sachsenhausen, which were prison camps set up prior to World War II for people defined as 'undesirable'. From March 1936, all Nazi concentration camps were {{managed by the}} SS-Totenkopfverbände (the <b>Skull</b> <b>Units,</b> SS-TV), who operated extermination camps from 1941 as well. An SS anatomist, Dr. Johann Kremer, after witnessing the gassing of victims at Birkenau, wrote in his diary on 2 September 1942: [...] "Dante's Inferno seems to me almost a comedy compared to this. They don't call Auschwitz the camp of annihilation for nothing!" [...] The distinction was evident during the Nuremberg trials, when Dieter Wisliceny (a deputy to Adolf Eichmann) was asked to name the extermination camps, and he identified Auschwitz and Majdanek as such. Then, when asked [...] "How do you classify the camps Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald?" [...] he replied, [...] "They were normal concentration camps, {{from the point of}} view of the department of Eichmann." ...|$|R
2500|$|Speaking to Code Talker in Navajo, Quiet {{reveals that}} Skull Face {{intended}} to use her against Venom Snake and his army by having herself be captured {{so that she could}} be taken to Mother Base and infect everyone with the English-language strain of the vocal chord parasites that she had been given. Quiet was further subjected to [...] "parasite therapy", whereby parasites were introduced to her body to keep her alive after she was set on fire. It also gives her enhanced strength, mobility and speed as well as inhuman resilience, durability and recovery abilities. Unlike the <b>Skulls</b> <b>unit</b> of parasite-enhanced soldiers encountered through the game, Quiet retains an outwardly-human appearance. Due to her injuries, the parasites compensated for her burned epidermis, giving her the ability to [...] "breathe" [...] through her skin, requiring her to wear as little clothes as possible, as covering her skin would suffocate her. However, her time spent with Diamond Dogs made her genuinely change sides and she retained her silence to prevent an infection.|$|R

40|$|Since the mid- 1960 s {{surgeons}} {{have attempted}} to cure intracranial perineural spread (PNS) of cutaneous malignancies. Untreated patients with trigeminal PNS die from brainstem invasion and leptomeningeal disease. It was understood that resection with clear margins was potentially curative, but early surgical attempts were unsuccessful. The prevailing wisdom considered that this surgery failed to improve the results achieved with radiation therapy alone and was associated with high morbidity. However, with improved imaging, surgical equipment, and better understanding of cavernous sinus (CS) anatomy and access, contemporary surgeons can improve outcomes for this disease. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe a technique to access the interdural compartment of the CS and treat PNS of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in the intracranial trigeminal nerve and ganglion. It is based on the experience of the Queensland <b>Skull</b> Base <b>Unit,</b> Australia in managing PNS of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (cSCCHN) ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the Nazi Party, the leadership realized that a bodyguard unit composed of zealous and reliable men was needed. Ernst Röhm formed a guard formation from the 19.Granatwerfer-Kompanie; from this formation the Sturmabteilung (SA) soon evolved. In early 1923, Hitler ordered a separate small bodyguard unit formed. It was dedicated to his service rather than [...] "a suspect mass" [...] of the party, such as the SA. Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by Julius Schreck and Joseph Berchtold. It was designated the Stabswache (staff guard). The Stabswache were issued unique badges, but at this point the Stabswache was still under overall SA control. Schreck resurrected the use of the Totenkopf (i.e. <b>skull)</b> as the <b>unit's</b> insignia, a symbol various elite forces had used throughout the Prussian kingdom and the later German Empire.|$|R
40|$|Background:  We {{report the}} {{experience}} of endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EETS) for resection of pituitary region tumours at Wellington, the central regional referral centre for neurosurgery in New Zealand, and discuss the collaborative mentoring surgical model that enhanced the learning experience. Method:  Between January 2007 and June 2009, a total of 47 operations on 46 patients were performed and reviewed retrospectively. All patients had perioperative clinical assessment, hormonal profile and magnetic resonance imaging studies for residual/recurrent disease. The collaborative model utilized two neurosurgeons with experience in the microsurgical resection of pituitary tumours: an endoscopic skull base fellowship trained rhinologist and an endoscopic skull base rhinologist with more experience who visited twice a year from Adelaide, Australia. Results:  The pathology results included: 30 non-functioning pituitary adenomas, 10 secreting pituitary adenomas, 3 meningiomas, 1 chordoma, 1 anterior skull base adenocarcinoma and 1 clival prostate metastasis. Complete tumour resection was intended and achieved in 38 cases. All 10 patients with secreting adenomas achieved improvement of hormonal profile. Nineteen out of 27 cases demonstrated improvement of vision. Perioperative complications included one epistaxis, three cerebrospinal fluid fistulae, one delayed chronic subdural haematoma and one persistent diabetes insipidus. Conclusion:  Our results highlight {{the value of a}} collaborative mentoring surgical model for a single centre adopting the endoscopic transsphenoidal technique and demonstrate that excellent EETS outcomes can be achieved in a smaller endoscopic <b>skull</b> base <b>unit</b> in Australasia during the learning phase.

40|$|Objective: Accurate {{and precise}} {{measurement}} of vestibular schwannoma (VS) size {{is key to}} clinical management decisions. Linear measurements are used in routine clinical practice but are prone to measurement error. This study aims to compare a semi-automated volume segmentation tool against standard linear method for measuring small VS. This study also examines whether oblique tumour orientation can contribute to linear measurement error. Study design: Experimental comparison of observer agreement using two measurement techniques. Setting: Tertiary <b>skull</b> base <b>unit.</b> Participants: 24 patients with unilateral sporadic small (< 15 mm maximum intracranial dimension) VS imaged with 1 mm thickness T 1 -weighted Gadolinium enhanced MRI. Main outcome measures: 1 Intra and inter-observer intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), repeatability coefficients (RC) and relative smallest detectable difference (%SDD). 2 Mean change in maximum linear dimension following reformatting to correct for oblique orientation of VS. Results: Intra-observer ICC was higher for semi-automated volumetric when compared with linear measurements, 0. 998 (95 % CI 0. 994 – 0. 999) vs 0. 936 (95 % CI 0. 856 – 0. 972), p< 0. 0001. Inter-observer ICC was also higher for volumetric vs linear measurements, 0. 989 (95 % CI 0. 975 – 0. 995) vs 0. 946 (95 % CI 0. 880 – 0. 976), p= 0. 0045. The intra-observer %SDD was similar for volumetric and linear measurements, 9. 9 % vs 11. 8 %. However, the inter-observer %SDD was greater for volumetric than linear measurements, 20. 1 % vs 10. 6 %. Following oblique reformatting to correct tumour angulation, the mean increase in size was 1. 14 mm (p= 0. 04). Conclusion: Semi-automated volumetric measurements are more repeatable than linear measurements when measuring small VS and should be considered for use in clinical practice. Oblique orientation of VS may contribute to linear measurement error...|$|R
