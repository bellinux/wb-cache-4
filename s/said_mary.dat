25|$|Some {{maintain}} that, {{according to}} Lúcia and Fátima advocates such as Abbé Georges de Nantes, Fr. Paul Kramer and Nicholas Gruner, Russia {{has never been}} specifically consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by any Pope simultaneously with all the world's bishops, which is what Lúcia in the 1985 interview had <b>said</b> <b>Mary</b> had asked for.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Counter-Reformation group, {{founded by}} theologian , takes the {{position}} that the released text is the complete Third Secret, but refers to Pope John Paul I rather than John Paul II, pointing out that the latter, after all, did not die when he was attacked, while the bishop in the Third Secret did. John Paul I had met Lúcia Santos while he was Patriarch of Venice, and was deeply moved by the experience. In a letter to a colleague after his election, he vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia which Lúcia <b>said</b> <b>Mary</b> had asked for.|$|E
25|$|The {{visions of}} the Virgin Mary {{appearing}} to three shepherd children at Cova da Iria, in Fátima, Portugal, in 1917 were declared worthy of belief by the Catholic Church in 1930. Seven popes — Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis — have supported the Fátima messages as supernatural. John Paul I met with Sister Lúcia on July 11, 1977, {{while he was still}} Cardinal Patriarch of Venice. He reported being deeply moved by the experience and vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia as Lucia <b>said</b> <b>Mary</b> had asked. John Paul II was particularly attached to Fátima and credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast Day of Our Lady of Fátima in May 1981. He donated the bullet that wounded him on that day to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima. Pope Paul VI sent a Golden Rose to the shrine in 1964, and Benedict XVI, on May 13, 2010, prayed in the Chapel of the Apparitions at the shrine and gave a second Golden Rose to Our Lady of Fátima. Before a gathering of more than 500,000 pilgrims, he spoke of the Fátima prophecy about the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.|$|E

500|$|A Journey drew a mixed {{reception}} from critics. Financial Times editor Lionel Barber {{called it}} [...] "part psychodrama, part treatise on {{the frustrations of}} leadership in a modern democracy ... written in a chummy style with touches of Mills & Boon". He wrote that it made Blair seem [...] "likable, if manipulative; capable of dissembling while wonderfully fluent; in short, a brilliant modern politician (whatever his moans about the media)." [...] Writing in The Independent on Sunday, Geoffrey Beattie said A Journey offered an understanding of Blair's [...] "underlying psychology." [...] John Rentoul, author of the Blair biography Tony Blair Prime Minister, was equally positive, giving particular praise to the chapter on the Iraq War. [...] "The chapter on Iraq is tightly argued in some detail, which may persuade those with open minds to recognise {{that the decision to}} join the US invasion was a reasonable, if not very successful, one, rather than a conspiracy against life, the universe and everything decent," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>Mary</b> Ann Sieghart, writing for The Independent said, [...] "whatever its faults, and toe-curling passages, [...] has many good lessons on how to succeed in both opposition and government.|$|E
500|$|Regnans in Excelsis gave English Catholics {{a strong}} {{incentive}} {{to look to}} Mary Stuart as the true sovereign of England. Mary {{may not have been}} told of every Catholic plot to put her on the English throne, but from the Ridolfi Plot of 1571 (which caused Mary's suitor, the Duke of Norfolk, to lose his head) to the Babington Plot of 1586, Elizabeth's spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham and the royal council keenly assembled a case against her. At first, Elizabeth resisted calls for Mary's death. By late 1586, she had been persuaded to sanction her trial and execution on the evidence of letters written during the Babington Plot. Elizabeth's proclamation of the sentence announced that [...] "the <b>said</b> <b>Mary,</b> pretending title to the same Crown, had compassed and imagined within the same realm divers things tending to the hurt, death and destruction of our royal person." [...] On 8 February 1587, Mary was beheaded at Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire. After Mary's execution, Elizabeth claimed not to have ordered it and indeed most accounts have her telling her Secretary, William Davison, who brought her the warrant to sign, not to dispatch the warrant even though she had signed it. The sincerity of Elizabeth's remorse and her motives for telling Davison not to execute the warrant have been called into question both by her contemporaries and later historians.|$|E
2500|$|Willow Bunch is {{the birthplace}} of Édouard Beaupré, known as the Géant Beaupré. [...] "When he was 12 years old, he was six feet, six inches tall.

[...] "Dr. Burnham provided only partial information and explicitly refused to provide complete information about the basic elements of his research," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Mary</b> Losch, chair of the association’s Standards Committee.|$|E
2500|$|Lúcia {{said that}} the Lady {{emphasized}} Acts of Reparation and prayers to console Jesus {{for the sins of}} the world. Lúcia said that Mary's words were, [...] "When you make some sacrifice, say 'O Jesus, it is for your love, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.'" [...] At the apparition of 13 July 1917, Lucia <b>said</b> <b>Mary</b> told the children that sinners could be saved from damnation by devotion to the Immaculate Heart, but also by making [...] "sacrifices". They heard her repeat the idea of sacrifices several times. Her vision of hell prompted them to ever more stringent self-mortifications to save souls. Among many other practices, Lúcia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars, and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Francisco and Jacinta became extremely devoted to this practice. Lúcia wrote that Mary said God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances.|$|E
