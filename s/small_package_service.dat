40|$|A firm often {{must ensure}} that {{products}} or services it actually offers closely match customer expectations. We define variability as any deviation in a production or service process that yields products or services whose attributes differ from the firm’s stated target specifications. Firms positioning themselves to offer products or services marked by low variability are more subject to maladaptation costs if production processes are not adjusted accordingly to avoid nonconformities. Furthermore, such adjustments to production processes to pursue low variability often require idiosyncratic investments (e. g., dedicated IT systems), thereby creating contractual hazards and potential underinvestment. We hypothesize that ownership of sequential activities in the value chain helps mitigate problems associated with maladaptation as well as suboptimalities of underinvestment in idiosyncratic assets, thereby resulting in lower variability. Using data from Japanese International Courier and <b>Small</b> <b>Packages</b> <b>services</b> industry, where a key product attribute is delivery time, we assess the variability-reducing role of ownership along the value chain in two complementary ways. The first approach is parametric and allows us {{to assess the impact}} of ownership on the variance associated with delivery time; here we focus on shipments tha...|$|R

Furthermore, such adjustments often require idiosyncratic investments (e. g., dedicated information technology systems), thereby creating contractual hazards and potential underinvestment. We hypothesize that ownership of sequential activities in the value chain helps mitigate problems associated with maladaptation as well as suboptimalities in transaction-specific investment, thereby resulting in lower variability. Using data on delivery times from the Japanese international courier and <b>small</b> <b>package</b> <b>services</b> industry, we assess the variability-reducing role of ownership in two complementary ways. The first approach is parametric, allowing us {{to assess the impact}} of ownership on the variance associated with delivery time; here we focus on shipments that frequently fail to arrive precisely within the time period initially expected by customers. The second approach is more consistent with the notion of reliability, or the likelihood that shipments will not arrive later than expected: we nonparametrically estimate the distribution of deviations between actual and expected delivery time, and verify how distinct organizational choices change the distribution. Ownership of multiple segments yields a particularly pronounced effect on both variance and reliability. Ownership bestows variability-reducing benefits of ownership, especially when ownership is observed in multiple stages of the value chain...|$|R
40|$|In retail stores, {{consumers}} are frequently offered choices between large and <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> of products. Previous literature characterizes choices between large and <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> {{primarily as a}} means for manufacturers to practice price discrimination. Quite often, however, <b>packaging</b> also provides <b>services</b> to consumers, such as keeping foods fresh or facilitating storage. In this paper, we examine consumers’ willingness to pay more for the <b>services</b> provided by <b>packaging,</b> {{and the degree to which}} this changes their susceptibility to price discrimination. We conduct a series of studies in which consumers make choices among alternatives with different package characteristics, brands, and prices, holding constant the purchase quantity. We find evidence that {{consumers are}} willing to pay for <b>packaging</b> <b>services,</b> and that their willingness to pay for these services varies across product categories. Our results suggest that in product categories for which freshness is a concern, <b>packaging</b> <b>services</b> may be underutilized as positioning attributes. We also find evidence that consumers are willing to pay more for <b>packaging</b> <b>services</b> provided by name brands than for store brands, suggesting that name brands can increase their profits by offering <b>packaging</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
40|$|Efficiency {{enhancement}} {{for urban}} mobility {{is one of}} the key elements in smart city conceptions. Nowadays, there is significant underutilization of vehicle capacities in the case of individual vehicles, taxis, and vehicles, especially for food or <b>small</b> <b>package</b> delivery <b>services.</b> The motivation of our research is to reveal opportunities for so-called dynamic, combined ridesourcing service. Passengers and certain goods sharing the same destination can be transported in shared vehicles. Since such novel service concepts are based on new forms of information management, the research question is: how the information systems and the operations are to be modeled in order to create the service. In such a service, demands and capacities are coordinated by dynamic prices based on real-time data. The logical correspondences of pricing are also revealed. During model development, we considered autonomous vehicles as well, because their emergence requires fundamentally new perational approaches. Accordingly, the developed information management method can be adopted for services based on autonomous vehicles. The results provide a basis for innovation and development of these services...|$|R
40|$|In retail stores, {{consumers}} are frequently offered choices between large and <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> of products. While some previous literature has viewed variations in package size {{as a mechanism}} for providing services to consumers, other literature has characterized these variations primarily {{as a means for}} manufacturers to practice price discrimination. In this paper, we demonstrate an experimental method for determining the degree to which {{consumers are}} willing to pay more for <b>packaging</b> <b>services</b> that preserve freshness, holding constant the volume of product purchased and controlling for the marginal costs of packaging and the consumer’s consumption rate. Our results show that consumers vary in their willingness to pay a premium for packaging forms that preserve freshness, such as <b>smaller</b> <b>package</b> size, and that differences in willingness to pay vary predictably across product categories, brands, and time horizons. Our approach illustrates the extent to which packaging variations that preserve freshness can serve as mechanisms for price discrimination and service provision. It can be easily extended to other dimensions of quality in packaging. 3 In retail stores, consumers are frequently offered choices between large and <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> of products such as soft drinks and cereals.

All <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> are sent to a series of sorting machines. The <b>small</b> <b>package</b> sort contains 14 sorting machines, including primary and secondary levels of sorting machines. <b>Small</b> <b>packages</b> are organized and sent to inductors to place <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> on a conveyor of machines. The <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> are read in a tunnel and diverted into their appropriate bags. Once bags are filled, they are placed on a conveyor belt to be sent to the outbound area to be loaded and the full bag is replaced by an empty bag.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} moderating role of attempted dietary restraint {{on the amount}} of food consumed from small food in <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> versus large food in large packages. Four experiments demonstrate that restrained eaters consume more calories from small food in <b>small</b> <b>packages,</b> while unrestrained eaters consume more calories from large food in a large package. For restrained eaters, overconsumption of the small food in <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> results from a lapse in self-control caused by the stress of perceiving conflicting food information: the small food in <b>small</b> <b>packages</b> is perceived as both diet food and high in calories.
