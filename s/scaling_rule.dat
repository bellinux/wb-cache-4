2500|$|The {{concept of}} a fractal {{dimension}} rests in unconventional views of scaling and dimension. As Fig. 4 illustrates, traditional notions of geometry dictate that shapes scale predictably according to intuitive and familiar ideas about the space they are contained within, such that, for instance, measuring a line using first one measuring stick then another 1/3 its size, will give for the second stick a total length 3 times as many sticks long as with the first.

Here we analyze the cellular <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> that apply to the brain of artiodactyls, a group within the order Cetartiodactyla, believed to be a relatively recent radiation from the common Eutherian ancestor. We find that artiodactyls share nonneuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> with all groups analyzed previously. Artiodactyls share with afrotherians and rodents, but not with primates, the neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> that apply to the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> that apply to the remaining brain areas are however distinct in artiodactyls. Importantly, we show that the folding index of the cerebral cortex scales with the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex in distinct fashions across artiodactyls, afrotherians, rodents, and primates, such that the artiodactyl cerebral cortex is more convoluted than primate cortices of similar numbers of neurons. Our findings suggest that the <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> found to be shared across modern afrotherians, glires and artiodactyls applied to the common Eutherian ancestor, such as the relationship between the mass of the cerebral cortex as a whole and its number of neurons. In turn, the distribution of neurons along the surface of the cerebral cortex, which is related to its degree of gyrification, appears to be a clade-specific characteristic. If the neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> for artiodactyls extend to all cetartiodactyls, we predict that the large cerebral cortex of cetaceans will still have fewer neurons than the human cerebral cortex...|$|R

Here we analyze the cellular <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> that apply to the brain of afrotherians, {{believed to be the first}} clade to radiate from the common eutherian ancestor. We find that afrotherians share non-neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> with rodents, primates and eulipotyphlans, as well as the coordinated scaling of numbers of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Afrotherians share with rodents and eulipotyphlans, but not with primates, the scaling of number of neurons in the cortex and in the cerebellum as a function of the number of neurons in the rest of the brain. Afrotheria also share with rodents and eulipotyphlans the neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> that apply to the cerebral cortex. Afrotherians share with rodents, but not with eulipotyphlans nor primates, the neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> that apply to the cerebellum. Importantly, the scaling of the folding index of the cerebral cortex with the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex is not shared by either afrotherians, rodents, or primates. The sharing of some neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> between afrotherians and rodents, and of some additional features with eulipotyphlans and primates, raise the interesting possibility that these shared characteristics applied to the common eutherian ancestor. In turn, the clade-specific characteristics that relate to the distribution of neurons along the surface of the cerebral cortex and to its degree of gyrification suggest that these characteristics compose an evolutionarily plastic suite of features that may have defined and distinguished mammalian groups in evolution.

The present investigation is an extension of the earlier analysis and approaches the case of impact cratering. More restrictive bounds are found for impact cratering than for the explosive case. These stronger results come from considering the role of the impactor momentum as an independent variable for impact cratering.

Such an opportunity has arisen following tests on a Tethered Harrier. Comparison of this full scale data and results from tests on a model configuration approximating to the full scale aircraft geometry has shown discrepancies between HGR levels.

40|$|A <b>scaling</b> <b>rule</b> of {{ecological}} theory, accepted but lacking experimental confirmation, {{is that the}} magnitude of fluctuations in population densities due to demographic stochasticity scales inversely with the square root of population numbers. This supposition is based on analyses of models exhibiting exponential growth or stable equilibria. Using two quantitative measures, we extend the <b>scaling</b> <b>rule</b> to situations in which population densities fluctuate due to nonlinear deterministic dynamics. These measures are applied to populations of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum that display chaotic dynamics in both 20 -g and 60 -g habitats. Populations cultured in the larger habitat exhibit a clarification of the deterministic dynamics, which follows the inverse square root rule. Lattice effects, a deterministic phenomenon caused by the discrete nature of individuals, can cause deviations from the <b>scaling</b> <b>rule</b> when population numbers are small.

40|$|Brain size {{scales as}} {{different}} functions of its number of neurons across mammalian orders such as rodents, primates, and insectivores. in rodents, we have previously shown that, across {{a sample of}} 6 species, from mouse to capybara, the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and the remaining brain structures increase in size faster than they gain neurons, with an accompanying decrease in neuronal density in these structures [Herculano-Houzel et al. : Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2006; 103 : 12138 - 12143]. Important remaining questions are whether such neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> within an order apply equally to all pertaining species, and whether they extend to closely related taxa. Here, we examine whether 4 other species of Rodentia, {{as well as the}} closely related rabbit (Lagomorpha), conform to the <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> identified previously for rodents. We report the updated neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> obtained for the average values of each species {{in a way that is}} directly comparable to the <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> that apply to primates [Gabi et al. : Brain Behav Evol 2010; 76 : 32 - 44], and examine whether the scaling relationships are affected when phylogenetic relatedness in the dataset is accounted for. We have found that the brains of the spiny rat, squirrel, prairie dog and rabbit conform to the neuronal <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> that apply to the previous sample of rodents. the conformity to the previous rules of the new set of species, which includes the rabbit, suggests that the cellular <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> we have identified apply to rodents in general, and probably to Glires as a whole (rodents/lagomorphs), with one notable exception: the naked mole-rat brain is apparently an outlier, with only about half of the neurons expected from its brain size in its cerebral cortex and cerebellum.

This {{raises the possibility that}} insectivore brains differ from other taxa, including rodents and primates, in cellular scaling properties. Here we examine the cellular <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> for insectivore brains and demonstrate that insectivore <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> overlap somewhat with those for rodents and primates such that the insectivore cortex shares <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> with rodents (increasing faster in size than in numbers of neurons), but the insectivore cerebellum shares <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> with primates (increasing isometrically). Brain structures pooled as “remaining areas” appear to scale similarly across all three mammalian orders with respect to numbers of neurons, and the numbers of non-neurons appear to scale similarly across all brain structures for all three orders. Therefore, common <b>scaling</b> <b>rules</b> exist, to different extents, between insectivore, rodent and primate brain regions, and it is hypothesized that insectivores represent the common aspects of each order. The olfactory bulbs of insectivores, however, offer a noteworthy exception in that neuronal density increases linearly with increasing structure mass. This implies that the average neuronal cell size decreases with increasing olfactory bulb mass in order to accommodate greater neuronal density, and represents the first documentation of a brain structure gaining neurons at a greater rate than mass. This might allow insectivore brains to concentrate more neurons within the olfactory bulbs without a prohibitively large and metabolically costly increase in structure mass...|$|R

As simple representations of such materials, one-dimensional arrays of parallel cylinders {{as well as}} two-dimensional arrays of perpendicularly crossing cylinders were used.
