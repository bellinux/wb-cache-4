5|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} work {{depicting}} Elgar is Ken Russell's 1962 BBC television film Elgar, made when the composer was still largely out of fashion. This hour-long film contradicted {{the view of}} Elgar as a jingoistic and bombastic composer, and evoked the more pastoral and melancholy <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character and music.|$|E

In that time, he recorded one assist in league play, and assisting in the game-winning goal against Mexico's Tigres UANL in the CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinals. He was later placed {{on injured reserve}} and twice underwent surgery on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> groin. Zakuani's contract was allowed to expire, effectively ending his five-year career with the Sounders, during which he started in 67 of 78 appearances in league play. At the time, he was the club’s third-leading scorer with 17 goals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Honoré I the {{internal}} transformation from fortress to palace was continued. The Treaty of Trodesillas {{at the beginning of}} Honoré's rule clarified Monaco's position as a protectorate of Spain, and thus later of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. This provided the security to allow the Lord of Monaco to concentrate on the more comfortable <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> residence rather than the constant need to defend it.|$|E
5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors had done for them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of}} the Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E

5|$|He became {{personally}} {{involved in all}} branches {{of the government and}} successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials. The dark <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech, and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate. He punished libel with exile or death and, due to his suspicious nature, increasingly accepted information from informers to bring false charges of treason if necessary.|$|E

Lysacek was also named to the team for the 2008 World Championships.

Lysacek toured over the summer of 2008 with the Stars on Ice tour.|$|E
5|$|Huston {{continually}} {{took the}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> players in any argument they had against Huggins, criticizing Huggins {{in the press}} when the Yankees lost the pennant in 1920. Meanwhile, Ruppert was at best a lukewarm advocate of Huggins. Babe Ruth resisted Huggins' discipline; he did not respect Huggins due to his small stature, soft-spoken nature, and inability to fight, and Huggins was unable to enforce punishments on Ruth. The Yankees {{finished third in the}} AL in 1919 and 1920. Huggins signed a one-year contract to remain with the team in 1921.|$|E

Brady died at his home after having the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body paralyzed for several days, and was interred at Calvary Cemetery in New York.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves on the wrong <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E
5|$|No tells Bond that he {{is working}} with the Russians and has built an {{elaborate}} underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral. He had previously been a member of a Chinese tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off as a warning to others, and then shot. Because No's heart was on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body, the bullet missed it and he survived.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday, and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, {{while the second}} session lasted 45 minutes. The third and final session lasted 60 minutes. In the first practice session, Clint Bowyer was fastest, placing ahead of Biffle in second, and Johnson in third. Gordon was fourth fastest, and Edwards placed fifth. Kurt Busch, David Ragan, Jeff Burton, Keselowski and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Max Papis damaged the right-hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car when he hit the turn two wall; Jamie McMurray, David Reutimann and Mike Bliss also hit the turn two wall. Bliss went to a back-up car because the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car was heavily damaged. John Andretti's engine failed during the early phase of the session, and Andretti changed engines. Burton switched to a back-up car after he collided with the turn two outside wall.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Willis has {{appeared}} on the Late Show with David Letterman several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when {{he was supposed to}} be a guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, having one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.|$|E
