5000|$|Winchester Chesil {{station was}} chosen for an {{innovative}} system of signalling, developed in about 1923 by L M G Ferreira of Siemens Brothers and Co Ltd and R J Insell of the GWR. A route <b>setting</b> <b>frame</b> was installed, with miniature levers: the frame was small, measuring 2 ft 10 in by 2 ft 4 in (863 mm by 711 mm). It was a forerunner of the one control switch system; the levers set up routes; when the lever was moved to mid-stroke the interlocking proved that the route was free and no conflicting move had been set up; and the points moved to the required position, after which the lever could be moved to the reverse position and the signal cleared. There were 16 miniature levers and 15 routes could be selected; the sixteenth was a king lever. The points were operated by a 120-volt supply from the signal box. Track circuits were provided at the points: they were described as [...] "point protection tracks", that is, route locking track circuits, {{but there were no}} track circuits in the plain line. The night illumination was provided by oil lamps except for two signals located in the tunnel; ground signals were miniature semaphores of novel design.|$|E

If the screen space rendering is chosen, the depth information in its geometric buffer can be used repeatedly.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a TDMA slot {{assignment}} protocol {{to improve the}} channel utilization, which controls the excessive increase of unassigned slots by changing the frame length dynamically. Our proposed protocol assigns one of the unassigned slots to a node which joins the network. If there is no unassigned slots available, our proposed protocol generates unassigned slots by depriving one of the multiple slots assigned to a node, or enlarging frame length of nodes which can cause collision with each other. Moreover, by <b>setting</b> <b>frame</b> length as a power of 2 slots, our proposed protocol provides the collision-free packet transmission among nodes with different frame length. The simulation results show that our proposed protocol improves the channel utilization dramatically {{as compared with the}} conventional protocols. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} author {{shows that the}} women’s role in the marital {{relationships}} formed {{under the influence of}} two main reasons. The first reason is the state’s influence on the family as a social institution (state family policy in Ukraine). Government policies on women and their role in the family and society formed as part of this problem field. The second reason is related to the natural essence of the woman with the development of its internal creative potential in need of self-realization and responds to challenges. Researchers O. Zdravomyslova and G. Tiomkina noted that overall governance of gender relations has two types of mechanisms. On the one hand, the state exercises enforced normative regulation, pursuing a policy of sex and gender in the laws of different levels. On the other hand, it creates an ideological apparatus of coercion, gender relations by controlling the dominant official discourse, <b>setting</b> <b>frame</b> representations. In this paper we consider the effect of the ideological state apparatus of coercion against the woman, who to any extent mediated and defined the Ukrainian women’s role in the field of family and marital relations during the social and political upheavals...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{enlighten}} the use of knowledge management in Finnish companies in HR context. The study is based on a survey conducted in autumn 2002. The target group was the TOP 50 Finnish companies. It was assumed that every Finnish TOP 50 company uses knowledge management in some extent. Earlier there has been only case studies, thus there is need for this study. Contributions of this study are firstly to describe the history and the current state of knowledge management in Finnish TOP 50 companies. Secondly, to see what are the rationales of using knowledge management. By surveying only the HR personnel the actual state-of-the-practice in KM is hardly revealed, as there are also other perspectives such as IT and handling documents. The delineation of this study is challenging in some extend, as it considers the largest and therefore the most well-resourced companies. Though, one might suggest those are the most interesting ones. As a conclusion this study discusses the use of knowledge management as part of balanced performance measurement by <b>setting</b> <b>frame</b> for the use of the “fourth perspective”...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Motivated by the {{classical}} notion of <b>frame</b> <b>sets</b> and their characterization, we develop {{a notion of}} Heisenberg <b>frame</b> <b>sets</b> in the dual of the Heisenberg group by means of invariant multiplicity one subspaces. We prove a characterization of Heisenberg <b>frame</b> <b>sets</b> that is precisely analogous to the characterization of classical <b>frame</b> <b>sets.</b> In the process we obtain {{a necessary condition for}} general frame vectors of Weyl-Heisenberg systems. Keywords and phrases: Wavelet (affine) sets, Heisenberg group, Weyl-Heisenberg frame, Parseval frame vectors, shift-invariant subspaces, multiplicity one subspaces 0. introduction A Parseval frame (mother-) wavelet on R is a function ψ for which { 2 j/ 2 ψ(2 j ·−k) : j,k ∈ Z} is a Parseval frame for L 2 (R). A measurable subset of R is called a <b>frame</b> <b>set</b> if its characteristic function is the Fourier transform of a Parseval frame wavelet. When R is replaced by the Heisenberg group N – or any connected nilpotent Lie group – one can consider discrete families of translations and dilations: translations by a discrete co-compact subset of N and dilations that are N-automorphisms.

The results show that both Obama and McCain used all three means of agenda control to continually displace the line of conflict in their favor.
