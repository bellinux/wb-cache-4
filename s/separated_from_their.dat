5|$|After {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album Give 'Em Enough Rope (1978), the band <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> manager Bernard Rhodes. This separation {{meant that the}} group had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location to compose their music. Tour manager Johnny Green and drum roadie Baker had found the group a new place to rehearse called Vanilla Studios, which was located {{in the back of}} a garage in Pimlico.|$|E
5|$|As was {{traditional}} in {{the royal}} family, Anne and her sister were brought up <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> father in their own establishment at Richmond, London. On the instructions of Charles II, they were raised as Protestants. Placed {{in the care of}} Colonel Edward and Lady Frances Villiers, their education was focused on the teachings of the Anglican church. Henry Compton, Bishop of London, was appointed as Anne's preceptor.|$|E
5|$|Brashear has two sons, Jordan and Jackson; he <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> mother, Gabrielle Desgagne, his common-law wife, in 2007. In 2000, Brashear {{was charged}} with assault {{following}} an incident where he grabbed {{a man by the}} neck and shoved him. The incident occurred after the man complained to Desgagne about the couple's infant son crawling on the exercise machines in a communal gym. Brashear received six months probation after pleading guilty to common assault.|$|E

5|$|Fox {{divided the}} {{patients}} at Brislington House according to social class, '1st', '2nd' and '3rd' class ladies and gentlemen, who were housed in different blocks, {{as well as}} behavioural presentation. Fox insisted that patients should be <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> families as they needed {{to move away from}} the conventional authority of the head of the household following the madness of King George III. It had erroneously been suggested that the king become a patient at Brislington House.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California {{at least two}} million years ago and became <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> relatives in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps {{at the same time}} as humans.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists at the {{monument}} find, describe the location of, and collect fossil-bearing rocks {{from more than}} 700 sites. They {{take them to the}} paleontology laboratory at the visitor center, where the fossils are stabilized, <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> rock matrix, and cleaned. The fossil specimens are then catalogued, indexed, stored in climate-controlled cabinets, and made available for research. In addition to preparing fossils, the paleontologists coordinate {{the monument}}'s basic research in paleobotany and other scientific areas and manage the fossil museum in the visitor center.|$|E

5|$|Another {{individual}} {{known as}} Captain Haddock {{had lived in}} this period, who had commanded a fire ship, the Anne and Christopher. It was recorded by David Ogg that this captain and his ship had been <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> squadron whilst out at sea and so docked at Málaga to purchase goods that could be taken back to Britain and sold for a profit. For this action, Haddock was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674, where {{he was ordered to}} forfeit all profits from the transaction and suspended from his command for six months.|$|E
5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{referred}} to the Natural Resources Committee, which then referred it to its Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans, chaired by Bordallo. Hearings were held a week later, at which Shelley Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London who studies the shark-fin trade, observed that transshipment operations such as the KD IIs were common and would likely continue as the competition in Hong Kong, the industry's traditional center, grew more intense. While the transshipment ban was an effective response to the decision, she suggested that shipments of containerized fins be allowed {{if they had been}} <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> carcasses after landing.|$|E

5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|At 08:50, {{the lead}} U.S. attack {{formation}} from Hornet spotted four ships from Abe's Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers {{and prepared to}} attack. Three Zeros from Zuihō attacked the formation's Wildcats, drawing {{them away from the}} bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twenty Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot down four of them. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on Shōkaku at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking her flight deck and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of Shōkaku and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer , causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> strike group, did not find the Japanese carriers and eventually turned back towards Hornet. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , missing with all their torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> mothers. Babies are often {{orphaned}} during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E

5|$|Coria and Salgado {{suggested}} that the convergent evolution of gigantism in theropods could {{have been linked to}} common conditions in their environments or ecosystems. Sereno and colleagues found that the presence of carcharodontosaurids in Africa (Carcharodontosaurus), North America (Acrocanthosaurus), and South America (Giganotosaurus), showed the group had a transcontinental distribution by the Early Cretaceous period. Dispersal routes between the northern and southern continents appear to have been severed by ocean barriers in the Late Cretaceous, which led to more distinct, provincial faunas, by preventing exchange. Previously, it was thought that the Cretaceous world was biogeographically separated, with the northern continents being dominated by tyrannosaurids, South America by abelisaurids, and Africa by carcharodontosaurids. The subfamily Carcharodontosaurinae, in which Giganotosaurus belongs, appears to have been restricted to the southern continent of Gondwana (formed by South America and Africa), where they were probably the apex (top) predators. The South American tribe Giganotosaurini may have been <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> African relatives through vicariance, when Gondwana broke up during the Aptian–Albian ages of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Phipps' grandfather, Constantine (1746–1797), {{rented the}} Hotel d'Harcout in Caen, France, from the Duke of Harcourt; in 1793, he {{returned}} briefly to England in 1793 {{for the wedding}} {{of one of his}} daughters, leaving eight of his children in France. When War of the First Coalition broke out in 1793, the children were <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> parents. Ramsay Phipps' father, Pownoll Phipps (1780–1858) and his siblings grew up in the French city during the French revolution, and lived under the threat of anti-English violence. Only after the Treaty of Campo Formio could the children return to England, arriving on 2 October 1798, all of them fluent in French; Pownoll Phipps reportedly spoke with French-accented English {{for the rest of his}} life. By the end of October, Pownoll had a commission as a lieutenant and joined the Bengal Army of the East India Company. The following June, he embarked for India on the Bombay-built ship Britannica.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of Zoah, Edge meets an engineer, Paet, who will trade {{information}} about the Tower for ancient artifacts. Searching an ancient vessel for parts, Edge is captured by imperial soldiers but rescued by Gash. Paet reveals that the Tower {{can be reached via}} the ruins of Uru; there, Edge and the dragon are attacked again by the girl and Atolm. After the battle, <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> dragons, he and the girl fall into an ancient underground facility and form a truce to escape. The girl explains that she is an ancient bio-engineered being named Azel, created in the facility and designed to interface with ancient technology. After Edge's dragon rescues them, Azel warns Edge that she will kill him if he crosses Craymen's path again and leaves on Atolm.|$|E

5|$|James F. Reed {{made it out}} of the Sierra Nevada to Rancho Johnson in late October. He {{was safe}} and {{recovering}} at Sutter's Fort, but each day he became more concerned for the fate of his family and friends. He pleaded with Colonel John C. Frémont to gather a team of men to cross the pass and help the company, in return for which Reed promised that he would join Frémont's forces and fight in the Mexican-American War. Reed was joined by McCutchen, who had been unable to return with Stanton, as well as some members of the Harlan-Young party. The Harlan-Young wagon train had arrived at Sutter's Fort on October 8, the last to make it over the Sierra Nevada that season. The party of roughly 30horses and a dozen men carried food supplies, and expected to find the Donner Party on the western side of the mountain, along the Bear River below the steep approach to Emigrant Gap, perhaps starving but alive. When they arrived in the river valley, they found only a pioneer couple, immigrants who had been <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> company and were near starvation.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 1944, the Eighth Air Force {{attempted}} {{to repeat the}} success of 20 February. 1st and 2nd Divisions flew due east towards Germany and the 3rd Division east-northeast without escort. After crossing into Schleswig-Holstein they attacked targets along the Baltic sea coast. The 1st and 2nd Divisions {{were considered to be}} the main thrust of the attack and the 3rd Division went unmolested. The B-24 bombers of the 2nd Division were scheduled to bomb Gotha and JG 1 were directed to attack these B-24s. Due to strong tailwinds and flying at lower altitude, the bombers were <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> escorting fighters and JG 1 reached Gotha before the bombers. Major Heinz Bär led II./JG 1 in a diving attack and claimed four B-24s while I./JG 1 attacked head-on and claimed five B-24s downed.|$|E
5|$|After finding all the Masters, the Exile travels back to Dantooine and {{learns that}} the countless deaths at Malachor V {{resulted}} in the Exile unconsciously giving up connection to the Force, which then became {{the teachings of the}} new Sith. If the player aided the Jedi Masters, they prepare to strip the Exile of their Force connection permanently, as the Masters fear that these teachings could result in the actual death of the Force, but Kreia reveals herself to be the former leader of the Sith and murders them all in retribution. If the player killed the Jedi Masters, Kreia attacks the Exile and leaves. Tracking Kreia to Telos, the Exile fights and defeats a corrupted Atris, from whom it is learned that Kreia plans to strengthen a massive wound in the Force made ten years prior. This wound had been created by the Exile during the Mandalorian Wars, when they activated a superweapon in order to end the battle on the planet Malachor V, causing mass death and destruction. Before following her to Malachor V, where Kreia had since rejoined the Sith as Darth Traya, the Exile stops a Sith invasion of Telos, defeating one of Traya's former apprentices, the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus. On Malachor V, the Exile is <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> companions and fights through hordes of monsters on the planet's surface and the inhabitants of a large Sith Academy that survived the cataclysm. On the final floor of the academy, the Exile kills the Sith Lord Darth Sion and confronts Darth Traya in the planet's core.|$|E
