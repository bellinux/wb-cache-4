5|$|A {{feature-length film}} that {{indirectly}} parodies Star Trek is Galaxy Quest. This film {{is based on}} the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest, modeled heavily on Star Trek, believe that what they are <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> real. Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was a brilliant parody.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the fort}} are some marvels of medieval architecture. The 15th century Gujari Mahal is a {{monument}} to the love of Raja Mansingh Tomar for his intrepid Gujar Queen, Mrignayani. The outer structure of Gujari Mahal has survived in an almost total state of preservation; the interior has been converted into an archaeological museum housing rare antiquities, some of them dating back to the 1st century A.D. Even though many of these have been defaced by the iconoclastic Mughals, their perfection of form has survived the ravages of time. Particularly worth <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> the statue of Shalbhanjika from Gyraspur, the tree goddess, the epitome of perfection in miniature. The statue is kept in the custody of the museum's curator, and can be seen on request.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} food is {{affected}} {{to a certain}} degree by the use of maize for biofuel production. The cost of transportation, production, and marketing are a large portion (80%) of the price of food in the United States. Higher energy costs affect these costs, especially transportation. The increase in food prices the consumer has been <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> mainly due to the higher energy cost. The effect of biofuel production on other food crop prices is indirect. Use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand, and therefore price of maize. This, in turn, results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production. This reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices.|$|E

50|$|His Suspensions of Perception {{focuses on}} the period from about 1880 to 1905, {{exploring}} {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century in which a new way of <b>seeing</b> <b>was</b> introduced. Crary describes this shift as an emergence of subjective vision. In addition, Crary discusses how Attention became a “new object within the modernization of subjectivity...”. Crary’s book examines how the perception of various cultures were reconstructed and uncertainties were argued. This new development of vision created controversy because it implied that <b>seeing</b> <b>was</b> dependent upon one’s subjective thoughts, which were based on what the observer saw. Therefore, this new way of <b>seeing</b> <b>was</b> thought of as unclear, unreliable, and always questioned among a large population of people. Suspensions of Perception published in 2000 was the winner of the 2001 Lionel Trilling Book Award.|$|R

500|$|Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune {{described}} {{the concept of}} Castiel as [...] "genius" [...] and the actor Collins as [...] "fabulous". Deeming Castiel to be a [...] "fascinating new element", Diana Steenbergen of IGN ranked Castiel fourth in her list of the [...] "Ten Things We Love About Supernatural". She posited that Collins plays the role with [...] "somber intensity", and [...] "brings a sense of curiosity about humans to the character". The angel's interactions with Dean were [...] "one {{of the highlights of}} the [...] season". She especially praised Collins for his dual role as Castiel and the angel's host Jimmy Novak in the episode [...] "The Rapture", and wrote, [...] "It is a tribute to Collins's acting that the audience knows immediately that the person we are <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> not Castiel." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that a learned ability to interpret blurred images may account for perceived improvements in eyesight. Ophthalmologist Walter B. Lancaster had this to say: [...] "Since <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> only partly a matter of the image on the retina and the sensation it produces, but is in still larger part a matter of the cerebral processes of synthesis, in which memories play a principal role, it follows that by repetition, by practice, by exercises, one builds up a substratum of memories useful for the interpretation of sensations and facilitates the syntheses which are the major part of seeing." [...] Lancaster faulted ophthalmologists in general for neglecting the role of the brain in the process of seeing, [...] "leaving to irregular, half-trained workers the cultivation of that field".|$|E

500|$|Regarded as an auteur filmmaker, Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, {{dialogue}} scenes {{framed in}} wide close-up with a shallow {{depth of field}} and modern locations and architecture. Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings and real filming locations over studio work. Nolan has noted {{that many of his}} films are heavily influenced by film noir. He has continuously experimented with metafictive elements, temporal shifts, elliptical cutting, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, labyrinthine plots and the merging of style and form. Discussing The Tree of Life (2011), Nolan spoke of Terrence Malick's work and how it has influenced his own approach to style, [...] "When you think of a visual style, when you think of the visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and the narrative elements. But with the greats, whether it's Stanley Kubrick or Terrence Malick or Hitchcock, what you're <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> an inseparable, a vital relationship between the image and the story it's telling".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by clay animation using character models each {{about the size of}} a wine bottle. The models were first constructed using plasticine before pouring Carbog, a solid material used by mechanics, into moulds to form the bodies. They were then painted to appear like plasticine, and real plasticine around wire was used for the arms. Elliot said he chose to use Carbog since models made from just plasticine would require more maintenance. Some characters had replaceable mouths made of hardened Sculpey clay that were attached magnetically to the faces to reflect different facial expressions; Harvie's model had more than 30 separate mouth shapes. The design of the models was influenced by Elliot's tremor, since he needed them to be relatively large and easy to manipulate. He made the models' eyes particularly large [...] "to fully express the character's emotion". He intentionally left fingerprints in the plasticine when manipulating the models to remind the audience that [...] "what they're <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> tangible, tactile and it's not generated through a computer". He was assisted by Sophie Raymond and Michael Bazeley in constructing and modelling the characters. The sets were largely constructed from wood.|$|E
500|$|The protagonists in Argento's giallo films {{almost always}} suffer from vision {{impairment}} of some kind. It is these characters' chronic inability {{to find the}} missing pieces of a puzzle the puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders) that generally provides much of the films' narrative thrust. [...] Most obviously is the blind Franco Arno (Karl Malden) in The Cat o' Nine Tails, who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied {{to him by his}} niece to solve a mystery. [...] In The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be [...] "missing"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he did not [...] "miss" [...] anything, but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of his eyes. In Deep Red, Marcus (David Hemmings) has a similar problem in both seeing and not seeing the murderer {{at the scene of the}} crime, and does not realize his mistake until it is almost too late. This recurring theme, according to Douglas E. Winter, creates [...] "a world of danger and deception, where <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> not believing".|$|E

500|$|In the book, {{the narrator}} is not only self-aware, but also alert to every detail around her. Pilgrims second chapter defines two types of seeing: as [...] "verbalization" [...] (active) and as [...] "a letting go" [...] (passive). [...] The narrator refers to the {{difference}} between the two methods as [...] "the difference between walking with and without a camera." [...] Whereas the former requires the need to [...] "analyze and pry", the latter only requires rapt attention. [...] The act of <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> exhaustive and exhausting, as one of the chapters relates: [...] "I look at the water: minnows and shiners. [...] If I am thinking minnows, a carp will fill my brain till I scream. [...] I look at the water's surface: skaters, bubbles, and leaves sliding down. Suddenly my own face, reflected, startles me witless. [...] Those snails have been tracking my face! Finally, with a shuddering wrench of the will, I see clouds, cirrus clouds. [...] I'm dizzy. I fall in. This looking business is risky." [...] Sandra Johnson refers to the structure of the book itself leading to an epiphany of self-awareness, or a [...] "mystical experience"; as the narrator watches a falling maple key, she feels [...] "lost, sunk ... gazing toward Tinker Mountain and feeling the earth reel down".|$|E
