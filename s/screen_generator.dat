To attempt to ride out such a storm upon the surface seemed suicidal, for the Coldwater was not designed for surface navigation except under fair weather conditions. Submerged, or in the air, she was tractable enough in any sort of weather when under control; but without her <b>screen</b> <b>generators</b> she was almost helpless, since she could not fly, and, if submerged, could not rise to the surface.|$|R

50|$|The M88A2 is {{slightly}} larger than its predecessors (8.6 × 3.7 × 3.2 m compared to 8.3 × 3.4 × 3.2 m) thus retains a lower top speed (40 km/h) and a significantly lower road range (322 km compared to 450 km). There have also been improvements in braking and steering. Additionally, the M88A2 has upgraded armor protection including armored track skirts and applique armor panels, which both previous models lack. The M88 is also lacking in Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) defenses and a smoke <b>screen</b> <b>generator,</b> which the later M88A1 and M88A2 models are equipped with.

50|$|The turret is {{fitted with}} two six-barreled 81mm smoke grenade {{launchers}} and two four-barreled flare launchers. The system {{can create a}} thick smoke that blocks both vision and thermal imaging. The tank is also equipped with a smoke <b>screen</b> <b>generator</b> that is triggered by the driver. When activated, diesel fuel is injected into the hot exhaust, creating the thick smoke. The TR-85M1 is equipped with laser illumination warning sensors that can automatically trigger the GFM-76 smoke grenades and flares, thus disrupting the guidance systems of thermal and infrared guided missiles. The SAILR (Sistem de Avertizare la Iluminarea Laser și Radar, laser and radar illumination warning system) laser warning receiver can locate and identify the threat, warning the crew and triggering the DLC (Dispozitivul de Lansare Contramăsuri, Countermeasures Launching Device).|$|E
40|$|A new Fourier Series {{atmospheric}} phase <b>screen</b> <b>generator</b> is introduced. A Fourier Series (FS) is used {{to represent}} the wavefront phase as a two dimensional periodic function. The period of the function is chosen to be {{much larger than the}} outer scale of the turbulence and thus the FS accurately represents the power in the low spatial frequencies of the wavefront. The accuracy of the representation of the high spatial frequencies is determined by the number of terms used in the FS expansion. The FS based <b>screen</b> <b>generator</b> is capable of simulating atmospheric-induced wavefront phase distortions arising from temporal and/or anisoplanatic conditions. Both the spatial and temporal correlations between wavefront phases screens separated by time and/or angle are properly modeled.

These include human-machine interfaces such as visualization casks, stereoscopic spectacles and <b>screens,</b> <b>generators</b> of three-dimensional sound, data gloves, data clothes, position sensors, tactile and power feed-back systems, etc. All these technologies allowed immersion into the image and interaction with it. The impression of reality felt under these conditions was not only provided by vision and hearing, but also by the other bodily senses. This multiple sensing was so intensely experienced at times, that Popper could speak of it as an immersive virtual reality (VR).|$|R

40|$|The Mission Planning Graphical Tool (MPGT) {{provides}} mission analysts with a mouse driven {{graphical representation}} of the spacecraft and environment data used in spaceflight planning. Developed by the Flight Dynamics Division at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, MPGT {{is designed to be}} a generic tool that can be configured to analyze any specified earth orbiting spacecraft mission. The data is presented as a series of overlays on top of a 2 -dimensional or 3 -dimensional projection of the earth. Up to six spacecraft orbit tracks can be drawn at one time. Position data can be obtained by either an analytical process or by use of ephemeris files. If the user chooses to propagate the spacecraft orbit using an ephemeris file, then Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) formatted ephemeris files must be supplied. The MPGT User's Guide provides a complete description of the GTDS ephemeris file format so that users can create their own. Other overlays included are ground station antenna masks, solar and lunar ephemeris, Tracking Data and Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) coverage, a field-of-view swath, and orbit number. From these graphical representations an analyst can determine such spacecraft-related constraints as communication coverage, interference zone infringement, sunlight availability, and instrument target visibility. The presentation of time and geometric data as graphical overlays on a world map makes possible quick analyses of trends and time-oriented parameters. For instance, MPGT can display the propagation of the position of the Sun and Moon over time, shadowing of sunrise/sunset terminators to indicate spacecraft and Earth day/night, and color coding of the spacecraft orbit tracks to indicate spacecraft day/night. With the 3 -dimensional display, the user specifies a vector that represents the position in the universe from which the user wishes to view the earth. From these "viewpoint" parameters the user can zoom in on or rotate around the earth. The zoom feature is also available with the 2 -dimensional map image. The program contains data files of world map continent coordinates, contour information, antenna mask coordinates, and a sample star catalog. Since the overlays are designed to be mission independent, no software modifications are required to satisfy the different requirements of various spacecraft. All overlays are generic with communication zone contours and spacecraft terminators generated analytically based on spacecraft altitude data. Interference zone contours are user-specified through text-edited data files. Spacecraft orbit tracks are specified via Keplerian, Cartesian, or DODS (Definitive Orbit Determination System) orbit vectors. Finally, all time-related overlays are based on a user-supplied epoch. A user interface subsystem allows the user to alter any system mission or graphics parameter through a series of pull-down menus and pop-up data entry panels. The user can specify, load, and save mission and graphic data files, control graphical presentation formats, enter a DOS shell, and terminate the system. The interface automatically performs error checking and data validation on all data input from either a file or the keyboard. A help facility is provided. MPGT also includes a software utility called ShowMPGT which displays screen images that were generated and saved with the MPGT system. Specific sequences of images can be recalled without having to reset graphics and mission related parameters. The MPGT system does not provide hardcopy capabilities; however this capability will be present in the next release. To obtain hardcopy graphical output, the PC must be configured with a printer that captures the video signal and copies it onto a hardcopy medium. MPGT is written in FORTRAN, C, and Macro Assembler for use on IBM PC compatibles running MS-DOS v 3. 3 or higher which are configured with the following hardware: an 80 X 87 math coprocessor, an EGA or VGA board, 1. 3 Mb of disk space and 620 K of RAM. Due to this memory requirement, it is recommended that a memory manager or memory optimizer be run prior to executing MPGT. A mouse is supported, but is optional. The provided MPGT system executables were created using the following compilers: Microsoft FORTRAN v 5. 1, Microsoft C compiler v 6. 0 and Microsoft Macro Assembler v 6. 0. These MPGT system executables also incorporate object code from two proprietary programs: HALO Professional Kernel Graphics System v 2. 0 (copyright Media Cybernetics, Inc., 1981 - 1992), which is distributed under license agreement with Media Cybernetics, Incorporated; and The <b>Screen</b> <b>Generator</b> v 5. 2, which is distributed with permission of The West Chester Group. To build the system executables from the provided source code, the three compilers and two commercial programs would all be required. Please note that this version of MPGT is not compatible with Halo ' 88. The standard distribution medium for MPGT is a set of two 3. 5 inch 720 K MS-DOS format diskettes. The contents of the diskettes are compressed using the PKWARE archiving tools. The utility to unarchive the files, PKUNZIP. EXE v 2. 04 g, is included. MPGT was developed in 1989 and version 3. 0 was released in 1992. HALO is a Registered trademark of Media Cybernetics, Inc. Microsoft and MS-DOS are Registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation.

40|$|A {{source term}} model which simulates {{the effects of}} vortex {{generators}} was implemented into the Wind-US Navier Stokes code. The source term added to the Navier-Stokes equations simulates the lift force which would result from a vane-type vortex generator in the flowfield. The implementation is user-friendly, requiring the user to specify only three quantities for each desired vortex generator: the range of grid points over which the force {{is to be applied}} and the planform area and angle of incidence of the physical vane. The model behavior was evaluated for subsonic flow in a rectangular duct with a single vane vortex generator, supersonic flow in a rectangular duct with a counterrotating vortex generator pair, and subsonic flow in an S-duct with 22 co-rotating vortex generators. The validation results indicate that the source term vortex generator model provides a useful tool for <b>screening</b> vortex <b>generator</b> configurations and gives comparable results to solutions computed using a gridded vane...|$|R

The paper presents the fabrication and testing of bismuth tellurium (Bi 1. 8 Te 3. 2) – antimony tellurium (Sb 2 Te 3) based flexible thermocouples using screen printing technology for energy harvesting application. In this study, planar <b>screen</b> printed thermoelectric <b>generators</b> (TEGs) with three different printing processes were developed and coiled up to test. All thermocouples were printed on a flexible polyimide substrate. The dimension of each planer thermoleg is 20 mm × 2 mm while the thickness varied from 70. 5 ?m to 78 ?m. The thermoelectric performance of TEGs using different binder systems A and B were investigated. For TEGs with binder A, the calculated Seebeck coefficient of a single thermocouple was in the range of 193 – 227 ?V/K. At a temperature difference of 20 °C, the optimized power was 142 nW contributed by the cold isostatic pressed TEG with SbTe electrodes. Binder system B with lower viscosity was applied and proved to be able to decrease the resistivity of BiTe thick film, which increased the power factor (? 2 ?). The power output of such coiled-up device increased to 444 nW with the same temperature difference. Higher output power could be realized by rolling up more planar thermocouples electrically connected. This work demonstrates that the low-cost screen printing technology and low-temperature curing materials are promising for the fabrication of flexible TEGs. Binder system that could help to generate a denser film was important to BiTe and SbTe based screen printable thermoelectric materials. </span...|$|R
