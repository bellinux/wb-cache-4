40|$|In {{this work}} a robust {{generating}} {{system for a}} 5 MW PMSM wind turbine system with diode rectifier and DC/DC converter connected to DC link has been investigated. The design and efficiency have been studied using MATLAB Simulink and SIMPLORER and the result shows that this system topology has high efficiency. The result found was that the same generator that can provide 5 MW using an IGBT-Converter, can only give 2. 5 MW using a diode rectifier and a variable DClink. However, with series and parallel compensations the same generator can provide an output power even more than 5 MW. It was {{also found that the}} efficiencies of systems at rated operation with IGBT-converter, diode rectifier with series compensation and <b>shunt</b> <b>compensation</b> are 97. 6 %, 98. 6 %, and 98. 9 %, respectively. Moreover, the systems efficiency at 5 % of load are 93. 0 %, IGBT-converter, 97. 3 %, series compensation, and 95. 3 %, <b>shunt</b> <b>compensation.</b> The required reactive power for series compensation and <b>shunt</b> <b>compensation</b> to provide 5 MW output power for the diode rectifier system, at rated operation, are 1. 5 MVar and 2. 8 MVar, respectively. To conclude, the diode rectifier with series compensation is more efficient for low wind speed (4 - 11 m/s) also it needs less reactive power; however, the <b>shunt</b> <b>compensation</b> scenario has better efficiency at rated speed when the wind speed is higher than 12 m/s...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 In this research, a novel <b>shunt</b> <b>compensation</b> {{scheme design}} {{procedure}} is developed for unbalanced, untransposed n-phase transmission lines. The main {{function of the}} scheme {{is to reduce the}} effect of the capacitive coupling on untransposed transmission lines to levels where successful single-pole switching is assured. The analysis procedure is carried out for six-phase transmission lines, but it could be applied to any n-phase system. In {{the first part of the}} research, the arc characteristics for various gap lengths are investigated. The results of the investigation are utilized in developing the transmission line gap recovery characteristics. Equations that express the capacitively-coupled secondary arc current and recovery voltage in terms of line constants and the compensation scheme element values are derived. A digital computer is used to find the optimum compensation element values using these equations. Two existing transmission line data are utilized as a demonstration of the adequacy of the <b>shunt</b> <b>compensation</b> in reducing the secondary arc current and the recovery voltage. The performance of the compensation scheme under various line conditions is verified by simulating the line and the compensation bank using the Electromagnetic Transient digital computer program.
