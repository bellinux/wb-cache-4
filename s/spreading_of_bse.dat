50|$|Meat {{and bone}} meal (MBM) {{is a product}} of the {{rendering}} industry. It is typically about 48-52% protein, 33-35% ash, 8-12% fat, and 4-7% moisture. It is primarily used in the formulation of animal feed to improve the amino acid profile of the feed. Feeding of MBM to cattle is thought to have been responsible for the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> (mad cow disease). In most parts of the world, MBM is no longer allowed in feed for ruminant animals. However, MBM is still used to feed monogastric animals.

40|$|Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} {{prion disease}} of cervids. Some animal prion diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, can infect humans; however, human susceptibility to CWD is unknown. In ruminants, prion infectivity is found in central nervous system and lymphoid tissues, with smaller amounts in intestine and muscle. In mice, prion infectivity was recently detected in fat. Since ruminant fat is consumed by humans and fed to animals, we determined infectivity titers in fat from two CWD-infected deer. Deer fat devoid of muscle contained low levels of CWD infectivity and might be {{a risk factor for}} prion infection of other species. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that in-clude Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, scrapie in sheep, and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. Cross-species prion infec-tion can occur and is responsible for the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> to humans (2). Since spread is likely due to exposure to infected tissues, it is vital to know which tissues contain infectivity. In animals such as cattle, sheep, and cervids, whose tissues ar...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to build a {{methodology}} allowing the study and the comparison <b>of</b> the potential <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> at the scale of countries under different routine slaughtering conditions in order to evaluate the risk of nonextinction due to this slaughtering. We first model the evolution in discrete time of the proportion of animals in the latent period and that of infectives, assuming a very large branching population not necessarily constant in size, two age classes, less than 1 -year-old animals, and adult animals. We analytically derive a bifurcation parameter ρ 0 allowing us to predict either endemicity or extinction of the disease, which has the meaning of an epidemiological reproductive rate. We show that the classical reproductive number R 0 cannot be used for prediction if the size of the population, when healthy, does not remain stable throughout time. We illustrate the qualitative results by means of simulations with either the British routine slaughtering probabilities or the French ones, the other conditions being assumed identical in both countries. We show that the French probabilities lead to a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the disease than the British ones, this result being mainly due to a smaller value of the routine slaughtering probability of the adult animals in France than in Great Britain.

40|$|AbstractBovine spongiform encephalopathy, {{otherwise}} known as mad cow disease, can spread when an individual cow consumes feed containing the infected tissues of another individual, forming a one-species feedback loop. Such feedback is the primary means <b>of</b> transmission for <b>BSE</b> during epidemic conditions. Following outbreaks in the European Union and elsewhere, many governments enacted legislation designed to limit the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> such diseases via elimination or reduction of one-species feedback loops in agricultural systems. However, two-species feedback loops—those in which infectious material from one-species is consumed by a secondary species whose tissue is then consumed by the first species—were not universally prohibited and have not been studied before. Here we present a basic ecological disease model which examines the rôle feedback loops may play in the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and related diseases. Our model shows that there are critical thresholds between the infection's expansion and decrease related to the lifespan of the hosts, {{the growth rate of}} the prions, and the amount of prions circulating between hosts. The ecological disease dynamics can be intrinsically oscillatory, having outbreaks as well as refractory periods which can make it appear that the disease is under control while it is still increasing. We show that non-susceptible species that have been intentionally inserted into a feedback loop to stop the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease do not, strictly by themselves, guarantee its control, though they may give that appearance by increasing the refractory period of an epidemic's oscillations.

40|$|Cattle {{infected}} with {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) {{appear to be a}} reservoir for transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) to humans. Although just over 100 people have developed clinical vCJD, millions have probably been exposed to the infectivity by consumption of BSE-infected beef. It is currently not known whether some of these individuals will develop disease themselves or act as asymptomatic carriers of infectivity which might infect others in the future. We have studied agent persistence and adaptation after cross-species infection using a model of mice inoculated with hamster scrapie strain 263 K. Although mice inoculated with hamster scrapie do not develop clinical disease after inoculation with 10 million hamster infectious doses, hamster scrapie infectivity persists in brain and spleen for the life span of the mice. In the present study, we were surprised to find a 1 -year period postinfection with hamster scrapie where there was no evidence for replication of infectivity in mouse brain. In contrast, this period of inactive persistence was followed by a period of active replication of infectivity as well as adaptation of new strains of agent capable of causing disease in mice. In most mice, neither the early persistent phase nor the later replicative phase could be detected by immunoblot assay for protease-resistant prion protein (PrP). If similar asymptomatic carriers of infection arise after exposure of humans or animals to BSE, this could markedly increase the danger <b>of</b> additional <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> or vCJD infection by contaminated blood, surgical instruments, or meat.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of most proteins derived from mammals (referred to as prohibited material) in feed intended for cattle and other ruminants. The feed-ban rule {{is one of the}} primary actions taken by the federal government to protect U. S. cattle from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, which is believed to be spread through feed that contains malformed protein found in certain tissue [...] particularly brain and central nervous system tissue [...] of BSE-infected animals. Earlier this year, mad cow disease was found {{for the first time in}} a 12 -year old animal born and raised in the United States. In January 2002, we reported on the effectiveness of federal actions to prevent the introduction and <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> in the United States and identified a number of areas where improvements were needed to strengthen FDA's oversight of firms in the feed industry. In February 2005, we issued a follow-up report that examined the effectiveness of FDA's actions since the 2002 report to ensure industry compliance with the feed-ban rule and protect U. S. cattle from BSE. Our report concluded that while FDA has taken a number of positive steps, its processes still have room for improvement. Our February 2005 report also noted that FDA had begun a small, discrete feed testing program in August 2003. We reported that we would provide information on this new feed testing program, which FDA described as a unique effort, once FDA provided us with data on the feed tests. FDA later gave us the information we required to examine those feed testing activities. Accordingly, this report assesses FDA's small feed testing program and examines the extent to which this feed testing program helps FDA better assure industry compliance with the feed-ban rule.

40|$|Introduction: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer among women worldwide, and it can be {{detected}} at an early stage through self-examination which increases the chance of survival. This study aimed to assess knowledge and practice <b>of</b> breast self-examination (<b>BSE)</b> among females in a rural area of Trichy district. Methodology: This community-based, cross-sectional study was carried out among a total sample of 200 women in rural area of Trichy. The participants were interviewed using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to obtain information on their sociodemographic characteristics, awareness on breast cancer, and knowledge, attitude, practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Data were entered into MS Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 20. 0. Spearman correlation and Chi-square test were used to analyze the association between the variables. Results: The mean age of the study group was 36. 9 ± 8. 8 years. Eighty percent were literates. Most of the women 178 (89 %) were aware of breast cancer. Only 26 % of the women were aware <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Only 18 % of the females had ever checked their breast and 5 % practiced it regularly.

40|$|This {{study used}} the Health Belief Model (HBM) to examine attitudes about breast health among {{women who had}} participated in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. More specifically, {{the purpose of this study}} was to {{identify}} the relationship between the HBM variables and the frequency <b>of</b> breast self-examination (<b>BSE).</b> A convenience sample of 80 women completed Champion’s (1993) HBM questionnaire. It was hypothesized that the HBM concepts would significantly correlate with the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> However, only two significant correlations were found: a positive correlation between the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and perceived benefits (r=. 37; p=. 000) and a negative correlation between the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and perceived barriers (r=-. 41; p=. 000). Therefore, this hypothesis was not supported. A second hypothesis addressed was whether the HBM concepts could differentiate between groups <b>of</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Using an analysis of variance, a significant difference was found between the HBM concept of barriers and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Women who perceived significant barriers to BSE performance were less likely to perform this procedure on a routine basis. These results indicate that there are women who are still not performing monthly BSE even though they have been deemed high risk for developing breast cancer.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) epidemic is transmitted by feed contamination with meat and bone meal (MBM). Whether in some cases substances other than MBM have caused the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> this disease cannot be excluded at present. Detailed knowledge about country-specific transmission routes and relevant risk factors is important to perform accurate risk analyses and to control BSE. In the present study all possible information <b>of</b> Dutch <b>BSE</b> cases was collected. The general epidemiological data were first used for a comprehensive descriptive analysis <b>of</b> the Dutch <b>BSE</b> epidemic. A case-control study was performed to identify the risk factors associated with the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> cases in the Netherlands.

40|$|To {{eradicate}} {{or control}} the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> infectious diseases, knowledge on the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the infection between (groups of) animals is necessary. Models can include such information and can subsequently {{be used to}} observe the efficacy of various control measures in fighting the infection. However, the availability of information and data to build and quantify these models is essential for applying such models in real life. In this thesis, models on the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> infectious diseases in animals are always combined with data concerning the host, the infectious agent, their interactions and often also case data from epidemic or endemic disease situations. To do so, various infections that {{are present in the}} Netherlands are discussed. We show that for Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) the data of the epidemic in 1988 show that clustering of animals has a strong influence on the transmission and survival of the animals. A previously applied model to analyse the seal situation did not fit the data very well. A model that incorporates the clustering of the animals on sand banks gave a better fit. Due to their clustering, the death rate was higher than could be expected from the first model. To control and eradicate Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) it is known that the persistence of the infection in previously infected animals may cause a delay in eradication. We have quantified the probability for such a virus to reactivate in the field, and combined that with a model that calculates the expected time to extinction. Thus, control measures in the eradication process can easily be compared for efficacy and a time frame can be defined. The control <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> was an important issue in the last decade, but due to limited data, exact advice was difficult to find. By quantifying the transmission parameters, the various control measures can be compared for efficacy. Now that more information is available concerning risks for humans and cattle, optimisation of the surveillance and control can be introduced based on such models. The age distribution <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> cases offers information on the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> control in the past, but also concerning the prevalence of the infection in the future. Risk assessment and modelling are especially important for countries that would like to prove the absence <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> in their country. Monitoring of an animal disease situation may have many purposes, for instance to prove freedom from infection for a certain farm or country. In the last chapter of the thesis, we give an opening for extended modelling to quantify the risk of missing a new outbreak in a country that has the Free from disease status. An integrated approach of transmission models that specifically includes the frequency of sampling over time enables us to calculate the probability that an epidemic escapes from detectio...|$|R

Simple random sampling technique was used to recruit a total of 390 health extension workers (HEWs). A structured Amharic questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS statistical package version 16. 0. Result. This study found that 37 % ofHEWs had ever practiced BSE and 14. 4 % practiced it regularly. The threemain reasons for not doing regular BSE were no breast problem (53. 2 %), not knowing the technique <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> (30. 6 %), and not knowing the importance <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> (21. 4 %). Discussion with families on <b>BSE</b> and history <b>of</b> breast examination by health professionals were found significantly associated with ever practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Conclusion. BSE practice was found low in this study. Having information on the importance <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> was predictor <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> practice. Therefore, it is important to give training on BSE techniques and its role on breast cancer prevention for HEWs. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the issue <b>of</b> breast self-examination (<b>BSE)</b> in female nurses, as nurses who perform BSE {{are more likely}} to promote BSE to their clients. The purpose of the study is twofold: first, to assess the effects of three alternative methods <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> instruction on nurses’ BSE practice; and second, to determine the influence of nurses’ health beliefs on their practice <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> Previous studies have indicated that various teaching strategies have improved BSE practice. However, the three methods <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> instruction to be assessed on this study which includes booklet with written instruction, film and group discussion, and to one-to-one discussion, modelling and rehearsal have not been previously researched collectively in a single day. The study is guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM) which attempts to explain preventative health behaviour in terms of attitudes, values and beliefs. The following hypotheses have been formulated for investigation: (a) there will be {{a significant difference in the}} effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> practice in the experimental groups at follow-up twelve weeks post intervention; and (b) the health belief scores of nurses who do practise BSE will be higher than the health belief scores of nurses who do not practise BSE...|$|R

Numerous commentators have investigated a link between PDM and the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and CJD. It is estimated that 1 in 2000 people in the UK are carrying the disease. An employee of PDM Group, conceded it was [...] "quite possible" [...] that products manufactured by PDM (Prosper De Mulder) was ultimately responsible for cases <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> worldwide.|$|R
40|$|BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) is a fatal neu-rodegenerative {{disorder}} that affects cattle, which was first identified in 1986 in the UK [1]. Following the first description <b>of</b> <b>BSE,</b> the number <b>of</b> cases rapidly in-creased and reached epidemic proportions in the UK cattle population. A {{relatively small number}} <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> cases were also found in cattle in other countries. In 1990 {{the appearance of a}} new variant of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans was linked to food borne transmission <b>of</b> <b>BSE,</b> which caused major concerns for public health [2]. The key event in the pathobiology <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and other Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) is the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPc) into an insoluble, protease-resistant isoform, PrPres. This aberrant form of the protein eventually accumulates in the central nervous system (CNS) and is associated with the onset of clinical disease [3]. In the initial phases of classical transmissible prion diseases, such as scrapie and TSE infection via the oral route, PrPres propagates in the peripheral lymphoreticular system before trans...|$|R

Representative information was obtained from 4006 dairy farms. The results indicated that in comparison with these control farms a higher proportion <b>of</b> the <b>BSE</b> farms had also kept pigs or poultry, although the difference was not significant, and that a significantly higher proportion <b>of</b> the <b>BSE</b> farms had fed proprietary concentrates and/or milk replacers to their calves...|$|R
