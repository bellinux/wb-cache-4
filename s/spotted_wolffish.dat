50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas minor), {{also known}} as the leopardfish, is a large marine fish of the Anarhichadidae family. In Canada it is {{classified}} as a threatened species, at risk of extinction.|$|E
50|$|The diet of {{this fish}} {{consists}} primarily of hard-shelled invertebrates {{found on the}} bottom, such as crustaceans and mollusks. Echinoderms, tube worms, seaweeds and fish have also {{been reported in the}} gut contents of the <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish.</b>|$|E
50|$|The bottom-dwelling <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{is found}} across the North Atlantic from north of Russia and Scandinavia to the Scotian Shelf, off Nova Scotia, Canada. In Canada the {{population}} declined by about 90% {{from the late}} 1970s through the early 1990s, particularly {{in the northern part}} of its range.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} wolffish {{can be distinguished}} from the <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (A. minor) and the Atlantic wolffish (A. lupus) by its more uniform body colour and its soft, jelly-like musculature. Its head is also proportionally larger to its body and its upper lip is thick and covered with papillae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{occur in}} the Arctic Ocean and {{on both sides of}} the North Atlantic Ocean from Labrador to the Barents Sea. Its {{northern}} limit in Canada is Baffin Bay, although its presence is rare. In the western North Atlantic, it is found off east and west Greenland, on the Labrador Shelf and Grand Banks and less commonly on the Scotian Shelf.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} wolffish {{is protected under}} the Canadian federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). A recovery team for the northern and <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> has almost completed a recovery strategy and plan for both species. The strategy provides a framework for improving the status of wolffish through an enhanced understanding of their life history, potential sources of harm, and implementing management measures such as live release of captured wolffish. The plan also includes habitat stewardship and educational activities designed to involve stakeholders and inform the public.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{related species}} (Atlantic, {{northern}} and <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish)</b> {{occur in the}} north Atlantic. The northern wolffish has loose gelatinous flesh, but the other species are esteemed as food, both fresh and preserved. They are marketed in Britain as [...] "Scotch halibut" [...] and [...] "Scarborough woof", or, simply [...] "woof" [...] {{in other areas of}} the northeast coast, and are a popular ingredient in fish and chips. The oil extracted from the liver is said to be equal in quality to the best cod liver oil.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{population}} structure of <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> Anarhichas minor (Olafsen) in the North Atlantic was investigated by allozyme electrophoresis and by PCR based RFLP variation in mtDNA. Samples {{were collected from}} five sites distributed across the North Atlantic and from second generation Norwegian broodstock. The present data demonstrates that significant differences exist between almost all sampling sites, indicating biologically different groups of individuals, and thus the existence of different management populations of <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> in the North Atlantic. Overall, the data indicated that isolation by distance is weak among <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> at the geographic scale investigated in this study, suggesting that gene flow between neighbouring <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> populations is low. The present study demonstrates {{a high level of}} geographic {{population structure}} between the western Atlantic, middle and eastern Atlantic and Baltic Sea, and thus, the findings should be useful in devising overall management and conservation strategies for the species...|$|E
40|$|Field caught common {{wolffish}} (Anarhichas lupus) and <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (A. minor) {{have been}} raised from fry on dry pellets. The two species have experienced annual fluctuations in temperature between 6 and 12 °C and the results indicates that both species have there best growth rates below 10 °C. With initial average wet weights of 2. 6 g (common wolffish) and 6. 3 g (<b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish),</b> and at equal experimental conditions, the <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> reached four times the wet weight of the common wolffish {{over a period of}} two years and 10 months, 3. 4 and 0. 9 kg respectively. The specific growth rate, however, were 0. 62 %d^- 1 and 0. 58 %d^- 1 respectively, indicating only small differences in growth rates in that period. Estimates based upon the fastest growing fish in the experimental groups indicated that at optimum temperature conditions (approx 6 °C) the <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> will probably reach a total wet weight of 6 kg in two years from start-feeding, while the common wolffish (below 10 °C) will reach a weight of 3 kg in that same period.

40|$|The first {{appearance}} of IgM in lymphocytes varies considerably among fish species. Generally, the {{first appearance}} of B-lymphocytes and immunoglobulins is late in marine species compared to fresh water species, and larvae have reached about 20 – 30 mm in length when IgM is first expressed. Rainbow trout and channel catfish show the first appearances of surface IgM at about 1 week after hatching. Marine species like the sea bass, <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> and cod show IgM positive lymphocytes 1 – 10 weeks after hatching. Transfer of maternal antibody to eggs and embryos {{has been demonstrated}} in several species. Examples are plaice, tilapia, carp, sea bass and salmon, but not cod. The ontogeny of complement component C 3 has been studied in Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) and the <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas minor O.). By Western blotting experiments C 3 was found in unfertilised eggs in the <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> indicating a maternal transfer. RT-PCR analysis revealed C 3 mRNA transcripts from 290 d° in <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> eggs. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation, C 3 was found in liver, brain, kidney and muscle of cod larvae 2 days post-hatching and in intestines, pancreas, heart and gills {{at different stages of}} larval development. Also, C 3 was detectable in halibut larvae in yolk sac, muscle, liver, brain, chondrocytes, spinal chord, eye, heart, intestines and kidney. These studies suggest that complement {{may play a role in}} generation of different organs, not only in the defence against invading pathogens. Lysozyme is a bactericidal enzyme present in mucus, lymphoid tissue and serum of most fish species, but not in cod and wolffish. The enzyme has been detected in oocytes, fertilised eggs and larval stages of fish species like coho salmon, sea bass and tilapia. The activity of other enzymes like the cathepsins has been described in eggs and larvae of sea bass, cod and salmonids. Cathepsins may have a bactericidal role in the skin of fish. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that interact with pathogenic surface structures that result in opsonization, phagocytosis or activation of complement. Lectins have been isolated from the eggs of various fish species...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{habits of}} 7 995 {{individuals}} of three wolffish species {{distributed in the}} north Atlantic were analyzed: 1 016 of northern wolffish (Anarhichas denticulatus), 4 783 of Atlantic wolffish (A. lupus) and 2 196 of <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (A. minor). The individuals sampled were taken in the NAFO Area Divisions 3 NO in spring in the period 2002 - 2005, Div. 3 L in summer in the period 2003 - 2004, Div. 3 M in summer in the period 1993 - 2005, and in the ICES Area Div. IIb in autumn in the period 2004 - 2005. Feeding intensity was higher in the NAFO Area than in the northeast Atlantic (spring-summer vs. autumn), mainly in <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> in Div. 3 M. The importance of each prey taxa was evaluated using the weight percentage. Wolffish species diet showed geographical differences. Ontogenic diet changes and prey variation throughout the studied period were observed, mainly in Atlantic and spotted wolffishes. This two species preyed primarily on bottom (echinoderms, gastropods and bivalves) and benthopelagic (northern shrimp and redfish) organisms on Flemish Cap and Grand Bank. However fish and northern shrimp predation were more important on the Flemish Cap, mainly in <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish,</b> showing periods with higher predation on these prey when the biomass of these prey species increased. This fact {{might have been the}} cause of diet overlap between Atlantic and spotted wolffishes in some periods in Div. 3 M. Less ontogenic, annual and geographical diet variations were found in northern wolffish in NAFO Area, feeding mainly on ctenophores; however in Svalbard area, this species showed to be highly piscivore. Three species showed cannibalism but only in the Div. 3 M...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{the biology}} of the <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> in the Northwest Atlantic were {{obtained}} in 1946 - 67 during research fishing with otter trawls and longlines. Length frequencies {{of males and females}} showed no consistent differences. The longest male was 118 cm and the longest female was 121 cm. Egg diameters and ovarian weights of mature fish indicated that spawning of most <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> occurred during or soon after July-August. Sexual maturity of females over most of the area began at sizes of 75 - 80 cm or larger, but there were indications that maturity may have begun at smaller sizes off West Greenland and on Flemish Cap. Males weighed more than females at the larger sizes. Weights of the larger size-groups in July-September were lower than in other quarters of the year, in agreement with the probable spawning period. The mean vertebral number of 684 spotted wolff ish was 77. 64, with the range being 74 - 80. There {{were no significant differences in}} vertebral means throughout the area, although West Greenland and Flemish Cap data showed possibilities of being lower. The dorsal fin-ray mean for 45 specimens was 75. 90, with the range being 74 - 77. The correlation between dorsal fin-ray and vertebral numbers was highly significant. Invertebrates and fish composed 77 and 23 % by volume respectively of the stomach contents. Echinoderms, which constituted 52 % of the volume, were the most important prey group...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the early}} 2000 s, {{experimental}} rearing of <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish,</b> Anarhichas minor, {{was started in}} Iceland. Health surveillance, carried out at regular intervals during the rearing period, revealed persistent and highly prevalent Kudoa infections of fish muscles which caused great financial losses due to post mortem myoliquefaction. In addition, during the traditional process of drying and smoking wild Atlantic lumpfish, Cyclopterus lumpus, the muscles from some fish almost completely disappear and the fish have to be discarded. To describe the etiological agent responsible for these conditions, <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish,</b> Atlantic wolffish Anarhichas lupus, northern wolffish Anarhichas denticulatus and Atlantic lumpfish were caught off the Icelandic coast and examined {{for the presence of}} Kudoa. We describe a novel myxosporean, Kudoa islandica n. sp., using morphological and molecular data, and show with histopathology that it causes extensive myoliquefaction in three different wild fish hosts, which all are commercially valuable species in Iceland. Although some spore dimensions varied significantly between fish species, the molecular analyses showed that the same parasite was responsible for infection in all fish. The northern wolffish was not found to be infected. Although robustly placed in the Kudoa clade in phylogenetic analyses, K. islandica was phylogenetically distinct from other kudoids. A single myxosporean, K. islandica, is responsible for the infections in the somatic muscles of lumpfish and wolffish, causing extensive post mortem myoliquefaction. This myxosporean is likely to infect other fish species and it is important to study its life cycle in order to evaluate any threat to salmonid culture via the use of lumpfish as a biocontrol for sea lice...|$|E
40|$|A gill {{filament-based}} assay for the cytochrome P 450 1 A (CYP 1 A) -catalysed activity ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) {{was developed}} in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and applied to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), saithe (Pollachius virens), and <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas minor). Exposure to waterborne β-naphthoflavone (βNF; 10 - 6 M) induced branchial EROD activity in all species but the <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish.</b> In rainbow trout exposed to low concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP; 10 - 9 M) and the textile dye indigo (10 - 8 M) the gills responded more rapidly than the liver to BaP, and indigo induced branchial but not hepatic EROD activity. A CYP 1 A-dependent BaP adduct formation was shown in gills of fish exposed to waterborne 3 H-BaP, i. e. the adduct formation was enhanced by βNF and blocked by ellipticine (CYP 1 A inhibitor). The predominant location for BaP adducts was the secondary lamellae (most exposed part of the gill filament), whereas the CYP 1 A enzyme was also present in the primary lamellae of the gill filament. Hence, {{in addition to the}} cell-specific expression of CYP 1 A an important determinant for the localisation of adducts seemed to be the bioavailability of BaP. This idea is supported {{by the fact that the}} CYP 1 A enzyme was induced only in secondary lamellae by BaP (10 - 7 M) and indigo (10 - 6 M), whereas it was induced in both primary and secondary lamellae by 3, 3 ´, 4, 4 ´, 5 -pentachlorobiphenyl (10 - 8 M). Apparently, readily metabolised inducers (BaP and indigo) are biotransformed in the secondary lamellae. My results show that gill filament EROD activity is a sensitive biomarker of exposure to waterborne dioxin-like pollutants, and that the assay has potential for use in monitoring. Furthermore, the results suggest that readily metabolised dioxin-like compounds absorbed via the gills may undergo first-pass metabolism in the gill cells and therefore remain undetected by monitoring of EROD activity in the liver...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the Arctic, in contributing to {{the knowledge of the}} overall ensemble of adaptive processes influencing the evolution of marine organisms, calls for investigations on molecular adaptations in Arctic fish. Unlike the vast majority of Antarctic Notothenioidei, several Arctic species display high hemoglobin multiplicity. The blood of four species, the <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> of the family Anarhichadidae and three Gadidae, contains three functionally distinct major components. Similar to many Antarctic notothenioids, Arctic Liparis tunicatus (suborder Cottoidei, family Liparidae) has one major hemoglobin (Hb 1) accompanied by a minor component (Hb 2). This paper reports the structural and functional characterisation of Hb 1 of L. tunicatus. This hemoglobin shows low oxygen affinity, and pronounced Bohr and Root effects. The amino-acid sequence of the β chain displays an unusual substitution in NA 2 (β 2) at the phosphate-binding site, and the replacement of Val E 11 (β 67) with Ile. Similar to some Antarctic fish Hbs, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra reveal the formation of a ferric penta-coordinated species even at physiological pH. The amino-acid sequences have also been used to gain insight into the evolutionary history of globins of polar fish. L. tunicatus globins appear close to the notothenioid clades as predicted by teleostean phylogenies. Close phylogenetic relationships between Cottoidei and Notothenioidei, together with their life style, seem to be the main factor driving the globin-sequence evolution...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the mislabelling of seafood {{products}} {{has come to}} prominence {{in the fields of}} food science and marine conservation. This study aims to determine whether differences in fish labelling accuracy can be explained by factors associated with governance, legislation and product availability, using cod (Gadus spp.) as a case study. A total of 401 cod products from a range of different supermarket retailers in each of nine countries bordering the North Atlantic Ocean were purchased and genetically identified. The countries sampled were grouped into primarily cod-importing or cod-producing states, and belonging/not-belonging to the European Union. They comprised the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Canada. Estonia showed the highest incidence of mislabelling, with 59. 4 % samples mislabelled, followed by Denmark with 18. 6 %, Canada with 7. 3 %, Sweden with 4. 4 % and finally the United Kingdom with 2. 4 %. Substitute species included species within the Gadidae and Merlucciidae, such as haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), Alaskan pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) and Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), respectively, but also included species more distantly-related to cod, such as snailfish (Liparis spp.), <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas minor) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens), the latter a freshwater species. The remaining countries showed no mislabelling. Neither EU affiliation, production nor the type of product, i. e. fresh or processed, had a significant effect on mislabelling. It is suggested that other factors, such as country-specific differences at social, cultural or legal levels, may be the greater drivers of mislabelling...|$|E
40|$|Data were {{obtained}} from 682 demersal trawls made between 126 and 738 m depths on Flemish Cap in summer during the European Union research surveys in the years 1989 – 94. Despite {{the fact that the}} depth range for all species was not completely covered, analysis of different deep distributions of the 25 most representative species showed that the fauna are zoned with depth. Three faunal assemblages with characteristic catch rates, diversity and dominant species were found on the shelf (126 – 300 m), upper continental slope (300 – 600 m) and middle continental slope (> 600 m). Catch rates were greatest on the shelf and upper continental slope, while diversity was greatest on the middle continental slope. Domi-nance of the commercial species Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the shelf, beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) and Labrador redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) on upper continental slope, and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) on the middle continental slope. This showed an important aspect of the community structure. Diversity patterns may be under-stood in terms of the relationships with predation, competition, environmental heterogeneity and trophic level. Also the influence of the fisheries in the area can modify this structure. On the size-depth correlations, only longnose eel (Synaphobranchus kaupy), longfin hake (Urophycis chestery), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) showed a significant 'bigger-deeper ' relationship (i. e. larger fish in deeper strata), while <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas minor) and witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) showed a negative 'smaller-deeper ' relationship...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} were performed during spring 2004, {{to develop a}} method to elevate the blood plasma level of 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) in male brood stock of <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> Anarhichas minor, and to {{study the effects of}} 11 -KT on sperm production. Intraperitoneal implantation of silastic capsules containing 11 -KT - coconut butter mixture and 11 -KT - sesame oil mixture and intramuscular injection of 11 -KT – propylene glycol mixture were tested. Blood plasma 11 -KT levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Low and medium doses (c. 0. 09 mg/kg and c. 0. 18 mg/kg) of 11 - KT-coconut butter mixture administered in silastic capsules did not elevate the plasma 11 -KT levels. High dose (c. 0. 37 mg/kg) of 11 -KT – coconut butter mixture gave an increase (6. 48 ± 1. 89 ng/ml) of about 3 times pretreatment level (1. 83 ± 0. 36 ng/ml) for one week. 11 -KT- sesame oil mixture (1 mg/kg dose) elevated the plasma 11 -KT levels (22. 58 ± 4. 69 ng/ml) compared to the controls (14. 98 ± 3. 45 ng/ml) for one week. Silastic capsule implants did not maintain the elevation more than one week irrespective of dose or vehicle (coconut butter, sesame oil). Intramuscular injection of 11 -KT dissolved in propylene glycol (1 mg/kg) elevated plasma 11 -KT (99. 16 ± 56. 04 ng/ml) to about 12 times the level of the controls (7. 44 ± 2. 04 ng/ml), and was identified as a more effective method than silastic capsule implantation. Sperm production was studied by examining milt volume, spermatocrit, milt pH and motility of sperm. 11 -KT treatment with intramuscular injection significantly increased milt volume. Mean milt volumes in treatment and control groups were 14. 26 ± 4. 2 ml and 4. 73 ± 2. 8 ml respectively. 11 -KT treatment had no significant effects on spermatocrit, which was very low (2 - 4 %) in both treatment and control fish. Total sperm cell volume in milt was significantly high in treatment group. There {{were no significant differences in}} milt pH and sperm motility between 11 -KT treatment and control groups. The results indicate that 11 -KT induces the spermatogenesis but does not influence the motility of sperm...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2010. BiologyIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 117 - 136) Temperature has profound {{effects on}} the rate of physiological processes in ectothermic vertebrates. Protein metabolism is no exception {{and the effects of}} temperature have mostly been studied with respect to protein synthesis. Temperature generally has a parabolic effect on protein synthesis with a maximum rate being observed at optimal growth temperature. The effect of temperature on protein degradation is poorly understood. The 20 S proteasome is mainly responsible for the degradation of short-lived and oxidatively modified proteins. It has been recently identified as a potentially good proxy for protein degradation in fish. [...] In the first experiment, the relationships between the rate of protein synthesis, 20 S proteasome activity, oxidative stress markers and antioxidant capacity in white muscle of juvenile <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas minor) acclimated at three temperatures (4, 8 and 12 °C) were examined. The rate of protein synthesis was lower at 4 °c than at 8 °c while it was intermediate at 12 °C. Despite the decrease in protein synthesis at low temperature, 20 S proteasome activity was maintained at a high level, reaching 130 % of that of fish acclimated at 8 °c when measured at a common temperature. The oxidative stress markers TBARS and carbonyl-protein content did not change amongst temperature groups, but the concentration of reduced glutathione was higher in cold acclimated fish suggesting a higher antioxidant capacity in this group. The data suggest that lower growth rate at cold temperatures results from both high 20 S proteasome activity and a reduced rate of protein synthesis. [...] In a second experiment, the relationship between specific growth rate (SGR) and 20 S proteasome activity in heart ventricle, liver and white muscle was assessed in fish acclimated at 4 and 12 °C in order to determine if protein degradation via the proteasome pathway could impose a limitation on somatic growth in fish of weight ranging from 150 to 1500 g in mass. The data show that white muscle 20 S proteasome activity is negatively correlated to SGR (partial Pearson's r = - 0. 609) in white muscle at the cold acclimation temperature (4 °C) but not at 12 °C or heart and liver at either temperature. Contrary to the first experiment, the white muscle 20 S proteasome activity was not higher in the group acclimated at 4 °C. This observation suggests that the effect of temperature on protein degradation may change during fish ontogeny. Nevertheless, the results from the first two experiments suggest that interindividual variation of 20 S proteasome activity has an impact on SGR. [...] The third part of this study documents the effects of acclimation to high and low temperature (4 and 12 °C) on mitochondrial and antioxidant capacities in white muscle, heart ventricle and liver of <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish.</b> Following an acclimation period of 51 days, mitochondrial capacity was measured as the activities of the Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport system (CPLXI) and citrate synthase (CS). Glutathione disulfide reductase (GR) and catalase (CAT) activities as well as glutathione concentration were also measured to estimate antioxidant capacities. Following acclimation to 4 °C, mitochondrial capacities were compensated in liver and heart ventricle but not in white muscle. GR activity was increased at cold temperature in the three tissues while CAT activity was increased at the higher acclimation temperature in heart and white muscle. The relationships between mitochondrial and antioxidant enzyme activities, when observed, were always positive. In white muscle only, the activity of 20 S proteasome was positively related to the complex I (r 2 = 0. 450) and to CS (r 2 = 0. 411) activities. Also, only in white muscle, positive relationships were observed between 20 S proteasome, CAT and GSH (only at 12 °C for the latter) activities. These results suggest a connection between mitochondrial capacity and protein degradation by the 20 S proteasome but whether or not this link is mediated by the necessity to degrade protein oxidatively modified by mitochondrial ROS production remains an open question. [...] A supplementary section presents a simple method devised to measure the fractional rate of protein synthesis in fish using the stable isotope labelled tracer (ring-D 5 L-phenylalanine) instead of radioactive phenylalanine. The method takes advantage of the increasingly available technology of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MSMS). The technique was validated by measuring the fractional rate of protein synthesis in the gills of goldfish (Carrassius auratus). The modified technique requires fewer steps compared to previously available procedures and allows studies on fish protein metabolism to be carried out in situations where the use of radioactivity is not possible, such as in free living animals...|$|E

40|$|During winter, {{the coastal}} waters of Newfoundland can be {{considered}} a "freeze risk ecozone" for teleost fishes. The benthic Atlantic (Anarhichas lupus - AW) and <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (A. minor - SW) reside at opposite ends of this ecozone, with the AW facing the greatest risk because of its shallower niche. To resist freezing, AW secretes five times the level of plasma antifreeze protein (AFP) activity than does SW. [...] The main basis for this difference in plasma AFP levels is gene dosage, as AW has approximately three times more AFP genes than SW. Perhaps as a result, AFP transcript levels in liver (the primary source of circulating AFP's) are several times higher in AW. One explanation for these gene and transcript dosage differences is the presence of tandemly arrayed AFP gene repeats in AW that make up two-thirds of its AFP gene pool. Such repeats are not present in SW. AW and SW diverged from a common ancestor {{at a time when the}} ebb and flow of northern glaciations would have resulted in the emergence of "freeze risk ecozones". The duplication/amplification of AFP genes in a subpopulation of ancestral wolffish would have facilitated the exploitation of this high risk habitat, resulting in the divergence and evolution of modem day AW and SW species. [...] Investigations on artificially produced AW/SW hybrids showed that all the AFP genes of SW are likely shared with AW, which supports recent gene amplification as an impetus for speciation. The high dynamism of the AW AFP locus (through high variability in dosage and organisation) was best visualized in the single haplotype inherited by the hybrids. Their intermediate levels of plasma AFPs make these fish unfit for survival within the shallowest part of the "freeze risk ecozone". [...] While the total levels of AFP gene transcripts varied little from winter to summer in both species (especially in the liver), differential expression of members of the two subfamilies of type III AFPs, the SP- and QAE-type genes (appellation based on the ion-exchange Sephadex resins to which each type of isoform binds), was observed. While the expression of the QAE-type transcripts was ubiquitous (both temporally and spatially), that of the SP-type genes seemed to show some level of tissue specificity, which highlights the complex evolutionary history of these genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{urgency to}} {{investigate}} evolutionary adaptations at high latitudes is increasing considerably, {{especially in the}} Arctic. Similar to Antarctic notothenioids, Arctic fish endemic to high latitudes have adapted to thermally stable waters and therefore their physiological systems are finely tuned to the narrow temperature range they are experienced to. Given the short evolutionary time at polar temperatures, Arctic fish may provide valuable information {{on the effects of}} environmental temperature on specific physiological and biochemical traits (1, 2). Fish hemoglobins have been extensively studied, not only for their structural and functional properties, but also because they offer the possibility to investigate functional differentiation and molecular adaptations in species living in a large variety of environmental conditions. In addition, Arctic fish hemoglobins appear to be good models for studying sickling disorders and hemoglobin-polymerisation processes. In this study we report the structural and functional characterisation of the single hemoglobin of Lycodes reticulatus (family Zoarcidae) living on the sea floor near the coasts of northern Europe and North America. The hemoglobin shows a low Bohr effect and no Root effect;it tends to form high-molecular mass polymers at physiological pH and low temperature (5 °C), as shown by gel-filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering. The elucidation of the primary structure has allowed to establish correlation between functional behaviour (no Root effect) and structural properties (polymerisation). The large number of cysteyl residues in the α and β subunits, typical of hemoglobins of many Arctic species, e. g. several gadids, brings about the capability to produce polymers. Also the hemoglobins of Arctogadus glacialis, Boreogadus saida and Gadus morhua (2), similar to L. reticulatus hemoglobin, contain additional His and Cys residues in their primary structure which potentially account for polymerisation (3).

40|$|Data {{from the}} EU (Spain-Portugal) bottom trawl surveys in the Division 3 M of the NAFO Regulatory Area (2004 - 2013) were {{analyzed}} to examine patterns on this zone of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity {{in relation to}} depth. 1699 hauls between 129 and 1460 m in depth were carried out. We focused on the 29 most abundant species, which made up 87. 5 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 600 m. Three main assemblages were identified. A shallow assemblage {{was found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 250 m and include American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Assemblage II (Intermediate) includes the strata with depths between 251 and 600 m and comprises Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulates), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata), longfin hake (Phycis chesteri), deepwater redfish (Sebastes mentella), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and Northern wolffish (Anarichas denticulatus). Three species are present in the two first assemblages: Atlantic wolffish (Anarichas lupus), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and <b>spotted</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarichas minor). Assemblage III (Deep) contains the depth strata greater than 601 m. Marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), scaly dragonfish (Stomias boa), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), sloane’s viperfish (Chaulonius sloani), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemitzii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), threadfin rockling (Gaidropsarus ensis), bean’s sawtoothed eel (Serrivomer beanii), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), lanternfish (Lampanyctus sp), vahls’s eelpout (Lycodes vahlii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborea) and Demon catshark (Apristurus sp) formed Assemblage III. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Extending depth range to 1460 m, no another boundaries were found. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Acadian redfish and golden redfish appear to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the collapse in some species and the permanent fishing activity target to the North Shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp) and Greenland halibut, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
