Furthermore, the logarithmic growth phase (4.5 – 12.0  h) was extended and the U.O.D. 580 value increased compared with the control (Fig.  3 a). Of note, the pH of the culture broth also increased compared with the control (Fig.  3 b). This may be because the pH buffering capacity decreased owing to the decrease in dissolved CO 2.

For the analysis of documentary sources we will refer to two illustrated publications: El Papel Periódico Ilustrado (Illustrated Newspaper), managed by Alberto Urdaneta, and the Revista Ilustrada (Illustrated Magazine), managed by Pedro Carlos Manrique. Such publications define themselves as platforms for the formation of taste and, within a set of political, religious and cultural conditions, allow us to see new processes in the formalisation of <b>specialised</b> <b>culture</b> through institutions such as the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (National School of Fine Arts). The contribution of these illustrated publications becomes a reference to what will be the relation between art critique and the public, formulating notions of aesthetic appreciation and taste that we understand as programmatic in a project of civilisation...|$|E

40|$|This article explores ‘The Black Pool’, a {{docudrama}} {{which was}} made for the BBC’s science documentary series Horizon (BBC 2, 1964 -present) but never transmitted. Aiming to provide a case history of paranoid schizophrenia, Horizon commissioned Alan Plater to dramatise an ‘autobiographical document’ by a doctor who murdered three children in 1972. Its makers debated the most appropriate form and style, raising issues which are relevant to current documentary scholarship in ethics and affect. Similar issues were raised by BBC executives who decided not to broadcast the completed programme. This period produced several programmes which were banned, delayed or not completed, but ‘The Black Pool’ and the circumstances behind it are not well-known. This article draws {{from a range of}} sources, including a new interview with director Simon Campbell-Jones, previously-unseen archival documents and a viewing of the untransmitted programme, not merely to uncover a ‘banning’ but to reflect on ethical and affective questions in current scholarship and to address the nature of science documentary and science docudrama. The article contributes to studies of ‘forgotten drama’ both in terms of this unseen and largely undiscussed programme and in terms of a neglected, <b>specialised</b> <b>culture</b> of drama in documentary strands in general and science documentary strands in particular...|$|E
40|$|The global mussel {{aquaculture}} industry uses specialised spat catching and nursery culture ropes made of multi-filament synthetic {{and natural}} fibres to optimise settlement {{and retention of}} mussels for on-growing. However, the settlement ecology and preferences of mussels are poorly understood and only sparse information exists in a commercial context. This study quantified the settlement preferences of pediveligers and plantigrades of Mytilus galloprovincialis on increasingly complex surfaces and settlement locations at a micro spatial scale on and within ropes under commercial hatchery operating conditions using optical microscopy and X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT). M. galloprovincialis has clear settlement preferences for more complex materials and high selectivity for settlement sites from the pediveliger through to the plantigrade stage. Pediveligers of M. galloprovincialis initially settle inside <b>specialised</b> <b>culture</b> ropes. Larger pediveligers were located close to the exterior of ropes as they increased in size over time. In contrast, smaller individuals were located deeper inside of the ropes over time. This study demonstrates that X-ray µCT is an excellent non-destructive technique for mapping settlement and attachment sites of individuals as early as one day post settlement, and quantifies the number and location of settled individuals on and within ropes {{as a tool to}} understand and optimise settlement in complex multi-dimensional materials and environments...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{in vitro}} proliferative {{responses}} of naive T cells to antigens other than superantigens and alloantigens have been little studied. Two tissue culture techniques {{have been reported}} which support in vitro antigen priming of T cells. These methods require various degrees of cellular manipulation and culture vessels other than standard microtitre plates. We report here that primary proliferative responses to non-recall antigens can be readily obtained using unselected human PBMC prepared from either adult or cord blood. Cells proliferate whether cultured in 2 ml volumes, 200 microliters microcultures or 20 microliters hanging drops. The variation in the proliferative responses increases as the culture volume is decreased such that considerable errors are apparent when Terasaki culture plates are used. The lowest stimulation indices are also observed in the 20 microliters microcultures. Nevertheless, similar response patterns are noted for the differing culture vessels; generally, proliferative responses reach peak magnitude only after 7 days of culture. The initial concentration of PBMC in culture influences {{the magnitude of the}} reactions such that halving the cell numbers frequently leads to greater than 50 % reduction in the measured responses. The results {{of this study indicate that}} neither a <b>specialised</b> <b>culture</b> vessel nor complex cellular manipulation are required for in vitro priming of T cell immunity. Consequently, this area of immunology should be readily amenable to further study...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Biomedical Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009. The {{role of the}} mycobacteriology {{laboratory}} in the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis has become increasingly important in the human-immunodeficiency virus era. Due to the paucibacillary nature of childhood mycobacterial disease, laboratory optimisation of mycobacterial cultivation is necessary for paediatric clinical management and epidemiological surveillance. Previous {{studies have shown that}} growth supplements markedly improve the recovery rate and time-to-detection in mycobacterial cultures. In this study, we hypothesised that <b>specialised</b> <b>culture</b> media and meat-based growth supplements would improve the recovery rate and time-to-detection in clinical samples from paediatric patients. Pulmonary sputa and gastric aspirates and extra pulmonary fine needle aspiration biopsies were processed from children less than 15 years of age routinely investigated for mycobacterial disease. The processed clinical samples were split into a control aliquot that was cultured in liquid and solid media without growth supplement, and an intervention aliquot cultured on supplemented media. The effect of enrichment of the culture media was then calculated by comparison to the control. These results indicated a significant reduction in the time-to-detection, 18. 5 to 12. 4 days, and an improved primary recovery rate of 14 % in paediatric samples when cultured in liquid media enriched with a nutrient meat broth growth supplement. The findings of this study confirm the value of optimising mycobacterial cultivation with the use of growth supplements to enhance the detection of childhood mycobacterial disease...|$|E
40|$|In 1969, Quine enjoined {{philosophers}} {{to leave}} matters of ontology to {{the determination of}} scientists with the suggestion that a thorough-going naturalism – a philosophical position he considered to be necessitated by the empirical successes {{of the natural sciences}} – can recognise “no place for a prior philosophy. ” Implicit in Quine’s view are the suppositions that the sciences themselves engage in ontology and that, ultimately, they are better equipped than philosophy to undertake such work. As a consequence of Quine’s injunction, and the wide-spread deference with which it was met, a hierarchy of influence has come to be instituted and broadly accepted within philosophy of science in which, science is understood to defer to nature and philosophy to science. Drawing on the late works of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, this paper will challenge Quine’s characterisation of scientific work as intrinsically ontological in orientation and will advocate a renewed philosophical interest in ontology. It will suggest the scientist is motivated less by ontological concerns, than by the desire to gain a foothold and intervene and that, as such, her ontology is likely to be uncritical, objectivist, and somewhat ad hoc, thereby providing less than ideal working conditions for the philosopher concerned to understand how scientific knowledge is built and substantiated. By contrast, it will be the position of this paper that phenomenologically-oriented ontological models, founded in evidence drawn from scientists’ actual practice, will offer the valuable prospect of an important corrective for the scientist’s ontology, and, in so doing, will suggest fruitful ground upon which philosophers and scientists might constructively engage with one another. In an effort to demonstrate these ideas more concretely, the bulk of the paper is taken up with a thought experiment conducted in three acts. In each case, an ontological understanding is sketched and its consequences for our conceptions of scientific and philosophic practice are briefly explored. Act one engages the classic understanding of a Kosmotheoros in confrontation with a World as Object; act two takes more seriously the consequences of our embodiment, recognising the limitations it introduces and the natal bond it seems automatically to afford us with the world; act three retains this recognition of both our embodiment and our embeddedness within a natural world, while also acknowledging our implantation within certain instituted social and cultural settings that are both constituted by and constitutive of us as living beings. With the introduction of each new ontological model, our conceptions surrounding the nature of scientific knowledge and practice will be made to shift, as will our understanding of our own philosophical practice. In adopting an increasingly realistic sense of our position with respect to the world, we will find that we move from what I suggest is the untenable image of science as ontology and philosophy as verification and legitimation to a recognition of science as a kind of <b>specialised</b> <b>culture</b> and philosophy as a sort of poetry or literature. Finally, we will find that Quine’s linear and unidirectional hierarchy is forced to give way to a more hermeneutic conception...|$|E
