40|$|The {{participation}} {{of people in}} online communities is rapidly increasing and the shared data, information and knowledge in these communities is becoming greater and more diverse. The social community Facebook. com has over 300 million active members and over 40 billion photos uploaded to the <b>site</b> each month. <b>Wikipedia.</b> <b>org</b> has more than 75, 000 active contributors, who are working on 10 million articles in more than 260 languages. The opportunities of these large sources of information gathered in communities are being discovered by companies. Harley Davidson has established a large community where motorbikes and accessories are presented and discussed by members. Moreover, members interact about user- and maintenance tips. Participation in this community {{has been found to}} increase the commitment and affection for the Harley Davidson brand. The toy manufacturer LEGO has over 2. 5 million participants in their community, 40 % are adults, and 3, 000 new designs are uploaded to this community weekly. The best designs are produced and sold in stores. The use of co-creation communities seems promising. However, the main business model elements that strengthen successful co-creation communities have not been defined yet. The elements of these communities that create value, that require resources, and that incur costs have not been explored in detail. The objective {{of this article is to}} provide insights into three main business model elements of co-creation communities: the value proposition, the value network, and the revenue model. These elements will be specified for distinctive new product development phases. The insights are obtained from our in-depth study of seven co-creation communities. We will conclude with some recommendations for creating successful co-creation communities...|$|R

This second edition partly expanded and partly abridged the first edition. As the “Magazin’s” author, Ludwig Philippson, explained in his introduction, he decided to publish a second edition of the “Israelitisches Predigt- und Schul-Magazin” after the first edition sold out despite a large print-run. In addition to the "Israelitisches Predigt- und Schul-Magazin," Philippson founded the “Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums,” which was published for 86 years. The author was well-known for his influence in the Haskalah movement. Philippson was an advocate for Jewish education, thus his "Magazin" had a section with essays promoting religious education {{and the expansion of}} knowledge of Jewish history. Essays covered topics like philosophy of Maimonides and the persecution of Jews in Spain and Portugal. The “Magazin” also featured sermons for festivals, Sabbaths, and occasions like funerals, confirmations, and marriages.

40|$|Background: Supplemental {{educational}} {{reading material}} {{is of no}} value to patients {{if it is not}} read and comprehended. Objective: Using standardized research tools, online patient education materials were comparatively assessed for readability and length in words to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} widely utilized sources. Methods: Three sources of patient-education material on the internet (WebMD. com, <b>Wikipedia.</b> <b>org,</b> and MedicineOnline. com) were compared with materials produced by the American Academy of Dermatology for readability utilizing Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Flesch Reading Ease Scale. Automated word counts were used to determine the length of each educational piece. Results: The information presented in American Academy of Dermatology electronic pamphlets on the internet is significantly harder to comprehend than MedicineOnline. com, but easier than <b>Wikipedia.</b> <b>org.</b> The latter <b>site</b> proved significantly harder to comprehend than all other sources. The American Academy of Dermatology electronic pamphlets and MedicineOnline. com materials were the most concise, averaging 1, 200 words or less, although this was not a statistically significant difference in length compared to other online patient-education resources. No single source of online patient-education material demonstrates optimal features with regard to each of these parameters. Limitations: Only 15 topic areas in the four most commonly accessed sources of patient information were analyzed in this study. Conclusion: No single source of commonly used internet patient-education material demonstrates optimal features with regard to readability, length, and presence of photographic illustrations. These educational materials should target a length of 1, 200 words, be illustrated with clinical images, and readability should correspond with the national average reading level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Wikipedia</b> (www. <b>wikipedia.</b> <b>org)</b> is {{an online}} encyclopedia, {{available}} {{in more than}} 100 languages and comprising over 1 million articles in its English version. If we consider each Wikipedia article as a node and each hyperlink between articles as an arc we have a “Wikigraph”, a graph that represents the link structure of Wikipedia.

The timestamps indicate the creation and update dates of each page, and this allows us to do a detailed analysis of the Wikipedia evolution over time. In the first part of this study we characterize this evolution in terms of users, editions and articles; in the second part, we depict the temporal evolution of several topological properties of the Wikigraph. The insights obtained from the Wikigraphs can be applied to large Web graphs from which the temporal data is usually not available. I...|$|R

In addition to strengthening Jewish women to their faith, the JFB also wanted to enhance the value of housekeeping. It sought to develop young women's skills as future housewives; it also offered vocational training for young women so that, if necessary they could support themselves independently.

Our main results are the following: (1) Compact output bids that mix both URLs and hosts have the same specification power as more lengthy input bids; (2) Output bidding can increase the recall of relevant queries; and (3) Output and input biding can be combined into a hybrid mechanism that combines the benefits of both. 1...|$|R
