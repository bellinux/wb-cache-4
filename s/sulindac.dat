40|$|BACKGROUND [...] <b>Sulindac</b> is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug which induces {{regression of}} colonic polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Animal and in vitro {{studies have shown that}} both the sulphide metabolite of <b>sulindac,</b> which is able to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase, and the sulphone metabolite, which lacks this ability, are able to inhibit the growth of colonic carcinoma cells. The exact mechanism by which these effects occurs is not known. AIMS [...] To examine the effect of <b>sulindac</b> sulphide and <b>sulindac</b> sulphone on the expression of APC messenger RNA (mRNA), and on the proliferation of colonic carcinoma cells in vitro. METHODS [...] The colonic carcinoma cell line LIM 1215 was treated with <b>sulindac</b> sulphide and <b>sulindac</b> sulphone (10 microM or 100 microM) for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted and APC mRNA was quantitated using competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Measurements of cell number, cell proliferation, and prostaglandin E 2 concentrations were also made. RESULTS [...] A significant increase in APC mRNA was observed after treatment with 10 microM of both <b>sulindac</b> sulphide and <b>sulindac</b> sulphone (control: 37. 2 (19. 7); 10 microM <b>sulindac</b> sulphide: 129 (112. 8); 10 microM <b>sulindac</b> sulphone: 207. 7 (102. 9) pg/(g total RNA) (p < 0. 05). Prostaglandin E 2 concentrations were significantly reduced after treatment with <b>sulindac</b> sulphide, but not after <b>sulindac</b> sulphone.

We studied the effect of <b>sulindac,</b> and its metabolite <b>sulindac</b> sulfide, on the proliferation of HT- 29 colon adenocarcinoma cells. Both compounds reduced the proliferation rate of these cells, changed their morphology, and caused them to accumulate in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dihydroxy bile acids {{induce a}} bicarbonate-rich hypercholeresis when {{secreted}} into canalicular bile in unconjugated form; the mechanism is cholehepatic shunting. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify a xenobiotic that induces hypercholeresis by a similar mechanism. METHODS: Five organic acids (<b>sulindac,</b> ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, and norfloxacin) were infused into rats with biliary fistulas. Biliary recovery, bile flow, and biliary bicarbonate were analyzed. <b>Sulindac</b> transport was further characterized using Tr(-) rats (deficient in mrp 2, a canalicular transporter for organic anions), the isolated perfused rat liver, and hepatocyte membrane fractions. RESULTS: In biliary fistula rats, <b>sulindac</b> was recovered in bile in unconjugated form and induced hypercholeresis of canalicular origin. Other compounds underwent glucuronidation and were not hypercholeretic. In the isolated liver, <b>sulindac</b> had delayed biliary recovery and induced prolonged choleresis, consistent with a cholehepatic circulation. <b>Sulindac</b> was secreted normally in Tr(-) rats, indicating that its canalicular transport did not require mrp 2. In the perfused liver, <b>sulindac</b> inhibited cholyltaurine uptake, and when coinfused with cholyltaurine, induced acute cholestasis. With both basolateral and canalicular membrane fractions, <b>sulindac</b> inhibited cholyltaurine transport competitively. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Sulindac</b> is secreted into bile in unconjugated form by a canalicular bile acid transporter and is absorbed by cholangiocytes, inducing hypercholeresis.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that <b>sulindac,</b> an anti-inflammatory drug, enhances {{the killing of}} cancer cells, but not normal cells, under conditions of oxidative stress, by mechanisms unrelated to its cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. To further study the protective effect of <b>sulindac</b> on cells exposed to oxidative stress, we have investigated the effect of <b>sulindac</b> on rat cardiac myocytes subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation, {{as well as in}} a Langendorff model of myocardial ischemia. Low levels of <b>sulindac</b> could protect cardiac myocytes against cell death due to hypoxia/reoxygenation. In the Langendorff model <b>sulindac</b> provided significant protection against cell death, when the drug was fed to the animals before the removal of the heart for the Langendorff procedure. The results indicate that the primary protective effect of <b>sulindac</b> in these experiments does not involve its role as a COX inhibitor. Numerous signaling pathways have been implicated in myocardial protective mechanisms, many of which involve fluctuations in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The results suggest that low levels of <b>sulindac</b> can induce a preconditioning response, triggered by ROS, to protect cardiac tissues against oxidative damage. Blocking of preconditioning pathways by administration of the PKC blocker chelerythrine abrogated the ischemic protection afforded by <b>sulindac.</b> Secondly, after feeding of <b>sulindac,</b> two end-effectors of preconditioning, inducible nitric oxide synthase and heat shock protein 27, were found to be markedly induced in the heart, dependent on PKC.

Three groups of mice were studied {{all of which were}} fed AIN- 76 A diet: one group was fed AIN- 76 A diet alone, a second group received <b>sulindac</b> 200 p. p. m. premixed in the diet and a third group received <b>sulindac</b> 180 p. p. m. added in drinking water.

Mice receiving <b>sulindac</b> developed fewer tumors in the intestine overall; the major decrease in tumor development after <b>sulindac</b> was seen in the small intestine regardless of route of administration. In the large intestine, however, <b>sulindac</b> significantly increased the incidence, multiplicity and volume of tumors in the colon of ApcMin mice, a regional response to <b>sulindac</b> differing from previous reports. Quantitative measurements of apoptosis, Bax and Bcl-xL protein expression in the ApcMin mice revealed the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL expression and apoptosis increased in the small intestine but decreased in the cecum, consistent with the regional tumorigenesis observed after <b>sulindac.</b> These findings thus suggest involvement of Bax and apoptosis in tumors developing after <b>sulindac</b> treatment in this mouse model...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sulindac</b> reduces {{colorectal}} cancer risk in genetically susceptible humans and animals. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are incompletely understood.

We determined the effects of <b>sulindac</b> on apoptosis and expression of death receptor (DR) - 4 and DR 5, beta-catenin, and p 21 in normal-appearing colorectal epithelium. Biopsies were obtained before and after <b>sulindac</b> treatment during two chemoprevention studies. Patients (n = 18) with hereditary nonpolyposis {{colorectal cancer}} (HNPCC) received 150 mg <b>sulindac</b> bd for 4 weeks in a placebo-controlled crossover design.

Apoptosis was assessed by M 30 staining and expression patterns of DR 4, DR 5, beta-catenin, and p 21 were studied immunohistochemically. In HNPCC patients, apoptotic indices were similar following placebo and <b>sulindac.</b> Also in FAP patients, apoptotic indices were not different after <b>sulindac</b> compared with pretreatment values.
