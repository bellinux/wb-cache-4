40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{government}} intervention in the housing market on prices, quantities and welfare in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents. We consider (i) the tax-deductibility of mortgage interest payments, and (ii) the exclusion of owner-occupied rents from taxation. We go beyond the existing literature and study both steady state effects as well as effects along the transition between <b>steady</b> states. <b>When</b> comparing <b>stationary</b> equilibria, we find that reducing asymmetries in the treatment of owner-occupied and rental housing in the tax code leads to welfare gains for all agents, as does the elimination of the mortgage interest deductibility. However, during the transition to the new steady-states, the welfare impacts are more varied. All agents benefit from the removal of the deduction of mortgage interest rates, due to general-equilibrium effects on prices and an increase in lump-sum transfers through higher government revenues. However, the introduction of taxes on imputed rents leads to significant welfare losses for all households that consume owner-occupied housing. This highlights the importance of focusing on the transition period for policy analysis...|$|R

5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable <b>when</b> <b>stationary</b> and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable <b>when</b> <b>stationary</b> and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} investigation of two coupled thermokinetic oscillators. The {{system is the}} exothermic iron-(III) -nitrate catalyzed oxidation of ethanol with hydrogen peroxide to ethanal and acetic acid. The coupling of two continuous flow stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) is performed in four different ways: via coupling of the cooling circuits, via exchange of reaction mass, and via combinations of both in equal and opposite directions. The experiments are modeled {{by a set of}} ordinary differential equations,which we have used in previous studies of the uncoupled free running system in a single CSTR. The model calculations predict three different kinds of qualitative behavior before and after the coupling. First, the qualitative behavior can remain unchanged, i. e. one gets <b>steady</b> states <b>when</b> <b>steady</b> states are coupled or one gets periodic oscillations when periodic oscillations are coupled. Second, oscillations can emerge <b>when</b> <b>stationary</b> states are coupled (rhythmogenesis) and third, oscillations are suppressed and change into steady states (phase death) when the coupling is activated. All these types of behavior can be verified in the experiments. Generating thermal oscillations by coupling can also lead to significant safety implications. We demonstrate experimentally a safe and an unsafe way of performing the rhythmogenesis experiment guided by our model calculations. © Copyright 2011 Elsevier B. V., All rights reserved.
