5|$|Stanton {{herself was}} marginalized in the women's {{suffrage}} movement after publication of The Woman's Bible. From that time forward, Susan B. Anthony took {{the place of}} honor among the majority of suffragettes. Stanton was never again invited to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> place of honor on stage at the NAWSA convention.|$|E
5|$|In 367BC, plebeians {{were allowed}} to stand for the consulship, and this implicitly opened both the {{censorship}} {{as well as the}} dictatorship to plebeians. Around this time, the practice of electing military tribunes with consular authority was dropped. In 366BC, in an effort by the patricians to reassert their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. These two offices, the praetorship and the curule aedileship (so-called because its holder, like consuls and praetors, had the right to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> curule seat), were at first open only to patricians, but within a generation they were open to plebeians as well.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that women should be denied participation in the proceedings, even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead to sit with the women.|$|E

5|$|The Master and Mistress take Lad {{on their}} annual fall camping {{trip to the}} {{mountains}} for two weeks. During the trip, Lad playfully teases a bear, leading to a fight, which the master ends by scaring off the bear. At {{the end of the}} trip, Lad is accidentally left tied to a tree at the camp site. While his owners are returning to find their missing dog, Lad is trapped by a forest fire. When the bear he fought earlier rushes past with singed fur, Lad chews through his rope and follows the other animals of the forest to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearby lake. When his owners arrive, he runs through the burning fire to join them, blistering his paws on some coals.|$|E
5|$|The {{medical school}} {{facilities}} at Dartmouth College <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complex {{on the north}} side of Dartmouth's campus and includes academic, administrative, research, and presentation facilities. Dartmouth Medical School is served by two libraries, the Dana Biomedical Library and the Matthews-Fuller Health Sciences Library, which together offer over 240,000 volumes. Off-campus housing is available through Dartmouth College. In addition, the Class of 1978 Life Sciences Center was completed in August 2011 at a cost of $92 million, and as part of its design a central lawn is surrounded by the Remsen and Vail Laboratories and Dana.|$|E
5|$|Tute in Pairs {{is played}} by four players—two teams of two players each—and every player {{receives}} ten cards (since there are 40 cards, this means {{that all of the}} cards in the deck are dealt). The last card to be dealt is shown {{to the rest of the}} players and becomes the trump. This card belongs to the player it was dealt to. The four people <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circle, with opponent players to the right and left of each player, and players sitting opposite their team members.|$|E

25|$|When {{dining in}} a {{traditional}} tatami room, sitting upright on the floor is common. In a casual setting, men usually sit with their feet crossed and women sit with both legs to one side. Only men are supposed to sit cross-legged. The formal way of sitting for both sexes is a kneeling style known as seiza. To <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> seiza position, one kneels {{on the floor with}} legs folded under the thighs and the buttocks resting on the heels.|$|E
25|$|The {{youngest}} {{children were}} employed as ventilation tenters. Ventilation {{in the mines}} was controlled {{by a series of}} wooden doors across the passages, these children would <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> niche dug out of the wall, opening and closing these doors to allow miners and tubs to pass. It was common for them to sit in the dark for up to 8 hours a day. Other young children were employed as pony tenters, they would feed and water the pit ponies in the underground stables.|$|E
25|$|Besides his diverse {{business}} interests in Sydney, Sir Saul Samuel {{was the first}} Jew to become a magistrate, to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> colonial Parliament and to become a minister of the Crown.

25|$|A funnel {{water slide}} {{requires}} riders to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2 or 4 seater round tube. Riders drop from inside a tunnel {{out into the}} ride's main element shaped like a funnel on its side. Riders oscillate {{from one side to}} the other until they exit through the back of the funnel and into a splash pool. The most common type of funnel is the ProSlide Tornado which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003. In 2010, WhiteWater West began developing a competing product known as the Abyss, utilizing a raft that holds up to six riders.|$|E

A race is held at the {{beginning}} of the festival to see who will be the first to deliver the plaster to the mosque. Women and girls carry water to the pits before the festival and to the workmen on the mosque during it. Members of Djenné's masons guild direct the work, while elderly members of the community, who have already participated in the festival many times, <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> place of honor in the market square watching the proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Police {{also often}} carry an impact weapon - a baton, {{also known as}} a nightstick. The common nightstick and the side handle baton have been {{replaced}} in many locations by expandable batons such as the Monadnock Auto-Lock Expandable Baton or ASP baton. One advantage of the collapsible baton is that the wearer can comfortably <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> patrol vehicle while still wearing the baton on their duty belt. The side handle night stick usually has to be removed before entering the vehicle. Many departments also use less-lethal weapons like mace, pepper spray, electroshock guns, and beanbag shotgun rounds.|$|E

25|$|In June 1840, Mott {{attended}} the General Anti-Slavery Convention, {{better known as}} the World's Anti-Slavery Convention, in London, England. In spite of Mott's status as one of six women delegates, before the conference began, the men voted to exclude the American women from participating, and the female delegates were required to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> segregated area. Anti-slavery leaders didn't want the women's rights issue to become associated with the cause of ending slavery worldwide and dilute the focus on abolition. In addition, the social mores of the time generally prohibited women's participation in public political life. Several of the American men attending the convention, including William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, protested the women's exclusion. Garrison, Nathaniel Peabody Rogers, William Adam, and African American activist Charles Lenox Remond sat with the women in the segregated area.|$|E
25|$|Tipu's {{persecution}} of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, {{there were a}} significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the battle of Pollilur, 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ghagra cholis and entertain the court as nautch girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of negroes, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.|$|E
