5|$|The Salton Trough {{is part of}} {{the complex}} plate {{boundary}} between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate where it undergoes a transition from the continental transform of the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> system to the series of short spreading centers of the East Pacific Rise linked by oceanic transforms in the Gulf of California. The two main right–lateral strike-slip fault strands that extend across {{the southern part of the}} trough are the Elsinore Fault Zone/Laguna Salada Fault to the western side of the trough and the Imperial Fault to the east. The Imperial Fault is linked to the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> through the Brawley Seismic Zone, which is a spreading center beneath the southern end of the Salton Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area is {{well known}} for the {{complexity}} of its landforms that are the result of millions of years by the forces of plate tectonics, since the region is located {{in the middle of a}} meeting point between two plates. Nine out of eleven distinct assemblages have been identified in a single county, Alameda. Diverse assemblages adjoin in complex arrangements due to offsets along the many faults (both active and stable) in the area. As a consequence, many types of rock and soil are found in the region. The oldest rocks are metamorphic rocks that are associated with granite in the Salinian Block west of the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault.</b> These were formed from sedimentary rocks of sandstone, limestone, and shale in uplifted seabeds. Volcanic deposits also exist in the Bay Area, left behind by the movement of the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault,</b> whose movement sliced a subduction plate and allowed magma to briefly flow to the surface.|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} of the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault,</b> the {{southern}} edge of the Transverse Ranges has been in a state of contraction during the Quaternary Period, with active reverse faulting that has uplifted San Gabriel Mountains. The west-striking (and range-bounding) Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Faults, as well as the San Cayetano Fault and Santa Susana Faults all exhibit a component of left-lateral strike-slip motion and share a similar trend.|$|E

This would allow Zorin to create his own microchip monopoly in the booming computer industry.|$|R

5|$|With the San Jacinto Fault Zone to the northwest, the Elsinore fault to the south-southwest, and the Imperial fault {{centered}} {{directly under}} the Imperial Valley, the area frequently encounters seismic activity, including moderate and damaging earthquakes. Other events in 1852, 1892, 1915, 1940, 1942, and 1987 have impacted the region. More small to moderate events of less than 6.0 (local magnitude) have occurred in this area than any other section of the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{criminal}} genius Lex Luthor {{plans to}} make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of barren desert land, then using a nuclear explosion on a weak point in the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault,</b> sinking California and leaving Luthor's desert as the new West Coast, greatly increasing its value. Upon learning the U.S Army and U.S. Navy will launch a twin nuclear missile test, he diverts one missile to the weak spot, after his incompetent henchman Otis accidentally redirects the first missile to the wrong place.|$|E
5|$|The <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> has offset Indian stone rings, {{its path}} is buried by sediments from Lake Cahuilla. During the Pleistocene, this fault was {{relatively}} inactive {{compared to the}} Imperial Fault and the San Jacinto Fault. Other faults that crossed the shores of Lake Cahuilla are the Extra fault zone, which divides a northern more stable basin from a southern basin that underwent tectonic extension and slightly slower sedimentation, the Coyote Creek Fault (whose movement rate has been estimated from displacement of Lake Cahuilla sediments and probably accelerated {{during the time of}} Cahuilla's highstand), the Superstition Mountain Fault which extends from the Coyote Creek fault, the San Jacinto Fault which runs parallel to part of Cahuilla's western shore, was last active in 820-1280, 1280, 1440-1637 and 1440-1640 and whose fault trace could be buried beneath sediments from Lake Cahuilla, and the Elmore Ranch fault which displays evidence of after-lake activity in the Superstition Hills. Faults on the lake floor include the Brawley Seismic Zone, potentially the Cerro Prieto Fault, the Imperial Fault, and the Kane Springs Faults. The Imperial Fault may have ruptured together with a rupture of the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> during a highstand of Lake Cahuilla, and was last active during the 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake.|$|E

5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault,</b> and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E
5|$|Tectonics-based {{events will}} {{continue}} to occur well into {{the future and the}} surface will be steadily reshaped by tectonic uplift, extrusions, and erosion. Mount Vesuvius can be expected to erupt about 40 times over the next 1,000 years. During the same period, about five to seven earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater should occur along the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault,</b> while about 50 magnitude 9 events may be expected worldwide. Mauna Loa should experience about 200 eruptions over the next 1,000 years, and the Old Faithful Geyser will likely cease to operate. The Niagara Falls {{will continue to}} retreat upstream, reaching Buffalo in about 30,00050,000 years.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Cape Mendocino {{earthquakes}} (or 1992 Petrolia earthquakes) occurred {{along the}} Lost Coast of Northern California on April 25 and 26. The three largest events were the M7.2 thrust mainshock that struck near the unincorporated community of Petrolia midday on April 25 and two primary strike-slip aftershocks measuring 6.5 and 6.6 that followed {{early the next}} morning. The sequence encompassed both interplate and intraplate activity that {{was associated with the}} Mendocino Triple Junction, a complex system of three major faults (including the Cascadia subduction zone, <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault,</b> and Mendocino Fracture Zone) that converge near Cape Mendocino. The total number of aftershocks that followed the events exceeded 2,000.|$|E

5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California {{are a result of}} two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E
5|$|The lake formed {{several times}} over during the Holocene when water from the Colorado River was {{diverted}} into the Salton Trough. This tectonic depression forms the northern basin of the Gulf of California, but it was separated from the sea proper by {{the growth of the}} Colorado River Delta. Such changes in river courses may have been caused by earthquakes among the numerous faults that cross the region, such as the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault.</b> Conversely, {{it is possible that the}} weight of the water itself triggered earthquakes. During its existence, Lake Cahuilla formed strandlines and various beach deposits such as gravel bars and travertine deposits.|$|E
5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E
500|$|Bond and Sutton {{infiltrate}} Zorin's {{mine and}} discover his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward and <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>faults,</b> which would {{cause them to}} flood, causing the Silicon Valley area to be permanently submerged underwater. A larger bomb {{is also in the}} mine to destroy a [...] "geological lock" [...] that prevents the two faults from moving at the same time. Once the bombs are in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mines, killing the mine workers. Sutton escapes, while Bond and May Day are stranded in the mine. When May Day realizes that Zorin has abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb by putting the device onto a handcar and pushing it out of the mine. When the handcar's brakes block their attempt, May Day stays on it to make it roll clear of the mine; once outside, the bomb explodes, killing her.|$|R
25|$|Though {{the shock}} was {{centered}} near Parkfield, {{the event is}} referred to as the Fort Tejon earthquake, because that was the location of the greatest damage. Fort Tejon is just north of the junction of the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> and Garlock <b>Faults,</b> where the Tehachapi, San Emigdio, and Sierra Pelona Transverse Ranges come together.|$|R
40|$|The {{ratio of}} short- to long-period {{amplitude}} {{is expressed in}} terms of apparent stress, rigidity times energy over moment (tsEe/Mo), for 277 earthquakes in California. A map showing the apparent stresses is compiled. In general, the Mendocino and <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>faults</b> as well as the Gulf of California area are regions of large surface-wave excitation and little short-period radiation (low apparent stress). Away from the main fault zones, the apparent stresses tend to be higher. Regions of conspicuously low surface-wave excitation (high apparent stress) are the Laguna Salada-Sierra Juarez region in northern Baja California, the California-Nevada border region north of Bishop, and the region associated with the bend of the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> between <b>San</b> Bernardino and San Gorgonio Moun-tain. A detailed comparison of earthquakes with accurately-known depths at Parkfield and Borrego Mountain indicates two important differences in apparent stresses between these two source regions. The apparent stress at all depths is larger at ~orrego Mountain than at Parkfield, and it increases with depth at Borrego Mountain, whereas it remains constant at all depths at Parkfield. The explana-tion for the variation of surface-wave excitation (apparent stress) is not known for certain, but it could be related to variations in true stress...|$|R
5|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused earthquakes along the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> and other faults when they were already close to rupture. Such lake-induced seismicity is known from reservoirs and referred to as induced seismicity. Alternatively, earthquakes could have caused course changes in the Colorado River that then caused the lake to flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some earthquakes such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} {{considerable}} vertical relief in its landscapes {{that are not}} in the alluvial plains leading to the bay or in inland valleys. The topography, and geologic history, of the Bay Area can largely be attributed to the compressive forces between the Pacific Plate and the North American plate. The three major ridge structures in the Bay Area, part of the Pacific Coast Range, are all roughly parallel to the major faults. The Santa Cruz Mountains along the San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Hills in Marin County follow the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault,</b> The Berkeley Hills, San Leandro Hills and their southern ridgeline extension through Mission Peak roughly follow the Hayward fault, and the Diablo Range, which includes Mount Diablo and Mount Hamilton and runs along the Calaveras fault.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
5000|$|Diablo Canyon was {{originally}} designed to withstand a 6.75 magnitude earthquake from four faults, including the nearby <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> and Hosgri <b>faults,</b> but was later upgraded to withstand a 7.5 magnitude quake.

25|$|It is {{primarily}} {{the likelihood of}} a severe earthquake on the Hayward or <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>faults</b> that has spurred a substantial effort to retrofit and sometimes replace large structures at risk, particularly the eastern and western spans of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the San Francisco and Oakland city halls, and numerous elevated rail, road, and pedestrian structures and overpasses. Much work remains {{to be done in the}} region and progress is being hampered by budget constraints imposed by trickle down federal-state-regional deficits, design and construction delays due to state and local political bickering over design, and unexpectedly high steel and cement costs due to the extensive construction work being done in China. Nonetheless, Bay area cities and counties have long expected a major earthquake and as a result all building in the past 30 years has been required to adhere to strict guidelines regarding earthquake resistance. Of all the earthquake prone regions of the world, the San Francisco Bay Area is among the most prepared structurally for the eventuality of a major quake while remaining grossly unprepared in both civil response planning and in the retrofitting of older buildings.|$|R

5|$|July 1986 was {{an unusually}} active month for {{moderate}} to strong earthquakes in California, with three events occurring {{in less than}} two weeks, each with mild to moderate effects. The first of these shocks came on July 8 with a M6.0 event on the Banning fault near Palm Springs and the second event occurred off the coast of Oceanside as a M5.8 shock on July 13. While the earthquake off the southern California coast occurred in an area thought to be capable of generating a tsunami, the earthquake near Palm Springs occurred on a portion of the southern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> system that has been designated a seismic gap, and is a likely location for a very large earthquake. The same seismic gap theory (regarding the potential for a future large earthquake) had also been presented for the White Mountains area near Chalfant.|$|E
