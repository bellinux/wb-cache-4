5000|$|Using wings from a 1946 Luscombe 8, cut and re-formed {{into the}} gull-wing configuration, {{the cabin and}} forward {{fuselage}} section were formed of steel tubes.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between the Musketeer line and other similar light aircraft is the Musketeer’s landing gear. While the competitive Cessna 172s use <b>spring-steel</b> main gear, the Piper PA-28 Cherokees use oleos and the Grumman American AA-5s use fiberglass-sprung main gear, the Musketeer family use a trailing idler link gear system with a compressed rubber puck suspension system. This gives the aircraft quite different landing characteristics compared to the competition; light touchdowns are often accompanied by the idler links skipping and producing a less-graceful than anticipated landing. With practice, smooth landings are easy to accomplish.|$|E
50|$|To {{produce the}} right amount of {{hardness}} in the finished product, the smith generally begins with steel that has a carbon content that is higher than desired. In ancient times, forging often began with steel that had a carbon content much too high for normal use. Most ancient forge-welding began with hypereutectoid steel, containing a carbon content sometimes well above 1.0%. Hypereutectoid steels are typically too brittle to be useful in a finished product, {{but by the end of}} forging the steel typically had a high carbon-content ranging from 0.8% (eutectoid tool-steel) to 0.5% (hypoeutectoid <b>spring-steel).</b>|$|E

The <b>spring-steel</b> gear had been swept 3 in forward on 120 and 140 models in late 1947 so wheel extenders were no longer necessary to counter nose-over tendencies during heavy application of brakes; all 140A models had the improved gear legs.

5000|$|In another June 2016 flight review, Paul Bertorelli of AVweb said, [...] "The XCub has {{aluminum}} {{rather than}} steel or the Cub’s traditional bungee gear. This {{was a revelation}} for me because aluminum does a nice job of absorbing surplus touchdown energy; it’s far less energetic than steel or those blasted bungees in returning misdirected touchdown energy. This results in a unique feeling on touchdown. If you know you’re a little fast and you know you’re going to bounce, it’s just a small one and not the sharp-edged twang of steel or the slingshot of the bungees, but rather a firm pushback with no lateral wiggles at all. It’s quite confidence inducing because those small bounces don’t require the massive control inputs to arrest that a really bad <b>spring-steel</b> bounce would." ...|$|E
50|$|The Pianet {{is a type}} of {{electro-mechanical}} piano {{built by}} the Hohner company of Trossingen, West Germany, from the early 1960s to the early 1980s. The designer of the early Pianet models was Ernst Zacharias, basing the mechanism closely on a 1920s design by Lloyd Loar. The Pianet was a variant of the earlier reed-based Hohner electric piano the Cembalet which, like the Pianet, was intended for home use. Hohner offered both keyboards in their range until the early 1970s. The Pianet production consisted of two distinctly different mechanism groups with characteristically different sound. The first group, lasting from introduction to 1977, had ground stainless steel reeds, a pick-up using variable capacitance, and leather faced activation pads. The second group from 1977 until the end of production used rolled <b>spring-steel</b> reeds, electro-magnetic pick-ups, and moulded silicone rubber activation pads.|$|E
50|$|In operation, {{the user}} would arm the weapon by {{removing}} the warhead safety pin that retains the detonators striker. The weapon is then aimed with the built-in iron sights, and the hammer on the fire controls would be cocked with the users thumb. When the trigger is pulled, the hammer falls onto a percussion primer which ignites the black powder propellant charge. Part of the explosive force is blown out {{the rear of the}} tube as back-blast, which provides a recoilless effect. The warhead is ejected {{from the front of the}} tube by the exploding propellant, and the <b>spring-steel</b> fins unfold to stabilize the projectile in flight. The warhead then travels in a ballistic arc until it impacts the target. Yasin projectiles do not accommodate an onboard rocket for extending its range. On impact, the internal firing pin is thrown forward by the sudden deceleration, forcing it into the detonator's primer and igniting the warheads explosive charge. This powerful explosion inverts and compresses the aluminum warhead liner, projecting it forward as a penetrating jet of high-temperature, burning aluminum that can defeat the target.|$|E
5000|$|Usually {{regarded}} {{as a type of}} Morris, although many of the performers themselves consider it as a traditional dance form in its own right, is the sword dance tradition, which includes both rapper sword and longsword traditions. In both styles the [...] "swords" [...] are not actual swords, but implements specifically made for the dance. The dancers are usually linked one to another via the swords, with one end of each held by one dancer and the other end by another. Rapper sides consist of five dancers, who are permanently linked-up during the dance. The rapper sword is a very flexible strip of <b>spring-steel</b> with a wooden handle at each end. The longsword is about 2'6" [...] (0.8 metres) long, with a wooden handle at one end, a blunt tip, and no edge. Sometimes ribbons are threaded {{through a hole in the}} tip of the sword, and the dancers grab on to them during the course of the dance. Longsword sides consist usually of five to eight dancers. In both rapper and longsword there is often a supernumerary [...] "character", who dances around, outside, and inside the set.|$|E

The second design uses precut <b>spring-steel</b> flexure elements mounted into a mold which is then filled with molten tin to form a bimetallic device. Accelerations necessary to switch the devices between bistable states were measured using a centrifuge.

40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} is an {{improvement}} over a <b>spring-steel</b> dual-axis accelerometer that we had reported earlier. The fabrication process (which entails wire-cut electro discharge machining of easily accessible and inexpensive spring-steelfoil) and the sensing of the displacement (which is done using off-the-shelf Hall-effect sensors) remain the same. Theimprovements reported here are twofold: (i) the footprint of the packaged accelerometer is reduced from 80 mm square to 40 mm square, and (ii) almost perfect de-coupling and symmetry are achieved between the two in-plane axes of the packageddevice {{as opposed to the}} previous embodiment where this was not the case. Good linearity with about 40 mV/g was measuredalong both the in-plane axes over a range of 0. 1 to 1 g. The first two natural frequencies of the devices are at 30 Hz and 100 Hz, respectively, as per the experiment. The highlights of this work are cost-effective processing, easy integration of the Hall-effect sensing capability on a customised printed circuit board, and inexpensive packaging without overly compromising eitherthe overall size or the sensitivity of the accelerometer. Through this work, we have reaffirmed the practicability of spring-steelaccelerometers towards the eventual goal of making it compete with micro machined silicon accelerometers in terms of sizeand performance. The cost is likely to be much lower for the <b>spring-steel</b> accelerometers than that of silicon accelerometers, especially when the volume of production is low and the sensor is {{to be used as a}} single packaged unit...|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of geometrically nonlinear {{analysis of the}} elastic deformation of frame structures for application in two biology related problems {{is the focus of}} this project.

This involves an inverse problem in elasticity. The general technique where the location, the direction, and the magnitude of the loading are not known is found to be overly sensitive to errors in the measurement of displacements. Hence, a practically useful and accurate technique is developed by assuming the location of the applied force.

40|$|In The Netherlands, about 50 % of all amputations of {{the lower}} limb are toes and {{forefoot}} amputations. Traumata of toes and mid-foot are rare.

This case study presents an insole solution for the solitary first phalangeal bone after amputation of the phalangeal bones II-V. The normal adaptation for forefoot amputations is stiffening of the sole of the shoe and a rocker bar to improve the toe off phase with load reduction of the forefoot. Because the patient had to do excessive stair climbing during work another solution was chosen. As a foot orthosis, a metal soleplate was made in order to have free movement during loading and toe-off during walking. The soleplate gives safety and provides self-adjusting properties after toe off. This enables the shoe technician to make a shoe without a rocker bar or an extra stiff insole.

40|$|Many studies require {{undisturbed}} soil cores. Soil conditions vary widely, depending upon site characteristics; {{some of the}} more difficult conditions are encountred in such studies as canal seepage studies and dry rangeland. A minimum amount of shattering, compaction, or distortion is desired. In some areas, rocky soil makes sampling from a pit impractical, and mountain terrain restricts the sampling equip-ment to lightweight, portable devices. Swanson (5) noted that the Lutz-type sam-pler (4) caused sample disturbance, usually from the impact of the hammer while taking samples. Since the Swanson-type sampler, the Coile Sampler, (1) and many others employ the same techniques and require a pit to sam-ple deeper toils, the chances of:disturbance still exist. Experience indicated that the hammer-type sampler was undesirable for use in our studies and that a sampler that could be used where mountainous terraine prohibited the transportation of motor-driven samplers, such the Utah Soil Sampling Machine (3) ', was a necessity. The Snake River Sampler (fig. 1) consists of five basic parts: an outer spiraled steel casing, an inner split sleeve holder, a split sleeve sam-ple holder (which can be either brass or steel), an inner sleeve lock, and a spring steel cutting tip.

40|$|Simultaneously {{achieving}} high-sensitivity {{and a large}} {{resonance frequency}} of micromachined accelerometers is difficult because of the inherent trade-off between the two. In this thesis, we present a mechanical displacement-amplifying technique that is amenable to micromachining to enhance sensitivity without compromising on the resonance frequency and cross-axis sensitivity. Depending on the requirements of sensitivity alone or sensitivity and resonance frequency, Displacement-amplifying Compliant Mechanisms (DaCMs) are designed using the selection map-based technique, which indicates the limits of what is possible for given specifications on size and microfabrication. In order to prove {{the benefits of a}} DaCM, we modified the designs of two very sensitive capacitive micromachined accelerometers from the literature by incorporating DaCMs and showed that, within the same footprint on the chip, the displacement sensitivity could be enhanced by more than 60 % while the resonance frequency was also improved by more than 30 %. As the focus of the thesis is to explore the integration of DaCMs into accelerometers, the analytical, computational, and practical aspects are discussed in detail. Both single and dual axis in-plane accelerometers are considered. The fabrication processes used are Silicon-on-Insulator Multi-user MEMS Processes (SOIMUMPs) and a customized Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) based process. The fabricated accelerometers are packaged and brought to the product form. They were tested at the die level {{as well as in the}} packaged form. Under dynamic conditions, the measured amplification factor of the fabricated single-axis in-plane accelerometer was observed to be 11. The overall dimension of the accelerometer was 4. 25 mm × 1. 25 mm. The first in-plane natural frequency of the fabricated accelerometer was found to be 6. 25 kHz. The voltage sensitivity of the packaged accelerometer with the DaCM measured 26. 7 mV/g at 40 Hz with differential capacitance sensitivity of 3926 ppm/g around the base capacitance of 0. 75 pF. The fabricated dual-axis accelerometer has a special configuration of twelve folded-beam suspension blocks that de-couple any displacements along the two in-plane orthogonal axes. The decoupling feature is retained even after adding the DaCMs along both the axes. The total device size was 8. 6 mm × 8. 6 mm. The device was also fabricated and packaged inside a ceramic flat-pin package using hybrid die-to-die wire-bonding. Die-level dynamic characterization showed that the average geometric advantage achieved using the DaCMs is 6. 2 along both the in-plane axes. The measured axial voltage sensitivity of about 580 mV/g for both the axes was achieved with a cross-axial sensitivity of less than 2 % and a natural frequency of 920 Hz. The static capacitance sensitivity was found to be 0. 296 × 106 ppm/g with a base capacitance of 0. 977 pF. Also presented in this work is a wide-band dual-axis accelerometer without an amplifying mechanism. Its first two in-plane modal frequencies measured 14. 2 kHz. The measured sensitivity of the packaged accelerometer along both the axes of the device was found to be 62 mV/g at 200 Hz. Aiming at towards cost-effective accelerometers for small-volume markets, we also developed a single-axis and two dual-axis meso-scale <b>spring-steel</b> in-plane accelerometers equipped with Allegro A 1395 linear Hall-effect sensors for sensing the displacement of the proof-mass. The single-axis in-plane meso-scale accelerometer also contains a DaCM. It is observed through simulation that the single-axis design with a DaCM is 39 % more sensitive and has 41 % more bandwidth compared to a single-axis design without a DaCM. The measured sensitivity of the fabricated single-axis <b>spring-steel</b> accelerometer with a DaCM was found to be 71. 4 mV/g with a minimum resolvable acceleration of 14 milli-g. The unique features of the first generation of dual-axis accelerometers are that a rechargeable Li-ion battery adds to the proof-mass. It also contains a de-coupling mechanism that can decompose any planar acceleration into its axial components. The second generation of dual-axis accelerometers is more compact in size. All the mechanical elements of the accelerometers are made of EN J 42 /AISI 1080 spring steel foil machined using Wire-cut Electro-Discharge- Machining. The measured sensitivity of the first generation of dual-axis meso-scale accelerometers is 78 and 108 mV/g along the X and Y axes whereas the second generation device exhibits a sensitivity of 40 mV/g for both the axes. The thesis concludes that the sensitivity of a displacement-based sensor can be improved using a suitably designed DaCM without compromising the resonance frequency and hence the bandwidth. Furthermore, the work describing the development of meso-scale accelerometers also establishes spring steel as a viable material for meso-scale applications...|$|E
