5|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} state for sodium is +1. It is generally less reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium. <b>Sodium</b> <b>metal</b> is highly reducing, {{with the standard}} reduction potential for the Na+/Na couple being −2.71 volts, though potassium and lithium have even more negative potentials.|$|E
5|$|Potassium metal {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by electrolysis of molten KOH with the newly discovered voltaic pile. Potassium {{was the first}} metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different. Although the production of potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>metal</b> should have shown that both are elements, {{it took some time}} before this view was universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have many}} applications, {{the most well-known}} being sodium chloride as table salt. Sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap. Pure <b>sodium</b> <b>metal</b> also has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help smooth the surface of other metals. Being a strong reducing agent, it {{is often used to}} reduce many other metals, such as titanium and zirconium, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point, viscosity, and cross-section towards neutron absorption.|$|E

5|$|Pure {{potassium}} {{was first}} isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) {{by the use}} of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile. Previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium's extreme reactivity. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda (NaOH, lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different. Later that year, the first pieces of pure molten <b>sodium</b> <b>metal</b> were similarly prepared by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of molten caustic soda (now called sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|The lead analog of the {{simplest}} organic compound, methane, is plumbane. Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen. Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable, decomposing at 270°C.) With <b>sodium</b> <b>metal,</b> lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited: lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic chemistry and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound. Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable. For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.|$|E
5|$|Sodium at {{standard}} temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in air and forms grayish white sodium oxide unless immersed in oil or inert gas, {{which are the}} conditions it is usually stored in. <b>Sodium</b> <b>metal</b> can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak metallic bonding and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium. The melting (98°C) and boiling (883°C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides.|$|E

5|$|Sodium occurs {{mostly in}} {{seawater}} and dried seabed, {{but is now}} produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700°C {{through the use of}} a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide. Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (potassium chloride). Previously, potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with <b>sodium</b> <b>metal</b> at 850°C.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in <b>sodium</b> <b>metal,</b> and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} is {{also produced}} by combining pure <b>sodium</b> <b>metal</b> with water. The byproducts are hydrogen gas and heat, often {{resulting in a}} flame, making this a common demonstration of the reactivity of alkali metals in academic environments; however, it is not commercially viable, as the isolation of <b>sodium</b> <b>metal</b> is typically performed by reduction or electrolysis of sodium compounds including sodium hydroxide.|$|E

[...] Employing a battery of 2,000 elements of a voltaic pile Humphry Davy in 1809 gave the first public demonstration of the electric arc light, using for the purpose charcoal enclosed in a vacuum.|$|R

25|$|In the reaction, <b>sodium</b> <b>metal</b> {{goes from}} an {{oxidation}} state of 0 (as it {{is a pure}} element) to +1: in other words, the sodium lost one electron and {{is said to have}} been oxidized. On the other hand, the chlorine gas goes from an oxidation of 0 (it is also a pure element) to −1: the chlorine gains one electron and {{is said to have been}} reduced. Because the chlorine is the one reduced, it is considered the electron acceptor, or in other words, induces oxidation in the sodium – thus the chlorine gas is considered the oxidizing agent. Conversely, the sodium is oxidized or is the electron donor, and thus induces reduction in the other species and is considered the reducing agent.|$|E
25|$|Sodium amalgam {{containing}} 2–6% sodium (prepared by {{the treatment}} of ribbons of <b>sodium</b> <b>metal</b> with mercury(0)) is the most commonly employed reagent for the reductive desulfonylation and reductive elimination processes.
