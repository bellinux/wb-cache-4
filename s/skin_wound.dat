25|$|In <b>skin</b> <b>wound</b> healing, CYR61 {{is highly}} {{expressed}} in the granulation tissue by myofibroblasts, which proliferate and rapidly synthesize ECM to maintain tissue integrity and to promote regeneration of parenchymal cells. However, excessive matrix deposition can lead to fibrosis, scarring, and loss of tissue function. In skin wounds, CYR61 accumulates in the granulation tissue as myofibroblasts proliferate, and eventually reaches a sufficiently high level to drive the myofibroblasts themselves into senescence, whereupon these cells cease to proliferate and express matrix-degrading enzymes. Thus, CYR61 limits synthesis and deposition of ECM by myofibroblasts, {{reducing the risk of}} fibrosis during wound healing. In addition to <b>skin</b> <b>wound</b> healing, CYR61 expression is elevated in remodeling cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, in vascular injury, and in the long bones during fracture repair. Blockade of CYR61 by antibodies inhibits bone fracture healing in mice. In the kidney, CYR61 is expressed in podocytes in normal adult and embryonic glomeruli, but expression is decreased in IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy, particularly in diseased kidneys with severe mesangial expansion.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It often occurs in close {{proximity}} to water bodies, but no specific activities that bring people into contact with water have been identified (i.e. fetching of water, fishing, rice farming, washing, bathing, etc.). The mode of transmission of Buruli ulcer is not entirely known. Recent evidence suggests insects may be involved in the transmission of the infection. These insects are aquatic bugs belonging to the genus Naucoris (family Naucoridae) and Diplonychus (family Belostomatidae). Trauma is probably the most frequent means by which M. ulcerans is introduced into the skin from surface contamination. The initial trauma can be a mild <b>skin</b> <b>wound</b> such as scratch or as severe. Other studies have suggested aerosol spread but these are not proven. In Australia, animals such as koalas and possums are naturally infected. Epidemiological evidence has not clearly supported person-to-person transmission. However, Muelder & Nourou found that 10 out of 28 patients had relatives who had also had the disease, and cautioned against the dismissal of person-to-person transmission. Given the number of patients who shed large numbers of bacilli from their wounds and live in very close contact with relatives, more cases should have been observed. The cases reported by Muelder & Nourou could perhaps have been exposed to a common source of infection, and there might also be genetic component to sensitivity to the disease.|$|E
40|$|Background: Accelerating of <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> {{healing process}} has been focused by {{researchers}} in recent years. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the effects of topical phenytoin, silver sulfadiazine and conjugated estrogen on <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> healing in male rats. Accessing a way to accelerate <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> healing is still one of the important goals in medical science. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was accomplished on 32 male rats (8 animals in each group) with approximately equal body mass. <b>Skin</b> <b>wounds</b> were made with an area of 40 mmÂ² and a depth of 0. 5 mm on the back of the necks. Three groups were administered daily by topical phenytoin (1), silver sulfadiazine (1) and conjugated estrogen (625). Control group received no drug. Wounds healing was evaluated daily and the study was continued until the wounds healing completed. Results: Silver sulfadiazine demonstrated to be the best treatment for the wounds healing compared with the other medicines, it required significant shorter time of treatment.

40|$|The {{time-dependent}} reepithelialization of 55 human surgical <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> with a wound age between 8 h {{and more}} than 2 months was investigated by the immunohistochemical localization of cytokeratins 5 and 13. A complete, rebuilt epidermal layer over the wound area was first detectable in a 5 -day-old wound, while all wounds of more than 18 days duration contained a completely reepithelialized wound area. Between 5 and 18 days the basal layer of keratinocytes showed — in contrast to normal skin — only some cells positive for cytokeratin 5. In some, but not all lesions with a wound age of 13 days or more, a basal cell layer completely staining for cytokeratin 5 was demonstrable. This staining pattern was found in all <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> with a wound age of more than 23 days. The immunohistochemical detection of cytokeratin 13 which can be observed regularly in non-cornifying squamous epithelia provides no information for the time-estimation of human <b>skin</b> <b>wounds,</b> since no significant temporary expression of this polypeptide seems to occur during the healing of human <b>skin</b> <b>wounds.</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|Two {{forms of}} the disease of {{smallpox}} were recognised, now known {{to be due to}} two strains of the Variola virus. [...] Those contracting Variola minor had a greatly reduced risk of death – 1–2% – compared to those contracting Variola major with 30% mortality. [...] Infection via inhaled viral particles in droplets spread the infection more widely than the deliberate infection through a small <b>skin</b> <b>wound.</b> [...] The smaller, localised infection is adequate to stimulate the immune system to produce specific immunity to the virus, while requiring more generations of the virus to reach levels of infection likely to kill the patient.

2500|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is produced}} naturally {{by the human}} body as a signaling molecule. Thus, carbon monoxide may have a physiological role in the body, such as a neurotransmitter or a blood vessel relaxant. Because of carbon monoxide's role in the body, abnormalities in its metabolism {{have been linked to}} a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerations, hypertension, heart failure, and pathological inflammation. Relative to inflammation, carbon monoxide has been shown to inhibit the movement of leukocytes to inflamed tissues, stimulate leukocyte phagocytosis of bacteria, and reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by leukocytes. In animal model studies, furthermore, carbon monoxide reduced the severity of experimentally induced bacterial sepsis, pancreatitis, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, colitis, osteoarthritis, lung injury, lung transplantation rejection, and neuropathic pain while promoting <b>skin</b> <b>wound</b> healing. These actions {{are similar to those of}} Specialized pro-resolving mediators which act to dampen, reverse, and repair the tissue damage due to diverse inflammation responses. Indeed, carbon monoxide can act additively with one of these mediators (Resolvin D1) to limit inflammatory responses. The studies implicate carbon monoxide as a physiological contributor to limiting inflammation and suggest that its delivery by inhalation or carbon monoxide-forming drugs may be therapeutically useful for controlling pathological inflammatory responses.|$|E

40|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>wounds</b> {{are common}} in sports but are rarely {{documented}} by the certified athletic trainer. The literature is unclear about wound types, {{and none of the}} articles reviewed reported frequencies. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss the frequency of common athletic <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> and their specific management. Management of <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> can sometimes be problematic. Hydrogen peroxide has been used on wounds since 1947, yet some researchers report that hydrogen peroxide and iodophor solution can delay or interfere with wound healing, or cause damage to the wounded area if use is intense and prolonged. Occlusive dressings have been reported to have considerable advantage in maintaining a moist wound bed and in decreasing healing time. Infection rates beneath occlusive dressings, however, are similar to those associated with other types of dressings. Complications to wounds, with or without the use of occlusive dressings, such as keloids and seborrheic dermatitis, occur in low frequencies. Due to a lack of specific information about sports-induced <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> and their management, we recommend that standardized documentation for common wounds be developed along with further study of techniques for management...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the importance of}} injury for the epidermal innate immune response in human <b>skin</b> <b>wounds.</b> We found that injury, independent of infiltrating inflammatory cells, generated prominent chemotactic activity toward neutrophils in injured skin because of IL- 8 production. Furthermore, injury was a major inducer of the expression of antimicrobial (poly) peptides (AMPs) in <b>skin</b> <b>wounds.</b> In human <b>skin,</b> these injury-induced innate immune responses were mediated by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Consequently, inhibition of the EGFR blocked both the chemotactic activity generated in injured skin and {{the expression of the}} majority of the AMPs. The importance of injury was confirmed in mouse experiments in vivo, in which injury independent of infection was a potent inducer of AMPs in <b>skin</b> <b>wounds.</b> To our knowledge, these data thereby provide a previously unreported molecular link between injury and neutrophil accumulation and identify the molecular background for the vast expression of IL- 8 and AMPs in wounded epidermis.

50|$|After an abrasion, cut, burn, {{or other}} injury, the body uses several {{different}} biological processes {{to repair the}} <b>skin.</b> <b>Wound</b> healing generally has three different stages: the inflammatory stage, the proliferative stage and the remodeling stage.|$|E
50|$|Skin {{provides}} a mechanical {{barrier to the}} external environment and acts to prevent the ingress of infectious agents. Once injured, the tissues beneath are exposed to infection; therefore, rapid and effective healing is of crucial significance to reconstruct a barrier function. <b>Skin</b> <b>wound</b> healing is a complex process, and includes many interacting processes initiated by haemostasis {{and the release of}} platelet-derived factors. The following stages are inflammation, granulation tissue formation, reepithelization and remodeling. HA is likely to play a multifaceted role in mediation of these cellular and matrix events. The proposed roles of HA in this sequence of <b>skin</b> <b>wound</b> healing events are detailed below.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To show {{analysis}} {{of the results of}} applying the method platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of problematic <b>skin</b> <b>wounds.</b> The paper’s objective is to prove its reliability and relevance, to evaluate its efficiency and applicability to Bulgarian patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Out of a total of 154 hospitalized patients with problematic <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> 83 have been treated with platelet-rich plasma, comprising the Experimental group (EG), and 71 patients with similar wounds have been treated by using traditional methods for the respective pathology at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Vessel and Plastic Surgery Department, comprising the Control Group (CG). Data on the condition of monitored symptoms of researched cases was collected for the research. A variable is defined for every symptom and its value and weight is correspondingly introduced. Scores introduced by Cancela AM are used for the assessment of the respective wound. Each of these scores is used for assessing specific wound parameters: Total Wound Score (TWS); total anatomic score (TAS) of wound and Total Score of Wound data (TSWD). RESULTS: Analysis of variance was performed to achieve the objectives and solve the research tasks; variables containing information on initial and final data from each series of experiments have been analyzed in order to determine basic numerical characteristics of variables, and by comparative analysis to check how they tend to vary in experimental (EG) and control (CG) group. Statistical survey shows that the platelet-rich plasma method gives significant results when treating problematic <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> leading to full recovery as compared to traditional methods typical for the pathology. The graphical interpretation allows to identify forecast relations between assessed aspects of problematic wounds and weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION: By analyzing the results of our study we can conclude that the use of platelet-rich plasma to treat problematic <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> is a safe and effective treatment method. It is not universal for every wound, but follows the principles of biological wound treatment and leads to full recovery of high percentage of problematic <b>skin</b> <b>wounds.</b> We support proponents of the application of platelet-rich plasma to treat problematic <b>skin</b> <b>wounds...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Nitric oxide (NO) plays a {{critical}} role in wound healing, in part by promoting angiogenesis. However, the precise repair pathways affected by NO are not well defined. We now show that NO regulates matrix metalloproteinase- 13 (MMP- 13) release during wound repair. We find that normally MMP- 13 is kept inside endothelial cells by an association with caveolin- 1. However, nitration of MMP- 13 on tyrosine residue Y 338 causes it to dissociate from caveolin- 1 and be released from endothelial cells. We next explored the functional significance of MMP- 13 nitration in vivo. Skin injury increases nitration of MMP- 13 in mice. <b>Skin</b> <b>wounds</b> in inducible nitric oxide synthase knockout mice release less MMP- 13 and heal more slowly than <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> in wild-type mice. Conversely, <b>skin</b> <b>wounds</b> in caveolin- 1 knockout mice have increased NO production, increased MMP- 13 nitration, and accelerated wound healing.
