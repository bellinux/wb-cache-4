40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{two methods}} for estimating {{the effect of}} <b>schooling</b> <b>on</b> achievement test scores that control for endogeneity of schooling by postulating that both schooling and test scores are generated by a common unobserved latent ability. These methods are applied to data <b>on</b> <b>schooling</b> and test scores. Estimates from the two methods are in close agreement. We find {{that the effects of}} <b>schooling</b> <b>on</b> test scores are roughly linear across schooling levels. The effects of <b>schooling</b> <b>on</b> measured test scores are slightly larger for lower latent ability levels. We find that schooling increases the AFQT score on average between 2 and 4 percentage points, roughly twice as large as the effect claimed by Herrnstein and Murray (1994) but in agreement with estimates produced by Neal and Johnson (1996) and Winship and Korenman (1997). We extend the previous literature by estimating the impact of <b>schooling</b> <b>on</b> measured test scores at various quantiles of the latent ability distribution.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{mechanisms}} driving the {{negative relationship between}} parents' schooling and fertility. Brazilian data demonstrate strong negative effects of women's <b>schooling</b> <b>on</b> fertility over the first eight years of schooling. We observe no increase in women's labor supply, however, in spite of rapidly rising wages, suggesting that reservation wages rise as fast as market wages over this range. We find strong effects of parental <b>schooling</b> <b>on</b> children's <b>schooling</b> and survival. We conclude {{that the effects of}} early years of <b>schooling</b> <b>on</b> fertility work primarily through increased investments in child quality, with only a minor role played by rising women's wages. ...|$|R
