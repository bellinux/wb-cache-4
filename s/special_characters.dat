5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the <b>special</b> <b>characters</b> that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E

25|$|Simplicity – Since {{the basic}} Latin {{alphabet}} has {{a smaller number}} of letters than many other writing systems, digraphs, diacritics, or <b>special</b> <b>characters</b> must be used to represent them all in Latin script. This affects the ease of creation, digital storage and transmission, reproduction, and reading of the romanized text.|$|E

Two <b>special</b> <b>characters</b> were only available in the selected pre-order editions of the game: the Harlequin and the Officer. However, these two pre-order <b>special</b> <b>characters</b> are also included in The Da Vinci Disappearance downloadable content as are the formerly pre-order only Trajan Market and Aqueducts special locations.

25|$|In the new Uzbek Latin {{alphabet}} {{adopted in}} 2000, the apostrophe {{serves as a}} diacritical mark to distinguish different phonemes written with the same letter: it differentiates o (corresponding to Cyrillic ў) from o, and g (Cyrillic ғ) from g. This avoids the use of <b>special</b> <b>characters,</b> allowing Uzbek to be typed with ease in ordinary ASCII on any Latin keyboard. In addition, a postvocalic apostrophe in Uzbek represents the glottal stop phoneme derived from Arabic hamzah or ‘ayn, replacing Cyrillic ъ.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} writing {{systems have been}} used for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the Somali Latin {{alphabet}} is the most widely used, and has been the official writing script in Somalia since 1972. The script was developed by the Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed specifically for the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except p, v and z. There are no diacritics or other <b>special</b> <b>characters</b> except the use of the apostrophe for the glottal stop, which does not occur word-initially. There are three consonant digraphs: DH, KH and SH. Tone is not marked, and front and back vowels are not distinguished.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{enactment}} of the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act in New Zealand in 1975, leadership in Catholic schools has become increasingly complex. Under the legislation Catholic schools are required to develop and maintain the <b>special</b> <b>character</b> of the school. In recent times the position of Director of Religious Studies (DRS) has become a prominent leadership position with a key responsibility to ensure the structural transmission of the <b>special</b> <b>character</b> of the school. Financial or State-aid is dependent upon each school’s ability to develop and maintain its <b>special</b> <b>character.</b> The challenges and demands placed on DRSs to develop and maintain the <b>special</b> <b>character</b> of the Catholic school has impacted perceptions {{of the role of the}} DRS to the point where it has become necessary to reconceptualise the role. This study provides insights into the central responsibilities and characteristics of the DRS which are vital to any considerations pertaining to reconceptualising the DRS role for contemporary leadership...|$|R

25|$|The {{strength}} of random passwords {{depends on the}} actual entropy of the underlying number generator; however, these are often not truly random, but pseudo random. Many publicly available password generators use random number generators found in programming libraries that offer limited entropy. However most modern operating systems offer cryptographically strong random number generators that are suitable for password generation. It is also possible to use ordinary dice to generate random passwords. See stronger methods. Random password programs often {{have the ability to}} ensure that the resulting password complies with a local password policy; for instance, by always producing a mix of letters, numbers and <b>special</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern {{programs}} use Unicode strings {{to allow}} internationalization of text. Often, these programs will convert incoming ASCII strings to Unicode before processing them. Unicode strings encoded in UTF-16 use two bytes to encode each character (or four bytes for some <b>special</b> <b>characters).</b> When an ASCII string {{is transformed into}} UTF-16, a zero byte is inserted after each byte in the original string. Obscou proved in Phrack 61 {{that it is possible}} to write shellcode that can run successfully after this transformation. Programs that can automatically encode any shellcode into alphanumeric UTF-16-proof shellcode exist, based on the same principle of a small self-modifying decoder that decodes the original shellcode.|$|E
25|$|Exacerbating the problem, common {{punched card}} {{character}} sets {{of the time}} were uppercase only and lacked other <b>special</b> <b>characters.</b> It {{was only in the}} late 1960s that the widespread adoption of the ASCII character set made both lower case and the underscore character _ universally available. Some languages, notably C, promptly adopted underscores as word separators, and identifiers such as end_of_file are still prevalent in C programs and libraries (as well as in later languages influenced by C, such as Perl and Python). However, some languages and programmers chose to avoid underscores—among other reasons to prevent confusing them with whitespace—and adopted camel case instead.|$|E
