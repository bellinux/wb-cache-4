25|$|MGM {{had bought}} the film rights to Clare Boothe Luce's 1936 smash Broadway hit The Women in 1937. Many writers had, unsuccessfully, taken a <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> a {{screenplay}} version. The studio handed it to Loos and veteran scriptwriter Jane Murfin, and three weeks later Loos handed Cukor a script that he loved. Unfortunately the censorship board did not. They insisted on changing more than 80 lines, and the film {{had to go into}} production. Loos was apprehensive, but Cukor insisted she do the changes on set, among his all-star bevy of leading ladies. Loos made immediate friends with Paulette Goddard, who was surprisingly well-read. She also had Aldous and Maria Huxley as houseguests, and encouraged Huxley to stay in California and continue to write there. When World War II began in September 1939, Loos convinced Huxley that it would be safer for his family if they stayed in the United States rather than returning to England, and she got him a job adapting screenplays at MGM.|$|E
25|$|The band's origins can {{be traced}} to 1981, in Bradford, Yorkshire, where vocalist and {{songwriter}} Ian Astbury formed a band called Southern Death Cult. The name was chosen with a double meaning, and was derived from the 14th century Native American religion, the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex or Southern Death Cult as it was sometimes known, from the Mississippi delta area, {{but it was also a}} <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> what the band viewed was the centralisation of power in Southern England (including that of the music industry); there has long been a perceived notion of a North-South divide based on social, historic and economic reasons. Astbury was joined by Buzz Burrows (guitar), Barry Jepson (bass) and Aki Nawaz Qureshi (drums); they performed their first show at the Queen's Hall in their hometown of Bradford on 29 October 1981. The band were at the forefront of an emerging style of music, in the form of post-punk and gothic rock (then known as positive-punk), they achieved critical acclaim from the press and music fans.|$|E

500|$|In {{his song}} review for AllMusic, Lindsay Planer writes of [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong": [...] "While arguably simplistic, both lyrics and tune boast Harrison's {{trademark}} optimism, {{especially during the}} affable and repeated chorus of 'Ring out the old/Ring in the new/Ring out the false/Ring in the true.'" [...] Harrison biographer Alan Clayson acknowledges the traditional pop merits of the song while explaining its underachievement: [...] "With a chirpy-chirpy cheapness worthy of Red Rose Speedway, 'Ding Dong, Ding Dong' had all the credentials of a Yuletide smash but none that actually grabbed the public." [...] Writing for Goldmine magazine in January 2002, Dave Thompson described it as [...] "sweetly simplistic" [...] and [...] "a sterling <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> a Christmas anthem … that deserved far better than its low Top 40 chart placings in the U.S. and Britain".|$|E

Vick stated that the song [...] "is compelling enough to separate the singer from other Disney-groomed pop stars." [...] Wairarapa Times-Age writer Kim Gillespie named [...] "A Year Without Rain" [...] one of the album's highlights. David Welsh of musicOMH noted Gomez' mature performance and wrote that the song [...] "reaps rewards with an impressively heartbroken <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> euro-dance". In contrast, The Washington Post critic Allison Stewart was unfavorable of the lyrical content of the song, commenting that it was [...] "the sort of exercise in teenage co-dependence...that should be long extinct." ...|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers criticised the R production.

South Florida Sun-Sentinels Sean Picolli said that the song is [...] "a sincere <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> {{instructional}} R". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post {{described it as a}} [...] "lugubrious ballad", while Scott Schinder of Newsday said that [...] "the contempo-R schmaltz of 'Too Much' [...] mires the group in middle-of-the-road mediocrity". J.D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun was not convinced by the song's [...] "attempts at deep emotional expression", and Anthony Violenti of The Buffalo News said that it is [...] "supposed to be a heart tugging ballad that may even make the Spice Girls fan base of 10-year olds overdose on sugar".|$|E

[...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had [...] "taken its title so seriously that the plot stands still along with it", but also stated that it was [...] "an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson". Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two stars and wrote in her review she felt the film was [...] "musty and derivative" [...] and thought its only bright spot was 10-year-old Jaden Smith's [...] "engaging, lively performance".|$|E

Amid the scathing critique he gave Harrison's tour and album, Jack Sheridan of Baltimore radio station WCAO cited [...] "Ding Dong" [...] {{as an example of}} how the former Beatle's music had altered [...] "so radically". Writing in Circus Raves magazine, Michael Gross defended Harrison's move away from the past, saying that Dark Horse matched the critically acclaimed All Things Must Pass, [...] "surpassing it, at times, with its clarity of production and lovely songs", and he praised [...] "Ding Dong", the title track and the Harrison–Ron Wood collaboration [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "all, simply, good songs". While remarking on the surprisingly late release for a holiday-season single, Billboards reviewer deemed the track to be an [...] "Extremely listenable performance" [...] and added: [...] "George has a genuine hit sound to offer here that's just right for those early January time-to-change resolutions.

500|$|Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed {{awarded the}} episode 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "this Chris Carter-directed ep [...] oddly enough doesn't {{center on the}} series mythology arc, but instead opts for a <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> the tired ol' virtual reality genre. [...] The only saving grace here is the {{appearance}} of hip conspiracy buffs The Lone Gunmen, who always brighten up any episode they appeared in." [...] Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called Maitreya one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters". Lamar derided the plot, calling it [...] "Scully And Mulder Do Doom", and expressed surprise that the episode was written by William Gibson. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five.

500|$|... "Hello Kitty" [...] was {{generally}} panned by music critics. While labeling it [...] "weird", Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a dubstep track {{that seems to}} acknowledge its own tokenism by adopting a 'J-Pop American Funtime Now!' sheen." [...] Despite praising her [...] "techno-pop" [...] influence, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that [...] "it's a bold <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> a genre outside of Lavigne's oeuvre, but it never comes together. By the 20th time 'Hello Kitty, you're so pretty' is declared, the listener's attention is already on the next track." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the song [...] "bypasses bubblegum so it can settle into the embarrassing". While reviewing and stating {{that most of the}} album was [...] "soggy", Chuck Eddy from Rolling Stone felt that [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] was the most playful song on the album and called it [...] "J-pop-via-Kesha". Robert Corpsey from Digital Spy was mixed on his opinion of the song, writing that [...] "the juddering electro-pop beats of 'Hello Kitty' serve as an ode to her you-know-what as well as her sizeable Japanese fanbase. As a curveball, it works brilliantly; but as an attempt to make her sound current in today's EDM-pop dominated charts, it falls considerably short." ...|$|E
500|$|Jake Coyle of the Associated Press {{was more}} {{critical}} of the film, calling it [...] "terribly overstuffed {{and many of the}} jokes get drowned out by the special effects... The pervasive movie references detract from the <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> freshness, and Guardians depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat." [...] He also felt that Close, Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "In place of wit, Guardians offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening–and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post also had a negative response to the film, comparing it to Howard the Duck and Green Lantern, and criticizing the dialogue, villains, soundtrack, lack of suspense, and the characters of Quill, Rocket, and Drax. The film received mixed reviews in China, where viewers complained that the film's [...] "poor subtitle translation not only spoiled the fun of watching it, but also made it difficult to understand its humor." ...|$|E
