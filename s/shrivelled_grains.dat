60|$|With {{respect to}} the state of the {{reproductive}} organs in the self-fertilised plants of Tables 9/D and 9/E, only a few observations were made. In the seventh and eighth generation of Ipomoea, the anthers in the flowers of the self-fertilised plants were plainly smaller than those in the flowers of the intercrossed plants. The tendency to sterility in these same plants was also shown by the first-formed flowers, after they had been carefully fertilised, often dropping off, {{in the same manner as}} frequently occurs with hybrids. The flowers likewise tended to be monstrous. In the fourth generation of Petunia, the pollen produced by the self-fertilised and intercrossed plants was compared, and they were far more empty and <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grains</b> in the former.|$|E
60|$|We {{will now}} turn to the {{fertility}} of the 53 illegitimate long-styled grandchildren, descended from the long-styled plant which was first fertilised with its own pollen. The pollen in two of these plants included a multitude of small and <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grains.</b> Nevertheless they were not very sterile; for 25 flowers, fertilised with their own pollen, produced 15 capsules, containing an average of 16.3 seeds. As already stated, the probable average with legitimate plants for a union of this nature is rather above 20 seeds. These plants were remarkably healthy and vigorous, {{as long as they}} were kept under highly favourable conditions in pots in the greenhouse; and such treatment greatly increases the fertility of the cowslip. When these same plants were planted during the next year (which, however, was an unfavourable one), out of doors in good soil, 20 self-fertilised flowers produced only 5 capsules, containing extremely few and wretched seeds.|$|E
6000|$|First, {{in regard}} to the {{transmission}} of form and colour. The parent-plant was long-styled, and of a rich purple colour. From the self-fertilised seed 23 plants were raised; of these 18 were purple of different shades, with two of them a little streaked and freckled with yellow, thus showing a tendency to reversion; and 5 were yellow, but generally with a brighter orange centre than in the wild flower. All the plants were profuse flowerers. All were long-styled; but the pistil varied a good deal in length even on the same plant, being rather shorter, or considerably longer, than in the normal long-styled form; and the stigmas likewise varied in shape. It is, therefore, probable that an equal- styled variety of the primrose might be found on careful search; and I have received two accounts of plants apparently in this condition. The stamens always occupied their proper position low down in the corolla; and the pollen-grains were of the small size proper to the long-styled form, but were mingled with many minute and <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grains.</b> The yellow-flowered and the purple-flowered plants of this first generation were fertilised under a net with their own pollen, and the seed separately sown. From the former, 22 plants were raised, and all were yellow and long-styled. From the latter or the purple-flowered plants, 24 long-styled plants were raised, of which 17 were purple and 7 yellow. In this last case we have an instance of reversion in colour, without the possibility of any cross, to the grandparents or more distant progenitors of the plants in question. Altogether 23 plants in the first generation and 46 in the second generation were raised; and the whole of these 69 illegitimate plants were long-styled! ...|$|E
40|$|In 4 field {{experiments}} at 2 {{sites in}} Western Australia, wheat was sown {{at different times}} in autumn and early winter. Within each sowing, incidence of barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (BYDV) was monitored by ELISA tests on leaf samples, using antiserum specific to BYDV serotype PAV. Delaying sowing decreased BYDV incidence in all 4 experiments. At the higher rainfall site, decreased BYDV incidence due to delayed sowing was associated with increased grain yield and size, and in 1 experiment also with {{a decrease in the}} proportion of <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grain.</b> In contrast, at the lower rainfall site, grain yield penalties derived from late sowing negated the yield increases associated with decreased BYDV levels. When imidacloprid seed-dressing followed by foliar sprays of alpha-cypermethrin were applied to control aphids at the lower rainfall site, within each sowing BYDV incidence and the proportion of <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grain</b> decreased and grain yield and size increased. Applications of pirimicarb at the higher rainfall site also decreased BYDV incidence and the proportion of <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grain</b> within each sowing, and grain yield and size were increased. In all experiments, the only, or predominant, colonising aphid species was Rhopalosiphum padi. At flag leaf emergence, delayed sowing decreased the number of aphids on plants. In high BYDV risk zones, when an appropriate insecticide is not applied to control aphid vectors in autumn-sown wheat, delaying sowing may be advisable to minimise BYDV-induced grain yield losses. However, the yield benefits from decreased BYDV infection need to be balanced against possible yield penalties due to late sowing...|$|R
50|$|Early lesions are {{characterized}} by small, dark brown lesions 1 to 2 mm long without chlorotic margin. In susceptible genotypes, these lesions extend very quickly in oval to elongated blotches, light brown to dark brown in colour.

Fruiting structures develop readily under humid conditions and are generally easily observed on old lesions. If spikelets are affected, it can result in <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grain</b> and black point, a dark staining of the embryo end of the seed.

60|$|I raised twenty {{plants from}} self-fertilised seed sent me by Mr. Scott; {{and they all}} {{produced}} red flowers, varying slightly in tint. Of these, two were strictly long-styled both in structure and in function; for their reproductive powers were tested by crosses with both forms of the common cowslip. Six plants were equal-styled; but on the same plant the pistil varied a good deal in length during different seasons. This was likewise the case, according to Mr. Scott, with the parent-plant. Lastly, twelve plants were in appearance short-styled; but they varied much more in the length of their pistils than ordinary short- styled cowslips, and they differed widely from the latter in their powers of reproduction. Their pistils had become short-styled in structure, whilst remaining long-styled in function. Short-styled cowslips, when insects are excluded, are extremely barren: for instance, on one occasion six fine plants produced only about 50 seeds (that is, less than the product of two good capsules), and on another occasion not a single capsule. Now, when the above twelve apparently short-styled seedlings were similarly treated, nearly all produced a great abundance of capsules, containing numerous seeds, which germinated remarkably well. Moreover three of these plants, which {{during the first year}} were furnished with quite short pistils, on the following year produced pistils of extraordinary length. The greater number, therefore, of these short-styled plants could not be distinguished in function from the equal- styled variety. The anthers in the six equal-styled and in the apparently twelve short-styled plants were seated high up in the corolla, as in the true short- styled cowslip; and the pollen-grains resembled those of the same form in their large size, but were mingled with a few <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grains.</b> In function this pollen was identical with that of the short-styled cowslip; for ten long-styled flowers of the common cowslip, legitimately fertilised with pollen from a true equal-styled variety, produced six capsules, containing on an average 34.4 seeds; whilst seven capsules on a short-styled cowslip illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the equal-styled variety, yielded an average of only 14.5 seeds.|$|E
60|$|As Professor Asa Gray has {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} this species and L. acuminata, {{as well as some}} species in the allied genus Drymispermum, are dimorphic or heterostyled (3/15. 'American Journal of Science' 1865 page 101 and Seemann's 'Journal of Botany' volume 3 1865 page 305.), I procured from Kew, through the kindness of Dr. Hooker, two dried flowers of the former species, an inhabitant of the Friendly Islands in the Pacific. The pistil of the long-styled form is to that of the short-styled as 100 to 86 in length; the stigma projects just above the throat of the corolla, and is surrounded by five anthers, the tips of which reach up almost to its base; and lower down, within the tubular corolla, five other and rather smaller anthers are seated. In the short-styled form, the stigma stands some way down the tube of the corolla, nearly on a level with the lower anthers of the other form: it differs remarkably from the stigma of the long-styled form, in being more papillose, and in being longer in the ratio of 100 to 60. The anthers of the upper stamens in the short-styled form are supported on free filaments, and project above the throat of the corolla, whilst the anthers of the lower stamens are seated in the throat on a level with the upper stamens of the other form. The diameters of a considerable number of grains from both sets of anthers in both forms were measured, but they did not differ in any trustworthy degree. The mean diameter of twenty-two grains from the short-styled flower was to that of twenty-four grains from the long-styled, as 100 to 99. The anthers of the upper stamens in the short-styled form appeared to be poorly developed, and contained a considerable number of <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grains</b> which were omitted in striking the above average. Notwithstanding the fact of the pollen-grains from the two forms not differing in diameter in any appreciable degree, there can hardly be a doubt from the great difference in the two forms in the length of the pistil, and especially of the stigma, together with its more papillose condition in the short-styled form, that the present species is truly heterostyled. This case resembles that of Linum grandiflorum, in which the sole difference between the two forms consists in the length of the pistils and stigmas. From the great length of the tubular corolla of Leucosmia, {{it is clear that the}} flowers are cross-fertilised by large Lepidoptera or by honey-sucking birds, and the position of the stamens in two whorls one beneath the other, which is a character that I have not seen in any other heterostyled dimorphic plant, probably serves to smear the inserted organ thoroughly with pollen.|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} the equal-styled plants in the table, Mr. Horwood raised from {{purchased}} seeds four plants, which he remembered were certainly not long-styled, but either short or equal-styled, probably the latter. These four plants were kept separate and allowed to fertilise themselves; from their seed the seventeen plants in the table were raised, all of which proved equal-styled. The stamens stood low down in the corolla as in the long-styled form; and the stigmas, which were globular and smooth, were either completely surrounded by the anthers, or stood close above them. My son William made drawings for me, by {{the aid of the}} camera, of the pollen of one of the above equal-styled plants; and, in accordance with the position of the stamens, the grains resembled in their small size those of the long-styled form. He also examined pollen from two equal- styled plants at Southampton; and in both of them the grains differed extremely in size in the same anthers, a large number being small and shrivelled, whilst many were fully as large as those of the short-styled form and rather more globular. It is probable that the large size of these grains was due, not to their having assumed the character of the short-styled form, but to monstrosity; for Max Wichura has observed pollen-grains of monstrous size in certain hybrids. The vast number of the small <b>shrivelled</b> <b>grains</b> in the above two cases explains the fact that, though equal-styled plants are generally fertile in a high degree, yet some of them yield few seeds. I may add that my son compared, in 1875, the grains from two white-flowered plants, in both of which the pistil projected above the anthers, but neither were properly long-styled or equal- styled; and in the one in which the stigma projected most, the grains were in diameter to those in the other plant, in which the stigma projected less, as 100 to 88; whereas the difference between the grains from perfectly characterised long-styled and short-styled plants is as 100 to 57. So that these two plants were in an intermediate condition. To return to the 17 plants in the first line of Table 5.31: from the relative position of their stigmas and anthers, they could hardly fail to fertilise themselves; and accordingly four of them spontaneously yielded no less than 180 capsules; of these Mr. Horwood selected eight fine capsules for sowing; and they included on an average 54.8 seeds, with a maximum of 72. He gave me thirty other capsules, taken by hazard, of which twenty-seven contained good seeds, averaging 35.5, with a maximum of 70; but if six poor capsules, each with less than 13 seeds, be excluded, the average rises to 42.5. These are higher numbers than could be expected from either well- characterised form if self-fertilised; and this high degree of fertility accords with the view that the male organs belonged to one form, and the female organs partially to the other form; so that a self-union {{in the case of the}} equal- styled variety is in fact a legitimate union.|$|E

The analyses revealed that 2 D(2 R) substitution reduces plant height and spikelet number per spike, increases the 1, 000 -kernel weight, does not reduce <b>grain</b> <b>shrivelling,</b> and promotes early heading and anthesis. 2 D(2 R) substitution lines exhibit deeper postharvest seed dormancy, which provides resistance to preharvest sprouting. However, 2 D(2 R) substitution lines are not recommended for winter hexaploid triticale cultivar development purposes due to their reduced grain productivity...|$|R
40|$|Wheat {{and barley}} crops {{were shown to}} be {{susceptible}} to Indian peanut clump virus (IPCV) under field conditions. In wheat, the Hyderabad isolate of IPCV (IPCV-H) induced symptoms resembling the rosette caused by soil-borne wheat mosaic virus, and these were apparent only three weeks after emergence. Early-infected plants were severely stunted and dark green, with chlorotic streaks on the youngest leaves, which turned necrotic as the plants aged; most of these plants died. Late-infected plants were also stunted and were conspicuous in the field because of their dark green appearance {{as a result of}} delayed maturity. The virus was detected by ELISA and nucleic acid hybridization in all plants with symptoms. These plants usually produced fewer tillers than healthy ones. Spikes were malformed, often did not emerge from the flag leaf, and they contained few <b>shrivelled</b> seeds. <b>Grain</b> yield was decreased, on average, by 58 %. In barley, IPCV-H caused severe stunting and general leaf chlorosis. As the plants aged, the leaves became necrotic and the few infected plants that reached maturity produced small spikes. IPCV-H antigens were detected by ELISA in every wheat seed from infected plants and the virus was transmitted through wheat seed at a frequency of 0. 5 - 1. 3 %. Storage at 4 degrees C {{for more than a year}} did not affect seed transmission frequency. The virus was detected in leaves and roots of seed-transmitted plants. Seed transmission was not detected in barley. The Durgapura isolate (IPCV-D) was detected in wheat crops (cv. RR- 21) at 3 different locations in Rajasthan State, India.

60|$|It {{occurred}} to Wyllard that Gregory had, at least, made no great success of farming; but that occupation, as practiced on the prairie, demands {{a great deal}} more than quickness and what some call brilliancy from the man who undertakes it.

It was, however, evident that this girl had an unquestioning faith in Gregory Hawtrey, and once more Wyllard felt compassionate towards her.

40|$|Fusarium ear blight (FEB) is {{a disease}} of wheat and small grain cereals, caused by the fungi Fusarium culmorum and Fusarium graminearum. The disease causes {{premature}} bleaching of spikelets and <b>shrivelling</b> of the <b>grain</b> {{can result in a}} direct yield loss. Mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol produced by the fungus can reduce grain quality. Breeding for resistant wheat cultivars {{is considered one of the}} best control options. Previously identified resistance has been reported in the Chinese genotype Sumai 3. The principal aim of this project was to identify novel sources of resistance to FEB. Twenty four wheat genotypes were evaluated for resistance to FEB in this project. Molecular markers linked to previously identified QTL from Sumai 3 conferring resistance were used to confirm their absence in the genotypes under investigation, and revealed that none of the genotypes under investigation contained all of the QTL for resistance. Field trials conducted over two years screening for resistance demonstrated that, although not statistically similar to Sumai 3, levels of disease were below 10 % in some of the Chinese genotypes. Follow up experiments using reporter strains of Fusarium graminearum explored the accumulation of fungal biomass and the expression of the gene Tri 5, which is essential for DON biosynthesis. Fungal biomass levels were not significantly different between genotypes; however expression of the Tri 5 gene was significantly lower in the genotype Alsen. A previously developed wheat leaf seedling bioassay was also explored. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of fungal hyphae in advance of the visible lesion during the infection course of F. culmorum. Inoculation with a Tri 5 mutant strain of F. graminearum demonstrated that a lack of mycotoxin production altered the lesion type. This project has successfully identified potential novel resistance mechanisms and the future prospects for the control of this disease are discussed.

40|$|Triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) is a high-yielding and {{vigourous}} {{interspecific hybrid}} between wheat and cereal rye. The crop {{is known for}} tolerance of abiotic stresses and high biomass production, and thus {{it has the potential}} to increase the profitability and productivity of growers in marginal environments and to help address the food production challenges of the 21 st century. The original cultivars from the 1960 s and 1970 s usually produced grain with flour properties in between triticale’s progenitor species, and thus produced dough inferior to wheat and unsuitable for a range of food products, including loaf bread, flat bread, cakes, biscuits and crackers. However over the last 40 years, grain yield and grain quality for animal feed have been significantly improved through breeding and selection, and hence indirect improvements (or at the least, genetic drift in quality alleles) in its potential to produce good food products could be expected. Furthermore, significant advances in wheat quality research have produced vast amounts of information, methodology and technology that can be easily used to improve triticale quality, and the tastes of the modern consumer are different to those of 40 years ago. This thesis aimed to characterise the flour properties of a range of modern triticale cultivars and compare them to wheat, then investigate genetic, agronomic and post-harvest strategies to improve the value of the grain for a human food market. Focus was given to the two major scientific issues which have historically hindered the use of triticale flour in food products – poor gluten strength and high α-amylase activity – and to other quality traits of commercial significance. The grain and flour quality was quantified in up to 17 modern triticale cultivars grown in four environments over 2 years – Greendale, NSW in 2009 (JP 09), Cowra, NSW in 2010 (COW 10), both of which are typical triticale growing environments with poor soil and minimal fertiliser, Narrabri, NSW in 2010 (NARR 10), which is a high yielding, high quality environment known for producing Australian Prime Hard wheat, and Stirling, SA in 2011 (SA 11) which is a high protein, low yielding environment. Field plots were arranged in a randomised complete block design at JP 09, COW 10 and NARR 10 with minimal irrigation; rust was controlled with fungicide. The three varieties from SA 11 were sourced from commercial seed production lots. Grain was milled to wholemeal flour on a Newport Scientific hammer mill with 0. 5 mm screen, and to white flour on both a Quadrumat® Junior Mill and a Bühler experimental mill. Glutenin and secalin subunits were characterised by SDS-PAGE and the gluten properties were investigated using the SDS-sedimentation test and mixographs. α-Amylase activity was investigated spectrophotometrically and using the falling number test. These vi measurements were compared to estimations of grain protein, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), starch content and fibre content using near-infrared transmittance (NIT). Flour protein was estimated by NIR (near-infrared reflectance). The pasting properties of milled flours were evaluated on a Newport Scientific Rapid Visco Analyzer according to AACC 76 - 21, except 10 mM AgNO 3 was used in place of DI water to inhibit α-amylase activity. Grain hardness was measured by the Single-Kernel Characterisation System and moisture and ash content by standard oven methods. Colour of Junior milled flour was assessed using a Minolta Chroma meter CR- 400. Finally, plain cookies were baked according to a standard recipe used to assess soft wheats. Variability in the glutenin and secalin subunits was small relative to global diversity amongst triticale cultivars, and reflects the narrow genetic base of material in Australian breeding programs. The gluten quality of these triticale cultivars was inferior to bread wheat but similar to soft wheat; however the protein content of triticale flour was significantly lower than wheat flour. Lower triticale protein content represents a change from early cultivars and reduces its capacity to form viscoelastic gluten. Cultivars Hawkeye and Vicuna were recommended for breeding to improve gluten strength in locally adapted germplasm. Much greater variability in starch and NSP characteristics were found in triticale compared to wheat, and the ranges overlapped between species. The cultivars Tobruk, Yukuri and Berkshire expressed equivalent α-amylase activity to wheat; cultivars Jaywick and Yukuri were found to have partially waxy starch. Triticale generally exhibited higher NSP, equivalent pasting properties, higher α-amylase activity and lower falling number than wheat checks. However, low falling number was not indicative of high α-amylase activity; this contradicts the assumptions on which previous triticale research was based and has implications for the interpretation of research and the use of falling number to compare triticale to wheat. Furthermore, an unexpected negative correlation was observed with NSP, where higher NSP reduced the slurry viscosity measured in the falling number test. Modification of the falling number test is recommended before it can be used in triticale breeding programs. Nevertheless, the observed genetic variability in starch characteristics and α-amylase activity indicates some triticale cultivars have waxy properties conducive to the production of noodles, and that certain lines exhibited similar late-maturity α-amylase activity to modern wheat cultivars: an indirect benefit of breeding and selection over the past few decades. Like starch properties, great variation was found amongst triticale cultivars for hardness, colour and milling yield. Berkshire displayed a grain hardness equivalent to durum wheat, suggesting a null allele at the rye softness protein locus (Sin locus); the remaining cultivars exhibited a grain hardness between soft wheat and bread wheat. The high milling yield and low fibre content of Tobruk (milling yield was even higher than bread wheat) suggested this line has a thin seed coat and thus would be an excellent parent for the genetic improvement of triticale milling yield. Average flour ash content was significantly higher vii than wheat in both statistical and practical terms, and a different bench mark needs to be used for low ash triticale flour compared to low ash wheat. Apart from Vicuna and Yukuri, triticale cultivars produced darker flour than wheat, however with modern consumer preferences tending towards ‘healthy-looking’ foods, darker flour should not be a hindrance to its utility. The overall results confirmed previous suggestions that triticale is suited to soft wheat products such as cookies, and hence their cookie quality was investigated. Although the dough behaviour and water absorption of triticale was different to soft wheat (specifically, triticale dough tended to loose large amounts of water during sheeting), triticale cookies were found to be equivalent to soft wheat cookies. Overall, the survey of quality amongst modern triticale cultivars suggested two things: firstly, sufficient genetic variation exists amongst current lines to breed triticale cultivars with significantly improved flour quality (comparable to wheat for some quality traits); secondly, there is a clear need to classify current cultivars into suitability for various end uses. This would facilitate efficient marketing to the milling industry and subsequent use in food products. Improvement of the the poor gluten strength in triticale was attempted by backcrossing locally-adapted spring breeding lines to DH 265, a winter line which contained a modified 1 R chromosome carrying two translocations from 1 D of bread wheat – the Glu-D 1 d allele from 1 DL (which simultaneously removed Glu-R 1) and the Gli-D 1 /Glu-D 3 locus from the distal end of 1 DS. Single plant and plot selection was performed on five cross populations grown in multiple environments and the yield, protein content and gluten strength was analysed on F 4 -derived F 7 grain. Lines containing the translocation had a slightly lower yield compared to the null lines and the triticale checks; but similar to the wheat checks for all except one cross (which was significantly less). This may reflect a loss of root system vigour, head length or higher selection pressure due to lower transmission rate of the translocation to offspring. The translocation slightly increased protein content in two populations and increased SDS-sedimentation height in one population (after accounting for the influence of higher protein content). However, no difference was detected between the overall average SDS-sedimentation height of the null lines and the wheat and triticale checks. This is partially due to large variability in SDS-sedimentation height within each cross population resulting from significant variability at other glutenin and secalin loci. Nevertheless, several lines were identified with grain yield equivalent to current triticale cultivars (and significantly higher than wheat) plus equivalent SDS-sedimentation height to wheat. Thus the translocation is a potential solution to the generally poor gluten strength of modern triticale cultivars. The viability of using existing variability for secaloglutenin alleles in the progenitor species was investigated as a means of creating new germplasm (‘primary triticales’) with high gluten strength. The HMW glutenins of five durum lines, and the HMW secalins and 75 k γ- secalins of two rye lines, were defined using SDS-PAGE. These lines were then crossed, new primaries were produced, and grain was tested for the expression of secaloglutenin viii alleles, protein content and SDS-sedimentation height as an estimation of secalogluten strength. The secaloglutenin alleles were simply inherited from the parental plants and all were expressed normally in the offspring, however it was possible that mixed oligomers were formed between glutenins and secalins at the macromolecular level. Significant differences were observed in the SDS-sedimentation height of primaries originating from different durum parents, suggesting that selection of durum parents with high SDSsedimentation is a viable method for producing triticale flour with superior gluten properties. In south-eastern Australia, dual-purpose cropping is commonly used by growers to manage risk in mixed enterprise operations. A preliminary report of lower ash content but comparable protein content in triticale produced in dual-purpose systems was reported in Bangladesh and hence an experiment was conducted to assess the effect of biomass removal on grain yield, test weight, protein content and ash content of grain from four Australian dual-purpose triticale lines grown in five year-site environments (ash content is correlated with nutritional value, milling yield and flour colour). Ash content was either unaffected or increased by removal of biomass and both protein content and grain yield were reduced. It was concluded that although ash content was lower in some lines cut late in the season, the general effect was detrimental to quality and even when ash content was reduced, the effect was not large enough to reduce the level to that of wheat. Hence similar to wheat, dual-purpose triticale systems are not recommended for production of grain for a milling market. Poor milling yield in triticale is a key concern for millers. However, the high variability of grain hardness in triticale, historic problems with <b>grain</b> <b>shrivelling,</b> and lack of varietal classification has meant milling is usually conducted without adjusting settings to batch characteristics. Hence the importance of tempering moisture was investigated in three triticale varieties of varying hardness grown in two environments alongside a wheat standard. Milling yield and ash content both increased as tempering moisture was decreased from 15...|$|R
