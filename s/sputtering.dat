As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, reactive <b>sputtering,</b> and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid <b>sputtering</b> effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E

5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; <b>sputtering</b> then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, <b>sputtering,</b> sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{demonstrate}} the coupling of Monte Carlo <b>sputter</b> simulation with feature-scale simulation of profile evolution during <b>sputter</b> etching. With the Monte Carlo <b>sputter</b> simulation, {{the dependence of}} the <b>sputter</b> yield on the angle of incidence and on the energy of ions impinging onto the surface is determined. The yield curves obtained thereby are fed into a feature-scale etching profile simulator which predicts the local etch rates based on these <b>sputter</b> yield curves and on ion fluxes which are calculated for a substrate placed in a <b>sputter</b> reactor. For validating the simulations, a process sequence consisting of deposition and back etching (in an argon plasma) of silicon oxide between metal lines has been studied. Assuming an ion energy of 250 eV allows us to consistently reproduce profiles observed experimentally. I...|$|R

5|$|The {{permanent}} {{magnetic moment}} carves {{a part of}} space around Ganymede, creating a tiny magnetosphere embedded inside that of Jupiter; {{it is the only}} moon in the Solar System known to possess the feature. Its diameter is 4–5 RG (RG = 2,631.2km). The Ganymedian magnetosphere has a region of closed field lines located below 30° latitude, where charged particles (electrons and ions) are trapped, creating a kind of radiation belt. The main ion species in the magnetosphere is single ionized oxygen—O+—which fits well with Ganymede's tenuous oxygen atmosphere. In the polar cap regions, at latitudes higher than 30°, magnetic field lines are open, connecting Ganymede with Jupiter's ionosphere. In these areas, the energetic (tens and hundreds of kiloelectronvolt) electrons and ions have been detected, which may cause the auroras observed around the Ganymedian poles. In addition, heavy ions continuously precipitate on Ganymede's polar surface, <b>sputtering</b> and darkening the ice.|$|E

25|$|Ion etching is a <b>sputtering</b> {{process that}} can remove very fine {{quantities}} of material. This is used to perform a finishing polish of specimens polished by other means. Ion etching uses an inert gas passed through an electric field to generate a plasma stream that is directed to the sample surface. Acceleration energies for gases such as argon are typically a few kilovolts. The sample may be rotated to promote even polishing of the sample surface. The <b>sputtering</b> rate of such methods is {{on the order of}} tens of micrometers per hour, limiting the method to only extremely fine polishing.|$|E

Ion beam textured surface structures have been characterized with SEM photomicrographs for a large number of materials including Cu, Al, Si, Ti, Ni, Fe, Stainless steel, Au, and Ag. Surfaces have been textured using a variety of low <b>sputter</b> yield materials - Ta, Mo, Nb, and Ti. The initial stages of the texture creation have been documented, and the technique of ion beam <b>sputter</b> removal of any remaining deposited material has been studied. A number of other texturing parameters have been studied such as the variation of the texture with ion beam power, surface temperature, and the rate of texture growth with <b>sputter</b> etching time...|$|R
40|$|Thin film {{systems are}} often {{analysed}} by using <b>sputter</b> depth profiling. First the sample gets eroded by inert gas ion impact during <b>sputter</b> depth profiling. Then the elemental {{composition of the}} freshly unveiled surface is determined by using a surface sensitive analytical method as AES or XPS, for instance. This way the depth distributions of the elements are recorded {{as a function of}} <b>sputter</b> time. The time to record the spectral data in a certain <b>sputter</b> depth is kept as short as possible to avoid recontamination of the freshly <b>sputtered</b> surface by adsorption of gas particles from the vacuum during the measurement. Therefore in every <b>sputter</b> depth only those spectral regions are recorded, which belong to the elements expected to be in the sample. But in case the sample composition is entirely unknown, it is indispensable to measure wide energy range spectra. By this approach the depth distributions of all elements are estimated, which are detectable by the used analytical method. The measurement of wide energy range spectra during <b>sputter</b> depth profile acquisition is promising for samples, which are very insulating. If the surface potential varies in different <b>sputter</b> depths, the elemental peaks are shifted in an unpredictable way. If wide energy range spectra are recorded, the energy scale can be re-adjusted afterwards and the data can be re-evaluated. Both use cases are demonstrated exemplarily by <b>sputter</b> depth profile measurements. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of a <b>sputter</b> erosion monitoring system to study Hall thruster lifetime and contamination. The laser-based sensor uses the continuous-wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy (cw-CRDS) technique and allows for in situ measurements in near real-time. The cw-CRDS diagnostic allows direct probing of <b>sputter</b> products in their ground state, thereby providing a reliable quantitative measure of their overall number density. Combining the number density of <b>sputtered</b> particles with their velocity allows determination of the flux of <b>sputtered</b> articles and erosion rate. We perform proof of principle experiments in which <b>sputtered</b> manganese (Mn) atoms from the acceleration channel of an anode layer type Hall thruster are measured. The measurement strategy is to detect the Mn atoms via an absorption line from the ground state at a wavelength of 403. 076 nm (air). The measured path-integrated number density of <b>sputtered</b> Mn atoms is 1. 7 ± 0. 3 × 1013 m- 2 for an argon anode mass flow rate of 2. 08 mg/s and discharge voltage of 250 V.

25|$|The {{starting}} material is a flat substrate, {{such as a}} silicon wafer or a polished disc of beryllium, copper, titanium, or other material.

25|$|If {{graphite}} is used, {{the gross}} erosion rates due to {{physical and chemical}} <b>sputtering</b> would be many meters per year, so one must rely on redeposition of the sputtered material. The location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with {{the location of the}} <b>sputtering,</b> so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite, although a very attractive material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary plasma-facing material (PFM) in a commercial reactor.|$|E

25|$|Vacuum {{deposition}} {{began with}} {{the study of the}} <b>sputtering</b> phenomenon during the 1920s and 1930s, which was a common problem in lighting in which metal ejected from the electrodes coated the glass, blocking output. However, turning <b>sputtering</b> into a reliable method of coating a mirror did not occur until the invention of semiconductors in the 1970s. Evaporation coating was pioneered by John Strong in 1912. Aluminum was a desirable material for mirrors, but was too dangerous to apply with electroplating. Strong used evaporation coating to make the first aluminum telescope mirrors in the 1930s. The first dielectric mirror was created in 1937 by Auwarter using evaporated rhodium, while the first metallic mirror to be enhanced with a dielectric coating of silicon dioxide was created by Hass the same year. In 1939 at the Schott Glass company, Walter Geffcken invented the first dielectric mirrors to use multilayer coatings (stacks).|$|E

40|$|In the {{semiconductor}} industry the number of devices per die increases and the critical dimension decreases as the processor speed increases. These developments have pushed the industry toward depositing metal, seed layers, and diffusion barriers into high aspect ratio (height to width or radius) trenches and vias. Ionized Metal Physical Vapor Deposition (IMPVD) is being developed to meet these needs. IMPVD is {{a process in which}} <b>sputtered</b> metal atoms from a magnetron target are ionized by a secondary plasma, accelerated into the substrate, and deposited with moderately anisotropic fluxes. In IMPVD the <b>sputtered</b> metal atoms and neutralized ions reflected from the target have higher kinetic energies than the buffer gas and so are not in thermal equilibrium. The momentum and energy transfer from the <b>sputtered</b> atoms and reflected neutrals rarifies the background gas (<b>sputter</b> heating) and redistributes the metal species in the reactor. The Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM) was improved to address <b>sputter</b> heating during IMPVD. The model was validated by comparison to experimental metal atom densities and to the ionization fraction of the deposition flux. It was found that <b>sputter</b> heating produces rarefaction of the buffer gas, which results in a redistribution of Al species in the reactor compared to the absence of <b>sputter</b> heating...|$|R
