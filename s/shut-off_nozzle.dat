2500|$|The {{chemical}} foam extinguisher {{was invented in}} 1904 by Aleksandr Loran in Russia, based on his previous invention of fire fighting foam. Loran first used it to extinguish a pan of burning naphtha. It worked and looked similar to the soda-acid type, but the inner parts were slightly different. The main tank contained a solution of sodium bicarbonate in water, whilst the inner container (somewhat larger than the equivalent in a soda-acid unit) contained a solution of aluminium sulphate. When the solutions were mixed, usually by inverting the unit, the two liquids reacted to create a frothy foam, and carbon dioxide gas. The gas expelled the foam {{in the form of}} a jet. Although liquorice-root extracts and similar compounds were used as additives (stabilizing the foam by reinforcing the bubble-walls), there was no [...] "foam compound" [...] in these units. The foam was a combination of the products of the chemical reactions: sodium and aluminium salt-gels inflated by the carbon dioxide. Because of this, the foam was discharged directly from the unit, with no need for an aspirating branchpipe (as in newer mechanical foam types). Special versions were made for rough service, and vehicle mounting, known as apparatus of fire department types. Key features were a screw-down stopper that kept the liquids from mixing until it was manually opened, carrying straps, a longer hose, and a <b>shut-off</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Fire department types were often private label versions of major brands, sold by apparatus manufacturers to match their vehicles. Examples are Pirsch, Ward LaFrance, Mack, Seagrave, etc. These types are some of the most collectible extinguishers as they cross into both the apparatus restoration and fire extinguisher areas of interest.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shut-off</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{are used}} in the {{manufacturing}} process of plastic injection molding. Machine <b>shut-off</b> <b>nozzles</b> serve as the connection between the plasticizing barrel (with reciprocating screw) and the mold. They are mounted on the machineside of the plastic injection molding process, unlike hot runner nozzles which are mounted on the moldside of the process. Machine <b>shut-off</b> <b>nozzles</b> differ from open nozzles because of their closable melt channel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shut-off</b> <b>nozzles</b> can be {{self-controlled}} or externally controlled.|$|R
50|$|The nozzle {{is opened}} by {{external}} force, {{independent of the}} melt-pressure. The <b>shut-off</b> <b>nozzleâ€™s</b> actuation is hydraulically or pneumatically driven. Externally actuated <b>shut-off</b> <b>nozzles</b> can have different ways of closing the melt stream. Due {{to the fact that}} they operate independent of melt-pressure they can be used for a range of applications such as melt pre-compression, physical and chemical foaming and high-speed injection molding.|$|R

50|$|Non-{{pressure}} refuel systems operate via {{a closed}} loop system where all pressure is contained interior to signal lines, level control, and a shut-off valve. When the fuel tank fill point is reached, a bleed line signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a diaphragm valve at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled. Non-pressurized refueling systems do not require tank pressurization for automatic <b>nozzle</b> <b>shut-off,</b> thus allowing their use on thin-walled metallic and composite material fuel tanks.|$|R
