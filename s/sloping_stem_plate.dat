40|$|Fusarium {{basal plate}} rot (FBR), caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, is an {{important}} soil-borne disease of onions worldwide. The causal organism infects the basal <b>stem</b> <b>plate</b> of the bulb and eventually kills the entire plant through degradation of the basal plate. F. o. f. sp. cepae infections in dormant bulbs during storage allow secondary infections to occur. The primary method of infection by F. o. f. sp. cepae is through direct penetration of the basal <b>stem</b> <b>plate.</b> Infection can also occur through wounded tissue particularly roots and basal portions of bulb scales. The most cost-effective methods of control are crop rotation and host plant resistance. Current research suggests that a single gene, two genes, or multiple genes govern resistance to FBR. Breeding programs have successfully used screening procedures to develop intermediate- and long-day, FBR-resistant cultivars...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In Gary Becker’s (1991) {{theory of}} {{bandwagon}} effects, {{a portion of}} market demand is positively sloped. In this, he ignores Harvey Leibenstein’s (1950) hypothesis that market demands for bandwagon goods are everywhere negatively <b>sloped</b> (<b>stemming</b> from scarcity imposed constraints). A substantial literature now invokes Becker’s bandwagon, also ignoring Leibenstein. Two anomalies attend Becker’s bandwagon demand when it slopes upward: 1) straightforward parameterizations are inconsistent with the economic requirement that quantities demanded be non-negative; 2) regardless of parameterization, the comparative statics of Becker’s demand carry unworldly implications...|$|R

40|$|All {{garlic cloves}} {{infected}} at harvest {{with the white}} rot fungus (Scierotium cepivorum) decayed while in storage. The white rot fungus was not recovered from any decayed trashy material in this seedlot other than scierotia. Nevertheless some sclerotia of the white rot fungus survived traditional hot water-formaldehyde seed treatment processes. Those sur-viving were aggregated within decayed cloves, which might pass through the mechanical processors associated withcracking and seed treatment. Reduction in time and/or tem-perature of the treatment solutions allowed partial survival even of unaggregated scierotia. It remains unclear if scle-rotia surviving hot water treatments are fully competent. Hypothetical Question: May the garlic industry feel secure that the standard Lear-Johnson seed treatment, and possibly milder variations of it, will eradicate the white rot fungus from a seed lot. METHODS In the summer of 1987, a bag of garlic infected with the white rot fungus (Sclerotium cepivorum) was collected in Monterey County CA, and shipped to the University of Cali-fornia Tulelake Field Station in Tulelake, CA. It was held as per normal seed storage until January, 1988. In January, 1988, the stored garlic was separated into several compo-nents: 1) loose sclerotia and 2) fully-decayed cloves in which abundant scierotia were aggregated together with clove tissue and mycelium ("aggregates"), these varied from 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm in various irregular cross sections and were cal-culated to contain from 4, 000 - 25, 000 sclerotia each and 3) cloves which appeared normally developed and uninfected (no signs of the fungus on either <b>stem</b> <b>plates</b> or covering leaf sheaths) ...|$|R

5000|$|In February 1923 the Fenella {{collided}} with the ocean liner Clan Cumming in low visibility on the River Mersey, sustaining damage and was subsequently beached. The Fenella had left Douglas in stormy conditions on Sunday 18 February, with passengers and a cargo of livestock. She arrived at the Prince’s Landing Stage later that night, and discharged her passengers and cargo. Following this she proceeded to anchor in the Mersey, and {{it was during the}} course of this manoeuvre that she struck the stem of the Clan Liner, Clan Cumming, and sustained substantial damage to her port quarter. The Clan Cumming was a vessel of [...] and 400 ft feet in length. She was lying at anchor in the Mersey at the time of the collision, following which she sustained slight damage to her stem, but was subsequently able to dock. Following the collision a hole was torn in the side of the Fenella, and her Master, Capt. Lee, not knowing the full extent of the damage, took the decision to beach the vessel on the Tranmere Bight. Fenella’s crew were then taken off by the Dock Board boat, Salvor, however Capt. Lee stayed with the vessel. The Fenella was inspected by the Company’s Marine Superintendent Mr. J. Kelly, who supervised temporary repairs, but the findings were that the damage was considerably worse than at first thought, and the Fenella remained beached at Tranmere until the following Thursday afternoon. She was subsequently floated and taken to the dry dock at Cammell Laird’s for further repairs to be undertaken. Following her dry docking, Fenella had her damage repaired and underwent a substantial overhaul as a result of the collision. According to Lloyd's List, this repair work took six weeks and included renewal of her boliers, cylinders and steam pipes, and the making good to damage sustained to public rooms and accommodation as a consequence of them being immersed in salt water for several days. Damage to the Clan Cumming was comparatively slight, however she was also taken to a dry dock where her <b>stem</b> <b>plating</b> was removed, and her twisted stem straightened.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} the icebreaking forces, the hull lines of an icebreaker are usually designed so that the flare at the waterline is as small as possible. As a result, icebreaking ships are characterized by a <b>sloping</b> or rounded <b>stem</b> as well as sloping sides and a short parallel midship to improve maneuverability in ice. However, the spoon-shaped bow and round hull have poor hydrodynamic efficiency and seakeeping characteristics, and make the icebreaker susceptible to slamming. For this reason, the hull of an icebreaker is often a compromise between minimum ice resistance, maneuverability in ice, low hydrodynamic resistance, and adequate open water characteristics.|$|R

40|$|Although {{it is well}} {{accepted}} that the constituents of the cellular microenvironment modulate a myriad of cellular processes, including cell morphology, cytoskeletal dynamics and uptake pathways, the underlying mechanism of how these pathways influence non-viral gene transfer have not been studied. Transgene expression is increased on fibronectin (Fn) coated surfaces {{as a consequence of}} increased proliferation, cell spreading and active engagement of clathrin endocytosis pathway. RhoGTPases mediate the crosstalk between the cell and Fn, and regulate cellular processes involving filamentous actin, in-response to cellular interaction with Fn. Here the role of RhoGTPases specifically Rho, Rac and Cdc 42 in modulation of non-viral gene transfer in mouse mesenchymal <b>stem</b> (mMSCs) <b>plated</b> in a fibronectin microenvironment was studied. More than 90 % decrease in transgene expression was observed after inactivation of RhoGTPases using difficile toxin B (TcdB) and C 3 transferase.

However, further activation of RhoA, Rac 1 and Cdc 42 by expression of constitutively active genes (RhoAQ 63 L, Rac 1 Q 61 L and Cdc 42 Q 61 L) did not further enhance transgene expression in mMSCs, when plated on Fn.

The evaluation was accomplished through detailed time studies conducted on a Koller K- 300 yarder, a Crown Super 3000 self-loader, and a John Deere 440 choker skidder, in a selective thinning of a Coast Range Douglas-fir stand with n average diameter range of eight to twelve inches. Production increases on the yarding cycle were observed when the skidder was used to keep the landing clear. A major factor for higher production rates was reduced landing delays. Comparisons of the loading operation from decks built by the yarder and by the skidder showed a significant time savings when loading from skidder decks. The portions of the loading cycle most affected were the sort and swing loaded elements. The analysis indicated that sorteddecks oriented at small angles to the road and decked as high as possible required the shortest loading time. The skidding cycle was evaluated frm a mechanical engineering approach and compared to regression analysis results. The results snowed that the skidder was capable of production rates in excess of 10 cunits per hour. The hooking and decking elements consumed the largest portion of the skidding cycle. An alternate method of hooking or investigation of a grapple attachment is suggested. Important factors influencing the harvesting of a unit were identified and a model was developed to aid in planning. The influence of landing geometry as related to log holding capabilities of a landing, log diameter, and stems removed per acre are explored. Despite an improvement in overall production, the skidder did not prove cost effective for the study when its full cost was charged to yarding production. There were indications, however, that the skidder or a loader may be a necessity for longer yarding distances, flat decking <b>slopes,</b> high <b>stem</b> removals, or larger diameter trees. The skidder cost benefit ratio may also be improved if the skidder or operator remain active in the overall harvest operation when not needed for swinging and sorting...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Twenty-five gabion-type {{structures}} {{across the}} main stem and tributaries of the Siuslaw River in the Oregon Coastal Range, installed {{to expand the}} available spawning area for fish, were investigated {{for their ability to}} perform gravel control functions such as trapping bedload carried by the stream or holding gravel placed behind the structures. The merits of gravel trapping structures in the main stem Siuslaw River were found to depend largely on channel features in the reach at and above the structures. Factors favoring successful developments were: ample gravel supply, high bed roughness, wide straight reaches, and lateral stream bed slopes deflecting flood water from the structure. Among limiting factors were: the existence of pools immediately upstream of structures, deficient gravel supply, curving stream alignment, and unfavorable lateral stream bed <b>slopes.</b> Main <b>stem</b> reaches with an instantaneous peak discharge exceeding 100 cfs per foot width were found questionable for development. The controlling factors in the tributary streams were found to be approach velocities and stream features such as bedrock smoothness, approach slope, channel alignment, constrictions, lateral bed slope, plunge pools, and lengths of gravel beds. Careful placing of gravel to predetermined slopes was found not to be warranted, as the stream would rework the gravel according to local influences. Reaches where the flow was retarded without widening and reaches where high velocities occurred were found especially unfavorable for gravel stability. Flume studies with simulated gabions and full-size gravel were carried out to study incipient motion and scour from a gravel bed behind a gabion. Scour was found to take place from the upstream portion of the gravel bed, resulting in an adversely sloping bed there. Bed forms of standing-wave type, with changing wave location, were encountered when the flow was in the critical region; subsequent scour would wash the bed waves out. Gravel transport from apparently stable beds subjected to very low flow strengths verified that gravel transport is a statistical phenomenon and that the threshold of motion should include time of observation as a variable. Disruption of the gravel imbrication at the bed surface was found to encourage particle movement. The effect of buried perforated pipes o. n reducing bed siltation was investigated {{at the time of the}} stability experiments. No beneficial effect on the siltation pattern could be found when well-graded fine material was added to the flume...|$|R
