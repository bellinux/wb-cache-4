5|$|A {{long-lived}} plant {{reaching an}} age of up to 60 years, I.anemonifolius resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfire. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although I.anemonifolius was collected by Daniel Solander in 1770, it was not described until 1796 by Richard Salisbury. Several varieties have been named, though none are now recognised as distinct. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. I.anemonifolius grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> sandy soil and good drainage.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 22 mm. The forewings are whitish, somewhat <b>spotted</b> <b>with</b> brownish and with weak brownish suffusions. The markings are rust brown, <b>spotted</b> <b>with</b> dark brown along the edges. The hindwings are whitish.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings are pale fuscous reddish, irregularly <b>spotted</b> <b>with</b> ochreous. The markings are deep ochreous, partially mixed {{with black and}} ferruginous. The hindwings are pale whitish grey, <b>spotted</b> <b>with</b> grey.|$|R
25|$|Antennae black, {{head and}} thorax black <b>spotted</b> <b>with</b> ochraceous and white; abdomen {{anteriorly}} black, posteriorly ochraceous yellow with narrow transverse black lines; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen ochraceous, the thorax <b>spotted</b> <b>with</b> ochraceous, the abdomen with a longitudinal line of black at base.|$|R
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} in pure culture on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum <b>spot,</b> <b>with</b> each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. All ten seasons of Friends ranked within the top ten of the final {{television}} season ratings; ultimately reaching the No. 1 <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> its eighth season. The series finale on May 6, 2004, was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth most watched series finale in television history, and the most watched television episode of the 2000s decade.|$|E
5|$|Nature {{has been}} more than lavish in her gifts to St. Johns. Travel as many miles as you like and go where you will, it is highly {{improbable}} that you will find a <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> so many magnificent nature advantages as has St. Johns. The fine stretch of level land on which the city is located, the deep water of the two rivers, the navigable sloughs and the superb scenery which nature has painted with a master hand, makes the location an ideal one in every respect either for industries or residences.|$|E

The next week, it sold 49,600 copies to remain at the top <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> a 75% sales decrease. The album secured a third consecutive week atop the French chart, withstanding a 29% sales drop to 35,500 copies.|$|E
5|$|Stroheim had met casually with Jean Hersholt {{to discuss}} the role of Marcus Schouler, but he was {{initially}} reluctant to cast him. However, after Hersholt adjusted his appearance and wardrobe to more closely resemble Schouler, Stroheim changed his mind on the <b>spot.</b> <b>With</b> the exception of Gowland, Stroheim shot extensive screen tests {{of all the other}} actors at Goldwyn with cinematographer Paul Ivano. A scene from the Goldwyn film Souls for Sale is thought to be behind-the-scenes footage of Stroheim directing Greed, but it actually depicts him directing Hersholt during one of these screen tests.|$|E
5|$|The Dallas Cowboys, {{who were}} {{unsuccessful}} claiming Quinn 10 days earlier, claimed {{him after he}} was waived by the Colts. In Dallas, Quinn became the Cowboys second-string quarterback after Troy Aikman was injured and Jason Garrett became the starter. He played in three games for the Cowboys in 1998, completing one pass for 10yards. In 1999, Quinn did not play in a game for Dallas. During the 2000 offseason, Garrett {{signed as a free}} agent with the New York Giants and quarterback Paul Justin was signed by Dallas to compete for the backup <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> Quinn. He was released on May 5, 2000.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, he {{secured a}} full-time roster <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> the Devils. With Doug Gilmour having left {{the team as}} a free agent in the 1998 off-season, Morrison was expected to help fill the void at centre. His 46 points (13 goals and 33 assists) over 76 games finished second among NHL rookies behind Milan Hejduk of the Colorado Avalanche. He ranked fifth in Calder Memorial Trophy voting as the League's rookie of the year with one first-place ballot (the award was given to the Avalanche's Chris Drury).|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships {{has long been a}} sore <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E
5|$|Through {{one of his}} escorting clients, Culver {{landed a}} <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> the Wilhelmina Models {{modeling}} agency, commanding an hourly rate of US $60. He continued to pursue stage work, landing an understudy job in 1969 in the Off-Broadway gay-themed play And Puppy Dog Tails, making his Broadway debut in 1970 in the Native American-themed production Brave and a co-starring role in the off-Broadway Circle in the Water, also in 1970.|$|E

5|$|After Groza retired, he entertained {{an offer}} {{to play for the}} San Francisco 49ers, but was {{reluctant}} to do so because {{he did not want to}} move his family and insurance business to the West Coast. He was offered a <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> the Browns as a kicking coach, helping mentor the young Don Cockroft, but he declined. Later in life, he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns, inviting rookies over for dinner and helping them find apartments. He continued to run a successful insurance business and lived in Berea, Ohio near the Browns' headquarters and training facility. He and his wife Jackie were known as the team's First Family.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was born}} {{five days after the}} September 15 cutoff date for {{eligibility}} in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, there was a significant effort made to allow Tavares into the Draft. Following his 72-goal campaign in 2006–07, Tavares' agents asked the NHL and NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) to make an exception for Tavares similar to the one the OHL had made in 2005. The attempt was unsuccessful, however, and Tavares was forced to wait until 2009 to participate in the League Entry Draft. In October 2007, however, it was reported that then-Toronto Maple Leafs General Manager John Ferguson, Jr., had offered the 17-year-old Tavares a <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. Like the NHL, however, the AHL declined to amend its by-laws, and Tavares subsequently returned to the OHL.|$|E
5|$|Benfica opened April in Azores against Santa Clara on the 6th. Lacking attacking options, {{the team}} was unable to score and ended with a goalless draw; they {{remained}} ahead of Porto only with the goal difference. On 14 April, Benfica received Paços de Ferreira at home. With two goals {{in the first half}} and another two in the second, the team won 4–0 and remained in third. A week later, Benfica visited Sporting for the second Derby de Lisboa of the season. Despite a first score by Jankauskas, a mistake by Armando Sá allowed Sporting's Jardel to score from the penalty <b>spot.</b> <b>With</b> its third draw in just one month, Benfica was overtaken by Porto in the league table, dropping to fourth. On the 28th, Benfica hosted Boavista, knowing that by beating them, they would award the league title to Sporting. The meet ended with a 2–1 win for Benfica, after Mantorras took advantage of an error from Bassey William Andem in the 81st minute, confirming the second title in three years for Sporting.|$|E

5|$|Entering April, the Capitals had {{a chance}} to clinch a playoff spot against the Tampa Bay Lightning. The game was tied 2–2 with 1:03 {{remaining}} when Steven Stamkos scored, leading Tampa to the eventual 4–2 victory. Facing the Division-leading Panthers in their next game, Washington succeeded in clinching a playoff <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> a 4–2 win of their own. The victory also gave the Capitals a chance at winning their Division in their final game. During the game, Neuvirth was hurt when former Capital Marco Sturm fell on top of him while he was making a save. Neuvirth left after the incident and did not return. Neuvirth suffered a lower body injury and was not ready to return for the final game or the start of the playoffs. Washington won its final game of the year behind a 35-save performance from Holtby, clinching at least the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference pending the outcome of Florida’s game. A win by the Panthers in their final game, however, prevented Washington from winning their fifth-straight Division title and moving into the third playoff seed.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before its}} release in the United Kingdom, the {{compilation}} had broken a record as the album with most shipments before release, with 750,000 copies shipped, overtaking the previous pre-release high of 650,000 copies achieved by Simply Red's compilation album, Greatest Hits (1996). GHV2 debuted at number {{two on the}} UK Albums Chart, after competing for the top <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> Westlife's third studio album, World of Our Own, with the boy band outselling Madonna by two to one in the midweek chart. The album was present {{for a total of}} 33 weeks inside the chart, and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). As of May 2006, the compilation has sold 804,076 copies according to the Official Charts Company. GHV2 also debuted at number two, behind Westlife's album in Ireland and Scotland. Across Europe, the compilation {{reached the top of the}} chart in Austria, and reaching the top-ten in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Spain and Switzerland. On the combined European Top 100 Albums, GHV2 peaked at number five.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the title}} win, Chapman kept faith with his squad, making only one new signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they {{successfully}} defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part {{caused by an}} injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top <b>spot</b> <b>with</b> a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As a testament to Chapman's philosophy of relying on a strong defence, {{it was the first}} time a title-winning side had gone through a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.|$|E
