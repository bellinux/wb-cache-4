5|$|The German naval staff hoped {{all these}} changes could be {{accomplished}} by April 1943, with the carrier's first <b>sea</b> <b>trials</b> taking place in August that year. Towards that end, Chief Engineer Wilhelm Hadeler was reassigned to oversee Graf Zeppelins completion. Hadeler planned on getting the two inner shafts and their respective propulsion systems operational first, giving the ship an initial speed of 2526 knots, fast enough for <b>sea</b> <b>trials</b> to commence and for conducting air training exercises. By the winter of 19431944 she {{was expected to be}} combat-ready.|$|E

5|$|On 19 March 1931, {{even before}} Arizona was put through post-modernization <b>sea</b> <b>trials,</b> she hosted President Herbert Hoover {{for a brief}} {{vacation}} in the Caribbean. The President visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Returning on 29 March, Arizona conducted her <b>sea</b> <b>trials</b> at Rockland, Maine, and had another catapult fitted {{on the top of}} Turret III, before she was transferred to the West Coast in August with her sister Pennsylvania. In February 1932, the ship participated in Grand Joint Exercise No. 4 in which carrier aircraft successfully attacked Pearl Harbor on Sunday morning, 7 February. After returning to the West Coast from Fleet ProblemXIV in 1933, the ship was anchored in San Pedro when an earthquake struck nearby Long Beach, California, on 10 March. Sailors from the ship joined the relief efforts, providing food, treating the injured and providing security from looters.|$|E

40|$|Hadal {{science is}} one of {{research}} frontiers in earth science. Exploring the hadal zone has become an attractive and challenging event in marine engineering due to extremely hostile environment. Only few underwater vehicles {{have the ability to}} dive deeper than 6000 meters. Free-fall vehicle, also known as “lander” has been widely applied in marine investigation for decades, and has made a spectacular achievement in hadal research. This paper presents the <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> and corresponding results of a 7000 -meter lander, which mainly focused on biology and ecology research in hadal zone. The <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> was conducted in shallow water area and deep-sea area in South China Sea, where functional tests, descent/ascent speed characteristics, and comprehensive performance were studied. During the deep-sea trial, a serial of scientific research achievements was obtained. <b>Sea</b> <b>trial</b> results validated the multi-function, effectiveness and stability of the lander system...|$|R

40|$|During a {{successful}} 2 year technology {{demonstration of the}} tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) based Multi-Gas Monitor (MGM) on the International Space Station (ISS), we began discussing with the US Navy the possibility of conducting a <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> of an MGM on a submarine. The <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> would also include a gas chromatography/differential mobility spectrometer based Air Quality Monitor (AQM), which is used operationally on ISS for select volatile organic compounds. AQM results will {{be the subject of}} a separate paper. The Navys interest in testing NASA equipment is in a planned update to the environmental monitoring equipment used aboard submarines. NASAs goal is studying submarines as closed environment analogs to spacecraft. MGMs core technology was developed by Vista Photonics Inc using Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants and expanded for various applications using NASA program funding. The MGM measures oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and water vapor in ambient air, displays concentrations with temperature and pressure, and stores 30 second moving averages. The <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> involves colocating the instrument with the Central Air Monitor (CAM) and connecting it to rack power prior to departure, and letting it run during the entire <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> of a few months duration. All data stored is inside MGM, with no connection to the vessel data bus. Crew intervention is limited to checking MGM periodically to see that it is working and power cycling if the display is OFF. After the trial is over, the unit with its data will be retrieved. Post <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> calibration check and data analysis are planned and results will be compared with both CAM data and results from MGMs ISS technology demonstration...|$|R
5|$|A {{week after}} taking command, Moosally and his {{executive}} officer, Mike Fahey, canceled a planned $1million repair package for Iowas main gun batteries, including repairs {{to the main}} gun turrets' lighting, electrical, powder hoists, and hydraulic systems—75 detailed deficiencies in all. Instead, the funds were spent on overhauling the ship's powerplant. In August 1988, Iowa set sail on <b>sea</b> <b>trials</b> around the Chesapeake Bay area and then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of <b>sea</b> <b>trials</b> which began in 2014 the USS Zumwalt was officially commissioned into the US Navy on October 15, 2016 at Baltimore, Maryland. However, in November, 2016 the principal and only ammunition for the Zumwalt's two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems, the Long Range Land Attack Projectile, was cancelled due to increased costs. USS Zumwalt is currently assigned to the US Pacific Fleet and is homeported in San Diego, California.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{refitted}} in early 1940 {{and a number}} of minor changes were made. The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during their <b>sea</b> <b>trials</b> a year earlier were finally implemented, the canvas cover for the back of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door, new radios were installed, and shields were fitted to the anti-aircraft machine guns and the searchlights. A SS-6 sonar was fitted in June 1940, but proved to be ineffectual.|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} 4 years, the Air Quality Monitor (AQM) {{has been the}} {{operational}} instrument for measuring trace volatile organic compounds on the International Space Station (ISS). The key components of the AQM are the inlet preconcentrator, the gas chromatograph (GC), and the differential mobility spectrometer. Onboard the ISS are two AQMs with different GC columns that detect and quantify 22 compounds. The AQM data contributes valuable information to the assessment of air quality aboard ISS for each crew increment. The US Navy is looking to update its submarine air monitoring suite of instruments {{and the success of}} the AQM on ISS has led to a jointly planned submarine <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> of a NASA AQM. In addition to the AQM, the Navy is also interested in the Multi-Gas Monitor (MGM), which measures major constituent gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ammonia). A separate paper will present the MGM <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> preparation and the analysis of most recent ISS data. A prototype AQM, which is virtually identical to the operational AQM, has been readied for the <b>sea</b> <b>trial.</b> Only one AQM will be deployed during the <b>sea</b> <b>trial,</b> but this is sufficient for NASA purposes and to detect the compounds of interest to the US Navy for this trial. The data from the <b>sea</b> <b>trial</b> will be compared to data from archival samples collected before, during, and after the trial period. This paper will start with a brief history of past collaborations between NASA and the U. S. and U. K. navies for trials of air monitoring equipment. An overview of the AQM technology and protocols for the submarine trial will be presented. The majority of the presentation will focus on the AQM preparation and a summary of available data from the trial...|$|R

These began two days later and revealed so many problems with her engines and boilers that Chanzy was decommissioned for repairs on 6 December. Recommissioned on 1 May 1895 to test the repairs, she entered service on 20 July.|$|E
