40|$|Gender {{selected}} or sexed semen {{has been}} commercially {{available to the}} dairy industry for almost a decade. However, sexed semen from beef bulls became commercially available only recently. The availability of sexed semen from beef bulls along with concerns about success of the technology at the ranch level has limited the use of sexed semen in purebred and commercial beef operations. Recent changes in semen availability combined with current studies with sexed beef semen are providing insights to the uses, limitations, opportunities, and challenges of this technology. Increased sorting capacity allowed the number of beef bulls with gender selected semen available to increase exponentially {{over the last five}} years. For the major US AI studs, the number of beef bulls with gender sorted semen available increased from 0 to 70 from 2008 to 2011 (Hall, 2011). Sexing Technologies, the major <b>semen</b> <b>sexing</b> company, lists 28 sires with sexed semen in their catalog. In addition to <b>sex</b> <b>sorting</b> operations at all major bull studs in the US and several other countries, Sexing Technologies now has custom <b>semen</b> <b>sexing</b> operations in five locations across the US. However, the number and genetic diversity of beef bulls with sexed semen available is limited compared to the offering of AI beef bulls with conventional semen. While not an overwhelming selection of bulls and genetics, there are now sufficient numbers of beef bulls with sexed semen to begin {{to meet the needs of}} the seedstock sector, and address the wanted traits for the commercial producer...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to examine the extent of variation of genetic improvement in dam of dams genetic pathway after insemination of heifers with <b>sex</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>semen.</b> For this purpose three different sexed semen based strategies were examined including 1 : continuous use of <b>sex</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>semen</b> (strategy CS), 2 : use of <b>sex</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>semen</b> for the first and the second inseminations and use of conventional semen for the third and later inseminations (strategy S 2) and 3 : use of <b>sex</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>semen</b> for the first insemination and use of conventional semen for the second and later inseminations (strategy S 1). Predicted values of genetic improvement resulted from the referred strategies were compared to its related values in the case of utilizing conventional semen. Changes in the selection proportion and selection intensity and its effect on genetic improvement were achieved in different scenarios under different conception rates. In all scenarios, genetic improvement of CS strategy was greater than its value in other strategies. Genetic improvement varied in additive genetic standard deviation unit from 0. 31 to 0. 32 in CS strategy, from 0. 23 to 0. 30 in S 2 strategy and from 0. 20 to 0. 27 in S 1 strategy. Furthermore, predicted genetic improvement in sexed semen based strategies was about 5. 82 to 39. 65 % greater than its related value when continuous utilization of conventional semen was applied. In spite of enhancing genetic improvement in dam of dams pathway after utilizing <b>sex</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>semen</b> in heifers, changes were not considerable compared with the obtained genetic improvement from other genetic pathways; And a greater genetic improvement is expected from other genetic pathways...|$|R

The method is based on flow cytometry and sorting is done {{on the basis of}} DNA difference of the X- and Y-chromosomes. Preselection of progeny provides an opportunity to obtain genetic gain and increased production as well as increased animal welfare and decreased environmental impact. However, the method is associated with low fertility, high costs and uncertainty whether the sorting process contributes to DNA damage and thereby results in genetically impaired progeny. Today, <b>sex</b> <b>sorted</b> sperm is only commercially available in the bovine industry, {{due to the fact that}} bull sperm is more suitable for selection than sperm from other species.

Improvement {{of this technology}} in the equine species requires increasing awareness of the modifications that the sorting procedure induces on sperm intactness. Oxidative stress {{is regarded as the}} major damaging phenomenon, and increasing evidence regards handling of spermatozoa - including <b>sex</b> <b>sorting</b> - as basic ground for oxidative damage. The aim {{of this study was to}} disclose whether the flow cytometric sorting procedure increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and to identify if ROS production relates to DNA damage in sorted spermatozoa using specific flow cytometry-based assays. After sorting, oxidative stress increased from 26 % to 33 % in pre-and post-incubation controls, to 46 % after <b>sex</b> <b>sorting</b> (p &lt; 0. 05). Proportions of DNA fragmentation index post-sorting were approximately 10 % higher (31. 3 %); an effect apparently conduced via oxidative DNA damage as revealed by the oxyDNA assay. The probable origin of this increased oxidative stress owes the removal of enough seminal plasma due to the unphysiological sperm extension, alongside a deleterious effect of high pressure on mitochondria during the sorting procedure.

40|$|The {{world is}} faced with the {{challenge}} to meet the increasing demand for livestock products while conserving animal genetic resource diversity and maintaining environmental integrity. Genetic improvement of local breeds can help to improve the livelihood of the livestock keepers, to increase the production of animal products and to conserve genetic diversity. Implementing breeding schemes in developing countries has proven to be very difficult. The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss the role of reproductive technologies for the creation and dissemination of genetic improvement in livestock populations in developing countries. In the paper opportunities are discussed for implementing breeding schemes which minimize the need for extensive pedigree and performance recording. It is shown that genetic progress can be generated in a small population. Community-based breeding schemes offer a good starting point for involving farmers in improving local breeds. Artificial insemination to exchange genetic material between communities offers an opportunity to increase the rate of genetic improvement while restricting the rate of inbreeding. Furthermore, artificial insemination is a promising technique for dissemination of genetic gain to producers at a relatively low cost. Opportunities to use <b>semen</b> <b>sexing</b> in a crossbreeding scheme are presented.

40|$|Science {{has been}} searching {{for a long time}} for a {{reliable}} method for controlling the sex of mammalian offspring. Recently, the application of specific modern cellular methodologies has {{led to the development of}} a flow cytometric system capable of differentiating and separating living X- and Y-chromosome-bearing sperm cells in amounts suitable for AI and therefore, commercialization of this sexing technology. The aim of this work was to present the first results of heifers that introduce bovine AI with <b>sex</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>semen,</b> for the first time in Macedonia. Insemination with <b>sex</b> <b>sorted</b> cryopreserved <b>semen</b> (2 x 106 spermatozoa per dose) imported from the USA was done at two dairy farms in ZK Pelagonija. In total, 74 heifers (Holstein Friesian) were inseminated. Inseminations were carried out in a timely manner following a modified OvSynch protocol. During the insemination, the sperm was deposited into the uterine horn ipsi lateral to the ovary where a follicle larger than 1. 6 cm was detected by means of transrectal ultrasound examination. Pregnancy was checked by ultrasound on day 30 after the insemination. Overall, the average pregnancy rate in both farms was 43, 24 % (40, 54 % and 45, 95 %, for farm 1 and farm 2, respectively). All pregnant heifers delivered their calves following a normal gestation length (274, 3 days in average) and of the 32 born calves, 30 (93, 75 %) were female. In conclusion, since the first results from inseminations with sex-sorted semen in dairy heifers in Macedonia are very promising, the introduction of this technique may bring much benefit to the local dairy sector. Average pregnancy rate seems similar with results obtained following ‘regular’ inseminations, notwithstanding the relatively low number of spermatozoa per insemination dose. Due to the latter, we however recommend inseminations only to be carried out by experienced technicians followinga TAI protocol and ultrasound examinations of the ovaries prior to insemination...|$|R

Global warming is often thought as being caused by energy production but the second largest contributor is animal production, with methane produced by cows and sheep a key component. One obvious solution is to reduce meat and milk consumption but this {{is unlikely to be}} acceptable to everyone. Moreover, grass-fed animals (such as cows and sheep) can provide other benefits than food, such as managing biodiversity. The UK has a good climate for producing grass and many of the upland regions of the UK cannot be used for cultivating anything other than grass. Grazing animals therefore provide the backbone of many rural communities. A range of different animal breeding technologies, such as traditional genetic methods to improve production efficiency or using biotechnology tools such as <b>semen</b> <b>sexing</b> and even potentially genetic modification, could be used to mitigate the global warming impact of farm livestock. Adoption of these technologies, however, may be limited by the willingness of farmers to purchase these animals. To this end, 42 semi-structured interviews were undertaken (of which 29 are included in this data collection) with sheep and beef cattle farmers across the UK and with industry representatives.

40|$|International audienceMany {{chromosomal}} rearrangements are detected {{each year}} in France on young boars candidates for reproduction. The possible use of these animals requires a good knowledge of the potential effect of the rearrangements on the prolificacy of their mates. This effect can be estimated by an accurate determination of the rate of unbalanced spermatozoa in the semen of boars which carry the rearrangements. Indeed, these spermatozoa exhibiting normal fertilizing ability are responsible for an early embryonic mortality, and then, for a decrease of the litter sizes. The "spermFISH" technique, i. e. fluorescent in situ hybridization on decondensed sperm heads, has been used on several occasions in Man, in this perspective. In livestock species, this method was formerly used mainly for <b>semen</b> <b>sexing</b> purposes. We used it, for the first time, to estimate the rates of imbalance in the semen of four boars carrying chromosomal rearrangements: two reciprocal translocations, rcp(3; 15) (q 27;q 13) and rcp(12; 14) (q 13;q 21), {{as well as two}} independent cases of trisomy 18 mosaicism. The rates of unbalanced gametes were relatively high for the two reciprocal translocations (47. 83 % and 24. 33 %, respectively). These values differed from the apparent effects of the rearrangements estimated using a limited number of litters: a decrease in prolificacy of 23 % (estimation obtained using the results of 6 litters) and 39 % (57  litters), respectively for the 3 / 15 and 12 / 14  translocations. The imbalance rates were much lower for the trisomy mosaics (0. 58 % and 1. 13 %), suggesting a very moderate effect of this special kind of chromosomal rearrangement...|$|R

Response variables were profit, lower 95 % confidence limit for profit, and utility. Responses for selection of sires on profit index at year 10 or 20 were similar and superior to responses from selecting on the basis of milk-fat-protein indexes. Less favorable economic conditions within an international scenario, use of a 10 -year planning horizon, or selection in scenarios with lower absolute responses favor the optimum of using inexpensive randomly chosen young sires. Under a scenario of average economic conditions, use of selected proven and young sires was generally superior to use of randomly chosen young sires for profit and lower 95 % confidence limit for profit at 20 -year planning horizon in all combinations, but was inferior for utility at year 10. Effect of herd size was generally small. ^ A second study investigated optimum conditions for maximizing genetic response in nucleus herds of dairy cattle using multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro embryo production (IVEP) and sperm sexing technologies. Deterministic modeling was used to compare 15 -year selection responses in nucleus herds with different combinations of herd size, number of sires used by year, female to male ratio and number of progeny per donor female.

The initial step, protein extraction is very important. Thus, the suitable strategies for sperm surface protein extraction from unsorted boar spermatozoa surface were considered for further use in 2 D-gel analyses. The sperm surface proteins were extracted and then purified using Con-A Sepharose beads. After 22 h incubation, 2. 625 mg/ml and 0. 186 mg/ml of the total protein can be obtained using extraction solution with and without 0. 5 % Triton X- 100, respectively.

Almost all of the proteins, especially the small-sized products (~ 13 and 16 kDa), were tightly bound to the Con-A Sepharose beads even in the presence of 800 mM D-glucopyranoside.
