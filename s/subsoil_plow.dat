40|$|Cuttings of the {{following}} varieties were made from ripened wood during October, 1887, under direction of Prof Budd. They were cut uniformly about nine inches in length, and carefully planted, the method being as follows : The ground a heavy black loam was plowed and levelled; rows were then marked out 31 / 2 feet apart, in each of which was run a <b>subsoil</b> <b>plow</b> to the depth of ten to thirteen inches. A garden line was then stretched over the first row, marking the line of trench which was quickly made with spades, leaving the side next the line nearly perpendicular against this side, the cuttings were laid three to five inches apart according to variety. The earth was then filled in gradually and carefully firmed, till the trench was level with the surface, leaving only the upper bud of each cutting in sight. They remained in this condition till November, when they were treated to a coating of coarse manure completely covering each row. This was removed {{the following}} spring, after which they received ordinary nursery cultivation...|$|E

Tillage may loosen soil, incorporate nutrients, warm or dry soil, manage weeds, bury residue, or level the surface for subsequent operations. Variable soil and weather conditions may result in different decisions about the need for tillage even within similar soil types.

Introduction: The best {{location}} for strawberries is an East slope with soil {{of a strong}} loam and a cool well drained subsoil, but they will flourish on {{a great variety of}} soils. They should never be planted on dry sand, chalk, or dry gravel, but in some instances they will flourish on a gravel which has a mixture of clay. The soil should be prepared as for other fruit, by extra deep cultivation. It is best to <b>plow</b> deep and <b>subsoil</b> with <b>subsoiling</b> <b>plow.</b> Then it should be thoroughly pulverized, leveled and rolled. The land should be perfectly clean and in good condition. It is best to put on a heavy coat of manure, which should be thoroughly mixed with soil before the plants are put out. The time for setting out plants in Kansas is either in April, or September, but they may be put out any time during the summer months under favorable conditions. The month of April is the best, unless the plants are put out early enough in September to enable them to become established in the soil before winter, otherwise they are liable to be lifted out of the soil by the frost. There are many methods of planting strawberries; some do well in hills, some in wide matted rows, and others do best in narrow matted rows. The different methods must be determined by the kind of soil, the place to be planted and scarcely of the land...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of ascertaining {{the best time to}} sow the seeds of {{cultivated}} grasses this station sowed the seeds of six different grasses at eight different times beginning March 23 and ending May 12, 1891. The varieties sown were red clover, white clover, timothy, orchard grass, tall meadow oat grass and awnless brome (bromus inermus). The plats are one rod square. The soil is rolling prairie with black surface and clay <b>subsoil,</b> fall <b>plowed.</b> The amount sown were, red clover and timothy at the rate of 20 pounds per acre, white clover 10 pounds per acre, tall meadow oat grass 50 pounds, orchard grass 30 pounds, and brome 60 pounds per acre. On March 24 two inches of snow fell after the first seeding that was sown on the surface without covering of any kind. At this seeding the frost was out of the ground 4 inches, the temperature of the atmosphere at 3 p. m. was 370 F:; one inch below the surface it was 38 °. The soil was quite wet and unfit for any kind of cultivation. All seedings after the first were raked in thoroughly...|$|R

The project worked with the species guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclocarpum), cenízaro (Samanea saman), cedro (Cedrela odorata), laurel (Cordia alliodora), amarillón (Terminalia amazonia) y botarrama (Vochysia ferruginea). The main objective was “Improving investment conditions for cultivation of native timber species of high value to small and medium landholders”; however, a two years financial horizon and the “el niño” climatic phenomena, where the main limitations {{to the establishment of}} planned field trials in only two effective years. Even though these limitations, the project achieved most of its goals, expected products and targets. The first specific objective proposed the initiation of a breeding program, in which was possible the establishment of provenance/progeny tests with guanacaste (50 families from 6 provenances), cenízaro (38 families from 5 provenances), cedro (32 families from 6 provenances) and laurel (35 families from 4 provenances). With five species (with the exception of botarrama) it were successfully established miniclonal gardens in greenhouse conditions, which generated new important knowledge enough for clonal production. Additionally, it was established a miniclonal garden for almendro (Dipteryx panamensis). A foliage analysis was also performed with all tree species in order to estimate nutrient demand. Second specific objective aimed to generate silvicultural information, however within two years scope it was only possible to establish appropriate field trials. In Liberia, Guanacaste, it were established field trials with guanacaste, cenízaro and cedro, in an area over one hectare each, over a subsoiled soil. With laurel, a new terrain has been prepared (<b>subsoiling,</b> <b>plowing</b> and bedding) and, to be planted in San Carlos, in May 2015. In Santa Clara, San Carlos, spacing field trials were established (7 treatments, from N = 400 until N = 10 000) with guanacaste, cenízaro and cedro. Since cedro had adaptation limitations, it was replaced by amarillón. The third specific objective was based on {{the construction of a new}} investment model, which managed to compile an extensive database costs and labor yield information, thanks to the cooperation from more than 10 reforestation companies. The new model was able to systematize variable and fix costs, which included infrastructure, equipment, maintenance and a definition of required human resources for a reforestation project. An EXCEL application was constructed, which allows all possible scenarios projects to be analyzed (small, medium and large landholders). For the tree species almendro, pilón (Hieronyma alchorneoides) and cebo or chancho (Vochysia guatemalensis), it was possible to fit new growth models, with satisfactory results, thanks to the datasets collaboration from forest organizations and companies. Growth models allowed the construction of growth and yield tables for each species, based on general silvicultural guidelines, where thinning keep basal area below 20 m 2 /ha. As a fourth specific objective it was intended to use AFLP´s in order to characterize each native tree collection, in terms of genetic structure and diversity. However, several limitations occurred due to availability of equipment and chemical reagents. It was possible to optimize in each tree species DNA extraction procedures, DNA purification and processing and, DNA amplification for several combinations. Finally, as a fifth specific objective it was proposed to compile and organize information in order to produce new technical manuals but investment oriented. In terms of progress, all manuals report a 60 to 80 % advancement and it is expected to publish them in ITCR Editorial. An event called “Meeting on native tree species for reforestation in Costa Rica” has been organized to be held at the end of June 2015 in Horizontes Forestry Research Station (Liberia, Guanacaste).
