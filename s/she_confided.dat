5|$|Over several verses, Ovid {{depicts the}} psychic {{struggle}} Myrrha faces between her sexual desire {{for her father}} and the social shame she would face for acting thereon. Sleepless, and losing all hope, she attempted suicide; but was discovered by her nurse, in whom <b>she</b> <b>confided.</b> The nurse tried to make Myrrha suppress the infatuation, but later agreed to help Myrrha into her father's bed if she promised {{that she would not}} again try to kill herself.|$|E
25|$|In May 1748, Du Châtelet {{began an}} affair with the poet Jean François de Saint-Lambert and became pregnant. In {{a letter to a}} friend, <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> her fears that she would not survive her pregnancy. On the night of 4 September 1749, she gave birth to a daughter, Stanislas-Adélaïde, but died six days later, at Lunéville, from a {{pulmonary}} embolism, at the age of 42. Her daughter died twenty months later.|$|E

25|$|Laurent and Isabelle {{had four}} children, {{but only two}} — Anne-Thérèse and Marie-Jeanne — survived to adulthood. Anne-Thérèse was mostly educated at home by her mother. At the age of 10, she was allowed to take her First Communion, which was two years earlier than the custom of the time. On {{the day of her}} First Communion, <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> to the priest in Etables that she wished to enter a {{religious}} community.|$|E
25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought to be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

500|$|Inquirer media {{columnist}} Michael Smerconish recounted {{that when}} he interviewed Erdely about the story on Sirius XM radio, she told him: [...] "I talked to all of her friends, {{all the people that}} <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> in along the way." [...] But as Smerconish wrote, [...] "he did not talk to all of Jackie's friends. In fact, her failure to speak to the three friends in whom Jackie supposedly confided immediately after the alleged incident was perhaps the most egregious of a string of journalistic failures." ...|$|E
500|$|A briefer {{confrontation}} {{occurred in}} 1613 when Anne {{shot and killed}} James' favourite dog during a hunting session. [...] After his initial rage, James smoothed things over by giving her a £2,000 diamond {{in memory of the}} dog, whose name was Jewel. In 1603, James fought with Anne over the proposed composition of her English household, sending her a message that [...] "his Majesty took her continued perversity very heinously." [...] In turn, Anne took exception to James' drinking: in 1604 <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> to the French envoy that [...] "the King drinks so much, and conducts himself so ill in every respect, that I expect an early and evil result." ...|$|E
500|$|Having found {{temporary}} employment at the Harper Library of the University of Chicago, Brodie began researching {{the origins of}} the Book of Mormon. [...] By mid-1939, <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> to her uncle, Dean R. Brimhall (another ex-Mormon), that she intended to write a scholarly biography of Joseph Smith. [...] Progress toward that goal was slowed by the birth of the Brodies' first child and by three rapid moves, a consequence of her husband's search for a permanent position. [...] In 1943 Fawn Brodie was encouraged enough by her progress to enter her 300-page draft in a contest for the Alfred A. Knopf literary fellowship. In May her application was judged the best of the 44 entries.|$|E

500|$|Lady Stainer {{was devastated}} by {{his death and}} went into {{mourning}} for a year, but as <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> to a friend, the pianist Francesco Berger, [...] "I am thankful he has been spared long illness and the weariness of old age, which he always dreaded". She gave a memorial stained glass window to St Cross Church and arranged for a monument to be erected at Magdalen College. Her husband's valuable library of antiquarian music books passed to his elder son, J F R Stainer, who allowed its use for study and research purposes. The collection was sold to an American collector in 1932 who, on his death in 1973, had it bequeathed to the Bodleian Library, where it remains. Lady Stainer died in 1916 leaving six children. She is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford beside her husband.|$|E
500|$|MacMillan {{said that}} {{during the summer of}} 1932 she {{experienced}} a nervous breakdown (for which Florence Brownlee paid the hospital bills), and that she met {{and fell in love with}} Caldwell soon after. [...] She resolved to end her affair with Brownlee but he reacted angrily, telling her that it would mean his wife's death and MacMillan's inability to find a job anywhere in Alberta. [...] That evening, <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> the affair to her landlady. [...] On October31, 1932, she had dinner with Brownlee's sons and visited Brownlee, who was sick in bed. [...] Despite her protestations that she was on her way to a Halloween party with Caldwell, he insisted that they have sex, which they did. [...] Thereafter, the affair resumed. [...] On another occasion, he called her away from her visiting mother to have sex with him at the legislature building.|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, Mercedes did {{not want}} to have an affair and was not [...] "looking for someone else", stating, [...] "Malachy's been working hard to provide for them and he hasn’t {{had a lot of time}} for her". Turning to Calvin, <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> in him and they kiss. Whittle added that the affair had become more serious and their {{chemistry}} was [...] "more than just physical". Also according to Metcalfe, [...] "Every three months Mercedes has to have an HIV test and, yes, it is making her resent Malachy a bit. She can’t help wondering what it would be like to be with someone like Calvin who isn't HIV positive", even though she felt [...] "guilty". When Mercedes learned that she has to be retested for HIV, she feared that the test would be positive. Initially, she did not tell Malachy about it, but eventually [...] "snaps" [...] at him, telling him she [...] "won't forgive him" [...] if she has contracted HIV. The test was negative which was a [...] "huge relief" [...] for them.|$|E

500|$|Upon her release, Leeds {{struggled}} to find work in Hollywood, and signed on to star in Wild Weed. [...] During publicity for the film in 1949, Leeds, who had been 20 {{at the time of}} the arrest, said that appearing in the picture would keep other people her age from trying drugs, but in 1952 <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> in Collier's that she [...] "only had one offer… which was an obvious attempt to capitalize on the Mitchum case notoriety. I took it. I was broke." [...] The film gained approval from the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to use the drug references, a standard practice at the time even though the Bureau had no power to censor the films. The film used its plot to push many of the beliefs of the time: that drug-using youth would turn to crime and the theory of [...] "marijuana as a gateway drug". [...] The latter was a leading argument for drug prohibition during the era, and an argument that Leeds herself made, based on her own history with marijuana and heroin.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Lloyd travelled to New York {{where she}} re-appeared at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first song {{was about a}} young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, [...] "Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers", proved hilarious; The Era observed that the line [...] "tickled the audience immensely". Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but {{turned out not to be}} so. The Era described the character as being [...] "not so demure as she looked, for <b>she</b> <b>confided</b> to her auditors that she 'knew a lot about those tricky little things they don't teach a girl at school'." [...] Many other songs followed and were all warmly received. [...] At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures. [...] The Era commented that [...] "Miss Lloyd's clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success". [...] After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley. That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in Peckham in a production of Dick Whittington in which she played the title role. In it, she sang [...] "A Little Bit Off the Top", which MacQueen-Pope describes as being [...] "one of the pantomime songs of the year". The Music Hall and Theatre Review was equally complimentary, saying: [...] "Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!" [...] During the Christmas period of 1898–9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in Dick Whittington. [...] The entertainment culminated with a song from Vesta Victoria, and a short piece called The Squeaker, starring Joe Elvin.|$|E

2500|$|She {{appears to}} have refused several offers, such as one by Albert Speer, to have the {{children}} smuggled out of Berlin and insisted that the family must stay at her husband's side.
