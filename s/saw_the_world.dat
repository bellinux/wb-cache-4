5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, {{which seeks to}} explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac {{the father of the}} naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E
5|$|The Sautrāntika school held {{a form of}} phenomenalism that <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> as imperceptible. It {{held that}} {{external}} objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its internalist stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism. Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects {{as anything other than}} mental entities. Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, neutral monism and realist phenomenology.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Nocturne was {{composed}} by Shoji Meguro, with additional work by Kenichi Tsuchiya and Toshiko Tasaki. Mixing {{was done by}} Meguro, Tsuchiya, and Tasaki. The soundtrack included tunes from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles composed by Tsukasa Masuko. While composing the music, Meguro attempted to express his feelings when he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> while remaining true to the styles established by the original Megami Tensei games. Taking inspiration from the game's dungeon-battle transitions, and the cut-scenes' combination of current graphics with classic use of subtitles for storytelling, Meguro created modulating tunes which included elements from 1980s music. Meguro also introduced orchestral elements which were absent from previous Megami Tensei scores, using it to emphasize the gameplay's constant shifts between movement and stillness. Meguro generally worked solo on the original version, but for the director's cut, he had help composing new tracks.|$|E

Finkelstein's mother was an ardent pacifist. Both his parents died in 1995. Of his parents, Finkelstein has recalled that [...] "they <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{through the prism of}} the Nazi Holocaust. They were eternally indebted to the Soviet Union (to whom they attributed the defeat of the Nazis), and so anyone who was anti-Soviet they were extremely harsh on". They supported the Soviet Union's approval of the creation of the State of Israel, as enunciated by Gromyko, who stated that the Jews had earned the right to a state, but thought that Israel had sold its soul to the West and [...] "refused to have any truck with it".|$|E
500|$|List {{generally}} <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{in which}} he was living as one of degeneration, comparing it with the societies of the Late Roman and Byzantine Empires. He bemoaned the decline of the rural peasantry through urbanisation, having witnessed how Vienna's population tripled between 1870 and 1890, resulting in overcrowding, a growth in diseases like tuberculosis, and a severe strain on the city's resources. A staunch monarchist, he opposed all forms of democracy, feminism, and modern trends in the arts, such as those of the Vienna Secessionists. Influenced by the Pan-Germanist politician Georg Ritter von Schönerer and his Away from Rome! movement, List decried the growing influence of linguistically Slavic communities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was opposed to laissez-faire capitalism and large-scale enterprise, instead favouring an economic system based on small-scale artisans and craftsmen, being particularly unhappy with the decline in tradesmen's guilds. He was similarly opposed to the modern banking sector and financial institutions, deeming it to be dominated by Jews; in criticising these institutions, he expressed anti-semitic sentiments. Such views of the country's economic situation were not uncommon in Austria at the time, having become particularly widespread following the Panic of 1873. The later Heathen and runologist Edred Thorsson noted that List's [...] "theories were to some degree based on the anti-semitic dogmas of the day", while Hammer stated that the Ariosophic tradition promulgated by List and others was [...] "unambiguously racist and anti-semitic".|$|E

500|$|Greenwalt {{discusses}} how Cordelia [...] "is sort {{of forced}} {{to become a}} deeper character" [...] when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, [...] "She's sort of living with {{one foot in the}} world of 'I want to be an actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I want to save and help people, and I have a deeper purpose and mission.'" [...] Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a [...] "vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, [...] "Parting Gifts", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and there's so much pain. We have to help them." [...] Carpenter explains, [...] "Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life." ...|$|E
500|$|Misfortune awaited Bolt at {{the next}} major event, the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much {{improved}} since the 2004 Olympics, and he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Championships {{as a way to}} live up to expectations, stating, [...] "I really want to make up for what happened in Athens. Hopefully, everything will fall into place". Bolt qualified with runs under 21 s, but he suffered an injury in the final, finishing in last place with a time of 26.27 s. Injuries were preventing him from completing a full professional athletics season, and the eighteen-year-old Bolt still had not proven his mettle in the major world-athletics competitions. However, his appearance made him the youngest ever person to appear in a 200 m world final. Bolt was involved in a car accident in November, and although he suffered only minor facial lacerations, his training schedule was further upset. His manager, Norman Peart, made Bolt's training less intensive, and he had fully recuperated the following week. Bolt had continued to improve his performances, and he reached the world top-5 rankings in 2005 and 2006. Peart and Mills stated their intentions to push Bolt to do longer sprinting distances with the aim of making the 400 m event his primary event by 2007 or 2008. Bolt was less enthusiastic, and demanded that he feel comfortable in his sprinting. He suffered another hamstring injury in March 2006, forcing him to withdraw from the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and he did not return to track events until May. After his recovery, Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility, and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold.|$|E

[...] Biddle captured scenes and people how they naturally occurred in life. “Catfish Row” is a good example of Biddle capturing people and objects in their natural state. “Rejecting the stale formulas of academism and critical of what he saw as a loss of articulate emotional expressionism in much of modernist art, Biddle grappled with his own artistic identity throughout his life”.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{concept is}} a deliberate inversion or update of the Tarzan mythos, the syndicated comic strip which Russ Manning had previously illustrated. Where Tarzan {{was a human}} raised as a noble savage feral child by African great apes who <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through his naturalistic upbringing and opposition to the rules and limits of civilization, Magnus was a human raised by a benevolent robot named 1A, who saw mankind becoming an ever more decadent and complacent human civilization doomed by its ever-increasing dependence on robots. In one case, the hero is a throwback to a hardier and more naturalistic time. [...] In the other, he is a creation of science sent to carry {{the message to the}} rest of humanity that Man must control his own destiny and carve out his own path, rather than become little more than an overfed herd of cattle tended by robots. In both incarnations of Magnus, Robot Fighter, he lives and operates according to his own set of rules and because of this, is considered an outsider and something of a threat to the established order of things.|$|E
