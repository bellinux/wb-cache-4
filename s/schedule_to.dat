5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its <b>schedule</b> <b>to</b> fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL in an effort to stay afloat. When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E

He struck ten fours, all off which were driven. In the second innings, {{he came to the}} crease with four wickets down with Australia still in arrears. He scored an unbeaten 35 to ensure that Australia would not {{collapse}} further and lose the match. The public reception towards the Victory Tests resulted in an additional fifth match being added to the <b>schedule.</b> <b>To</b> warm up for that match, Miller took 3/95 against the North of England.|$|E
5|$|Keith Richards as Edward Teague: Keeper of the Pirata Codex for the Brethren Court and Jack Sparrow's father. The other pirate lords are visibly {{terrified of}} him. Richards, who {{partially}} inspired Depp's portrayal of Sparrow, {{was meant to}} appear in Dead Man's Chest, {{but there was no}} room for him in the story, as well as his being tied up with a Rolling Stones tour. He almost missed filming a scene in At World's End, following injuries sustained by falling out of a tree. In June 2006, Verbinski finally managed to make room in Richards' <b>schedule</b> <b>to</b> shoot that September.|$|E

5|$|Since divers on {{the surface}} after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies, any {{subsequent}} dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify the <b>schedule</b> <b>to</b> {{take account of the}} residual gas load from the previous dive.

The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.|$|E

5|$|The Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an {{underground}} rapper into a high-profile celebrity.

In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the Vans Warped Tour and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on American youth.|$|E
5|$|The delay {{caused the}} entire {{production}} <b>schedule</b> <b>to</b> be revised, and cinematographer Carlo Carlini, {{who had a}} prior commitment, had {{to be replaced by}} Otello Martelli, a long-time favorite of Fellini's. When filming resumed in February 1954, it was winter. The temperature had dropped to -5°C, often resulting in no heat or hot water, necessitating more delays and forcing the cast and crew to sleep fully dressed and wear hats to keep warm.|$|E

They stayed only four months to allow the Soyuz <b>schedule</b> <b>to</b> line up with the planned space shuttle manifest, and so Polyakov greeted a second resident crew in October, prior to the undocking of Soyuz TM-19, when the EO-17 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-20.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 43 in {{the first}} innings, the second Test in Lahore came down to a run-chase for Australia, with Harvey and Norm O'Neill {{seemingly}} on <b>schedule</b> <b>to</b> win before time ran out. However, the Pakistani fielders began to waste time {{in an attempt to}} foil an Australian victory. They swapped the cover and midwicket fielders very slowly whenever the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single and changed the batsman on strike. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away from a straight ball and let himself be bowled, throwing his wicket away for 37. This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give the Pakistanis no opportunity to waste time by switching the field. Australia won the match with minutes to spare. Harvey scored 54 and 13 not out in the drawn third Test at Karachi. Australia took the series 2–0, but would not win another Test in Pakistan until 1998. Harvey ended the series with 273 runs at 54.60.|$|E
5|$|Alabama played four non-conference games. The {{game against}} Penn State was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played {{as part of the}} 2004 season, however the series was moved back to this season at the request of Alabama due to fallout from NCAA sanctions being levied on the program. The non-conference schedule also included games against Kent State of the Mid-American Conference, North Texas of the Sun Belt Conference and Georgia Southern of the Southern Conference. Alabama had one bye week after the Tennessee game and prior to the first LSU game. On December 4, 2011, the final Bowl Championship Series standings were unveiled with a rematch between No.1 LSU and No.2 Alabama in the BCS National Championship Game. The Sagarin computer ratings calculated Alabama's 2011 strength of <b>schedule</b> <b>to</b> be the fifteenth most difficult out of the 246 Division I teams.
