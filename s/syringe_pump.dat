5000|$|A <b>syringe</b> <b>pump</b> {{consists}} {{of one or}} more syringes which have been pre-filled and loaded into a mechanized device containing a motor-driven lead screw which will push the reciprocating plunger of the syringe(s) for specified distances at specified intervals. These devices are capable of extremely high accuracy and are pulse-free (i.e., the fluid is dispensed in a continuous stream rather than with the pulsations of the peristaltic or inductive pumps) but are limited in volume to the total volume of the attached syringe(s), and, once the emptied, the syringe(s) will require refilling before being used again making them of even more limited use than the bottle top dispensers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple-to-construct, low dead volume pump capable of generating {{a wide range}} of positive and negative pressures for microfluidic applications. The pump generates pressure or vacuum by changing the volume of air confined inside a syringe and is able to generate pressures between − 95 and + 300 kPa with a resolution as high as 1 Pa. Different from <b>syringe</b> <b>pumps</b> and electrokinetic pumping, which are capable of controlling flow rates only, our pump can be used to generate constant flow rates or constant pressures, which are required for certain applications such as the aspiration of biological cells for biophysical characterization. Compared to <b>syringe</b> <b>pumps,</b> the new pump has almost zero dead volume and does not exhibit pulsatile flows. Additionally, the system does not require electrical power and is cost effective (∼$ 100). To demonstrate the capabilities of the pump, we used it to aspirate osteoblasts (MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells) and to determine Young’s modulus of the cells, to generate a concentration gradient, and to produce variable-sized droplets in microchannels using hydrodynamic focusing...|$|R

50|$|Phenylephrine is {{commonly}} used as a vasopressor to increase the blood pressure in unstable patients with hypotension, especially resulting from septic shock. Such use is common in anesthesia or critical-care practices; it is especially useful in counteracting the hypotensive effect of epidural and subarachnoid anesthetics, {{as well as the}} vasodilating effect of bacterial toxins and the inflammatory response in sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The elimination half life of phenylephrine is about 2.5 to 3.0 hours. The clinical effects of a single intravenous bolus dose of phenylephrine are short lived and needs to be repeated every 10-15 minutes. Commonly the drug is given as a carefully titrated intravenous infusion with a <b>syringe</b> <b>pump</b> or volumetric pump.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} surgery, {{administration}} of anaesthetic agents is discontinued. Recovery of consciousness occurs when the concentration of anaesthetic in the brain drops below a certain level (usually within 1 to 30 minutes, depending on the duration of surgery). In the 1990s, a novel method of maintaining anaesthesia was developed in Glasgow, Scotland. Called TCI (target controlled infusion), it involves using a computer-controlled syringe driver (pump) to infuse propofol throughout the duration of surgery, removing {{the need for a}} volatile anaesthetic and allowing pharmacologic principles to more precisely guide the amount of the drug used by setting the desired drug concentration. Advantages include faster recovery from anaesthesia, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and absence of a trigger for malignant hyperthermia. At present, TCI is not permitted in the United States, but a <b>syringe</b> <b>pump</b> delivering a specific rate of medication is commonly used instead.|$|E
