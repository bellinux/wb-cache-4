50|$|The {{results from}} these tests clearly {{demonstrated}} that undersized initial samples and/or improper <b>sub-split</b> sizes for the crush and/or grind sizes could produce imprecise determinations of grade.|$|E
5000|$|In late 1993, Zenith Electronics and Prodigy {{provided}} 12 modified 500 Kbit [...] "white modems" [...] to Cox Communications in San Diego, {{including two}} with IBM Microchannel support. These modified modems {{were intended to}} support the Prodigy Cable Modem trial, which began on a 1500 homes-passed fiber node in El Cajon, CA. The modification allowed <b>sub-split</b> operation, with a fixed upstream frequency and a downstream at 74.75 MHz, within the 4 MHz space between analog channels 4 and 5.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the severe}} “nugget effect” {{produced}} by the extreme variability in gold size and distribution within the Goldboro mineralized belts forced companies to implement a number of sampling and grade determination programs. The nugget effect is so extreme that collecting and processing samples of a size adequate enough to overcome the nugget effect is problematic using conventional analytical methods. The programs {{have resulted in a}} wide variety of sample types tested by several different processing protocols on the initial and <b>sub-split</b> sample sizes. Sample types have included: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to study in situ degradability and fermentation kinetics parameters of the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of the silages of four sorghum genotypes, with and without tannin in the grain. A randomized block in split plot design was applied, using animals as blocks, silages as splits and time as <b>sub-splits.</b> Means were compared by SNK test (p< 0. 05). After 96 hours incubation, NDF and NDA effective degradability ranged from 32. 22 to 56. 07 % and from 26. 40 to 54. 40 %, for silages BR 700 and CMSXS 165, respectively. The results showed the negative effect of tannin on the ruminal degradability of NDF and ADF of sorghum silages...|$|R
