40|$|A {{commercial}} silicon PIN-photodiode {{was tested}} and characterized as ionizing radiation detector for radiological applications. A current-to-voltage amplification stage {{was designed and}} realized in order to acquire the photodiode signal in current mode. The system was tested with clinical beams routinely used for radiography and mammography. A Monte Carlo simulation of the detector was performed with the MCNPX code in order to model and fully understand, in particular, {{the impact of the}} <b>sensor</b> <b>casing</b> on the low energy response of the device. A reproducible output linearity was found over the dose range 0. 03 - 4. 5  mGy of great clinical relevance. The system sensitivity was found to be stable at 0. 2  V s Gy(- 1) for effective X-ray energies between 17 and 40  keV. The batch-to-batch reproducibility of the diodes was also experimentally investigated for two different batches of 14 diodes each. An inter-comparison with dosimeters routinely used in medical physics (i. e. Barracuda MPD RTI) showed a linear correlation between PIN-photodiode readout and absorbed dose measured with Barracuda, in the range of doses received by mammography and radiology patients...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale noise {{pollution}} sensor networks consist {{of hundreds of}} spatially distributed microphones that measure environmental noise. These networks provide historical and real-time environmental data to citizens and decision makers {{and are therefore a}} key technology to steer environmental policy. However, the high cost of certified environmental microphone sensors render large-scale environmental networks prohibitively expensive. Several environmental network projects have started using off-the-shelf low-cost microphone sensors to reduce their costs, but these sensors have higher failure rates and produce lower quality data. To offset this disadvantage, we developed a low-cost noise sensor that actively checks its condition and indirectly the integrity of the data it produces. The main design concept is to embed a 13 mm speaker in the noise <b>sensor</b> <b>casing</b> and, by regularly scheduling a frequency sweep, estimate the evolution of the microphone’s frequency response over time. This paper presents our noise sensor’s hardware and software design together with the results of a test deployment in a large-scale environmental network in Belgium. Our middle-range-value sensor (around € 50) effectively detected all experienced malfunctions, in laboratory tests and outdoor deployments, with a few false positives. Future improvements could further lower the cost of our sensor below € 10. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A "Top Bottom Ball Grid Array" (TB-GBA) is described, {{that takes}} {{advantage}} of existing BGA and CSP techniques, {{to create a new}} package for SCMs, MCMs, sensors and actuators. By using a pin-compatible BGA configuration at the bottom and the top of the carrier, a 3 D stack assembly of several TB-BGAs is possible. As demonstrators ceramic TB-BGAs are actually developed as single chip modules (SCMs) and multichip modules (MCMs). They will be mounted as intelligent sensors bus interfaces in convetional <b>sensor</b> <b>casings.</b> A full operating 16 -bit-processor-unit including microcontroller, SRAM, EEPROM, CAN bus interface, oscillator and SMD components will require a volume of only 1. 2 cm 3...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{an effect}} of thermal radiation (300 K) on precision of low temperature measurement of a sample holder (or sample) in an UHV SEM/SPM microscope working at range down to 20 K for various ways of temperature sensor mounting. We designed a special copper casing for installation of Lake Shore sensors (CernoxTM and Si diodes) encapsulated in SD packages. The sensor body is attached direct to the casing using indium solder. The current leads pertaining to the sensor are thermally anchored but electrically insulated from the <b>casing.</b> Quality of <b>sensors</b> installation in the casing was tested for various ways of mounting on a cooled plate. Insufficient thermal anchoring of electrical wires and thermal shielding were imitated. Comparative measurement was also performed with sensors in SD package mounted without. The experiments proved that our special design of temperature <b>sensors</b> <b>casing</b> is adequate for intended application of temperature measurement of sample holder in UHV SEM/SPM microscope. In contrary, measurement precision of unprotected sensors was absolutely unsuitable...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{introduces}} an algorithmic {{framework for}} diagnosis of cavitation in centrifugal pumps, founded upon methods of artificial intelligence. The framework forms {{a blueprint for}} a wide range of on-line condition monitoring systems with cavitation diagnosis capability. It relies on information provided by a single acceleration <b>sensor</b> mounted on <b>casing</b> of the monitored pump. The signal provided by the sensor is evaluated by an artificial neural network classifier. Adaptation of the classifier to a specific pump type is carried out by means of a supervised learning algorithm. Furthermore, a complete cavitation diagnosis application methodology, developed by the author, is presented in the thesis. It deals with issues of implementation of cavitation diagnosis to a variety of centrifugal pumps employed in industrial environment.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringSteven WarrenA {{reference}} {{design for}} a wearable, wireless biomedical sensor set has been a long-term need for researchers at Kansas State University, driven {{by the idea that}} a basic set of sensor components could address the demands of multiple types of human and animal health monitoring scenarios if these components offered even basic reconfigurability. Such a reference design would also be a starting point to assess sensor performance and signal quality in the context of various biomedical research applications. This thesis describes the development of a set of wireless health monitoring sensors that can be used collectively as a data acquisition platform to provide biomedical research data and to serve as a baseline reference design for new sensor and system development. The host computer, an Intel Edison unit, offers plug-and-play usability and supports both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. The reference sensor set that accompanies the Intel Edison single-board computer includes an electrocardiograph, a pulse oximeter, and an accelerometer/gyrometer. All sensors are based on the same physical footprint and connector placement so that the sensors can be stacked to create a collection with a minimal volume and footprint. The latest hardware version is 3. 1. Version 1. 0 supported only a pulse oximeter, whereas version 2. 0 included an electrocardiograph, pulse oximeter, and respiration belt. In version 3. 0, the respiration belt was removed, and accelerometers and gyroscopes were added to the sensor set. Version 3. 1 is a refined version of the latter design, where known hardware bugs were remedied. Future work includes the development of new <b>sensors</b> and <b>casing</b> designs that can hold these sensor stacks...|$|R
40|$|Design {{is the key}} {{activity}} in the generation of successful products. Without attention to the requirements and specification, generation and selection of a suitable concept and appropriate detailed design and manufacture, products {{will not be able}} to compete effectively in the market place. This book explores the process of design with specific emphasis on mechanical items. This includes consideration of the design and selection of components that involve relative motion to each other such as bearings, shafts, gears, belts, chains, dynamic seals, clutches and brakes. In addition a number of essential machine elements such as fasteners, springs, static seals, <b>casings,</b> <b>sensors</b> and actuators, which allow the implementation of useful devices, are included. The emphasis in the text is on the reader acquiring useful skills and developing understanding. Most applications of design do not result in single answers. This realistic insight has been recognised in the development of the material presented and many of the worked examples and worksheet questions do not have unique solutions. Instead a possible answer is offered to allow the reader to develop their understanding and insight and as confidence and abilities increase, alternative solutions can be explored. The book is supported, if adopted as a course textbook by approximately 2000 lecture slides, worked solutions for worksheet questions and a number of spreadsheets to speed up some of the analysis or design procedures...|$|R
40|$|Good {{air quality}} and {{temperature}} {{is not only}} pleasant but also a health issue and since the cabin of a truck is a work environment, the same demands as in other working spaces should be met. Volvo Group is a company which has the will of continuously improving their technology and has a strong safety culture, therefore the climate in the cabin is hence considered an important issue. There are four truck brands within the Volvo Group: Volvo Trucks, Mack Trucks, Renault Trucks and UD Trucks. The intention is that this thesis can contribute with knowledge to all the truck brands within the Volvo Group. To control the climate inside the cabin of a truck several sensors can be used. This master thesis aims at increasing the knowledge, mainly concerning a possible future solar sensor. A solar sensor in combination with a Climate Control Unit (CCU) {{can be used to}} forecast an increase in temperature in the cabin and to compensate for the thermal discomfort felt by a person situated in sunlight. The thesis started with a simulation of the heat balance of the truck in order to find the required accuracy and time constant of the solar sensor. Tests were performed to evaluate how a solar sensor would be affected by the windshield and finally a benchmark of the solar sensor was performed. The simulations show that the time constant of a solar sensor should be shorter than two seconds and that the accuracy should be within ± 6 W. There are several manufacturers of solar sensors with shorter time constants than required, however the accuracy of solar sensors is difficult compare between the manufacturers. The design of the <b>sensors</b> and their <b>casing</b> has a great impact on the performance of the sensor, as well as the placement of the sensor and the materials in the near surrounding. It is difficult to predict exactly how a specific sensor will perform in a particular application, hence physical tests will be needed to get exact results...|$|R
