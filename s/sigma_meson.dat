Predictions for long-range correlations and fluctuations of observables in our model could be used to study fundamental properties of the QCD phase transition.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the associated strangeness Lambda K+ and Sigma 0 K+ productions in proton-proton collisions within an effective Lagrangian model. The initial {{interaction between the}} two nucleons is modeled by the exchange of pi, rho, omega, and <b>sigma</b> <b>mesons</b> and the strangeness production proceeds via excitations of N*(1650), N*(1710), and N*(1720) baryonic resonances. The parameters of the model at the nucleon-nucleon-meson vertices are determined by fitting the elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering with an effective interaction based on the exchange of these four mesons, while those at the resonance vertices are calculated from the known decay widths of the resonances and from the vector meson dominance model. Experimental data taken recently by the COSY- 11 collaboration are described well by this approach. The one-pion-exchange diagram dominates the production process at both higher and lower beam energies. The excitation of the N*(1650) resonance dominates both the production channels at near threshold energies.

For small bare quark masses the critical point separating the first order {{phase transition}} line and the smooth crossover region is determined, and the spinodal lines are drawn. Adiabatic lines are computed showing that the critical point does not serve as focusing point in the adiabatic expansion. Second, coarse-grained evolution equations for inhomogeneous chiral condensate fields coupled to a heat bath are derived in the linear sigma model. Multiple effects of the thermal background on the Disoriented Chiral Condensate (DCC) are studied within linear response theory. In-medium modification of the pion dispersion relation is examined.

The {{structure of the}} model is upgraded {{in order to allow}} for terms in the quark selfenergy which violate Lorentz invariance due to the presence of the medium. We examine the critical properties, the phase diagram as well as the equation of state. Furthermore, some aspects of the Mott effect for pions and <b>sigma</b> <b>mesons</b> are discussed explicitly within a nonlocal Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In particular, we continued the meson polarization function in the complex energy plane and under certain approximations, we were able to extract the imaginary part {{as a function of the}} meson energy. We were not able to calculate the dynamical meson mass, and therefore resorted to a technical study of the temperature dependence of the meson width by replacing the meson energy with the temperature dependent spatial meson mass. Our results show that while the temperature behavior of the meson widths is qualitatively the same for a wide class of covariant regulators, the special case where the nonlocal interactions are introduced via the instanton liquid model singles out with a drastically different behavior.
