5|$|Babangida's {{fortunes}} {{started to}} change {{towards the end of}} 1998. Having missed {{the start of the season}} with malaria, Babangida gradually lost his starting line-up position as Morten Olsen was looking to improve on the team's inconsistent performances both in the domestic league and in Europe. Babangida started two of his team's opening Champions League games. The European season, however, ended in disappointment as Ajax finished bottom of their group behind Olympiacos, Dinamo Zagreb and Porto. Overall, Babangida appeared in 18 league games for Ajax that season, starting only seven. He didn't feature in the Dutch Cup final where Ajax managed to retain the trophy after beating Fortuna <b>Sittard</b> in the final.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} also {{time and again}} shown to have {{a soft spot for}} clubs in {{financial}} disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers. Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its license for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli. More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna <b>Sittard</b> was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club. Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid. On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.|$|E

25|$|The 1984–85 Cup Winners' Cup {{campaign}} {{was not without}} its controversy. In a tie with Fortuna <b>Sittard</b> of the Netherlands, an Everton fan streaked on the pitch and was arrested when trying to climb back over the security fencing into the stands. This {{was one of many}} high-profile pitch invasions by fans of English clubs at home and abroad around this time.|$|E

25|$|The 1980 World Championships in Athletics was {{the second}} global, {{international}} athletics competition organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Hosted from 14 to 16 August 1980 at the De Baandert in <b>Sittard,</b> Netherlands, it featured two events: the women's 400 metres hurdles and the women's 3000 metres run. West Germany's Birgit Friedmann took the first women's world title in the 3000 m, while her East German counterpart Bärbel Broschat became the first women's 400 m hurdles world champion.|$|E
25|$|Bayern won {{its first}} three games under Heynckes as coach, {{defeating}} Borussia Mönchengladbach, Energie Cottbus and Bayer Leverkusen. A draw at 1899 Hoffenheim led to a delicate situation before the last game, where second-place Bayern hosted third-place VfB Stuttgart. While {{the winner of the}} match would be qualified for the Champions League, and even win the championship if VfL Wolfsburg lost, the loser would likely fall to fourth position, outside of the Champions League spots. As fourth-place Hertha BSC lost and Wolfsburg won, the game eventually just decided that Bayern would go to the Champions League directly while Stuttgart would go to the qualification. The season concluded with four friendly games at Kaufbeuren, Eichstätt, 1. FC Magdeburg, and Fortuna <b>Sittard,</b> all won by Munich.|$|E
25|$|After {{his playing}} career {{he became a}} {{football}} manager and started in 1966 at Holland Sport. He also managed AZ '67, Standard Liège, Fortuna <b>Sittard,</b> Fort Lauderdale Strikers, FC Amsterdam, MVV, FC Den Haag, FC Volendam, Telstar, WAC Casablanca, the Ajax youth academy (1985 and following years) and Sariyerspor. In 1978, he finished third with AZ'67 in the Dutch league and the Dutch Cup (KNVB-Cup) was won (Final AZ'67-Ajax 1–0). In 1973 {{was added to the}} staff of the Dutch national team as an assistant manager next to Frantisek Fadrhonc. During the 1974 FIFA World Cup he was the assistant of Rinus Michels when the Dutch national team lost the final to Germany. In 1980 he coached Fort Lauderdale to the NASL's American Conference title, and a runner-up finish in Soccer Bowl '80.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the IAAF and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{agreed that}} the Athletics at the Summer Olympics served as the world {{championship}} event for the sport. The IAAF began to expand its programme of approved events for women and this conflicted with the Olympic athletics programme. The 400 m hurdles was recently introduced event for female athletes while the 3000 m marked the increasing popularity of long-distance running events among women. Neither event was contested at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The boycott of those Olympics {{and the presence of}} the Liberty Bell Classic (an alternative event for the boycotting nations) gave the IAAF additional incentive to hold its own competition; although the Soviet Union withdrew, the events in <b>Sittard</b> attracted entries from countries {{on both sides of the}} Western and Eastern divide.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 Feyenoord {{had another}} bright season, winning the double {{for the third}} time in their history. Key players in the squad from this period {{included}} Johan Cruyff, Ruud Gullit and Peter Houtman (who later became the Feyenoord stadium announcer). Cruyff reacted to Ajax's decision not to offer him a new contract at the start of the season and signed for arch rivals Feyenoord instead. Cruyff's move to Rotterdam was criticised and increased Ajax's motivation to beat Feyenoord. In the Olympic Stadium of Amsterdam Feyenoord suffered their heaviest ever defeat: 8-2. However, Feyenoord later defeated Ajax in Rotterdam 4-1 and Ajax were subsequently beaten a second time in the Dutch Cup. Feyenoord proceeded to win a league and cup double by beating Fortuna <b>Sittard</b> in the cup final.|$|E
25|$|Feyenoord {{started the}} {{pre-season}} preparations with its first training session on 25 June 2014 {{in front of}} 5,000 fans. They beat amateur sides SV Honselersdijk, VOC, FC Horst and ASWH in pre-season friedlies. Graziano Pellè, the top goals scorer of the two previous seasons, transferred to Southampton F.C., managed by Ronald Koeman who coached Feyenoord the previous three seasons, for eight million euros. The club announced they had acquired former international defender Khalid Boulahrouz transfer-free several days later. On 15 July the transfer of Daryl Janmaat to Newcastle United F.C. and Bruno Martins Indi to F.C. Porto was announced, both played as defensive backs the previous season and were bronze medalists in the Dutch squad at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The club subsequently played a friendly game away at FC Emmen {{that resulted in a}} 2–0 win. They were supposed to play Fortuna <b>Sittard</b> in Echt-Susteren on 19 July, that game got banned in that municipality and was played behind closed doors in Rotterdam, resulting in a Feyenoord win. The last pre-season friendly ended in a 1–1 draw at home against Spanish side Real Sociedad; Mitchell te Vrede scored the lone Feyenoord goal. Before the game, a moment of silence commenced to remember the victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Stefan de Vrij, the best defender of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, was transferred to S.S. Lazio at the end of July, marking the fourth high-profile sale of a Feyenoord player this transfer window.|$|E
500|$|Southall kept a clean sheet at Wembley in the 1984 FA Charity Shield, as Everton beat Liverpool 1–0 to {{take home}} the first {{silverware}} of the 1984–85 season. They then lost the opening two league games of the season, before losing only three of their next 37 league games to win the First Division title by a 13-point margin. Over {{the course of the}} season they beat Liverpool both at Anfield and at Goodison, and recorded a 5–0 win over Manchester United. Southall made one particularly crucial save from a point-blank Mark Falco header in a 2–1 win over title chasers Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 3 April; the Daily Mails Jeff Powell described it as [...] "the most astonishing save since Gordon Banks left Pelé dumbfounded in Mexico". In the European Cup Winners' Cup, Everton beat UCD (Ireland), Inter Bratislava (Czechoslovakia), Fortuna <b>Sittard</b> (Netherlands), and Bayern Munich (Germany) in two-legged encounters, and Southall conceded just the one goal (from Dieter Hoeneß) over the course of all eight matches. They then beat Austrian club Rapid Wien 3–1 in the final at De Kuip to win the first European title in the club's history. Three days later Everton played in the 1985 FA Cup Final, but lost 1–0 to Manchester United after a Norman Whiteside goal in extra-time. At {{the end of the season}} Southall was named as the FWA Footballer of the Year, becoming only the first Everton player, second Welshman and fourth goalkeeper to win the award.|$|E

In Europe, the club won its first, and so far only, European trophy by securing the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1985. The European success came after first beating University College Dublin, Inter Bratislava and Fortuna <b>Sittard.</b> Then, Everton defeated German giants Bayern Munich 3–1 in the semi-finals, despite trailing at half time (in a match voted the greatest in Goodison Park history), and recorded the same scoreline over Austrian club Rapid Vienna in the final. Having won both the League and Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, Everton {{came very close to}} winning a treble, but lost to Manchester United in the FA Cup final. The following season, 1985–86, Everton were runners-up to neighbours Liverpool in both the League and the FA Cup, but did recapture the League Championship in 1986–87.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time since the Eneco Tour was {{established}} in 2005, one of the race's stages was held as a team time trial; held over , around the towns of <b>Sittard</b> and Geleen in the Netherlands.

Two ninth place finishes followed, the second of which coming during the time trial stage in Roermond to help him overhaul Philippe Gilbert for the race lead, with two stages remaining. Boasson Hagen held the lead {{to the end of the}} race, and won the final stage of the event in <b>Sittard,</b> to take a 22-second victory over Gilbert. He also played a prominent part in the other classifications, as his six top-ten placings over the week earned him victory in the points classification, while his overall triumph also meant victory in the young rider classification. The squad provisionally won the teams classification on-the-road, but an eventual protest from [...] general manager Dirk Demol, resulted in RadioShack winning the classification on time trial timings.|$|E
