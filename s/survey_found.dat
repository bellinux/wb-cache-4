5|$|The {{first known}} {{population}}, at Wangelling Gully Nature Reserve in Tarwonga. This population {{appears to be}} in decline: in 1988 it was estimated as containing from 500 to 800 plants, but a 2001 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> only 198 adults, 1 seedling, and 286 dead plants; and a 2004 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> 135 adults, no seedlings, and 174 dead plants.|$|E

2500|$|Lyell {{noted the}} [...] "economic advantages" [...] that {{geological}} surveys could provide, citing their felicity in mineral-rich countries and provinces. Modern surveys, like the British Geological <b>Survey</b> (<b>founded</b> in 1835), and the US Geological <b>Survey</b> (<b>founded</b> in 1879), map and exhibit {{the natural resources}} within the country. So, in endorsing surveys, as well as advancing the study of geology, Lyell helped to forward the business of modern extractive industries, such as the coal and oil industry.|$|R

50|$|Evidence of {{corruption}} within {{the civil service}} comes from surveys conducted within the sector. Some <b>surveys</b> <b>found</b> out that almost half {{were found to have}} received bribes. Civil servants themselves admit to corruption.|$|R
5|$|Mites of {{the genus}} Ptilonyssus, such as P. sittae, {{have been found in}} the Eurasian nuthatch's nasal cavities. Intestinal worms include the {{nematodes}} Tridentocapillaria parusi and Pterothominx longifilla. Small studies in Slovakia and Spain found no blood parasites, but a larger Spanish <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> some evidence of Plasmodium infection.|$|E
5|$|A 2012 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> that Canadians {{consider}} the Grey Cup {{to be the}} most important annual event to attend. Fans of all teams converge at the game venue, including some who have attended 60 or more Grey Cups. The influx of people from across the country is estimated to have an economic impact of over $120 million for the region hosting the championship game.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E

50|$|Radial {{velocity}} <b>surveys</b> <b>found</b> exoplanet orbits beyond 0.1 AU to be eccentric, {{particularly for}} large planets. Kepler spacecraft transit data {{is consistent with}} the RV surveys and also revealed that smaller planets tend to have less eccentric orbits.|$|R
5000|$|Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum : It {{consists}} {{of a series of}} seven volumes of inscriptions discovered and deciphered by archaeologists of the <b>survey.</b> <b>Founded</b> in 1877 by Alexander Cunningham, a final revised volume was published by E. Hultzsch in 1925.|$|R
5|$|In 1977, the church, rectory, {{and schools}} were {{recorded}} by a historic preservation program {{run by the}} Ohio Historical Society, known as the Ohio Historic Inventory. This <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> the church in excellent condition, the elementary school in fair condition, and {{the high school and}} rectory in good condition. Although no historic preservation program was in effect, no threats to historic integrity were identified for any of the buildings, except for the elementary school, which was deemed to be in danger from being outdated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the eruption, despite earning rapid fame and opportunities to research internationally in Japan, New Zealand, and Guadeloupe, Glicken still failed to obtain a job at USGS. Senior employees at the <b>Survey</b> <b>found</b> his behavioral oddities unsettling. Activity at Mount St. Helens diminished, prompting USGS to reduce CVO's budget and contemplate closing the station. He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the year}} 2000 problem (Y2K) was the focus of {{significant}} COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before. The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates heavily, and to fixed-length data fields. After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> that many remained in use.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variety of}} sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) {{can result from}} sexual activity. A 2007 study reported that two large population <b>surveys</b> <b>found</b> [...] "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women." ...|$|R
50|$|Sky {{points are}} similar to a paid subscription, but can also be {{obtained}} through <b>surveys</b> <b>found</b> on IGG's homepage. They allow players {{to reduce the amount}} of time actions take in the game and allow them to obtain blueprints and other items through the treasure box.|$|R
50|$|Repair {{work which}} {{commenced}} in August 2015 {{was expected to}} cost £400,000, however initial <b>surveys</b> <b>found</b> the corrosion was worse than initially expected and could now cost £1.2million. Some pressure groups have called for the bridge to be closed to cars permanently, allowing only cyclists and pedestrians to use it.|$|R
5|$|Sri Lankan Tamils {{continue}} to seek refuge in countries like Canada and Australia. The International Organization for Migration and the Australian government have declared Tamil refugees as economic migrants. Canada has tightened controls on their refugee program due to various abuses within the Canadian refugee system. A Canadian government <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> that over 70% of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees {{have gone back to}} Sri Lanka for holidays raising concerns over the legitimacy of their refugee claims.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi Arabian {{government}} and other Gulf region governments strongly support the King of Bahrain. Although {{government officials and}} media often accuse the opposition of being influenced by Iran, a government-appointed commission found no evidence supporting the claim. Iran has historically claimed Bahrain as a province, but the claim was dropped after a UN 1970 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> that most Bahraini people preferred independence over Iranian control.|$|E
5|$|The census {{question}} on religion has been criticised by the British Humanist Association as leading, and other surveys of religion tend to find very different results. The 2015 British Election <b>Survey</b> <b>found</b> 52% of Northerners identified as Christian (22% Anglican, 14% non-denominational Christian, 12% Roman Catholic, 2% Methodist, and 2% other Christian denominations), 40% as non-religious, 5% as Muslim, 1% as Hindu and 1% as Jewish.|$|E
50|$|Sea Gull {{continued}} {{to operate with}} the squadron until July 1825, when she was ordered {{to return to the}} east coast. She was subsequently <b>surveyed,</b> <b>found</b> unfit for further sea duty, and fitted out as a receiving ship at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There she served until she was sold in 1840.|$|R
2500|$|Two <b>surveys</b> <b>found</b> that {{attitudes towards}} animal rights tactics, such as direct action, are very diverse within the animal rights communities. Near half (50% and 39% in two surveys) of activists {{do not support}} direct action. One survey {{concluded}} [...] "it {{would be a mistake}} to portray animal rights activists as homogeneous." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1908, the School of the Ministry of Agriculture has founded at Windsor Palace as the Ministry of Agriculture merged three schools, the School of <b>Surveying</b> (<b>founded</b> in 1882), the School of Irrigation (founded in 1905), and the School of Agriculture. Thailand's first tertiary-level {{agriculture}} curriculum {{began to}} offer courses in 1909.|$|R
5|$|VHEMT {{promotes}} a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, {{a group that}} argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population {{to care for the}} Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> that 36% considered themselves members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in the previous five years.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> that 68% of American flex-fuel car {{owners were}} not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} golden white-eye is very common, {{and in fact}} a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest {{recorded}} for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km² (8.47 per acre). It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does. A 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 <b>survey,</b> <b>found</b> that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous fantail and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.|$|E
