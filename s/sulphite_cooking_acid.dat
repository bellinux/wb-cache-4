40|$|During {{recent years}} in these {{laboratories}} {{attention has been given}} to the possibilities of pulping wood with sulphur dioxide gas, under conditions which differ widely from any of the conventional methods of <b>sulphite</b> <b>cooking.</b> While undertaken originally as a method which afforded studies {{of the effects of the}} reaction products on <b>sulphite</b> <b>cooking,</b> the outlook developed to be one of the commercial feasibility of such a process. The essential features are that wood (moisture, 66 %) is charged to a digester which is then evacuated and subsequently brought up to reaction temperature. Gaseous sulphur dioxide is then admitted to the digester under considerable pressure and the cooking continued in this manner for several hours. If development was to progress along these lines, the heat requirement of such a process becomes of extreme importance. Excessive temperature changes as the result of the heat of the reaction would present engineering difficulties in heat transfer through a mass of nearly dry chips if the process was attempted on a commercial scale. As a result this investigation was commenced with the immediate object of establishing the sign and, to some degree at least, the magnitude of the heat effects produced during the process of delignification of moist spruce wood in a highly concentrated medium of su 1 phur dioxide gas.

This thesis describes an investigation of the equilibrium vaporpressures of the system calcium oxide - sulphur dioxide - water* It thus forms a part of a general investigation into the physical propertiesof sulphite systems which has been in progress in this laboratory lor several years.

40|$|A catalyzed chemimechanical-anthraquinone pulping {{of black}} spruce wood was {{investigated}} in this study. The effect of liquor pH on anthraquinone performance, AQ and mass transfer limitations on chemimechanical pulp properties {{and the effects of}} AQ, liquor pH and sulphite concentration on pulping kinetic were studied. It was observed that AQ was not an effective redox catalyst when added to the sulphite liquor at pH 4, but it was very effective at pH 7 and higher. When chemical treatment of chemimechanical pulping was done with the presence of AQ, the sulphur content of pulp was reduced due to preferential reaction of AQ with wood components. AQ, as a pulping agent, is much effective in increasing the delignification rate {{and at the same time}} protecting the degradation of carbohydrates. Pulps produced from wood wafers with cooking liquor at pH 7 containing 0. 1 % of AQ on oven dry wood, exhibited the following improved properties when compared with those prepared without addition of AQ: increased pulping rate, higher pulp yield and carbohydrates yield at the same level of residual lignin in pulp, and in addition, the strength properties such as breaking length and burst strength improved by 15 % even with a minimum AQ charge (0. 05 % and 0. 01 %). With regular wood chips, the penetration of sulphite seems to be superior to that of AQ. It was observed that AQ was not uniformly distributed in the impregnated wood chips even when the compression ratio was increased from 3. 5 : 1 to 5 : 1. The penetration of AQ into wood chips remains to be a major factor affecting the pulping rate and pulp properties (strength and brightness) in chemimechanical-AQ pulping. The rate of delignification in the initial phase of both <b>sulphite</b> and sulphite-AQ <b>cooking</b> at pH 7 shows the second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The order with respect to sulphite concentration for <b>sulphite</b> and sulphite-AQ <b>cooking</b> were estimated to be 0. 24 and 0. 31, respectively. The activation energies of delignification of the initial phase in sulphite and sulphite-AQ pulping were 90. 2 and 97. 5 kJ/mole which was valid up to 30 % lignin removal within the temperature range of 160 °C and 175 °C. AQ as a pulping additive introduced to the sulphite liquor increased the rate of delignification 1. 5 times in the initial phase of delignification during the <b>sulphite</b> <b>cooking</b> process. At initial pH of sulphite liquor ranging from 7 to 10, the rate of delignification in the initial phase during <b>sulphite</b> and sulphite-AQ <b>cooking</b> appears to be a second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The reaction orders with respect to sulphite concentration increases when the initial pH is below 8 and decreases when the initial pH is above 8 for both <b>sulphite</b> and sulphite-AQ <b>cooking.</b> The raw of delignificafion is dependent on the initial pH of cooking liquor and the addition of AQ...|$|R
40|$|The sulfite pulping {{process is}} today practised {{in only a}} small number of pulp mills around the globe and the number of sulfite mills that use sodium as the base (cation) is less than five.

It was therefore considered to be of high importance to further study the sodium based sulfite process to investigate if its benefits could be better utilized in the future in the production of dissolving pulps. Of specific interest was to investigate how the pulping conditions in the initial part of the cook (≥ 60 % pulp yield) should be performed in the best way. Thus, this thesis is focused on the initial phase of single stage sodium bisulfite cooking of either 100 % spruce or 100 % pine wood chips. The cooking experiments were carried out with either a lab prepared or a mill prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid</b> and the temperature and cooking time were varied. Activation energies for different wood components were investigated as well as side reactions concerning the formation of thiosulfate and sulfate. Single stage sodium bisulfite cooking was carried out on either spruce or pine wood chips to investigate the influence of several process parameters in the initial phase of such a cook i. e. between 100 % and 60 % pulp yield. The cooking experiments were carried out with either a lab prepared or a mill prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid</b> and the temperature and time in the initial stage were varied. The influence of dissolved organics and inorganics components in the cooking liquor on the final pulp properties and side reactions were investigated. The impact of temperature and time on the pulp components were analyzed with respect to carbohydrates, lignin, extractives and thiosulfate. Kinetic equations were developed and the activation energies for delignification and carbohydrate dissolution were calculated using the Arrhenius equation. It was found that if using a mill prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid,</b> this had a beneficial effect with respect to side reactions, better extractives removal and higher pH stability during the cook, compared to a corresponding cook with a lab prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Cooking</b> with mill prepared and lab prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acids</b> showed the same behaviour with respect to delignification and carbohydrate degradation, but the lab acid experiments resulted in a higher thiosulfate formation during the cook. The cellulose yield was not affected at all during the initial phase of the sulfite cook verifying earlier results by other researchers. The temperature had an influence on both the delignification rate and the rate of hemicelluloses removal.  The corresponding activation energies were found to increase in the following order; cellulose, xylan, glucomannan and lignin.

The cooking experiments were {{carried out in the}} laboratory with either a lab-prepared or a mill-prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid</b> and the temperature and time were varied. The influences of dissolved organic and inorganic components in the cooking liquor on the final pulp composition and on the extent of side reactions were investigated. Kinetic equations were developed and the activation energies for delignification and carbohydrate dissolution were calculated using the Arrhenius equation. A better understanding of the delignification mechanisms during bisulfite and <b>acid</b> sulfite <b>cooking</b> was obtained by analyzing the lignin carbohydrate complexes (LCC) present in the pulp when different cooking conditions were used. It was found that using a mill-prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid</b> beneficial effect with respect to side reactions, extractives removal and higher stability in pH during the cook were observed compared to a lab-prepared <b>cooking</b> <b>acid.</b> However, no significant difference in degrees of delignification or carbohydrate degradation was seen.  The cellulose yield was not affected in the initial phase of the cook however; temperature had an influence on the rates of both delignification and hemicellulose removal. It was also found that the  corresponding activation energies increased in the order:  xylan, glucomannan, lignin and cellulose. The cooking temperature could thus be used to control the cook to a given carbohydrate composition in the final pulp. Lignin condensation reactions were observed during <b>acid</b> sulfite <b>cooking,</b> especially at higher temperatures. The LCC studies indicated the existence of covalent bonds between lignin and hemicellulose components with respect to xylan and glucomannan. LCC in native wood showed the presence of phenyl glycosides, ϒ-esters and α-ethers; whereas the α-ethers  were affected during sulfite pulping. The existence of covalent bonds between lignin and wood polysaccharides might be the rate-limiting factor in sulfite pulping.

All groups were fed on concentrate feed mixture plus 1 % of live body weight wheat straw for 169 days. Four levels (zero, 200 g, 400 g and 600 g) of leucaena hay were used. Final weight and carcass traits were evaluated. Color (L, a, b), proximate composition, pH, acidity, expressible water, water holding capacity, <b>cooking</b> loss, amino <b>acid</b> and minerals contents of meat were determined. Sensory evaluation of cooked meat was also evaluated. The results revealed that, Hindquarter, shoulder, and sets weight were significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) different. Moisture, protein, fat and ash content of fresh meat were ranged from 73. 72 to 76. 23 %, 20. 06 to 20. 80 %, 2. 41 to 4. 12 % and 1. 01 to 1. 08 %, respectively. Expressible water, water holding capacity and pH were significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) different. No significant (p ≤ 0. 05) {{differences were found in}} color (L, a, b), acidity and cooking loss of meat. Amino acids and minerals contents of all meat samples were varied. Cooked meat of group four had the highest scores of tenderness, juiciness, flavor and over all acceptability 4. 6, 4. 5, 4. 4 and 4. 5, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Results of {{many studies}} {{indicate}} that consumption of n- 3 fatty acids can benefit persons with cardiovascular disease and rheumatoid arthritis. However, encapsulated fish oil {{is unlikely to be}} suited to lifetime daily use and recommendations to increase fish intake have not been effective. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effectiveness of a diet that incorporates foods rich in n- 3 fatty acids in elevating tissue concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and in suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators. DESIGN: Healthy male volunteers were provided with foods that were enriched in alpha-linolenic <b>acid</b> (<b>cooking</b> oil, margarine, salad dressing, and mayonnaise) and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (sausages and savory dip) and with foods naturally rich in n- 3 fatty acids, such as flaxseed meal and fish. Subjects incorporated these products into their food at home for 4 wk. Fatty acid intakes, cellular and plasma fatty acid concentrations, and monocyte-derived eicosanoid and cytokine production were measured. RESULTS: Analyses of dietary records indicated that intake of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid averaged 1. 8 g/d and intake of alpha-linolenic acid averaged 9. 0 g/d. These intakes led to an average 3 -fold increase in eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma, platelet, and mononuclear cell phospholipids. Thromboxane B(2), prostaglandin E(2), and interleukin 1 beta synthesis decreased by 36 %, 26 %, and 20 % (P < 0. 05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Foods that are strategically or naturally enriched in n- 3 fatty acids can be used to achieve desired biochemical effects without the ingestion of supplements or a change in dietary habits. A wide range of n- 3 -enriched foods could be developed to support large-scale programs {{on the basis of the}} therapeutic and disease-preventive effects of n- 3 fatty acids.

Significant differences {{in the quality of}} vegetables cooked by various methods were found. Stir-fried spinach retained significantly more ascorbic acid than spinach prepared by the other cooking methods. Stir-fried green beans also retained significantly more ascorbic acid than green beans prepared by the other methods, {{with the exception of the}} steaming method. The stir-fried broccoli retained a high percentage of ascorbic acid though the retention was not significantly greater than that in broccoli cooked by the other methods. Stir-fried spinach, green beans and broccoli retained significantly more chlorophyll than samples prepared by the other cooking methods, except that the stir-fried broccoli did not differ significantly from the broccoli boiled in large amounts of water. A high correlation was found between chlorophyll retention and color scores obtained through sensory tests in all three vegetables. With the exception of color stir-frying was a less acceptable cooking method than the other cooking methods as judged by the taste panel. Considering total palatability scores, the microwave method was ranked most acceptable for spinach and green beans while boiling in large amounts of water was ranked most acceptable for broccoli samples.

40|$|Rice {{fortification}} {{with multiple}} micronutrients (folic acid, iron and &# 946;-carotene) by utilizing two different processes: parboiling- an ancient process and High Pressure processing (HPP)  a novel {{process has been}} examined in this thesis. The fortification process was addressed through four vital phases: optimisation of parboiling process and use of HPP for fortification with multiple micronutrients, physico-chemical properties of the fortified rice, consumer acceptance study and bio-accessibility and transport studies. Parboiling process was optimised for fortifying rice with three micronutrients using the following condition: soaking the brown rice at 70 °C for 2 hours with the fortificant solution(FA- 150 mg; BC- 62. 5 mg; Fe- 25 mg) followed by steaming at 100 °C for 1 hour and then air drying the rice at room temperature until the moisture content dropped to 10 - 12 %. Folic acid showed highest uptake during parboiling. After <b>cooking</b> folic <b>acid</b> was retained the highest (98 %) followed by iron (90 %) and then &# 946;-carotene (35 %). For HPP, thebest condition for fortification was selected: treating milled white rice with the fortificant solution at 200 MPa for 1 hour (non-thermal) and then air-drying the processed rice (10 - 12 % final moisture content). Folic acid showed highest uptake after HPP (41 %) followed by &# 946;-carotene and iron (20 % each). Retention in cooked HPP rice followed the same trend as parboiled rice- Folic acid (98 %) > Iron (64 %) >&# 946;-carotene (18 %). Rice fortified by the twotechniques was assessed for physico-chemical properties to understand changes in starch during fortification. The process of adding nutrients {{did not have an}} impact on starch properties in the fortified rice. Parboiled rice was completely gelatinised while HPP rice showed partial gelatinization which affected hydrolysis of starch by &# 945;-amylase which in turn influenced the release of vitamins from the rice matrix during extraction and in vitro digestion. Fortified parboiled rice was diluted with white rice and assessed for colour variation instrumentally in comparison to white rice, which showed no significant difference betweenthem. The diluted fortified rice was presented to consumers for visual and taste acceptance. Fortified diluted rice (uncooked) was not as acceptable as uncooked white rice (coomercial) to consumers due to non-uniformity in appearance. Initially the purchase intent was low (28 %) for the diluted fortified rice. Howeverafter informing consumers about fortification and the additional nutritional value, purchase intent for fortified rice increased to 51 % implying that {{at least half of the}} consumers were willing to buy the rice. 76 % of consumers preferred cooked fortified rice mixed with white rice particularly when mentioned about fortification. The bio-accessibility of fortified micronutrients using both techniques viii were higher for fortified parboiled rice (FA- 96 % BC- 12 %) followed by HPP (FA- 46 %; BC- 2 %) compared to the fortificant solution (FA- 80 %; BC- 0. 1 %) containing the same concentration of nutrients except for iron (parboiled rice- 31 %, HPP rice  42 % and fortificant- 38 %). Fortification with multiple micronutrients using parboiling process showed better transport (FA- 33 %; BC- 23 % and Ferritin 26 ng/mL) after in vitro digestionand would be easier for implementation...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is to {{investigate}} an efficient method for concentrating of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) from tuna oil (include recovering from tuna cooking juice and commercial tuna oil) by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction and surfactant-coated lipase hydrolysis. Hopefully it can offer the functional oil which accords with market demand Cooking is a necessary part of canned tuna processing. It is wasteful to discard the incidental cooking juice, which contains soluble proteins and lipid. The objective of this study was to recover and refine fish oil contained in <b>cooking</b> juice. <b>Acid</b> value (AV), saponification value (SV), and peroxide value (POV) of the crude oil prepared from cooking juice were 10. 5 mg KOH/g oil, 170. 2 mg KOH/g oil, and 18. 4 meq/kg oil, respectively. Values of the three indices decreased to 0. 25 mg KOH/g oil, 167. 3 mg KOH/g oil, and 12. 5 meq/kg oil, respectively, via refining by steps of degumming, deacidification, and decoloring. The quality of crude oil was clearly improved after refining. The crude oil contained 9. 23 % DHA (decosahexaneoic acid) and 3. 27 % EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). Both highly unsaturated fatty acids were only slightly damaged during refining. The fish oil contained 12. 98 % EPA and DHA after ethyl esterification and increased to 37. 4 % with subsequent urea adduct fractionation. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction was further used to increase the concentration of EPA and DHA ethyl esters. The ratio of EPA + DHA ethyl esters (high-molecular-weight components) to that of C 16 and C 18 : 1 fatty acid ethyl esters (low-molecular-weight components) was used as a separation index for evaluating the process variables. Experimental results indicated that a high CO 2 density caused a low separation factor. At 1, 500 psig and 328. 2 K, the extraction collected over 600 L CO 2, displaying an accepted concentration factor of EPA+DHA ethyl esters herein. About 80 % yield of EPA and DHA was obtained and the ethyl esters increased from 37. 4 % to 54. 3 %. A surfactant-coated lipase has been known to be soluble in organic solvents and acted as an efficient esterification catalyst in the dry organic solvent. In our study it was also found to acted as an efficient hydrolytic catalyst for tuna oil in the two-phase aqueous-organic system. Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the two-phase reactions was also studied. Km value of the surfactant-coated Candida rugosa lipase was a half the native lipase while the maximum velocity (Vmax) was 11. 5 times higher. In another part of enrichment n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n- 3 PUFA), the results showed that the content of n- 3 PUFA in glyceride mixtures grew from 26. 4 % to 49. 8 % after hydrolysis and the content of DHA increased from 19. 1 % to 38. 9 %. Ascorbyl FA esters, oil-soluble antioxidants, were widely used in food industry, medical hygiene, and cosmetics. They would be hydrolyzed to Vit C and fatty acid in human body. Vit C-DHA ester was synthesized through immobilized-lipase-catalyzed condensation of ascorbic acid and DHA. The ability for lipase from C. Antarctica (Novozyme 435) to catalyze the direct esterification of Vit C with DHA were investigated in this study. Response surface methodology (RSM) and four-factor-three-level central composite rotatable design (CCRD) were adopted to evaluated the effects of synthesis variables, such as reaction time (12 — 36 hr), substrate molar ratio (ascorbic acid : DHA = 1 : 3 — 1 : 7), enzyme amount (25 mg — 75 mg), and molecular sieve amount (200 — 600 mg), on percentage molar conversion of Vit C-DHA ester. The experiment's result showed that it used 2 -methyl- 2 -butanol as solvent in 55 ℃, with 50 mg lipase, substrate ratio 1 : 7, and 400 mg molecular sieve after 12 hour reaction the conversion of ester synthesis amounts to 85. 7 %. 本研究係以鮪魚油（包含從蒸煮液回收與市售產品）為原料，以超臨界二氧化碳萃取法與界面活性劑包覆之脂解酶水解方式，探討提高油脂中多元不飽和脂肪酸含量之效果，期能提供符合市場需求之機能性油脂。 蒸煮為鮪魚罐頭加工中之必要工程，副生之煮汁中含有水溶性蛋白質及脂質，研究中將煮汁離心，回收所得粗製魚油之酸價為 10. 5 mg KOH/g oil，皂化價為 170. 2 mg KOH/g oil，過氧化價為 18. 4 meq/kg oil。粗製魚油經脫膠、脫酸、脫色等精製過程後，此三項品質指標值依序為 0. 25 mg KOH/g oil、 167. 3 mg KOH/g oil、 12. 5 meq/kg oil，顯示出品質之提升效果。此外回收的粗製魚油中 DHA (decosahexaneoic acid) 含量達 9. 23 ％，EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) 則為 3. 27 %，此二種機能性成分均會因精製而有些微的損失，此應係精製過程中之加熱所致。 其中魚油部份含有 12. 98 % EPA 和 DHA，而經由乙基酯化與尿素區分濃縮後上升至 37. 4 %，希望能藉由超臨界二氧化碳萃取技術來更進一步提升魚油中多元不飽和脂肪酸的含量，並藉由定義分離效率 S 值為樣品中 C 16 + C 18 (較低分子量脂肪酸乙酯濃度) 和 EPA+DHA (較高分子量脂肪酸乙酯濃度) 的比值，來評估利用超臨界二氧化碳萃取技術濃縮多元不飽和脂肪酸的效率。實驗結果顯示較高的二氧化碳濃度會導致較低的萃取效果，以 1500 psig 和 328. 2 K 的萃取條件下，在 CO 2 超過 600 L 後收集，顯示出較佳的 EPA+DHA 脂肪酸乙酯的濃縮比例，其中 EPA 和 DHA 的回收比率接近 80 %，而濃度也從 37. 4 % 增加到 54. 3 %。 界面活性劑包覆之脂解酶 (surfactant-coated lipase；SCL) 被認為是一種可溶於有機溶劑之酵素，且其於無水的有機環境下具有良好之酯化功能，研究中發現，界面活性劑包覆之脂解酶於有機溶劑-水溶液兩相系統中仍保有水解鮪魚油之效果，且界面活性劑包覆的脂解酶之 Michaelis-Menten 動力學中 Km 值為未經包覆脂解酶的 1 / 2 倍，Vmax 則為其 11. 5 倍。針對脂解酶濃縮多元不飽和脂肪酸之功能而言，利用經界面活性劑包覆的脂解酶水解鮪魚油，可使多元不飽和脂肪酸之含量由 26. 4 % 增加至 49. 8 %，DHA 含量由 19. 1 % 提升至 38. 9 %。 抗壞血酸脂肪酸酯為脂溶性之抗氧化劑，在人體可水解為抗壞血酸及脂肪酸，故其不僅保留了抗壞血酸之特性，更因與脂肪酸結合而增加抗壞血酸於油相之溶解度，使其可廣泛地應用於食品、醫療衛生及化妝品等領域。Vit C-DHA 酯的合成是利用固定化酵素對於抗壞血酸及 DHA 進行催化所得之產物，實驗利用脂解酶 Novozyme 435 催化抗壞血酸與 DHA 之間的直接酯化反應，並套用反應曲面法 (response surface methodology; RSM) 及四因子三階層變數之中心混成實驗設計法，分別探討反應時間 (12 — 36 hr) 、基質莫耳數比 (1 : 3 — 1 : 7) 、酵素添加量 (25 mg — 75 mg) 及分子篩添加量 (200 — 600 mg) 等反應變數對合成 Vit C-DHA 酯之影響。研究結果顯示，於 55 ℃、 2 -methyl- 2 - butanol 溶劑中，添加脂解酶 50 mg、分子篩 400 mg、基質莫耳比 1 : 7 ，反應 12 小時，具有最佳之轉換率 85. 7 %。目次 中文摘要 [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要 [...] Ⅳ 第一章 緒論 [...] 1 - 1 壹、研究背景 [...] 1 - 1 ㄧ、多元不飽和脂肪酸 (PUFA) 研究發展 [...] 1 - 1 二、多元不飽和脂肪酸 (PUFA) 在人體內的生物合成 [...] - 1 - 2 三、多元不飽和脂肪酸的來源 [...] - 1 - 3 四、多元不飽和脂肪酸的生理活性 [...] - 1 - 3 五、EPA 及 DHA 不飽和脂肪酸的生理機能 [...] 1 - 4 1.
