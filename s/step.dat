5|$|The number 1 (expressed as a {{fraction}} 1/1) is {{placed at the}} root of the tree, and the location of any other number a/b can be found by computing gcd(a,b) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each <b>step</b> replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A <b>step</b> of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a <b>step</b> in the tree from a node to its right child, and a <b>step</b> that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a <b>step</b> in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether a/b is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number a/b. This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.|$|E

40|$|Adaptive time-stepping methods {{based on}} the Monte Carlo Euler method for weak {{approximation}} of Itô stochastic differential equations are developed. The main result is new expansions of the computational error, with computable leading-order term in a posteriori form, based on stochastic flows and discrete dual backward problems. The expansions lead to efficient and accurate computation of error estimates. Adaptive algorithms for either stochastic time <b>steps</b> or deterministic time <b>steps</b> are described. Numerical examples illustrate when stochastic and deterministic adaptive time <b>steps</b> are superior to constant time <b>steps</b> and when adaptive stochastic <b>steps</b> are superior to adaptive deterministic <b>steps.</b> Stochastic time <b>steps</b> use Brownian bridges and require more work for a given number of time <b>steps.</b> Deterministic time <b>steps</b> may yield more time <b>steps</b> but require less work; for example, {{in the limit of}} vanishing error tolerance, the ratio of the computational error and its computable estimate tends to 1 with negligible additional work to determine the adaptive deterministic time <b>steps...</b>|$|R
