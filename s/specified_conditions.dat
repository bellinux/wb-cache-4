In 1911, the system {{exported}} 330,000 tonnes of ore. The railway was also used for transporting workers, with trains running from the towns to the plants {{in the morning and}} returning after the working day was over. Prior to private cars becoming common, the railway operated a passenger carriage on the trains between Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn—allowing free travel. The railway has never had any scheduled or public transport of passengers, but the company's concession specifies that the authorities could at a later date require the company to operate public passenger services under <b>specified</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted, and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences, and defamation.

25|$|The logical {{instructions}} {{consist of}} those for performing bitwise logical operations and conditional moves on the integer registers. The bitwise logical instructions perform AND, NAND, NOR, OR, XNOR, and XOR between two registers or a register and literal. The conditional move instructions test a register as a signed quadword to zero and move if the specified condition is true. The <b>specified</b> <b>conditions</b> are equality, inequality, {{less than or}} equal to, less than, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The shift instructions perform arithmetic right shift, and logical left and right shifts. The shift amount is given by a register or literal. Logical and shift instructions use the integer operate instruction formats.|$|E

The statistics tabulated by the CWGC are representative of the number of names commemorated for all servicemen/women of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth and former UK Dependencies, whose death was attributable to their war service. Some auxiliary and civilian organizations are also accorded war grave status if death occurred under certain <b>specified</b> <b>conditions.</b> For the purposes of CWGC the dates of inclusion for Commonwealth War Dead are 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947.|$|E

500|$|A {{new feature}} in Final Fantasy XII is the [...] "gambit" [...] system, {{which allows the}} player to program each {{character}} to perform certain commands in battle in response to <b>specified</b> <b>conditions.</b> Using gambits, the player may set reactions to different stimuli for each character. Each gambit consists of three parts: a target, an action, and a priority. The target specifies which ally or foe to act on and the condition for applying the action. For example, the target [...] "Ally: HP < 70%" [...] causes the character to target any ally whose hit points have fallen below 70%. The action is the command to be performed on the target. The priority determines which gambit to perform when multiple gambits are triggered. These heuristics guide the characters when acting autonomously, though player-directed commands are always given top priority.|$|E
2500|$|The medal {{could be}} awarded to {{part-time}} warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men after {{twelve years of}} continuous efficient service as a volunteer on the active list of the Citizen Force. Service in West Africa, natives of West Africa and periods spent on leave excluded, and war service were reckoned two-fold as qualifying service for the medal. Service {{during the period from}} 3 September 1939 to 1 March 1950 inclusive need not have been continuous, while breaks in service under certain <b>specified</b> <b>conditions,</b> though not counting as qualifying service, [...] were not considered as a break in the twelve years of continuous qualifying service for the medal.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the graph}} {{structure}} of data in GDB, associated explicit ICs can have also a graph form. Very simple IC is a functional dependency (FD) or conditional functional dependency (CFD) introduced in [12]. For example, “Each teacher is born in one town” and “Teachers born later than in 1994 teach at most one language” {{are examples of}} FD and CFD, respectively. A usable approach is also offered by above mentioned GRAD database model. It enables to express some semantic restrictions over the graph data with using graph patterns. A graph pattern P is a predicate on the graph topology (<b>specifying</b> <b>conditions</b> on the structural properties of the graph) and properties (<b>specifying</b> <b>conditions</b> on their values) of the graph elements.|$|R
