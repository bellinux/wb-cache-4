A right-wing executive, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, was appointed Economy Minister {{at the outset of}} the dictatorship, and a neoliberal economic platform centered around anti-labor, monetarist policies of financial liberalization was introduced. Budget deficits jumped to 15% of GDP as the country went into debt for the state takeover of over $15 billion in private debts as well as unfinished projects, higher defense spending, and the Falklands War. By the end of the military government in 1983, the foreign debt had ballooned from $8 billion to $45 billion, interest charges alone exceeded trade surpluses, industrial production had fallen by 20%, real wages had lost 36% of their purchasing power, and unemployment, calculated at 18% (though official figures claimed 5%), was at its highest point <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1929 <b>Great</b> <b>Depression.</b>|$|R

The crisis has been described by scholars, as perhaps been the worst financial crisis <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> economic <b>depression</b> of <b>the</b> 1930 s. This paper lucidly examines the effects of global economic recession on the development of human capital with reference to Nigeria nation. The objectives of the paper among others are (i) To establish the level of the impact of global economic recession on development of skills of human capital in Nigeria (ii) To examine if there is any significant relationship between global economic recession and the motivation of human capital development in Nigeria among others. The paper uses survey method with two research hypotheses. Questionnaires were administered among academic staff of two Nigerian universities in the southwest part of Nigeria. Findings showed that the global economic recession has <b>great</b> impact on <b>the</b> development of skills of human capital in Nigeria. Findings also revealed that there exists a positive relationship between global economic recession and training and development of human capital in Nigeria. The paper offers useful policy recommendations, which include the need for government and appropriate agencies to put in place policies such as enabling environment that will lead to the growth and development of human capital in Nigeria. Government needs to put forward policies that minimize cost at all levels, maximize efficiency of output, training and retraining of goods hands; and that there is need to encourage better motivation of workers at every sector of the economy amongst others...|$|R

Ore content had declined, and the richer veins were depleted, increasing tin production costs; at the same time, tin prices on the international market fell. A disagreement with the United States over tin prices halted exports temporarily and caused a decline in income that further hurt the economy.

As part of that work, NACCHO specifically encourages the transformation of public health practice to include the following: a) The development, tracking, and regular presentation of social indicators that (1) measure social health and well-being, including inequities in health status, similar to the national presentation of economic indicators; and (2) identify the institutional sources of decision-making cumulatively generating health inequities(e. g., investment in local infrastructure by neighborhood; distribution of city fiscal resources by neighborhood; bank loans, lending practices, and foreclosures by neighborhood; political influence, etc) b) Recruitment of a racially/ethnically diverse workforce c) Anti-racism training for the public health workforce d) Support for local policies that begin to address root causes, such as paid sick leave (see NACCHO statement of policy 11 - 07), living wage, and so forth. e) Support for the use of Health Impact Assessments (see NACCHO statement of policy 06 - 01) f) Cooperation in the production and sharing of information with constituents and community organizations g) Support for research that explores the generation of social and economic inequality, the role of privilege and organized wealth, and the power arrangements or mechanisms that increase inequality h) Building networks of power with community organizers to change the processes which generate health inequities Justification Inequality in the United States is at <b>the</b> highest level <b>since</b> before <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> and <b>the</b> United States has the worst health in the industrialized world. 2 The first words from the Worl...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the serious}} turmoil that had {{affected}} world financial markets during 2007 and 2008, in late 2008 the world entered a major recession, <b>the</b> deepest <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1929 <b>Great</b> <b>Depression.</b> <b>The</b> financial crisis, {{and the ensuing}} generalised loss of confidence in financial markets, resulted in strong constraints to the liquidity of the economic system. This triggered a contraction of demand, which in turn caused cuts on investments and jobs, in a downward spiral. In 2009, GDP fell by 4 percentage points over OECD countries, demand shrank drastically, industrial production and global trade contracted and unemployment in industrial countries swiftly rose into double digits. Signs of slow recovery started being detected {{in the second half}} of 2009, but by mid 2010 world economic conditions were still weak. By late 2008 both governments and central banks had taken swift and unprecedented measures to contrast the effects of the financial crisis. These actions prevented the world from going through an economic collapse similar to the one experienced in the 1930 s. In addition, many governments approved also major fiscal stimulus packages which, together with the effects of automatic stabilisers, help contain the economic downturn and paved the way for the economic recovery. This paper focuses on policy responses to the crisis implemented in the EU and on the steering role taken by EU institutions. After briefly detailing the main prescriptions for governments put forward by EU institutions in late 2008, the paper describes the main tax reforms introduced by individual EU Member States in 2009 - 2010 as part of their fiscal stimulus packages, to contrast the economic downturn and favour economic recovery.

50|$|The {{crisis of}} 2007-2008 has been {{identified}} as <b>the</b> most severe <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1930 <b>Great</b> <b>Depression.</b> Major financial institutions around the world were greatly affected. The history of the 2007/2008 crisis traces back to the bursting of the housing bubble in the United States, and the increase in mortgage defaults. This came about {{as a result of the}} mandate by the U.S. Congress for the Federal National Mortgage to increase access to low-income housing. As a result of the high default rates, many financial institutions across the U.S. were affected. Although the U.S. government had attempted to salvage the situation through liquidity doses, the crisis further deepened. By March 2008, Bear Sterns, a U.S. investment bank, required the efforts of the government to be rescued. At this stage, it was clear that the crisis had deepened. Other financial institutions, such as the Lehman bank and American International Group (AIG), started to feel the effects of the crisis. The severity of this crisis grew, and most U.S. and European banks were pulling back their international loans. This move caused major financial problems across the world, especially for those countries that rely heavily on international borrowing. Financial contagion was felt severely, especially in countries whose financial systems were vulnerable due to local housing bubbles and current account deficits. Some of the countries affected were Germany, Iceland, Spain, Britain and New Zealand among others. Many analysts and governments had failed to predict the real effects of the crisis. As major economies of the world started to feel the effects of the crisis, nearly every economy was affected directly or indirectly. In particular, there was a drop in exports and a lowering of commodity prices.|$|R
