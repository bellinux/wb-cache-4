In this study, results from the traditional and alternative plotting methods are compared using both simulated and measured data.

Global, diffuse and direct solar irradiances were provided by the Laboratory of <b>Solar</b> <b>Radiometry</b> of Botucatu-UNESP (latitude 22. 9 ° South, longitude 48. 45 ° West, altitude 745 m). The period assigned for the study comprised the years 1996 to 2002. Global solar irradiance was measured by an Eppley PSP pyranometer, direct irradiance by an Eppley Nip pyrheliometer and diffuse irradiance by an Eppley PSP pyranometer under the Melo-Escobedo-Oliveira shadowring (radius of 40 cm and width of 10 cm). Isotropic and KT corrections were applied in diffuse irradiance. The proposed model was compared to classic models reported in the literature, with good results according to the MBE and RMSE statistical indicators for hourly, daily and monthly partitions, respectively. The results showed that the inclusion of KT correction improved the performance of the shadowring MEO according to MBE values for the three partitions: hourly, reduction from - 7. 21 % to - 1. 74 %; daily from - 4. 70 % to 0. 88 % and monthly from - 6. 58 % to - 1. 18 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Since November 1978 a set {{of total}} solar {{irradiance}} (TSI) measurements from space is available, yielding a time series of more than 25 years. Presently, there are three TSI composites available, called PMOD, ACRIM and IRMB, which are all constructed from the same original data, but use different procedures to correct for sensitivity changes. The PMOD composite {{is the only one}} which also corrects the early HF data for degradation. The results from the detailed analysis of the VIRGO radiometry allow a good understanding of the effects influencing the long-term behaviour of classical radiometers in space. Thus, a re-analysis of the behaviour of HF/NIMBUS- 7 and ACRIM-I/SMM was indicated. For the former the situation is {{complicated by the fact that}} there are no in-flight means to determine changes due to exposure to solar radiation by comparison with a less exposed radiometer on the same spacecraft. The geometry and optical property of the cavity of HF is, however, very similar to the PMO 6 -type radiometers, so the behaviour of the PMO 6 V radiometers on VIRGO can be used as a model. ACRIM-I had to be revised mainly due to a henceforth undetected early increase and a more detailed analysis of its degradation. The results are not only important for <b>solar</b> <b>radiometry</b> from space, but they also provide a more reliable TSI during cycle 21. The differences between the revised PMOD composite and the ACRIM and IRMB are discussed by comparison with a TSI reconstruction from Kitt-Peak magnetograms. As the PMOD composite is the only one which has reliable data for cycle 21, the behaviour of the three solar cycles can now be compared and the similarities and differences discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work is to verify the attenuation caused by atmospheric constituents through the relationship between global, direct and diffuse solar radiation with respect to optical air mass. The optical air mass change has spatial and temporal dependence and influences the radiation flux incident, causing changes in the average values. Global, diffuse and direct solar irradiances were provided by the Laboratory of <b>Solar</b> <b>Radiometry</b> of Botucatu-UNESP (latitude 22. 9 ° South, longitude 48. 45 ° West, altitude 745 m). The period assigned for the study comprised the years 2002 to 2006. The global solar radiation was measured by an Eppley PSP pyranometer. The direct solar radiation was measured by an Eppley Nip pyrheliometer attached to a ST- 3 solar tracking system. The diffuse solar radiation was calculated by the difference between global and direct solar radiations. It was observed a decrease of solar radiation {{with the increase of}} optical air mass justified by the increase in probability of collision of solar rays with atmospheric constituents. For global solar radiation and optical air mass mo = 1, it was observed a minimum at 3. 1 MJ/m 2 and a maximum of 4. 1 MJ/m 2. For optical air mass mo= 2, minimum at 1. 5 MJ/m 2 and a maximum of 1. 9 MJ/m 2. For direct solar radiation and optical air mass mo = 1, it was observed a minimum at 2 MJ/m 2 and a maximum of 3. 8 MJ/m 2.

40|$|Decreasing {{trends of}} total ozone affect mainly solar {{ultraviolet}} (UV) levels {{at ground level}} with adverse effects on the biosphere. Highly accurate measurements of solar UV irradiance have become an important issue to assess UV trends. To detect these trends stations with well calibrated instruments, with long-term stability and Quality Assurance (QA) / Quality Control (QC) carefully followed procedures, are necessary. The <b>Solar</b> <b>Radiometry</b> Observatory of Rome, University "La Sapienza" (city centre) {{is one of the}} stations regularly measuring UV irradiance in Italy. Measurements of UV spectral (290 - 325 nm) irradiance started in 1992, using Brewer MKIV 067. Measurements of total irradiance contained in the 280 - 320 nm waveband begun in 2000 with the YES UVB- 1 broad-band radiometer. An investigation of the internal temperature dependence of the spectral responsivity {{to improve the quality of}} the Brewer UV data was carried out. The study was based on the analysis of responsivity files recorded during the years 2000 - 2002. Responsivities are provided by specific tests through a set of five 50 W quartz tungsten-halogen lamps, traceable to the standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The lamp tests allow to measure any changes in the instrument response over time. It was observed that a decrease in the instrument's responsivity resulted from an increase of the internal temperature. A methodology based on a family of responsivity files at different temperature intervals is proposed to allow correction of UV irradiances using the responsivity file at the corresponding temperatures. The mean percentage difference between temperature corrected and non-corrected Brewer data varies from 0. 8 % to 1. 5 % over an internal temperature of 8 degreesC - 42 degreesC. In addition the results of a field evaluation in Rome between Brewer 067 and two temperature stabilized instruments, a broad-band radiometer (YES UVB- 1) and a moderate bandwidth multichannel radiometer (Biospherical GUV- 511 C) were analysed using temperature corrected spectral measurements...|$|E

The anisotropic correction model, obtained from the comparison between the diffuse irradiance measured by the Melo-Escobedo shadowring (radius of 40 cm and width of 10 cm) and the diffuse irradiance measured by the difference method (reference), considered three discreet intervals, with three equations: (0 < < 0, 30 - cloudy); (0, 30 < < 0, 65 - partially cloudy); and (0, 65 < < 1 - clear). The anisotropic correction model was validated through the comparison of the anisotropic diffuse irradiance and the reference diffuse irradiance with an independent database, showing good results according to the statistical indicators MBE (%) = 0, 25 %, 0, 51 % and - 0, 38 % and RMSE (%) = 5, 78 %, 9, 83 % and 12, 93 % for cloudy, partially cloudy and clear skies, respectively.

Alice provides moderate resolution (~ 3 - 10 Å FWHM), spatially resolved ultraviolet (~ 465 - 1880 Å) spectroscopy, and includes the ability to perform stellar and solar occultation measurements.

In China and Korea AOD and alpha were strongly anticorrelated (reflecting transient dust events); dust volume-size modes peaked near 8 microns diameter; and SSA(dust) greater than SSA(pollution). 2. Calculations and measurements of photosynthetically active radiation and aerosols in China yield 24 -h average downward surface radiative forcing per AOD(500 nm) of - 27 W/sq m (400 - 700 nm). 3. The Hawaii-Japan cruise sampled a gradient with AOD(500 nm) extremes of 0. 1 and 1. 1. Shipboard measurements showed that adding dust to pollution increased SSA(550 nm, 55 % RH), typically from - 0. 91 to approx. 0. 97.
