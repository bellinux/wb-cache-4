They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both these ways.

5000|$|These {{include an}} {{electric}} heat source that is automatically regulated {{to maintain the}} operating pressure. They also include a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve</b> (as described above). This pressure cooker type cannot be opened with a cold water quick-release method and should be operated with caution when releasing vapour through the valve, especially while cooking foamy foods and liquids (lentils, beans, grains, milk, gravy, etc.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The bottle, more {{precisely}} a metal or plastic cylinder, is lowered on a cable into the ocean, {{and when it}} has reached the required depth, a brass weight called a [...] "messenger" [...] is dropped down the cable. When the weight reaches the bottle, the impact tips the bottle upside down and trips a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve</b> at the end, trapping the water sample inside. The bottle and sample are then retrieved by hauling in the cable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spring-loaded</b> {{pressure}} safety <b>valves</b> use a compressed {{spring to}} hold the valve closed. The valve will remain closed until the process pressure exceeds the set point of the spring pressure. The valve will open 100% when the set point is reached and will remain open until a certain blow down factor is reached. Oftentimes the blow down is {{a percentage of the}} set point, such as 20% of the set point. That means that the valve will remain open until the process pressure decreases to 20% below the set point of the <b>spring-loaded</b> relief <b>valve.</b>|$|R

50|$|Like a float carburetor, a {{pressure}} carburetor has a barrel with a venturi inside it through which air flows {{on its way}} to the engine cylinders. However, it does not have a float to control the flow of fuel into the carburetor. Instead, it has four chambers in a row separated by flexible diaphragms. The diaphragms are attached concentrically to a shaft which operates a wedge-shaped servo valve. This valve controls the rate at which fuel can enter the pressure carburetor. Inside the barrel, downstream of the throttle sits the discharge valve, which is a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve</b> operated by fuel pressure that controls the rate that fuel is discharged into the barrel.|$|E
50|$|These {{operate with}} a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve</b> {{that is often}} hidden from view in a {{proprietary}} mechanism. This generation is characterized by two or more pressure settings. Some of these pressure cookers do not release any steam during operation (non-venting) and instead use a rising indicator with markings to show the pressure level. These only release steam when the pan is opened, or as a safety precaution if the heat source is not reduced enough when the pan reaches the required cooking pressure. Others use a dial that the operator can advance by a few clicks (which alters the spring tension) to change the pressure setting or release pressure; these release steam during operation (venting).|$|E
50|$|Its {{advantages}} however are: with no {{moving parts}} {{except for the}} dozens of <b>spring-loaded</b> inlet <b>valves,</b> it has low maintenance and high reliability. It is also quite efficient, consuming roughly half the fuel compared with a pump driven by a mechanical gas engine doing the same work.|$|R
50|$|The valve {{resembles a}} typical <b>spring-loaded</b> check <b>valve,</b> {{with a small}} {{addition}} for the anti-dribble function. These valves are mounted on the outlet fittings of the fuel injection pump, one per cylinder injector. They are always mounted at the pump end of the pipes between the pump and injectors.|$|R
50|$|Most present-day {{diesel engines}} use a {{mechanical}} single plunger high-pressure fuel pump {{driven by the}} engine crankshaft. For each engine cylinder, the corresponding plunger in the fuel pump measures out the correct amount of fuel and determines the timing of each injection. These engines use injectors that are very precise <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valves</b> that open and close at a specific fuel pressure. Separate high-pressure fuel lines connect the fuel pump with each cylinder. Fuel volume for each single combustion is controlled by a slanted groove in the plunger which rotates only a few degrees releasing the pressure and is controlled by a mechanical governor, consisting of weights rotating at engine speed constrained by springs and a lever. The injectors are held open by the fuel pressure. On high-speed engines the plunger pumps are together in one unit. The length of fuel lines from the pump to each injector is normally the same for each cylinder {{in order to obtain}} the same pressure delay.|$|R
50|$|In the {{standard}} wall-mounted cooler, also {{commonly referred to}} as a water fountain or drinking fountain, a small tank in the machine holds chilled water so the user does not have to wait for chilled water. Water is delivered by turning or pressing a button on a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve</b> located {{on the top of the}} unit, that turns off the water when released. Some devices also offer a large button on the front or side. Newer machines may not have a button at all; instead a sensor that detects when someone is near and activates the water. Water is delivered in a stream that arches up, allowing the user to drink directly from the top of the stream of water. These devices usually dispense water directly from the municipal water supply, without treatment or filtering.|$|E
5000|$|Steam engines {{frequently}} possess {{two independent}} mechanisms for {{ensuring that the}} pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe. Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve {{in the top of}} a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve,</b> which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic Snubber: Similar to an {{automobile}} shock arrestor the hydraulic snubber {{is built around}} a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid with a piston that displaces the fluid {{from one end of}} the cylinder to the other. Displacement of fluid results from the movement of the pipe causing the piston to displace within the cylinder resulting in high pressure in one end of the cylinder and a relatively low pressure in the other. The velocity of the piston will dictate the actual difference in pressure. The fluid passes through a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve,</b> the spring being used to hold the valve open. If the differential pressure across the valve exceeds the effective pressure exerted by the spring, the valve will close. This causes the snubber to become rigid and further displacement is substantially prevented. The hydraulic snubber is normally used when the axis of restraint is in the direction of expansion and contraction of the pipe. The snubber is therefore required to extend or retract with the normal operation of the pipe work. The snubber has low resistance to movement at very low velocities.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} on the pressure variations in the injection system of the N. A. C. A. Spray Photography Equipment and {{on the effects of}} these variations on the motion of the timing valve stem was undertaken in connection with the study of fuel injection systems for high-speed oil engines. The methods of analysis of the pressure variations and the general equation for the motion of the spring-loaded stem for the timing valve are applicable to a <b>spring-loaded</b> automatic injection <b>valve,</b> and in general to all hydraulically operated valves. A sample calculation for a <b>spring-loaded</b> automatic injection <b>valve</b> is included...|$|R
25|$|Helmets {{also have}} a <b>spring-loaded</b> exhaust <b>valve</b> which allows excess air to leave the helmet. The spring force is {{adjustable}} by the diver to prevent the suit from deflating completely or over-inflating and the diver being floated uncontrollably to the surface. Some helmets have an extra manual exhaust valve known as a spit-cock. This allows the diver to vent excess air when {{he is in a}} position where the main exhaust can not function correctly.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic surges {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient. Fluctuations in the fluid’s velocity are generated by restrictions like a pump starting/stopping, a valve opening/closing, or a reduction in line size. Hydraulic surges can be generated {{within a matter of}} seconds anywhere that the fluid velocity changes and can travel through a pipeline at very high rate of speed, damaging equipment or causing piping failures from overpressurizing. Surge relief systems absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system. Methods for controlling hydraulic surges include utilizing a gas-loaded surge relief <b>valve,</b> <b>spring-loaded</b> pressure safety <b>valves,</b> pilot-operated valves, surge suppressors, and rupture disks.|$|R
50|$|The man-portable {{flamethrower}} {{consists of}} two elements: a backpack and the gun. The backpack element usually {{consists of two}} or three cylinders. In a two-cylinder system, one cylinder holds compressed, inert propellant gas (usually nitrogen), and the other holds flammable liquid—typically petrol with some form of fuel thickener added to it. A three-cylinder system often has two outer cylinders of flammable liquid and a central cylinder of propellant gas to maintain the balance of the soldier carrying it. The gas propels the liquid fuel out of the cylinder through a flexible pipe and then into the gun element of the flamethrower system. The gun consists of a small reservoir, a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve,</b> and an ignition system; depressing a trigger opens the valve, allowing pressurized flammable liquid to flow and pass over the igniter and out of the gun nozzle. The igniter can be one of several ignition systems: A simple type is an electrically-heated wire coil; another used a small pilot flame, fueled with pressurized gas from the system.|$|E
50|$|All modern {{pressure}} cookers {{will have}} a pressure regulator valve and a pressure relief valve as a safety mechanism to prevent explosion {{in the event that}} the pressure regulator valve fails to adequately release pressure. Some older models lack a safety release valve. Most home cooking models are built to maintain a low and high pressure setting. These settings are usually between 7 and 15 PSI. Almost all home cooking units will employ a very simple single-stage pressure regulator. Older models will simply use a small weight on top of an opening that will jiggle to allow excess pressure to escape. Newer models usually incorporate a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve</b> that lifts and allows pressure to escape as pressure in the vessel rises. Some pressure cookers {{will have a}} quick release setting on the pressure regulator valve that will, essentially, lower the spring tension to allow the pressure to escape at a quick, but still safe rate. Commercial kitchens also use pressure cookers, in some case using oil based pressure cookers to quickly deep fry fast food. In this case, {{and in the case of}} cooking at home, pressurized vessels can be used to cook food much more rapidly than it would take to cook large amounts of food without pressure. Pressure vessels of this sort can also be used to sterilize small batches of equipment and in home canning operations.|$|E
40|$|On {{the premise}} of a {{rectangular}} velocity wave arriving at the valve, the equation of motion of a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valve</b> stem is developed and analyzed. It is found that the stem oscillates, the oscillation frequency being consistently above the natural frequency of the nozzle stem alone, and whose amplitudes would increase {{in the absence of}} damping. The results are evaluated and verified on an example. The pressure in the valve and the spray volume are analyzed and several pertinent questions are discussed {{on the basis of the}} results...|$|E

In the event both main cargo pumps fail the top can be removed from this pipe and an emergency cargo pump lowered {{down to the bottom of}} the pipe.

50|$|The {{governor}} {{is connected to}} the output shaft and regulates the hydraulic pressure depending on the vehicle speed. The engine load is monitored either by a throttle cable or a vacuum modulator. The valve body is the hydraulic control center that receives pressurized fluid from the main pump operated by the fluid coupling/torque converter. The pressure coming from this pump is regulated and used to run a network of <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>valves,</b> check balls and servo pistons. The valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as hydraulic signals from the range selector valves and the throttle valve or modulator) to control which ratio is selected on the gearset; as the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. The hydraulic pressure controlled by these valves drives the various clutch and brake band actuators, thereby controlling the operation of the planetary gearset to select the optimum gear ratio for the current operating conditions. However, in many modern automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by electro-mechanical servos which are controlled by the electronic engine control unit (ECU) or a separate transmission control unit (TCU, also known as transmission control module (TCM).|$|R

As a result; the valve releases the helium, hydrogen and/or other gases used in the breathing gas mix trapped inside the watch case.|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes {{called a}} check valve or a {{backflow}} preventer, a chemigation valve is an apparatus designed to protect water supplies from agricultural chemicals used during chemigation, the application of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides through irrigation water. [...] Most chemigation valves consist of a <b>spring-loaded</b> check <b>valve,</b> a low pressure drain, an air and vacuum relief valve, and an injection port for introducing the chemicals downstream of the check valve.

50|$|A <b>spring-loaded</b> {{safety relief}} <b>valve</b> is usually {{installed}} on all {{oil and gas}} separators. These valves normally are set at the design pressure of the vessel. Safety relief valves serve primarily as a warning, and in most instances {{are too small to}} handle the full rated fluid capacity of the separator. Full-capacity safety relief valves can be used and are particularly recommended when no safety head (rupture disk) is used on the separator.|$|R
