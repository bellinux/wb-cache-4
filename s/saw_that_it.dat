5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is no question that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E
5|$|Using {{an alcohol}} lamp, Wöhler heated {{alternating}} layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was made of}} fine particles with a dark metallic luster. The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the electrolysis of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War {{began at}} series creator Ion Storm {{following}} {{the success of}} the original Deus Ex. Most of the original game's development team returned to develop Invisible War, eager to both tell a new story and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked as lead designer for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both Invisible War and other projects within the company. While Smith was tempted to act as both director and designer, he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare as lead designer. Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack of experience as a designer was given the role when more qualified staff members were unavailable.|$|E

5|$|Initially other {{villages in}} the area, chiefly Mattau, Soulang and Bakloan, also professed their desire {{to live in peace}} with the Dutch. The villages <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in their {{interest}} to maintain good relations with the newcomers, but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629. The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of Wancan, not far from Mattau, in 1625. The pirates were able to drive off the Dutch soldiers, causing the Dutch to lose face among the Formosan villages. Encouraged by this Dutch failure, warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan, believing the Dutch too weak to defend their Formosan friends. At this point, the Dutch returned to Wancan and this time were able to rout the pirates, restoring their reputation. Mattau was then forced by the colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs. The peace was short-lived, however, because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan, before going to the Dutch to ask for protection from retribution. Although the Dutch were able to force Sinkan's enemies to back down in this case, in later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{tourism in}} Ireland {{was not a}} new development, {{it was in the}} last quarter of the nineteenth century that a great {{increase}} occurred with large numbers of tourists making the sea crossing from Great Britain to see the delights of Ireland's scenery. The railways <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be to their advantage to encourage tourist development since this would bring them increased traffic. On the BNCR, its manager, Edward John Cotton, especially recognised the potential value of tourism and was influential in its development throughout the North of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Following the Second World War railway {{services}} suffered due to {{skill and}} coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities {{elsewhere in the}} economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Frederick Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He {{turned his attention to}} electrification, mainly because he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.|$|E

According to legend, Cleomenes was hunting when his father sent him a message telling him to return immediately to Sparta. When {{he returned to the}} city, he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was being decorated for a wedding and when he asked his father who was getting married, his father replied that he, Cleomenes, was. It was reported that Cleomenes was doubtful about the marriage because his father had had Agiatis' husband executed. Nevertheless, the marriage went ahead.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{situation}} with Muhammad had been resolved, 'Ali took no action for a while. Eventually he decided to attack the stronghold of Mattuth and marched against it. When he arrived, however, he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had strong fortifications and numerous defenders, {{so he decided to}} make further preparations before assaulting it. He withdrew and began assembling ladders and tools for scaling walls; once this was completed, he ordered his army to again approach the city. As he drew near Mattuth this time, however, he was suddenly attacked by Masrur al-Balkhi, who had learned of 'Ali's plans. The sight of Masrur's cavalry caused 'Ali's men to abandon their equipment and flee, and 'Ali was forced to retreat.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{accident}} Whymper asked Taugwalder to see the rope and to his surprise he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the oldest and weakest of the ropes they brought {{and it was only}} intended as a reserve. All those who had fallen had been tied with a Manila rope, or with a second and equally strong one, and consequently it had been only between the survivors and those who had fallen where the weaker rope had been used. Whymper also had suggested to Hudson that they should have attached a rope to the rocks on the most difficult place, and held it as they descended, as an additional protection. Hudson approved the idea, but it was never done.|$|E

25|$|The Congregation for Clergy {{explained}} that Lennon was given {{sufficient time to}} present information to solidify his decisions to the Dicastery, and to forward all of the acts pertinent in the matter to the Congregation. The absence of any decree from Lennon, indicating and formalizing his dispositions made in his March 12, 2009 letter to the pastor, troubled the judges. The Congregation for Clergy reasoned {{that even if the}} March 12, 2009 letter to the pastor was taken as a manifestation of Lennon's dispositions in the matter, which is the essence of a decree, the Congregation for Clergy clearly <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lacked elements required by the canons. Hence, Lennon was held to have acted in violation of the law on procedural grounds with regard to Canon515§2.|$|E
25|$|Things {{were getting}} serious; {{it would never}} do for Rupert to be {{defeated}} by the inhabitants of Birmingham. Yet there was little chance of carrying the works by a direct attack. Some of Rupert's men <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be possible, by going across the fields, to ride round {{and get into the}} rear of the works, and from there charge the defenders. This was tried and proved successful.The defenders of the works could not stand being attacked front and rear, so abandoned the works and fled into the town. Rupert's troopers followed them. From the houses a desultory fire was kept up on the Royalist troopers as they advanced up the street. On this the troopers set fire to the houses from which they had been fired on, and the town was soon ablaze in several places. Pushing on the resistance became less; those who had fought fled and scattered.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Prussian victory at Königgrätz, Bismarck asked the Parliament {{for more money}} for the army, which raised a new {{controversy}} between the liberal parliamentarians. Frederick welcomed {{the creation of the}} North German Confederation, which joined Prussia and some Germanic principalities, because he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the first step toward German unification. However, the Confederation was far from adopting the liberal ideas of the Crown Prince. Despite being democratically elected, the Reichstag didn't have the same powers as a Parliament. In addition, local sovereigns were more interested in maintaining their prerogatives, and the new German constitution gave many powers to the now Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Less enthusiastic than her husband, Vicky saw the North German Confederation {{as an extension of the}} Prussian political system she hated. Nevertheless, she remained hopeful that this situation was temporary and that a united and liberal Germany could be created.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E
25|$|Various {{nations and}} peoples in history were {{identified}} as Ya'juj and Ma'juj. At one point, it was the Turks, who threatened Baghdad and northern Iran; later, when the Mongols destroyed Baghdad in 1258, it was they who were Gog and Magog. The wall dividing them from civilised peoples was normally placed towards Armenia and Azerbaijan, but in the year 842 the Caliph Al-Wathiq had a dream in which he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been breached, and sent an official named Sallam to investigate. Sallam returned {{a little over two}} years later and reported that he had seen the wall and also the tower where Dhul Qarnayn had left his building equipment, and all was still intact. It is not entirely clear what Sallam saw, but he may have reached the Jade Gate, the westernmost customs point on the border of China. Somewhat later the 14th-century traveller Ibn Battuta reported that the wall was sixty days' travel from the city of Zeitun, which is on the coast of China; the translator notes that Ibn Battuta has confused the Great Wall of China with that built by Dhul-Qarnayn.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the falling men pulled Hudson and Douglas from their holds and dragged them down the north face. The Taugwalders and Whymper were left alive when the rope linking Douglas to the elder Taugwalder broke. They were stunned by the {{accident}} {{and for a time}} could not move until the younger Taugwalder descended to enable them to advance. When they were together Whymper asked to see the broken rope and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been employed by mistake as it was the weakest and oldest of the three ropes they had brought. They frequently looked, but in vain, for traces of their fallen companions. They continued their descent, including an hour in the dark, until 9.30 p.m. when a resting place was found. At daybreak the descent was resumed and the group finally reached Zermatt, where a search of the victims was quickly organized. The bodies of Croz, Hadow and Hudson were found on the Matterhorn Glacier, but the body of Douglas was never found. Although the elder Taugwalder was accused of cutting the rope to save himself and his son, the official inquest found no proof of this.|$|E
