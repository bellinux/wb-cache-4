5|$|Females become <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> {{at the age}} of six {{to seven}} years, while males become <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> at about 10 years old. The {{gestation}} period is around 15–16 months. The calf, which typically weighs , is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the overfishing, the tilefish's age of sexual maturity has been dramatically affected. From 1978 to 1982, {{the median age of}} sexual maturity in males declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> before females. In 2008, the median age of sexual maturity in males had risen to 5.9 years. Females of the species also exhibit low reproductive ability after becoming <b>sexually</b> <b>mature,</b> instead increasing with age and their sexual maturity has varied to a lesser extent then the male population across the years.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are still}} in {{reproductive}} diapause when they colonize the field once crops reach flowering stage and day temperature reach 20°C. They become <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> in a few days, {{as a result of}} both an increased duration of photophase and the ingestion of faba bean pollen and nectar (Tran and Huignard 1993).|$|E
40|$|Random mating has {{generally}} been assumed in many species except for humans. The generality of random mating for biological traits has been assumed in many species except for the body size. However, nonrandom mating has widely been known for non-biological traits such as social status (position), income, educational level, religion, occupation in human populations. For ological traits such as body size, skin color and intelligence quotient (IQ), several researches report the positive assortative mating. There have been almost no studies for other traits. Random mating has been assumed as to the genetic variation such as blood type or isozyme type. However, the positive assortative mating has often been reported for genetic disease. The author presents an vidence for non-random mating for <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> time in a Japanese human population. The age at menarche for wives and the age at the first ejaculation for husband, spermache, were respectively adopted as <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> time in this study. Correlation coefficient in <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> age {{between husband and wife}} was disclosed to be 0. 395. This correlation is statistically ignificant at the 0. 1 ％ level and it is higher than those in morphological traits such as body weight, height and BMI (body mass index) ...|$|R
40|$|Implantation of a cortisol-releasing pellet (60 mg/kg fish) {{into the}} peritoneal cavity of brown trout, Salmo trutta L. (<b>sexually</b> <b>maturing</b> males and females), and rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri Richardson (maturing males and {{immature}} fish of both sexes), significantly elevated their plasma cortisol level. At 18 days postimplantation, cortisol-implanted <b>sexually</b> <b>maturing</b> male brown trout had smaller gonads, a lower plasma testosterone level, and less gonadotropin in their pituitary gland than control fish. Plasma levels of 11 -ketotestosterone and gonadotropin {{were not significantly}} affected. Cortisol-implanted <b>sexually</b> <b>maturing</b> female brown trout had smaller gonads, reduced plasma levels of 17 β-oestradiol, testosterone, and vitellogenin, and a lower pituitary gland gonadotropin content than control fish. The plasma gonadotropin level was unaffected. At 36 days post-implantation, cortisol treatment of maturing male rainbow trout significantly suppressed plasma gonadotropin levels. Plasma levels of testosterone, 11 -ketotestosterone, and 17 α, 20 β-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one, pituitary gonadotropin content, and gonad size were not significantly affected. In sexually immature female rainbow trout, cortisol administration suppressed the level of vitellogenin in the plasma, compared to control-implanted fish. The 17 β-oestradiol level was not affected. Cortisol implantation {{did not affect the}} plasma testosterone level in sexually immature male trout. These results suggest that prolonged elevation of plasma cortisol, to levels well within physiological range, can affect a wide range of reproductive parameters in both brown and rainbow trout. Further, some effects are manifest in immature as well as in mature fish. These findings are discussed in relation to the effects of cortisol treatment on the state of health of the treated fish...|$|R
5|$|Pinnipeds have lifespans {{averaging}} 25–30 years. Females usually live longer, as males tend {{to fight}} and often die before reaching maturity. The longest recorded lifespans include 43 years for a wild female ringed seal and 46 years for a wild female grey seal. The age at which a pinniped <b>sexually</b> <b>matures</b> can vary from 2–12 years depending on the species. Females typically mature earlier than males.|$|R
5|$|Males become <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> at 18 years. Upon {{reaching}} sexual maturity, males move {{to higher}} latitudes, {{where the water}} is colder and feeding is more productive. Females remain at lower latitudes. Males reach their full size at about age 50.|$|E
5|$|North American river otters are polygynous. Females {{usually do}} not {{reproduce}} until two years of age, although yearlings produce offspring on occasion. Males are <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> at two years of age. The number of corpora lutea increases directly with age.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these pupae emerge fully formed, <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> adult beetles, or imagos. Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the {{appendages}} are not {{attached to the}} body and {{are said to be}} exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with the body (termed as obtect pupae).|$|E
50|$|Adults {{spend some}} of their life in the open sea, living as a {{parasite}} on other fish. They attach themselves to the gills or side of the fish and rasp at the tissues below. Adults return to fresh water to breed, spending up to eighteen months <b>sexually</b> <b>maturing</b> before spawning. Adults have been recorded living up to 105 days after spawning and wrapping themselves around egg masses to provide parental care.|$|R
50|$|While wild catches {{have been}} {{generally}} declining, the Siberian sturgeon is increasingly farmed both for meat and to produce caviar from its roe. Because the Lena population of A. baerii completes its lifecycle in fresh water and <b>sexually</b> <b>matures</b> relatively early, {{it is the}} most common original broodstock for captive-bred specimens. The main producer of Siberian sturgeon caviar is France, while the largest meat producers are Russia and China.|$|R
40|$|Identification of an {{individual}} seahorse is important for captive breeding and conservation studies. A simple and cost-effective tagging method was devised to suit the rigid body structure and small fins of Hippocampus kuda. The first generation <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> individuals (452 numbers) were tagged using plastic strips tied around the neck. No significant differences (P > 0. 05) in growth between the tagged and untagged groups were noted. All the tags persisted for one year without any perceptible changes in sexual and social behaviour...|$|R
5|$|Female California spiny {{lobsters}} reach sexual maturity at {{a length of}} , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; males are <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, {{the life span of}} mature {{spiny lobsters}} is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|E
5|$|Females are <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> at two {{to three}} years of age and males at about two years. Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year, but it peaks during winter and early spring. In the northern Sahara, breeding peaks at the end of winter and beginning of spring; in the southern Sahara, breeding peaks from September to October and from January to mid-April. Each estrus bout lasts for one or two days.|$|E
5|$|Males’ sexual {{maturation}} is triggered by an increased proportion {{of light in}} the photoperiod, such that they are <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> when they colonize the field when the crop reaches leaf development. More specifically, a day length of 16h is required for the weevils to terminate their reproductive diapause. An optimal day length of 18h is found to induce diapause termination.|$|E
5000|$|Since some female {{students}} of the Royal School such as Abigail Maheha were expelled with hastily arranged marriages, due to scandalous pregnancies, [...] some speculate that the 16-year-old Kamehameha V {{or any of the}} other <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> male students at the school might have had a child, including his brothers, Moses Kekūāiwa (aged 18) and Alexander Liholiho (aged 12.5), and Lunalilo (aged 12), if the last two had a very early puberty. Thus he might have some descendants alive today.|$|R
50|$|It shows a one-host lifecycle, {{where all}} larva, nymphs and adults lives in one host. After eggs hatched, larva crawl in {{vegetation}} and blown away with wind. After stick on to a host, larva found in softer {{parts of the}} body and then becomes nymph and then to adult after two molts. After <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> and mating, female detaches from the host and lay eggs on vegetation. Female dies after ovipositing. Adult has a hexagonal shaped scutum. Male has adanal shields and accessory shields. Anal groove is absent in female, but minute in male.|$|R
50|$|For example, the {{critical}} {{period for the}} development of a human child's binocular vision is thought to be between three and eight months, with sensitivity to damage extending up to at least three years of age. Further critical periods have been identified {{for the development of}} hearing and the vestibular system. There are critical periods during early postnatal development in which imprinting can occur, such as when a greylag goose becomes attached to a parent figure within the first 36 hours after hatching. A young chaffinch must hear an adult singing before it <b>sexually</b> <b>matures,</b> or it never properly learns the highly intricate song.|$|R
5|$|Play {{behaviour}} in calves differs {{between the}} sexes; females run or chase {{each other while}} males play-fight. The former are <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> {{by the age of}} nine years while the latter become mature around 14–15 years. Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes. Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age. Lin Wang, a captive male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years.|$|E
5|$|The convict cichlid {{can reach}} sexual {{maturity}} {{as young as}} 16 weeks, though sexual maturity more commonly occurs at 6 months. <b>Sexually</b> <b>mature</b> convicts form monogamous pairs and spawn in small caves or crevices. In the wild, the fish excavate caves by moving earth from underneath large stones. Females adhere eggs to {{the walls of the}} cave.|$|E
5|$|Female okapis become <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> {{at about}} one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the prevalence and sexual behavioural dynamics of HIV infection in students of {{institutions of higher}} education (IHEs) as a guide to the design of a tailor-made HIV intervention programmes. Methods: A total of 9 709 <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> students from five IHEs in Southeast Nigeria aged 1 9 - 24 years were recruited to obtain representative data from the institutionalised student population. HIV status was confirmed using enzyme based immuno-assay technique. Demographic and behavioural information were obtained through a structured questionnaire. Association of HIV infection with behavioural risk factors was done using multiple logistics regression model. Results: IHEs in Southeast Nigeria have a higher HIV prevalence of 3. 69...|$|R
40|$|European eel is a {{catadromous}} fish species, {{which means}} that after living in freshwater premature individuals adapt to sea water, and migrate to the Sargasso Sea for spawning. Although male eel can be <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> even in freshwater, to date, {{it was believed that}} female eel can be matured only in seawater. Here we show that the process of sexual maturation may be induced in freshwater by treating female eels with carp pituitary (GSI = 9. 87 ± 1. 55 %). It is thus proposed that seawater condition is not an obligatory environment for stimulating gametogenesis and for artificial maturation of the European eel in neither gender...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} taken up {{with a view to}} train the yak bulls for {{donating}} semen in artificial vagina in the purpose of artificial insemination and conservation of male yak germplasm. A total of six <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> bulls were trained. Two methods have been tried viz. artificial vagina (AV) and electro-ejaculation methods. Electro-ejaculation was proved ineffective but semen was successfully collected by AV technique. Semen thus collected was milky white in color and in a volume of 2 - 4. 5 mL. The concentration of spermatozoa was 150 - 200 × 106 /mL and the pH of semen was 6. 3 - 6. 6...|$|R
5|$|In captivity, females become <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> at {{two months}} of age. The ovarian {{follicle}} forms about 16 days prior {{to the birth of}} the offspring. After mating, female hamsters typically have larger uteri, ovaries, and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone, with other females or those that have not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these females have a shorter gestation period, around four to five days.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to superficially distinguish between male and female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|The length time {{in which}} {{offspring}} stay with their mother varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or {{as long as a}} year. Females become <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} an average-sized oceanic dolphin. Females weigh up to 150 kg and males 200 kg with males {{reaching}} 2.5 m and females 2.3 m in length. Pacific white-sided dolphins usually {{tend to be}} larger than dusky dolphins. Females reach maturity at seven years. From 1990 to 1991, {{a study conducted by}} Richard C. Ferrero and William A. Walker revealed the vast majority of Pacific white-sided dolphins that fell victim to the drift nets were between the ages of 8.3 to 11 when they <b>sexually</b> <b>matured.</b> The gestation period usually last for one year. Individuals are believed to live up 40 years or more.|$|R

50|$|During their ocean phase, {{coho salmon}} have silver sides and dark-blue backs. During their {{spawning}} phase, their jaws and teeth become hooked. After entering fresh water, they develop bright-red sides, bluish-green heads and backs, dark bellies and dark spots on their backs. <b>Sexually</b> <b>maturing</b> fish develop a light-pink or rose shading along the belly, and the males may show a slight arching of the back. Mature adults have a pronounced red skin color with darker backs and average 28 in and 7 to 11 lb, occasionally reaching up to 36 lb. They also develop a large kype (hooked beak) during spawning. Mature females may be darker than males, with both showing a pronounced hook on the nose.|$|R
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> at {{one to three}} years of age, but in healthy populations they breed after {{two to three years}} of age. A pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives. The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} is <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> at age 4–5 years, with the Mediterranean {{subspecies}} typically breeding {{a year earlier}} than the Atlantic form. Breeding happens in colonies and normally begins in late May or June. Pairs have a repeated nocturnal display flight in which the male chases the female, the chase being accompanied by flight calls. Some near-adult birds may pair up and occupy a hole at the same time, prior to breeding in the following year.|$|E
5|$|Typically nocturnal (active at night), {{the royal}} {{antelope}} exhibits remarkable alertness. Territories are marked with dung. A herbivore, the royal antelope prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Like other neotragines, the royal antelope is monogamous. Both sexes can become <b>sexually</b> <b>mature</b> by as early as six months. Births {{have been reported in}} November and December. A single, delicate young is born after an unknown gestational period.|$|E
50|$|Protandrous hermaphrodites {{refer to}} organisms that are born male {{and at some}} point in their {{lifespan}} change sex to female. Protandrous animals include clownfish. Clownfish have a very structured society. In the Amphiprion percula species, there are zero to four individuals excluded from breeding and a breeding pair living in a sea anemone. Dominance is based on size, the female being the largest and the male being the second largest. The rest of the group is made up of progressively smaller non-breeders, which have no functioning gonads. If the female dies, the male gains weight and becomes the female for that group. The largest non-breeding fish then <b>sexually</b> <b>matures</b> and becomes the male of the group.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{statistically}} significant association between sex and seroprevalence of brucellosis was observed. Almost all (94.7  %) of the seropositive animals were females. This result was in agreement with earlier studies in Ethiopia where absence of male seroreactors was reported (Berhe et al. 2007; Tolosa 2004). The present study also showed the presence of statistically significant associations between age and seropositivity of brucellosis. This finding {{was supported by a}} previous report from Ethiopia (Asmare et al. 2010). Growth stimulating factors for Brucella organisms become abundant when the animal becomes <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> (Radostits et al. 2007). Besides, higher prevalence of brucellosis in older cattle {{can be attributed to the}} constant exposure of the cattle over time to the agent.|$|R
30|$|Artificial {{breeding}} {{was carried}} out using Ovaprim® (Syndel, Canada) following standard protocols (Legendre et al. 1992; Váradi et al. 1999; Olaniyi and Omitogun 2013) with modifications (Olaniyi, 2013). Both sexes of H. bidorsalis were given a single dose of 1.0  ml/kg of the hormone. Induction {{was carried out}} at 27 [*]±[*] 0.5 °C on three <b>sexually</b> <b>matured</b> females and four males broodstock. After the latency period, eggs and sperm {{were obtained from the}} female and male broodstock respectively. The “wet” method of fertilization was employed whereby eggs were fertilized with diluted sperm with physiological saline solution (0.9 % NaCl) (Olaniyi, 2013). Fertilized eggs were set in triplicate and incubations were carried out at a controlled temperature of 28.5 [*]±[*] 0.5 °C.|$|R
