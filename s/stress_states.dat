The experimental results revealed that {{the effect of}} <b>stress</b> <b>state</b> GB-II on the modulus and damping ratio was more significant and obvious than <b>stress</b> <b>state</b> GB-I. The effect of the anisotropic <b>stress</b> <b>state</b> was explained through the impact of confining pressure and anisotropic stress components on the stiffness and damping ratio.

The analysis of results revealed that reference shear strain was also affected by anisotropic <b>stress</b> <b>state.</b> Therefore, an empirical relationship was developed to predict the reference shear strain, as a function of confining pressure and anisotropic stress components.
