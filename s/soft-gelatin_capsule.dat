40|$|AbstractThe present {{investigation}} was aimed {{to establish a}} validated stability-indicating liquid chromatographic method for the estimation of etoposide (ETP) in bulk drug and self-nano emulsifying formulation. ETP was successfully separated from the degradation products formed under stress conditions on LiChrospher 100 C 18 reverse-phase column (a 250 mm× 4. 6 mm i. d., 5 -μm particle size) using 55 : 45 (v/v) acetonitrile–phosphate buffer saline (pH 4. 5) as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1. 0 mLmin− 1 and detection at 283 nm. The response was a linear function of analyte concentration (R 2 > 0. 9997) over the concentration range of 0. 05 – 50 μgmL− 1. The method was validated for precision, accuracy, robustness, sensitivity and specificity. The % recovery of ETP at three different levels (50 %, 100 % and 150 %) ranged between 93. 84 % and 100. 06 % in optimized self-nano emulsifying formulation, Etosid® <b>soft-gelatin</b> <b>capsule</b> and Fytosid® injection. First-order degradation kinetics of ETP were observed under acidic and alkaline conditions. The method was also applied for the stability assessment of self-nano emulsifying formulation under accelerated conditions, the formulation {{was found to be}} stable at all storage conditions with the shelf-life of 2. 37 years at 25 °C. The method holds promise for routine quality control of ETP in bulk, pharmaceutical formulations as well as in stability-indicating studies...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study {{the effect of the}} sex and the smoking status on the {{pharmacokinetics}} and the bioequivalence assessment of a branded and a generic cyclosporine A microemulsion formulation in <b>soft-gelatin</b> <b>capsule.</b> Sixteen healthy volunteers (eight women and eight men) participated in a CyA bioequivalence study, with nine of the volunteers being smokers. Sandimmun Neoral® (brand formulation; Reference) and Sigmasporin Microral® (generic formulation; Test) were administered under fasting conditions. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated through non compartmental analysis. Bioequivalence was declared based on the 90 % confidence intervals (90 % CI) for the T/R ratio of the geometric means for each parameter. In vitro determination of the capsules opening time was performed in simulated gastric fluid without enzyme with USP Apparatus 2. The extent of absorption was similar between both products for all subjects or each sex-group. The absorption rate was similar for both products when considering all subjects, whereas {{a significant difference in the}} T between the two products was observed for the male subjects only, which relates to its slower capsule opening time observed in vitro (12. 4 versus 6. 0 min). No differences were observed in women that could relate to their slower gastric emptying. Differences in drug exposure were observed between smokers and non-smokers. Sex- and smoke-related differences in the gastrointestinal transit should be considered when the on-set time would be determinant for the treatment success of a drug...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the pharmacokinetics of once-daily saquinavir (SQV) hard-gelatin capsule (HGC) /ritonavir (RTV), 1600 / 100 mg, compared with once-daily SQV <b>soft-gelatin</b> <b>capsule</b> (SGC) /RTV, 1600 / 100 mg. METHODS: We evaluated 13 randomly selected HIV- 1 -infected subjects taking once-daily SQV SGC/RTV, 1600 / 100 mg, plus dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in this pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy. Subjects took 1 week of SQV HGC/RTV and NRTIs, followed by steady-state SQV PK determinations. Subjects then changed to SQV SGC/RTV and NRTIs for 1 week, followed again by steady-state SQV PK determinations. Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), maximum concentration (C(max)), minimum concentration (C(min)), time to C(max), and elimination half-life were calculated. RESULTS: There {{was no significant}} difference in AUC values between HGCs and SGCs, with a median (plus interquartile range [IQR]) of 50. 0 (42. 6 - 71. 5) versus 35. 5 (28. 0 - 50. 2) mg/L/h, respectively (=. 056). Intersubject variability resulted in 4 of 13 subjects on the SQV SGCs and 2 of 13 subjects on the SQV HGCs having a C(min) below the minimum effective concentration of 0. 05 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Once-daily SQV HGCs, 1600 mg, boosted with once-daily RTV, 100 mg, resulted in PK parameters that were similar to those observed with 1600 mg of SQV SGC/ 100 mg RTV once daily. Once-daily SQV HGC/RTV, 1600 / 100 mg, may be easier to use in developing countries and may increase access where drug costs can be less, the capsule size is smaller, and the need for refrigeration is lessene...|$|E

40|$|Lopinavir (LPV) is an HIV {{protease}} inhibitor (PI) that is co-formulated with ritonavir (r), an inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 - 3 A. In adults, LPV/r is dosed at 400 / 100 mg BID or 800 / 200 mg QD. LPV/r has demonstrated {{safety and efficacy}} in numerous clinical trials and patient categories. 1, 2, 3, 4 In the developed world, LPV/r is a recommended option for initial therapy in antiretroviral-naïve patients. 5 In resource-constrained settings, LPV/r is recommended as a second-line agent for patients failing an initial regimen of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (typically stavudine plus lamivudine). 6 The recently introduced LPV/r tablet does not require refrigeration, can be dosed with or without food, has less pharmacokinetic variability, and requires fewer pills (4 tablets per day) than the <b>soft-gelatin</b> <b>capsule</b> formulation (6 capsules per day), key properties which are expected to increase patient access to effective {{protease inhibitor}}-based antiretroviral therapy in developing countries. Early pivotal trials of LPV/r used stavudine (d 4 T) in the nucleoside backbone, 1, 3, 7 consistent with then-current standards of care. Recent studies have used zidovudine (ZDV) or tenofovir (TDF) instead of d 4 T. 2, 8, 9 Since ZDV and TDF have demonstrated improved tolerability and less impact on lipids and body fat composition (BFC) than d 4 T, 10 - 14 we compared the safety and tolerability of LPV/r when used in combination with d 4 T vs. non-d 4 T-containing regimens in antiretroviral-naïve subjects...|$|E
