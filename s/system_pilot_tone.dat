We develop an upper bound on the probability of bit error, including all the participating interference. In addition, various techniques such as sectoring and forward error correction in the terms of convolutional encoding are applied to optimize the performance. We further improve the performance by applying a narrow bandpass filter in the <b>pilot</b> <b>tone</b> branch of the demodulator.

30|$|The {{sampling}} frequency offset estimation {{has been investigated}} in many papers too. Since sampling period offset causes subcarrier phase rotation, some algorithms, like those introduced in [7, 8], estimate the phase change between the subcarriers of the OFDM symbol or between the same subcarriers of succeeding OFDM symbols (see the method described in [9]). A noncoherent solution, that is, without carrier phase estimates, was proposed in [10]. The drawback of that algorithm is its sensitivity to symbol timing synchronisation errors. Like the schemes shown in [7, 8], it requires <b>pilot</b> <b>tones</b> transmitted in every OFDM symbol, as it {{is done in the}} DVB-T system. Thus, such algorithms are not suitable for <b>systems</b> with <b>pilot</b> <b>tones</b> separated in time by data symbols, as it {{can be found in the}} WINNER system. The algorithm described in [9] is driven by data hard decisions made by the receiver, and it estimates and tracks the residual carrier frequency offset as well.
