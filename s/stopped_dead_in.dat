5|$|Aaron Ward and Sterett, {{independently}} {{searching for}} targets, both sighted Yūdachi, who appeared {{unaware of the}} approach of the two U.S. destroyers. Both U.S.ships hit Yūdachi simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, heavily damaging the destroyer and forcing her crew to abandon ship. The ship did not sink right away, however. Continuing on her way, Sterett was suddenly ambushed by Teruzuki, heavily damaged, and forced to withdraw from the battle area to the east. Aaron Ward wound up in a one-on-one duel with Kirishima, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage. She also tried to retire from the battle area to the east but soon <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the water because the engines were damaged.|$|E
5|$|The only success the British {{managed to}} achieve was to damage both the Gneisenau and Scharnhorst (the latter seriously). Scharnhorst hit two mines, one at 14:31 GMT, and a further one at 21:34 GMT. Gneisenau also struck a mine at 18:55 GMT. Both ships {{recovered}} and steamed on. Scharnhost had been <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> {{the water with}} engine damage after the first hit. The failure to alert Bomber Command earlier meant a chance was missed to deliver an attack on Scharnhorst when it was most vulnerable. The second and third mine hits came after nightfall, which enabled both vessels to avoid further attacks. The last RAF sighting of the ships had occurred at 18:00 GMT.|$|E
5|$|The {{revival of}} ramming had a {{significant}} effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the water.|$|E

50|$|While {{the ship}} {{recovered}} from the damage inflicted by the dive-bombing attack, her speed dropped to 6 kn; and then at 14:40, about 20 minutes after the bomb hit that had shut down most of the boilers, Yorktown slowed to a <b>stop,</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the water.|$|R

5|$|Perhaps {{because it}} was the lead cruiser in the U.S. formation, Atlanta was the target of fire and torpedoes from several Japanese ships—probably {{including}} Nagara, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi—in addition to Akatsuki. The gunfire caused heavy damage to Atlanta, and a type 93 torpedo strike cut all of her engineering power. The disabled cruiser drifted into the line of fire of SanFrancisco, which accidentally fired on her, causing even greater damage. Admiral Scott and many of the bridge crew were killed. Without power and unable to fire her guns, Atlanta drifted out of control and out of the battle as the Japanese ships passed her by. The lead U.S. destroyer, Cushing, was also caught in a crossfire between several Japanese destroyers and perhaps Nagara. She too was hit heavily and <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the water.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Miami, the {{shakedown}} inspectors gave {{the ship and}} crew a rough going over for several days. However, the crew was jubilant when the ship received a glowing report. Leaving soon after on its first independent cruise, at about 10:35am the ship encountered engine trouble and was <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the water far from land. After some delay, a naval tug returned the ship to post after midnight.|$|E
25|$|According to her survivors, {{the first}} torpedo struck just aft {{of the bridge}} and caused major damage. Apparently, it {{exploded}} the ship's magazine; the resulting blast sheared off everything forward of the point of impact, destroying completely the bridge, the chart room, and the officers' and petty officers' quarters. As she <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the water, unable to signal a distress message, a second torpedo struck about 40 feet forward of the fantail and carried away the after part of the ship above the keel plates and shafts and destroyed the after crew's quarters. Only the midships section was left intact.|$|E

5000|$|At 12:46, a torpedo hit Yahagi {{directly}} in her engine room, killing the entire engineering room crew and bringing {{her to a}} complete <b>stop.</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>in</b> the water, Yahagi was hit by at least six more torpedoes and 12 bombs by succeeding waves of air attacks.

500|$|Shortly thereafter, {{the fires}} {{broke through the}} flight deck and heat and smoke made the ship's bridge unusable. At 10:46, Admiral Nagumo {{transferred}} his flag to the light cruiser [...] Akagi <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the water at 13:50 and her crew, except for Captain Taijiro Aoki and damage-control personnel, was evacuated.

500|$|At 14:05, Yamato was <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> {{the water}} and began to capsize. Admiral Itō and Captain Aruga refused to abandon her {{with the rest of}} the survivors.

[...] At 14:23, she suddenly blew up with an explosion so large that it was reportedly heard and seen [...] away in Kagoshima and sent up a mushroom-shaped cloud almost [...] into the air. Japanese survivor Yoshida Mitsuru said that her large explosion downed several U.S. planes observing her end. The explosion is believed to have occurred when the fires ignited by bomb hits reached the main magazines.|$|E
2500|$|Morning strikes were {{likewise}} launched against shipping {{targets in}} the lagoon. Lieutenant Commander (later Rear Admiral) James D. Ramage, commanding officer of Dive Bombing Squadron 10 (VB-10), is credited with sinking the previously damaged merchant tanker Hoyo Maru. Lieutenant James E. Bridges and his crew in one of Intrepids Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6) Avengers scored a direct hit on the ammunition ship Aikoku Maru. The bomb blast set off a tremendous explosion which immediately sank the ship and apparently engulfed the plane as well, killing all three men inside.By {{the second and third}} anti-shipping strikes of the day, carrier air group action reports listed the apparent enemy mission as [...] "escape." [...] Those ships able to make for open sea steamed for the North Pass exit from the lagoon while weathering repeated aerial attacks. One particular group of warships – [...] cruiser Katori, auxillary cruiser Akagi Maru, destroyers Maikaze, Nowaki and minesweeper Shonan Maru – was given special attention by carrier bombers. Multiple air groups attacked these ships, inflicting serious damage. Yorktowns dive and torpedo bombing squadrons together claimed 2 hits on Katori as well as hits on another cruiser and multiple destroyers; Essex bombers claimed as many as 5 hits on a Katori-class cruiser as well, indicating that the ship was <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the water after the attack.|$|E

25|$|However, as speeds rise, the {{resultant}} exhaust speed goes down, {{and the overall}} vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly {{at the same speed}} that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally <b>stop</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle.

2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I could tell it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it <b>stopped</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough for me to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E

50|$|The four-toed {{salamander}} has three main forms of self-defense against predators. The {{first is that}} it purposely sheds off its tail to distract the enemy. When the tail comes of, it is still wiggling around. The enemy gets distracted giving the salamander time to get away. The second form of defense is playing dead. When threatened, this salamander will have a short burst of violent trashes and then <b>stop</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> its tracks. It will stay frozen like this until it feels the threat is gone (Sass and Anderson, 2011). The third and final form of defense is it will curl up and put its tail on its back offering it in exchange for its life.|$|R

His league début was the following week on 22 October 1898; a 3-2 victory at Rochdale Hornets. He went on to be Warrington's leading try scorer that season' and for the following six seasons, becoming the club's first superstar. Fish was a stockily built man, at only 5 ft and 11 st.

6000|$|Throwing on a cloak {{she walked}} out into the moonlit garden, and went slowly down the whitened road toward the station. A magical, dewless night! The moonbeams had stolen in to the beech clump, {{frosting}} the boles and boughs, casting a fine ghostly grey over the shadow-patterned beech-mast. Gyp took the short cut through it. Not a leaf moved in there, no living thing stirred; so might an earth be where only trees inhabited! She thought: 'I'll bring him back through here.' And she waited at {{the far corner of the}} clump, where he must pass, some little distance from the station.

The destroyer fired a spread of torpedoes at a ship 3000 yd away and was rewarded with black smoke pouring from the target. As Spence retired to rendezvous with DesDiv 45, she spotted another Japanese force 4000 yd away. She opened fire, was [...] "on target," [...] and watched one ship <b>stop</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the water and burn fiercely.
