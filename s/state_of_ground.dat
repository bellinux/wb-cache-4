The neurons of animals irradiated in the state of awakeness are less radioresistant and recover more slowly than neurons of animals irradiated in torpor, with the difference being more distinct in neurons of the CA 1 field. The effect of irradiation is weak in animals entering torpor and reaches a peak in awakening animals.

30|$|The study {{suggests}} a robust decision-making tool for drinking water quality {{management in the}} form of the fuzzy water quality index (FWQI). The developed methodology demonstrates to determine a single index value to make assessment of drinking water quality more understandable especially in public consideration. This new index is believed to assist decision makers in reporting the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> water quality for drinking purposes. It has been demonstrated that computing with linguistic terms within fuzzy inference system (FIS) improves the tolerance for imprecise data. The model is developed for water quality assessment with artificial dataset considered eleven water quality (Alkalinity, Hardness, pH, Dissolved Solids, Ca, Mg, As, Fluoride, Sulphate, Nitrate and Iron) parameters. The authors believe that the fuzzy logic concepts, if used logically, could be an effective tool for drinking water policy issues. The fuzzy model developed is applicable only for specific number of water quality parameters in specified range selected.|$|E

The SO(6) representation of eigenstates and a transitional Hamiltonian in the Interacting Boson Model are used to consider the evolution from prolate to oblate shapes for systems with total boson number N = 9 - 12. Parameter free (up to overall scale factors) predictions for energy spectra and quadrupole transition rates {{are found to be}} in good agreement with experimental counterparts. The results for the control parameter of transitional Hamiltonian offer a combination of spherical and deformed shapes in these Hg isotopes and also more deviation from SO(6) limit is observed when the quadrupole deformation is decreased.

40|$|Statement of the problem. The {{calculation}} of core structures should consider as many prominent features of ground {{as possible and}} the technology factors affecting the stress-strain state of the base.

Results. The stress-strain <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> is described using a modified Cam-Clay model along with the model of filtration consolidation by Florin Biot and the Duvaut-Lions viscoplastic model.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a {{two-level}} atom, being initially in general superposition <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> and excited energy levels with mutually different momentum distributions there, gets a large scale evolution in the energy levels momentum distribution. As a consequence the mean momentum of each individual energy level also gets large scale changes, more than the own momentum hbar k of the photon. Because of not completeness of the literature under the hand, we are not sure that this simple phenomenon isn't known in quantum theory of atom-photon interactions or, particularly, in the interferometry of atomic matter waves. One of main {{purposes of this article}} is our request to the leading specialists to respond and if the phenomenon is known, send the corresponding references. Thoroughly is discussed the special case, when the atom's preliminary superposition state is created as a result of interaction of the atom with the resonant standing wave. Also it is pointed that in such conditions the mentioned phenomenon can be presented as a transformation of the resonant Kapitza-Dirac splitting of atomic states into the Stern-Gerlach type splitting.

FIDO provides a system state summary (a configurable engineering summary) and documentation for diagnosis of a potentially failing component that might have caused a given error message or anomaly. FIDO also enables high-level browsing of documentation by use of an interface indexed to the particular error message. The collection of available documents includes information on operations and associated procedures, engineering problem reports, documentation of components, and engineering drawings.

40|$|Dust storms have a {{great many}} {{environmental}} implications in the world's dry lands where they are particularly common. Four main classes of dust event are identified and defined: dust storms, dust haze, blowing dust and dust devils. The geography of dust storms is analysed in each of eight major world regions: Africa, the Middle East, South-west Asia, Europe and the USSR, China, Australia, North America and Latin America. Terrestrially observed meteorological data and data from remote sensing platforms are employed to identify the major source areas in each region, their seasonality, diurnal patterns of activity and trajectories of long-range transport. Among the important controls on the frequency distribution of dust storm activity are the meteorological conditions that generate dust-raising winds, {{and a number of}} meteorological systems commonly cause dust storms in all global regions. These include low pressure fronts with intense baroclinal gradients, pressure gradient winds between moving or stationary air masses, katabatic winds and convectional cells. The nature of the surface upon which deflation occurs is also important; typical dust-producing geomorpholological units include alluvial spreads, lacustrine deposits, desert depressions, loess deposits and reactivated fossil dunes. Dust storm activity is prone to considerable variation. The seasonal characteristics are explicable with reference to the meteorological systems generating dust, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> cover, particularly vegetation, and the effects of seasonal rainfall. Substantial variations also occur from year to year, and land use and climatic variations can substantially affect their occurrence. </p...|$|E

Then, we investigated the kinetic cause of the outcome in a 1 -on- 1 dribble in terms of the preparatory states according to our previous study. The results demonstrated that in successful defensive motions in the non-weighted state guarding trial, the times required for the generation of hip abduction and three extension torques for the hip, knee, and ankle joints were significantly shortened compared with the choice-reaction sidestep, and hip abduction and hip extension torques were produced almost simultaneously. The sport-specific movement kinetics emerges only in a more-realistic interactive experimental setting. A comparison of the outcomes in the 1 -on- 1 dribble and preparatory GRF states showed that, in the non-weighted state, the defenders guarded successfully in 68. 0 % of the trials, and the defender's initiation time was earlier than that in the weighted state (39. 1 %). In terms of kinetics, the root mean squares of the derivative of hip abduction and three extension torques in the non-weighted state were smaller than those in the weighted state, irrespective of the outcome. These results indicate that the preparatory body state as explained by short-term joint torque fluctuations before the defensive step would help explain the performance in competitive sports, and will give insights into understanding human adaptive behavior in unpredicted and uncontrolled environments...|$|E
