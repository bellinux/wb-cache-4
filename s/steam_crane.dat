5|$|Tilbury {{continued}} {{to function as}} a mobilisation store and, after the outbreak of the First World War, it was used to house up to 300 transit soldiers and to supply the new army camps established at Purfleet and Belhus Mansion. It was initially manned by the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers until 1916, and by various reserve units {{for the rest of the}} war. The fort itself was used to store munitions while a depot for remounts was built just to the west; a pontoon bridge was built across the Thames for troop movements, guarded by the fort's guns. Until 1917, also used to house the headquarters of several infantry battalions. Electric lighting was installed, and a narrow-gauge railway and a <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> on the quay were added to help to move material in and out of the fort. After the Zeppelin raids of June 1915, anti-aircraft guns and searchlights mounted at the fort and they played a role in the shooting down of the German Navy Zeppelin, L15, although it is disputed as to which site in the area fired the shell that brought down the airship.|$|E
25|$|The only {{surviving}} Fairbairn <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> is in Bristol, on the quayside at Princes Wharf. It is in {{the care}} of M Shed.|$|E
25|$|With {{the gradual}} {{closure of the}} City Docks, in 1973 the crane was passed to Bristol City Museum. In 1976 it was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument, as the last {{surviving}} Fairbairn <b>steam</b> <b>crane.</b> From 1988, it was restored to operational condition {{as part of the}} Bristol Industrial Museum. The crane operates on special museum days, such as bank holidays and the Harbour Festival.|$|E

25|$|The railway owns three {{rail mounted}} cranes: a 10T Grafton <b>steam</b> P-Way <b>crane,</b> a 15T Taylor Hubbard diesel P-Way Crane and an ex LMS 45T <b>steam</b> {{breakdown}} <b>crane.</b> In addition, the affiliated Bahamas Locomotive Society owns a <b>steam</b> breakdown <b>crane,</b> based at Ingrow. Currently the 15T Taylor Hubbard crane and the 10T Grafton <b>steam</b> P-Way <b>crane</b> are in traffic, the latter now in apple green. Furthermore, {{there are a}} variety of wagons used by the civil engineering department, largely at either Oakworth or Ingrow West.|$|R
50|$|Quarrying {{was carried}} out between 1830 and 1870 using hand held tools and <b>steam</b> <b>cranes</b> with the stone being used in local {{buildings}} including St Paul's Church in Helsby.|$|R
25|$|In 1892, {{hydraulic}} machinery, including cranes, {{appeared in}} the docks. These used a powerful central power supply and could transfer cargoes more quickly. In 1906 electric cranes appeared too. The <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> was required less and less often; {{for a whole year}} between April 1905 and April 1906 the crane went unused. From 1903 to 1909 it made a total of 143 lifts. It remained useful for heavy loads, however.|$|E
25|$|The {{centrifugal}} governor, {{which was}} invented by Christian Huygens in the seventeenth century, was used to adjust the gap between millstones. Another centrifugal governor was used by a Mr. Bunce of England in 1784 {{as part of a}} model <b>steam</b> <b>crane.</b> The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt’s partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, a more {{powerful}} <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> was ordered, {{to be capable of}} lifting 35tons and loading it directly onto a railway wagon. This was ordered from local makers Stothert & Pitt in 1875, although to the Fairbairn pattern. As for the later Fairbairn cranes, the original cell plate was changed to a design of a single flat plate stiffened by riveted T section ribs, rather than the original cellular structure. In August 1878 the crane had been completed and tested, at a cost of £3,600 for the machinery, plus the masonry foundations.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{bringing}} {{materials in}} by train via Goodmayes, gravel and aggregate {{were brought in}} to the jetty; this was 500 feet long and capable of handling seven barges; there were four <b>steam</b> <b>cranes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{cross-tube}} boiler was {{the most}} common form of small vertical boiler. They were widely used, in the age of steam, as a small donkey boiler, for the independent power of winches, <b>steam</b> <b>cranes</b> etc.|$|R
2500|$|Cranes are {{an ancient}} {{technology}} but they became widespread following the Industrial Revolution. [...] Industrial cranes {{were used to}} handle heavy machinery at the Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company (Bridgewater foundry) in the late 1830s. Hydraulic powered cranes became widely used in the late 19th century, especially at British ports. [...] Some cities, such as London, had public utility hydraulic service networks to power. [...] <b>Steam</b> <b>cranes</b> were also used in the late 19th century. Electric cranes, especially the overhead type, were introduce in factories {{at the end of}} the 19th century. [...] <b>Steam</b> <b>cranes</b> were usually restricted to rails. [...] Continuous track (caterpillar tread) was developed in the late 19th century.|$|R
25|$|The water {{station was}} moved to the depot in 1863. Later a house {{adjacent}} to the station building was converted into a railway hotel. The docks received <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> in 1864, followed by an extension three years later and a new crane in 1875. The traffic at Hamar increased little until 1880. Later known as the Røros Line, the railway was extended further up Østerdalen, eventually being connected with Trondheim in 1877. The main challenge was the inevitable break-of-gauge which would have to take place, as the Trunk Line had been built with standard gauge. The remaining link, the Eidsvoll–Hamar Line, later reclassified as {{the first part of the}} Dovre Line, was initially planned as narrow gauge. This was changed by Parliament in 1875, making Hamar the site of the break-of-gauge.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the 1946–48 Israeli War of Independence and {{subsequent}} 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Palestine Railways main line was severed at the 1949 Armistice Line. The 1956 Israeli invasion severed Sinai's rail link with the rest of Egypt was reconnected its rail link with Israel. Israel captured a 4211 class 0-6-0 diesel shunting locomotive and five 545 class 2-6-0 steam locomotives. Israel also captured rolling stock including a six-wheel coach dating from 1893 and a 30-ton <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> built in 1950, both of which Israel Railways then appropriated into its breakdown fleet. Before being forced to withdraw from Sinai in March 1957, Israel systematically destroyed infrastructure including the railway. By 1963 the railway in Sinai was reconnected to the rest of Egypt but remained disconnected from Israel.|$|E
25|$|The mineral {{line was}} built by the Ailsa Craig Granite Company Ltd. in 1909 and ran from the quarry at Kennedy's Nags via the stone crusher near the south foghorn to the Quarry Pier. This crudely {{constructed}} narrow gauge line was mainly horse drawn, although wagons were also moved by hand or hauled up inclines by winding engines. The mineral railway at the quarry end had a least one siding and a mobile <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> loaded the larger granite blocks into the wagons that were transported to the stone crusher at the Trammins near the south foghorn, smaller stones being loaded and even moved by hand. Wagons or bogies were winched up to the substantial stone crusher and gravity was used to deliver the different grades of road stone to the waggons below that were then hauled by horses to the Quarry Pier via a line that ran {{in front of the}} lighthouse buildings and took a tight right-angled bend to run up the substantial stone-built incline to the storage area in preparation for delivery via sea to the mainland. Curb stones and stone railway sleepers for sections of the Scotch gauge horse-drawn railway from Ardrossan to Doura were also produced.|$|E
50|$|Although making {{locomotives}} was {{its main}} business, Dübs & Co also manufactured traction engines and <b>steam</b> <b>cranes.</b> His company is further notable {{in that it}} was the first to employ women in its drawing office (from 1866).|$|R
50|$|Their {{products}} included model sailing {{boats and}} hulls, steam boats, boat fittings, stationary steam engines, marine engines, <b>steam</b> <b>cranes,</b> traction engines, <b>steam</b> fire engines, railway locomotives, railway rolling stock, track, lineside accessories, steam engine parts, boilers, and similar items.|$|R
50|$|The GER had a {{total of}} 11 {{breakdown}} cranes. Numbers 1a, 2a and 3a were built at Stratford Works in 1885 initially as hand cranes. They were converted to <b>steam</b> <b>cranes</b> at Stratford c 1905/06 and lasted into LNER days.|$|R
500|$|Cranes {{were used}} along the many wharfs on the canal to offload cargo. [...] One of these, a <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> at Mount Sion, still exists (albeit in poor condition). [...] At Bury Wharf a {{traversing}} <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> positioned {{between the two}} arms of the terminus would offload cargo to be loaded into waiting lorries and a similar system was used at Radcliffe Wharf.|$|E
500|$|Queens Dock {{was opened}} in August 1877 as a [...] dock for {{exporting}} goods from {{the centre of}} Glasgow. A [...] <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> was constructed west of the current one in the 1890s, until it was demolished {{to make way for}} a proposed bridge crossing between Finnieston Quay and Mavisbank Quay that was never built. The present crane, constructed as a replacement, was the last giant cantilever crane to be built on the Clyde.|$|E
500|$|The Mount Sion <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> (a {{depiction}} {{of which is}} used as the logo of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society) sits rusting and unused at Mount Sion, on the Bury arm. [...] One of the earliest surviving cranes in England, it was built some time about 1875–1884 for Mount Sion Bleach Works by Thomas Smith & Sons of Rodley and was used to unload coal boxes from barges into the yard below the canal. [...] It was granted Grade II listed status in 2011.|$|E
50|$|Inaugurated in 1994, {{the museum}} {{comprises}} 23 standard gauge locomotives, 10 narrow gauge locomotives, 3 snowploughs and 2 <b>steam</b> <b>cranes.</b> 7 of these locomotives are active, {{and are used}} {{on a variety of}} special trains for enthusiasts and other groups.|$|R
50|$|In the 1850s the {{original}} partnership was also {{passed on to}} the next generation. Jeremiah Balmforth died in 1858 and his son William Balmforth replaced him, the following year David Smith was succeeded by his son Thomas. Around 1860 they started to produce <b>steam</b> powered <b>cranes</b> capable of handling much larger loads. In 1861 there was a fall out between Balmforth and Smith, Thomas Smith bought out the company and took over its running.William Balmforth set up a new firm the 'Peel Ings Foundry' and remained in the crane manufacturing business. As well as <b>steam</b> <b>cranes</b> they also produced a small number of vertical boilered locomotives. The Peel Ings Foundry didn't enjoy the same kind of success as the works of Thomas Smith and Joseph Booth though. It went bankrupt in 1916 and was bought by bridge maker Samuel Butler & Co but they closed down the works and began production of <b>steam</b> <b>cranes</b> for a time in their own works.|$|R
50|$|Alexander Chaplin {{produced}} {{a range of}} steam-powered industrial products which included <b>steam</b> <b>cranes,</b> hoists, locomotives, pumping and winding engines, ship's deck engines and sea water distilling apparatus. Between 1860 and 1899, it delivered 135 of these locomotives to customers around the world.|$|R
500|$|The railway also developed, {{with the}} {{acquisition}} of [...] of portable track and six tipping wagons in 1889, a <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> later the same year, and more wagons in 1891 and 1892. The first locomotive arrived in 1898, after its purchase from the Yorkshire Engine Company. It was an 0-4-0 saddle tank, which had been built in 1875 {{for use as a}} contractor's engine, and had been refurbished by the manufacturer. A maintenance contract for the wagons lapsed in 1900, as the men at the works had become proficient at repairs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transport}} of building materials was facilitated by scaffolding and a <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> that lifted {{the material to}} the construction site. [...] Another crane was used at the construction site. The recently founded Dampfkessel-Revisionsverein (Steam Boiler Inspection Association) regularly inspected both boilers.|$|E
2500|$|The railway was {{required}} because {{the core of}} the Caban-coch, Pen-y-garreg and Craig-goch dams were built from large irregular stone blocks ("plums") embedded in concrete. The rock was mined locally from Cigfran and Craig-cnwch quarries by the Elan River and the Aberdeuddwr quarry on Cerrig Gwynion, just to the south of Rhayader. The shaped stones were hauled by locomotive to the dam sites on flatbed trucks. They were then lowered into place by <b>steam</b> <b>crane.</b> The central cores of the dams were encased with a [...] concrete lining. The outside walls were faced with cut stone brought from quarries at Llanelwedd near Builth Wells and Pontypridd. The cement, which was made near Chatham in Kent, was sent by sea to Aberystwyth and brought by railway to the Elan Valley.|$|E

60|$|The {{captain of}} the Fearless came on to the wharf in a manner more suggestive of deer-stalking {{than that of a}} prosaic {{shipmaster}} returning to his craft. He dodged round an empty van, lurked behind an empty barrel, flitted from that to a post, and finally from the interior of a <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> peeped melodramatically on to the deck of his craft.|$|E
60|$|His mother Radha Pyari,--Radha the darling,--who {{had been}} caught in the same drive with Kala Nag, told him, before his little milk tusks had dropped out, that {{elephants}} who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag knew that that advice was good, {{for the first time that}} he saw a shell burst he backed, screaming, into a stand of piled rifles, and the bayonets pricked him in all his softest places. So, before he was twenty-five, he gave up being afraid, and so he was the best-loved and the best-looked-after elephant in the service of the Government of India. He had carried tents, twelve hundred pounds' weight of tents, on the march in Upper India. He had been hoisted into a ship at the end of a <b>steam</b> <b>crane</b> and taken for days across the water, and made to carry a mortar on his back in a strange and rocky country very far from India, and had seen the Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had come back again in the steamer entitled, so the soldiers said, to the Abyssinian War medal. He had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and epilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at a place called Ali Musjid, ten years later; and afterward he had been sent down thousands of miles south to haul and pile big balks of teak in the timberyards at Moulmein. There he had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was shirking his fair share of work.|$|E
60|$|The last {{farewell}} was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far {{and near}} the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared {{to us from the}} cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful <b>steam</b> <b>crane),</b> Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.

All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.|$|E
