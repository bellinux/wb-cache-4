5|$|Hancock's {{time in the}} West was brief. President Johnson, {{unhappy with}} the way Republican generals were {{governing}} the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements for them. The general who offended Johnson the most was Philip Sheridan, and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to <b>switch</b> <b>the</b> assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking. Although neither man {{was pleased with the}} change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production for Ruma Maida {{took three}} months. The {{characters}} were written without any particular actors in mind. Atiqah Hasiholan, {{who had previously}} starred in the Academy Award-submitted Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President, 2009), was cast as Maida. Yama Carlos, who played Sakera, was initially cast for another role but received the leading male role after a last-minute <b>switch.</b> <b>The</b> actor cast as Muchlisin, Frans Tumbuan, {{was the only one}} auditioned as Soeriaatmadja thought the role was perfect for him. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that, including extras, Ruma Maida had the largest cast of any film he had made to that point.|$|E

5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the <b>switch,</b> <b>the</b> frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.|$|E
5|$|The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and was {{essentially}} a UK version of the German Lorenz beam system. Lorenz, or Standard Beam Approach as it was known in the UK, used a single transmitter located off {{the far end of}} the active runway that was alternately connected to one of two slightly directional antennas using a motorized <b>switch.</b> <b>The</b> antennas were aimed so they sent their signals to the left and right of the runway, but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{new sound}} chip and MIDI out {{abilities}} {{were exposed to}} the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to <b>switch</b> <b>the</b> machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although {{there is no way to}} switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs.|$|E

5|$|The same {{development}} {{team that}} worked on Four Swords Adventures also worked {{on what would}} become Phantom Hourglass. In the game's first prototype, the action {{took place in the}} upper screen while the touchscreen was a flat map that allowed Link to be controlled. However, the developers believed that this interface caused the player to be too disconnected from the game's action, thereby prompting them to <b>switch</b> <b>the</b> two screens. They felt that this interface would appeal to Japanese players, who they said prefer simple interfaces. The developers added a battle mode that was played over Wi-Fi to appeal to American players.|$|E
5|$|With {{its first}} season, The Simpsons became the Fox network's first series to {{rank among the}} top thirty highest rated shows of a {{television}} season. Due to this success, Fox decided to <b>switch</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons timeslot in hopes that it would result in higher ratings for the shows that would air after it. The series moved from 8:00p.m. on Sunday nights to the same time on Thursdays, where it competed with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark {{and hired}} Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo {{had been a}} {{personal}} friend of Clark's and publicly stated being surprised and disappointed with the <b>switch.</b> <b>The</b> decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E
40|$|SiC Schottky Barrier diodes (SiC SBD) {{are known}} to oscillate/ring in the output {{terminal}} when used as free-wheeling diodes in voltage-source converters. This ringing is due to RLC resonance among the diode capacitance, parasitic resistance, and circuit stray inductance. In this paper, a model has been developed for calculating <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> energy of SiC diodes {{as a function of}} <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> rate (dIDS/dt of the commutating SiC MOSFET) and temperature. It is shown that the damping of the oscillations increases with decreasing temperature and decreasing dIDS/dt. This in turn determines <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> energy of <b>the</b> diode, which initially decreases with decreasing dIDS/dt and subsequently increases with decreasing dIDS/dt thereby indicating an optimal dIDS/dt for minimum <b>switching</b> energy. <b>The</b> total <b>switching</b> energy of <b>the</b> diode can be subdivided into three phases namely <b>the</b> current <b>switching</b> phase, <b>the</b> voltage <b>switching</b> phase, and <b>the</b> ringing phase. Although <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> energy in <b>the</b> current <b>switching</b> phase decreases with increasing <b>switching</b> rate, <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> energy of <b>the</b> voltage and ringing phase increases with <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> rate. <b>The</b> model developed characterizes the dependence of diode's switching energy on temperature and dIDS/dt, hence, can be used to predict the behavior of the SiC SBD...|$|R

5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, {{with the exception of the}} yellow vertical loop. The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to <b>switch</b> <b>the</b> scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because Green Lantern's enemy is the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.|$|E
5|$|From Spring 2007 to 2008 the {{messages}} were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling, but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala.

This boost {{was greater than}} the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the <b>switch.</b> <b>The</b> continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Riverhillsoft {{released}} the first fully 3D survival horror game, Doctor Hauzer, for the 3DO. Both the player {{character and the}} environment are rendered entirely in polygons, while allowing the player to <b>switch</b> <b>the</b> view between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead view. In a departure from most other survival horror games before and after it, Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. It also uses background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the situation, {{and the sound of}} the player character's echoing footsteps can change depending on the surface; these would later be used in Resident Evil. The game is today considered a formative step in the creation of the survival horror genre, improving on Alone in the Dark.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Chinese Abacus Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for high speed and low power {{applications}} like audio and video applications.

5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton to <b>switch</b> <b>the</b> {{magazine}} from pocket-book {{to digest}} size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to about 14,000 copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that Authentic had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle. Hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in Authentic, and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E
5|$|In the 1979–80 European Cup, Linfield {{were drawn}} to face Dundalk from the Republic of Ireland. In the first leg, which was played in Dundalk and ended in a 1–1 draw, crowd {{disturbance}} prompted UEFA to <b>switch</b> <b>the</b> second leg to the Haarlem Stadion, Netherlands.

Dundalk were fined £870 for providing insufficient security at the match. Dundalk eventually won the match 2–0 to progress 3–1 on aggregate. In the 1987–88 campaign, Linfield's home game against Lillestrøm was marred by missile throwing, resulting in UEFA sanctions which meant that the club had to play their next two home games in European competitions at Welsh club Wrexham in 1988–89 and 1989–90.|$|E
