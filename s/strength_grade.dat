Although the value of strength can be directly forecasted, the estimation of <b>strength</b> <b>grade</b> remains particularly important because concrete mortar is non-uniform, and prac-tical preparation and curing cannot be fully simulated under laboratory conditions.

This {{can be achieved by}} different approaches that are represented in the current standard and pre-standard. The pre-standard defines a parametric and non-parametric calculation of characteristic properties from test results, which is the essential difference between various approaches. In both the non-parametric approach and the standard procedure, some simplifications and adjustment factors are used while in the parametric calculation only equations from a theoretical background are used. Procedures are derived for eight different <b>strength</b> <b>grade</b> combination and for all results comparisons are made. With the Mathematica software we used simulations to test given equations for the calculation of characteristic properties. Special consideration was taken on the non-parametrical calculation. The correction factor equation has not proved to be suitable, at least not for the assumptions that are made in the pre-standard. Therefore, we produced a new equation, which gives better results. A new strength grading machine is under development, which is not yet standardized and cannot formally be used for strength grading and CE marking yet. The requirements for the derivation of machine settings for initial type testing were met and we established new settings. We tried different properties as the indicative property. Due to its good correlation to specimens strength properties, dynamic modulus of elasticity was chosen. Grading procedure could be simplified by avoiding density measuring. Using size matrix and global cost matrix, we evaluated grading machine performance for data with measured density and data with constant density for each of the <b>strength</b> <b>grade</b> combination. The results using the measured density were significantly better than those with a constant density.

This deficiency arguably limits the safe and economic use of the material. This paper presents findings from an international research project which seeks to develop a <b>strength</b> <b>grading</b> system for bamboo culms. Over 200 four-point bending tests were carried out on Guadua angustifolia Kunth culms for which numerous mechanical and physical properties were measured. Correlations between flexural strength, static modulus of elasticity, dynamic modulus of elasticity from stress waves and density provided mediocre results, with R 2 ranging from 0 · 27 to 0 · 47. However, properties such as flexural stiffness, flexural capacity and mass per unit length, which are less dependent on geometric properties, provided much stronger correlations, with R 2 ranging from 0 · 86 to 0 · 92. The quality of these correlations indicates that these {{could be used as}} indicating properties for flexural capacity in a simple yet reliable <b>strength</b> <b>grading</b> procedure for bamboo.
