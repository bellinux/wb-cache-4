5|$|During the 17 May 1992 Fairchild air show, Holland {{was again}} the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} again violated several <b>safety</b> <b>regulations,</b> including several low-altitude, steep turns {{in excess of}} 45° of bank and a high pitch angle climb, estimated at over 60° nose high which Holland finished with a wingover maneuver. The new wing commander, Colonel Michael G. Ruotsala, apparently took no action. One week later, the new DO, Colonel Capotosti, on his own initiative warned Holland that if he violated any more <b>safety</b> <b>regulations,</b> Capotosti would ground him (remove him from flying status). Capotosti did not document his warning to Holland or take {{any other kind of}} formal action.|$|E

5|$|During a 19 May 1991 {{air show}} at Fairchild, Holland was the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} violated several <b>safety</b> <b>regulations,</b> including exceeding bank and pitch limits, flying {{directly over the}} air-show spectators, and possibly violating altitude restrictions.

5|$|Manganese {{overexposure}} is {{most frequently}} associated with manganism, a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons {{employed in the}} production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulations</b> protect workers in developed nations. The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese grinders.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{a number}} of issues that are influencing the evolution of food <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> in developed and, to a lesser extent, developing countries. Whilst not definitive, it aims to highlight those factors which are considered crucial to an understanding of contemporary food safety controls in both the public and private spheres. These issues include criteria applied to assess the need/justification for food <b>safety</b> <b>regulation,</b> relationships between public and private food safety control systems, alternative forms that public food <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> can take, strategic responses to food <b>safety</b> <b>regulation,</b> and the trade implications of national food safety controls. The article serves as an introduction to these issues, which are discussed at greater length in the other papers that make up this special issue of Food Policy. Ó 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|There was {{no system}} at Port Chicago for making sure {{officers}} {{and men were}} familiar with <b>safety</b> <b>regulations.</b> Two formal lectures and several informal lectures {{were given to the}} enlisted men by commanding officers, but follow-up confirmation of retained knowledge did not take place. <b>Safety</b> <b>regulations</b> were posted at a single location at the pier but not within each of the barracksKinne did not think the enlisted men would be able to comprehend such a list. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion but Navy leadership declined the offer, fearing higher costs, slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen. No enlisted man stationed at Port Chicago had ever received formal training in the handling and loading of explosives into ships. Even the officers did not receive training: Lieutenant Commander Alexander Holman, loading officer at Port Chicago whose duties included officer training, had initiated a search for training materials and samples but failed to organize a training class before disaster struck.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, <b>safety</b> <b>regulations</b> for the project were {{scrutinized}} and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E

40|$|In this book, Ellen Vos {{analyses}} {{the emergence}} of EC product <b>safety</b> <b>regulation,</b> which is explained as a reaction both to spill-over effects of the internal market policy, and to growing societal concerns regarding health and safety protection. Due to factors such as mutual distrust between the Member States, the 'post-Maastricht' Community is increasingly required to play a direct role in health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation.</b> This has confronted the Community with regulatory problems relating to the assessment and management of risks. This book seeks to identify {{the principles of the}} resulting Community approach to risk regulation. It first elaborates the fundamental EU law concepts of competence, institutional balance, subsidiarity, and delegation of powers in relation to health and safety. These legal concepts are then used to appraise the legality and the legitimacy of the three basic regulatory patterns typical of the Community approach to science-based decision-making: resorting to committees (in the food sector), to agencies (pharmaceuticals), and to private bodies (standardisation). Ellen Vos concludes that, to date, Community risk regulation is pragmatic but lacks a coherent regulatory model. •	Introduction: regulating risk; dealing with risk under community law; regulatory models - committees, agencies and private bodies. •	Part 1 The community's involvement in health and safety regulations: {{the emergence of}} community health and safety regulation; community competence and its legal basis; concurrent powers between the community and the member states. •	Part 2 Deepening of community health and safety regulation: deepening of community involvement in health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> - towards community implementation; the relationship between community legislation and implementation; the implications of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality for the deepening of community activities in health and safety regulation; the institutional balance of powers; difficulties flowing from the increasing reliance on the commission in health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation.</b> •	Part 3 Health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> through committees - the case of foodstuffs: the rise of committees within the community's institutional structure; the competence of the community to create committees; committees and the institutional balance of powers; health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> through committees - the case of foodstuffs. •	Part 4 Health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> through agencies - the case of pharmaceuticals: the rise of agencies within the community's institutional structure; the competence to establish agencies under the treaty provisions; health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> through agencies - the case of pharmaceuticals; delegation of powers to the European standardisation bodies?; legitimacy of decision-making and standard-setting. •	Part 5 Health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> through private bodies - the case of technical product standards: health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> through private bodies - the case of technical product standards. •	Conclusion; community health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulation</b> through committees, agencies and private bodies; in search of legitimate community health and safety regulation; towards a theoretical conceptualisation of community risk regulation.

It is also often used by the U.S. Armed Forces during aviation safety training {{as an example of the}} importance of compliance with <b>safety</b> <b>regulations</b> and correcting the behavior of anyone who violates safety procedures.|$|E
5|$|Hampden Park in Glasgow is the {{traditional}} home of the Scotland team and is described by the SFA as the National Stadium.

5|$|The {{old wooden}} {{roof of the}} stand was due to be {{replaced}} {{the day after the}} Lincoln match, because it did not meet the <b>safety</b> <b>regulations</b> required for Division Two, where the team would be playing in the following season. Instead, it took until July 1986 for rebuilding work to begin. The ground was used for reserve team fixtures from September 1985, but only journalists and club officials were present to watch. Bradford City's senior team played home games at other grounds in West Yorkshire for 19months while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The new ground cost £2.6million to rebuild, and was reopened in December 1986.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} 19th century stadia called Hampden Park, built on {{different}} sites. A stadium {{on the present}} site was first opened on 31 October 1903. Hampden was the biggest stadium in the world when it was opened, with a capacity in excess of 100,000. This was increased further between 1927 and 1937, reaching a peak of 150,000. The record attendance of 149,415, for a Scotland v England match in 1937, is the European record for an international football match. Tighter <b>safety</b> <b>regulations</b> meant that the capacity was reduced to 81,000 in 1977. The stadium has been fully renovated since then, with the most recent work being completed in 1999.|$|E

In May 2005 there were disturbances in Dublin at the Setanta Cup final between Linfield and Shelbourne. In the same month, Linfield fans were banned from travelling to the Oval for a match against Glentoran, allegedly {{as a result}} of disturbances involving both sets of fans the previous month. However, Glentoran denied this was the reason behind the ban, citing health and <b>safety</b> <b>regulations</b> that forced them to close the away stand.
