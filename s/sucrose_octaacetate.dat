50|$|Until recently, {{the nature}} of gustducin and its second {{messengers}} was unclear. It was clear, however, that gustducin transduced intracellular signals. Spielman {{was one of the}} first to look at the speed of taste reception, utilizing the quenched-flow technique. When the taste cells were exposed to the bitter stimulants denatonium and <b>sucrose</b> <b>octaacetate,</b> the intracellular response - a transient increase of IP3 - occurred within 50-100 millisecond of stimulation. This was not unexpected, as it was known that transducin was capable of sending signals within rod and cone cells at similar speeds. This indicated that IP3 was one of the second messengers used in bitter taste transduction. It was later discovered that cAMP also causes an influx of cations during bitter and some sweet taste transduction, leading to the conclusion that it also acted as a second messenger to gustducin.|$|E

For nitroxyl relaxation there is a master curve: log(1 /T 1) vs log(T) (γ = 0. 89). The similarity of the values of γ for the Raman process and for the additional process that contributes at higher temperatures, and the absence of frequency dependence between X- and Q-band, support assignment of this additional process as a local mode.

There was a significant increase in SOA thresholds in the desalivate mice, and the pre- to post-operative differences in threshold between the control and experimental groups were significant. The altered response to SOA by desalivate mice is shown to be due to the assumption of a prandial pattern of drinking as a result of desalivation.

40|$|Abstract. Two-bottle {{preference}} {{tests have}} often been used to make inferences about gustatory thresholds. The validity of such inferences depends {{on the extent to}} which taste differences produce differential fluid consumptions from the bottles. If equal amounts are consumed despite perceived gustatory dissimilarity, inaccurate threshold estimates result. Modifications of common preference-test procedures, interacting with tastant properties and genetic variation, disclosed instances of such non-discrimination among inbred strains of mice. With an hedonically neutral to mildly unpalatable tastant (sodium cyclamate), taste-aversion conditioning yielded lower thresholds. With a palatable tastant (maltose), testing without prior conditioning usually indicated lower thresholds. Descending concentration series produced lower thresholds than ascending concentration series, for both palatable (sucrose) and neutral (cyclamate) tastants. Previous experience with the tastants elevated preference scores, yielding lower thresholds with palatable tastants (sucrose, maltose) and higher thresholds with an unpalatable tastant (<b>sucrose</b> <b>octaacetate).</b> Within-strain discrepancies between thresholds indicated by the different methods were often large (2 — 3 log molar concentration steps). Among-strain differences of comparable magnitude, both in preferences and threshold estimates, were found for sucrose, maltose and cyclamate...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if taste interactions occur when bitter stimuli are mixed. Eight bitter stimuli were employed: denatonium benzoate (DB), quinine-HCl (QHCl), <b>sucrose</b> <b>octaacetate</b> (SOA), urea, L-tryptophan (L-trp), L-phenylalanine (L-phe), ranitidine-HCl, and Tetralone. The first experiment constructed individual psychophysical curves for each subject (n = 19) for each compound to account for individual differences in sensitivities when presenting bitter compounds in experiment 2. Correlation analysis revealed two groupings of bitter compounds at low intensity (1, L-trp, L-phe, and ranitidine; 2, SOA and QHCl), but the correlations within each group decreased as the perceived intensity increased. In experiment 2, intensity ratings and two-alternative forced-choice discrimination tasks showed that bitter compounds generally combine additively in mixture and do not show interactions with a few specific exceptions. The methods employed detected synergy among sweeteners, but could not detect synergy among these eight bitter compounds. In general, the perceived bitterness of these binary bitter-compound mixtures was an additive function of the total bitter-inducing stimuli in the mouth. <br /...|$|E

The solvents were chosen to have similar chemical and dielectric properties, but vastly different viscosities. Systems of an electron donor, rubrene, and varying concentrations of an electron acceptor, duroquinone, were studied. The solvents used were diethyl sebacate (liquid) and <b>sucrose</b> <b>octaacetate</b> (solid).

The forward transfer data, in both the solid and liquid solutions, are in very good agreement with calculations. Virtually identical forward transfer parameters are obtained from the solid and liquid samples.

The membrane transport model parameters as well as all parameters in the pressure drop and mass transfer correlations for the spiral-wound modules were obtained from regression on a limited number of experimental data at steady state conditions. Excellent agreement was found between the experimental and multi-scale modelling performance data under various operating conditions. The results illustrate that the performance of a large scale batch concentration process with spiral-wound membrane modules can be predicted based on laboratory crossflow flat sheet test data when the fluid dynamics and mass transfer characteristics in the module, and the necessary channel geometry are known.

Eleven URI symptoms were rated daily {{on a scale of}} 0 (not present) to 3 (severe). Duration of illness, reflected in the proportion of subjects remaining symptomatic on each day, was not significantly reduced (maximum difference of 12. 6 % on day 7, P = 0. 09; 95 % confidence interval, - 6 to 31 %) by either treatment. Severity of illness, assessed by using a summed severity score, was reduced incrementally by 7 to 8 % on days 5 to 7 (P = 0. 02) in subjects taking zinc. Adverse effects, mostly nausea and altered taste, were reported by 50 % of subjects taking zinc. We conclude that while zinc gluconate may produce a small reduction in overall severity of symptoms, this is not clinically significant.

40|$|A growing {{literature}} suggests taste stimuli commonly classified as "bitter" induce heterogeneous neural and perceptual responses. Here, the central processing of bitter stimuli was studied in mice with genetically controlled bitter taste profiles. Using these mice removed genetic heterogeneity {{as a factor}} influencing gustatory neural codes for bitter stimuli. Electrophysiological activity (spikes) was recorded from single neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius during oral delivery of taste solutions (26 total), including concentration series of the bitter tastants quinine, denatonium benzoate, cycloheximide, and <b>sucrose</b> <b>octaacetate</b> (SOA), presented to the whole mouth for 5 s. Seventy-nine neurons were sampled; in many cases multiple cells (2 to 5) were recorded from a mouse. Results showed bitter stimuli induced variable gustatory activity. For example, although some neurons responded robustly to quinine and cycloheximide, others displayed concentration-dependent activity (p< 0. 05) to quinine but not cycloheximide. Differential activity to bitter stimuli was observed across multiple neurons recorded from one animal in several mice. Across all cells, quinine and denatonium induced correlated spatial responses that differed (p< 0. 05) from those to cycloheximide and SOA. Modeling spatiotemporal neural ensemble activity revealed responses to quinine/denatonium and cycloheximide/SOA diverged during only an early, at least 1 s wide period of the taste response. Our findings highlight how temporal features of sensory processing contribute differences among bitter taste codes and build on data suggesting heterogeneity among "bitter" stimuli, data that challenge a strict monoguesia model for the bitter quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{perceived}} taste intensities of quinine HCl, caffeine, <b>sucrose</b> <b>octaacetate</b> (SOA) and propylthiouracil (PROP) solutions {{were examined}} in 1457 twins and their siblings. Previous heritability modeling of these bitter stimuli indicated a common genetic factor for quinine, caffeine and SOA (22 – 28 %), as well as separate specific genetic factors for PROP (72 %) and quinine (15 %). To identify the genes involved, we performed a genome-wide association study with the same sample as the modeling analysis, genotyped for approximately 610 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For caffeine and SOA, no SNP association reached a genome-wide statistical criterion. For PROP, the peak association was within TAS 2 R 38 (rs 713598, A 49 P, P = 1. 6 × 10 − 104), which accounted for 45. 9 % of the trait variance. For quinine, the peak association was centered {{in a region that}} contains bitter receptor as well as salivary protein genes and explained 5. 8 % of the trait variance (TAS 2 R 19, rs 10772420, R 299 C, P = 1. 8 × 10 − 15). We confirmed this association in a replication sample of twins of similar ancestry (P = 0. 00001). The specific genetic factor for the perceived intensity of PROP was identified as the gene previously implicated in this trait (TAS 2 R 38). For quinine, one or more bitter receptor or salivary proline-rich protein genes on chromosome 12 have alleles which affect its perception but tight linkage among very similar genes precludes the identification of a single causal genetic variant...|$|E

The synthesis and characterization by SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometry {{of one of the}} high-spin diradicals, in which nitroxides are conformationally constrained to be coplanar with the m-phenylene unit, is reported. The interspin distances ranged from about 5 - 9 Å, and the magnitude of the exchange interaction ranged from 3 ̆e 150 to 3 ̆e 0. 1 K. 1 /T 1 and 1 /Tm were measured by long-pulse saturation recovery, three-pulse inversion recovery, and two-pulse echo decay at X-band (9. 5 GHz) and Q-band (35 GHz). For a diradical with interspin distance about 9 Å, relaxation rates were only slightly faster than for a monoradical with analogous structure. For interspin distances of about 5 - 6 Å, relaxation rates in glassy solvents up to 300 K increased in the order monoradical 3 ̆c diradical 3 ̆c tetraradical. Modulation of electron-electron interaction enhanced relaxation via the direct, Raman, and local mode processes. The largest differences in 1 /T 1 were observed below 10 K, where the direct process dominates.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the past}} few decades organic solvent {{nanofiltration}} has received {{a great deal of attention}} and a growing number of studies has been reported on development and optimisation of solvent resistant membranes and their transport mechanism. However, most of these studies have used flat sheet membranes. On the other hand, many researchers studied fluid dynamics and mass transfer in spiral-wound membrane modules, almost exclusively in aqueous solutions. This paper reports the performance of four spiral-wound membrane modules tested in 0 – 20 wt% solutions of <b>sucrose</b> <b>octaacetate</b> in ethyl acetate under various pressures and retentate flowrates. These modules were made of two different types of membranes (a commercial membrane, PuraMem® S 600, and a development product, Lab- 1, from Evonik Membrane Extraction Technology Limited) and covered three module sizes (1. 8 ″× 12 ″, 2. 5 ″× 40 ″ and 4. 0 ″× 40 ″). All modules had the same feed and permeate spacers. The classical solution diffusion model was applied to describe the transport of solute and solvent through the membrane and regress the unknown model parameters from flat sheet data. Correlations for characterising the fluid dynamics and mass transfer in the spiral-wound membrane modules, as well as the parameters describing the feed and permeate channels, were determined by performing the regression of experimental data of a 1. 8 ″× 12 ″ PuraMem® S 600 membrane module. The classical solution–diffusion model, combined with the film theory, was then successfully applied to predict the performance of other modules of larger size (such as the 2. 5 ″× 40 ″ and 4. 0 ″× 40 ″ module sizes) and/or made of a different membrane material (such as Lab- 1). The procedure proposed in this paper predicts the performance of a specific module by obtaining a limited number of experimental data for flat sheets and a 1. 8 ″× 12 ″ spiral-wound membrane module only (necessary to obtain the fitting parameters characteristic of the membrane and the module). Furthermore, with this procedure, it is not necessary to know a priori the spacer geometry, because the necessary information about the spacer geometry will be also obtained by regression of few experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The small African weaver finch {{commonly}} known as Quelea (Quelea quelea) has been reported (Crook and Ward, 1968) {{to be one of}} the most numerous and destructive birds in the world and is found extensively throughout Africa (DeGrazio, 1974). Quelea have been associated with damage to many agricultural crops including millet, grain sorghum, rice, and wheat. Because current population control programs in Africa have not reduced damage except in a few local areas (Crook and Ward, 1968), more effective damage control methods need to be Inves- tigated. One promising method, protection of the agricultural crop with a chemical repellent, methiocarb, has been demonstrated to be highly effective (Guarino, 1972). Small scale efficacy demonstrations in Tanzania (DeGrazio, 1974) with three pounds of methiocarb per acre to protect maturing rice and wheat have reduced Quelea damage by about 90 percent. Methiocarb is thought to produce a post-ingestional effect in the affected birds (Guarino, 1972). Rogers (1974) has presented some evidence that methiocarb, unlike a highly bitter-tasting compound (<b>sucrose</b> <b>octaacetate),</b> affects feeding activity of Red-winged Blackbirds (Ageliaus phoenlceus), but some time delay is required for affectation and subsequent feeding aversion. The development of the repellent (or aversion) response for methiocarb was similar to the aversive response shown to lithium chloride (LiCl), a salt that has been traditionally used to study conditioned aversion in rats (Nachman, 1963). This aversion effect is then thought to become quickly associated with the taste of methiocarb or treated food material (Crase and DeHaven, 1976). Schafer, Brunton, and Lockyer (1977) observed that most of the seven bird species they tested [Robins (Turdus migratorius), Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), White-crowned Sparrows (zonotrlchia leucophrys). House Sparrows (Passer domesticus), Starlings (sturnus vulgaris), Grackles (Quiscalus qaiscula), and Red-winged Blackbirds] displayed more food aversion and longer-lasting conditioning to methiocarb when compared with thiram (TMTD), a taste repellent. Both repellent materials were placed on food particles at levels slightly lower than the R- 50 for Red-winged Blackbirds (Schafer and Brunton, 1971). To more effectively predict field application rates for protecting cereal grains from Quelea damage in Africa, we felt it necessary to compare the sensitivity of Quelea to methiocarb with sensitivities reported for other bird species (Schafer and Brunton, 1971). In addition, we wanted to determine the relative importance of taste versus visual feeding cues that could become associated with methiocarb exposure in Quelea. Knowledge gained from these studies could lead to an improved application method that would enhance the long-term repellent action of methiocarb with low level methiocarb treatments in conjunction with other stimuli. Aversive cues could also be used to alter food-searching behavior (Crase and DeHaven, 1976) so that Quelea repelled from agricultural crops would more quickly seek alternate natural foods such as grass or weed seeds and Insects...|$|E
40|$|Integrated {{gasification}} {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) power plants are ¡§the power plants of the future¡¨ {{due to their}} increased thermal efficiency compared to the current fleet of pulverized coal (PC) power plants employed throughout the US. An additional advantage they have is the range of possible fuels {{that can be used}} in their employ including, coal, biomass, recycled plastics, etc. Although there are no commercial scale IGCC plants currently in use in the US today, the increase in energy demand in the US compounded with the decommissioning of current PC plants each year will result in their construction soon. As with all fossil fuel using processes the IGCC plant will give off CO 2 as a major waste stream that today is currently vented to the atmosphere. With the rising levels of atmospheric CO 2 and the concern of global climate change, and the contribution from CO 2, technology has been developed to capture CO 2 from this IGCC fuel stream. This capture process is done via physical absorbents because of the inherent high pressure driving force present in this fuel stream. The overall objective of this work is to identify the most CO 2 -philic compounds from three classes of compounds made up of C, N, O, and H intended to be used in the carbon capture process associated with the IGCC plant. The three classes of compounds in question are low volatility CO 2 -philic oligomers, volatile organic solvents, and solid CO 2 -philic compounds that are capable of melting in the presence of CO 2. Phase behavior experiments have been carried out in order to construct phase diagrams for each solvent and CO 2. These diagrams quantify the miscibility of CO 2 in each solvent which helps determine the best possible solvent for absorbing CO 2 from a mixed gas high pressure stream in a typical counter-current absorption column. The higher the miscibility of CO 2 in the absorbent, the lower the pressure of phase separation will be throughout the phase behavior diagram. Several solvents classified as low volatile CO 2 -philic oligomers were tested with CO 2. A mixture of low volatility CO 2 -philic oligomers known as poly(ethylene glycol) di-methyl ether, PEGDME, is the current solvent of choice in the IGCC capture process. Poly(dimethylsiloxane), PDMS, and poly(propylene glycol) di-methyl ether, PPGDME, are potentially better solvents, compared to PEGDME, in this process due to their limited miscibility or immiscibility with water, a constituent in the fuel stream, and their low viscosity, an important property for gas transport in and out of the liquid phase solvent. Volatile organic solvents, while not prevalent in the IGCC capture process, are very widely used as solvents for a range of separation applications and are used extensively in CO 2 capture primarily in the sweetening process of natural gas. Commercial scale sorbents including methanol and propylene carbonate have been in use for years under the proprietary names of RectisolTM and the Fluor process. Several organic solvents were examined in this study in binary mixtures with CO 2. It was determined that acetone is the best solvent on a weight basis due to its small spherical size and shape and the CO 2 -philic ketone functionality. It cannot be used commercially however due to its high vapor pressure that would cause significant evaporative losses in practice. The best solvents compared on a molar basis include 2 -(2 -butoxyethoxy) ethyl acetate, 2 -methoxyethyl acetate, both discovered in this work, and methyl acetate. Overall the best solvents on a weight or molar basis are those that are highly oxygenated compounds, rich in carbonyl and/or ether groups that favor Lewis acid:Lewis base interactions with CO 2. CO 2 -philic solids are from the last group of potential solvents examined with CO 2 and were found in the past by our group and two others. Originally investigated to be valuable as sand binders, these solids¡¦ unique ability to melt and then mix with CO 2 has great potential value in energy savings and initial capital equipment cost savings. This potential stems from these solvents¡¦ ability to release all CO 2 absorbed at a moderate pressure, approximately 5 MPa as opposed to a liquid solvent that releases CO 2 at 0. 1 MPa. The solids were chosen from two classes known as sugar acetates and tert-butylated aromatics and were tested in a binary mixture with pure CO 2 and also a ternary mixture with an equimolar mixed gas CO 2 /H 2. Four compounds, <b>sucrose</b> <b>octaacetate,</b> 1, 3, 5 -tri-tert-butylbenzene, 2, 4 -di-tert-butylbenzene, and 1, 3, 5 -trioxane, were determined to be viable candidates for the selective absorption of CO 2 from a CO 2 /H 2 mixture that are capable of melting and selectively absorbing CO 2. Lastly, higher molar mass PDMS solvents were examined and compared to PEGDME (molar mass = 310) at elevated temperatures. These PDMS solvents are all substantially larger than the PDMS hexamer tested in conjunction with the other hexamers and oligomers tested. The major benefit these higher molar mass solvents have is that they allow the capture step to be carried out at higher temperatures. Additionally these PDMS solvents are completely immiscible with water up to 68. 95 MPa and 393 K. This change in the capture process allows for the elimination of heat exchangers needed to lower the temperature of the fuel gas stream, and also eliminates a condenser step that is typically needed to eliminate much of the water out of the fuel stream for the hydrophilic PEGDME solvent. Each PDMS solvent, PDMS 10 (viscosity, ƒÝ, equals 10 cSt at 298. 15 K, and average molar mass, (MW) ̅ equals 1, 250 g/mol), PDMS 20 (ƒÝ = 20 cSt at 298. 15 K and (MW) ̅ = 2, 000 g/mol), and PDMS 50 (ƒÝ = 50 cSt at 298. 15 K and (MW) ̅ = 3, 780 g/mol), was examined in a binary mixture with CO 2 at 353 K, 373 K, and 393 K, respectively, at PDMS weight fractions between 0. 60 and 0. 95. Each PDMS solvent displayed comparable CO 2 miscibility compared with PEGDME at each temperature. Additionally each PDMS solvent was mixed with H 2 at the same temperatures, and was able to mix and form a single homogeneous liquid phase however, only at substantially higher PDMS weight fractions, 0. 995 to 0. 999. While it is not clear which solvent has the highest miscibility with H 2, the comparison of H 2 miscibility to CO 2 miscibility in each solvent illustrates the difference in selectivity that these solvents have for CO 2 over H 2...|$|E
