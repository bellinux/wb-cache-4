2500|$|The main {{character}} of NOW. Practitioner of the [...] "Sashinmu" [...] (사신무) killing style. He has distinct silver colored hair. He was the adopted grandson of North Star, and holds himself responsible for North Star's death. He {{seems to be}} developing a crush on Rin. Bi-Ryu is a rather simple young man, unable {{to catch up with}} the times on his own. This is shown when he and Ah-Rin prepare to embark on their quest. She asks if he is all packed, and if <b>so,</b> <b>where</b> <b>are</b> his things. He casts a finger to Cho-Ryung in response. He also had casually walked in on Yhun Ah-Rin and Cho Ryung in a bath, Bi Ryu asked directions and left as though she was not naked, Cho Ryung seems to have the same casualness. However, he is merciless in combat, referring to himself as a Sa-Shin, a death god. He has been shown to descend into a ferocious killing rage during battle, with Ah-Rin being the only one able to return him to normal.|$|E
2500|$|Jo Garfein at TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} preview, saying, [...] "This episode {{has more of}} an early X-Files feel, in a good way... To {{those of you who}} have either given up on the series or are on the fence, I recommend that you give Fringe another try. If 'Inner Child' is any indication, we are in for a very satisfying and engaging journey for the rest of the season." [...] Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, [...] "As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling enough that I can wait on the mythology stuff for later." [...] Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted a theory about the Child, [...] "My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly looked a lot alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And why did the CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'"

60|$|Yes, we {{may have}} our suspicions. But {{how can we get}} a bill on this evidence? There are some thirty other {{individuals}} in Coniston whose mortgages Jethro holds, from a horse to a house and farm. It is not likely that they will tell Beacon Hatch, or us; {{that they are going to}} town meeting and vote for that fatherless ticket because Jethro Bass wishes them to do so. And Jethro has never said that he wishes them to. If <b>so,</b> <b>where</b> <b>are</b> your witnesses? Have we not come back to our starting-point, even as Moses Hatch drove around in a circle.. And we have the advantage over Moses, for we suspect somebody, and he did not know whom to suspect. Certainly not Jethro Bass, the man that lived under his nose and never said anything--and had no right to. Jethro Bass had never taken any active part in politics, though some folks had heard, in his rounds on business, that he had discussed them, and had spread the news of the infamous ticket without a parent. So much was spoken of at the meeting over which Priest Ware prayed. It was even declared that, being a Democrat, Jethro might have influenced some of those under obligations to him. Sam Price was at last fixed upon as the malefactor, though people agreed that they had not given him credit for so much sense, and Jacksonian principles became as much abhorred by the orthodox as the spotted fever.|$|E
