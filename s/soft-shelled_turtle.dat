50|$|Scientifically, {{the black}} <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> or Bostami Turtle (Aspideretes Nigricans, {{sometimes}} placed in genus Nilssonia) is {{a species of}} freshwater turtle found in India (Assam) and Bangladesh (Chittagong). They have been long-believed to be inbred variants of the Ganges <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> (A. gangeticus or N. gangeticus) or the Peacock <b>Soft-shelled</b> <b>Turtle</b> (A. hurum or N. hurum). While it is a close relative of the latter, it is a distinct species. As of 2002, the IUCN classified the species as Extinct in the Wild.|$|E

50|$|Many {{different}} species of reptiles occur on the refuge. Common species include the gopher snake, western diamondback snake, coachwhip, common kingsnake, whiptail lizard, desert spiny lizard and side-blotched lizard. The spiny <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> and the desert tortoise are also found on the refuge.

40|$|A {{total of}} 3528 {{specimens}} of freshwater turtles belonging to two families viz., Geoemydidae (brown river turtle, Kachuga smithi; Indian saw-backed turtle, K. tecta; Brahminy river turtle, Hardella thurgi; spotted pond turtle, Geoclemys hamiltonii) and Trionychidae (Indian <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle,</b> Aspederates gangeticus; peacock <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle,</b> A. hurum; narrow-headed <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle,</b> Chitra indica; Indian flap-shell turtle, Lissemys punciata) were identified. Kachuga smithi (43. 62 %) and K. tecta (42. 06 %) had abundant population status, whereas, Hardella thurgi (0. 88 %) and Chitra indica (0. 54 %) were rare. Capturing of turtles for supply to foreigners and export {{is a major}} threat to these animals. Fishermen also kill them during fishing. Canal closure and de-silting is also harmful to turtles. It is concluded {{that it is necessary to}} provide immediate legal protection/coverage to all turtle species under the Punjab Wildlife Act, 1974, Pakistan; otherwise turtle species will become extinct...|$|R

5000|$|The head of Amyda cartilaginea can {{be black}} or brown. Its head {{typically}} displays yellow dots that sometimes appear to fuse together, creating elongated streaks. As the turtle ages, its nape region becomes white or gray. [...] A trait that helps differentiate the Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> from other similar species is its noticeably elongated snout. This is an adaptation that, coupled with its great flexibility, aids the turtle in breathing {{when it has}} buried itself. [...] Increased gas exchange, {{a result of an}} adaptation known as [...] "pharyngel breathing", allows the Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> to remain submerged in water for extended periods of time. [...] Amyda cartilaginea has several permanent tubercles on its neck; [...] these tubercles can appear yellow or black. The Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle's</b> limbs also have yellow spots, but these are usually less in quantity and difficult to distinguish. Its feet are wide and flat, resembling paddles. As a final descriptive note, the males have longer and thicker tails than females.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{investigation}} {{was to investigate the}} effect of photoperiod on thyroid activity in <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> (Lissemys punctata punctata). Thirty days exposure of short photoperiod with 2 L: 22 D increased relative weight, follicular epithelial height and peroxidase activity of the thyroid gland; whereas exposure of long photoperiod with 22 L: 2 D for 30 days showed reversed changes to those of the short photoperiod in adult female turtles. These findings indicate that short photoperiod stimulates thyroid activity and long photoperiod inhibits its activity in <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles.</b> It is suggested that photoperiod exerts its action on thyroid activity presumably via gonads and/or pineal-gonadal axis in turtles...|$|R
