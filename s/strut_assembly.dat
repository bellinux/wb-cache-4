2500|$|On 16 May 1977, New York Airways' {{commercial}} S-61-L, N619PA, {{suffered a}} static rollover onto its starboard {{side at the}} heliport {{on top of the}} Pan Am Building while boarding passengers. The accident killed four boarding passengers and one woman on the street. 17 additional passengers and the three flight crew members were uninjured. The landing gear collapse was a result of metal fatigue in the helicopter's main landing gear shock-absorbing <b>strut</b> <b>assembly,</b> which caused the helicopter to tip over without warning. The accident resulted in the permanent closure of the Pan Am Building heliport. [...] As the heliport was closed, the wreckage was removed by disassembling it and taking the assemblies down to street level using the building's freight elevators.

50|$|The wing {{structure}} {{was formed by}} three built-up girder spars of triangular section with aluminium wing ribs spaced fairly wide apart; the wing fabric was sewn to special eyelets, which were attached to the framework at evenly spaced intervals. The lower wings were attached directly to the fuselage, touching the water when afloat, improving water-borne stability. The low aspect ratio upper wing {{was supported by a}} central frame work and N <b>strut</b> <b>assemblies</b> at 1/3rd span and 2/3rd span. Incidence of the upper wing was adjustable by altering the length of the forward N-strut tubes.|$|R
50|$|The A-Spec sport {{suspension}} changed out {{the four}} spring and damper (shock absorber) <b>strut</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The A-Spec suspension featured lowering springs (approximately 0.75 inch) and revalved dampers. The ride was stiffer, but not overly so, and handling was improved with less body roll, more controlled cornering and enhanced feel. Reportedly Acura chose {{to make the}} RL's A-Spec suspension more compliant than the very stiff A-Spec sport suspension upgrade for the Acura TL, {{in keeping with the}} two different missions of the cars: luxury for the RL, luxury sport for the TL. Acura RL A-Spec retained the same suspension geometry as the stock Acura RL suspension alignment specifications.|$|R

5000|$|The car {{featured}} a short-long arm (SLA) four-wheel independent suspension, with a modified MacPherson <b>strut</b> <b>assembly</b> in front, that offered excellent handling and ride quality. This setup was significant as {{it made the}} Thunderbird and the Cougar the only rear-wheel drive North American domestic cars other than the Chevrolet Corvette to offer a four-wheel independent suspension at the time. Engine options fell to only two for 1989 as Ford dropped the V8 option for the new Thunderbird. The base and LX models were powered by Ford's 3.8 L Essex OHV V6. Producing [...] at 3800 rpm and 215 lbft Nm of torque at 2400 rpm, many felt the engine was somewhat underpowered for a car that weighed over 3500 lb in base trim (heavier when equipped with available options). This engine was mated to Ford's AOD 4-speed automatic transmission regardless of trim level from the 1989 to 1993 model years. Thanks in part to its low coefficient of drag, the Thunderbird was relatively fuel efficient considering its overall size and weight. The EPA gave 1989 Thunderbirds equipped with the standard V6 a fuel efficiency rating of 19 mpg in city driving and 27 mpg on the highway, though, like most cars built before 2008, this rating was retroactively reduced by the EPA to reflect newer, more realistic fuel efficiency measurements. The fuel efficiency rating was noticeably better than that of Thunderbirds equipped with higher performance engines and gave the base V6-equipped Thunderbird a significant driving range with its 19 gallon fuel tank (later decreased to 18 gallons).|$|E
5000|$|The Ju 288's {{intricate}} main {{landing gear}} system's design proved to be troublesome, possessing twin vertical members directly behind a single oleo strut, for each pair of twinned wheels mounted to {{the lower end of}} the uniquely-attached main oleo strut unit. This single-tube oleo strut was pivoted off {{the lower end of the}} twin-member, [...] "Y-shaped" [...] retraction <b>strut</b> <b>assembly,</b> and was rotated in the vertical plane about this single attachment in a rearwards direction during retraction of the maingear unit, separate from the twin-member unit to help [...] "shorten" [...] its stowed length within the engine nacelle. This distinctive type of design required the oleo strut's freely-moving top end to physically rotate downwards and aftwards during the rear-swinging retraction of the main [...] "Y-shaped" [...] member, operated by a lever and gear-sector system mounted on the portside of each main gear assembly, operated with a long lever that had its upper end anchored to the firewall's rear surface. [...] The lever/sector gear system swiveled the oleo strut about its attachment point during the retract cycle, through an arc of roughly 180ยบ from its position when the main gear was fully extended. The stowed position of the oleo strut ended up orienting it aftwards within the rear of the engine nacelle, and placing the wheels' axle location just ahead of and above the oleo strut's pivot point when fully retracted. Such a complex main gear design, with only the single pivoting retraction point for its oleo struts taking the primary stress of touchdown, was likely only one of the many potential sources of trouble causing the Ju 288's main gear units to repeatedly collapse on touchdown.|$|E
5000|$|Work on the Ju 287 programme, {{along with}} all other pending German bomber {{projects}} (including Junkers' other ongoing heavy bomber design, the piston-engined Ju 488) {{came to a halt}} in July 1944, but Junkers was allowed to go forward with the flight testing regime on the V1 prototype. The wing section for the V2 had been completed by that time. Seventeen test flights were undertaken in total, which passed without notable incident. Minor problems, however, did arise with the turbojet engines and the RATO booster units, which proved to be unreliable over sustained periods. This initial test phase was designed purely to assess the low-speed handling qualities of the forward-swept wing, but despite this the V1 was dived at full jet power on at least one occasion, attaining a speed in the medium dive-angle employed of 660kph. To gain data on airflow patterns, small woolen tufts were glued to the airframe and the [...] "behavior" [...] of these tufts during flight was captured by a cine camera mounted on a sturdy tripod directly ahead of the plane's tailfin. After the seventeenth and last flight in late autumn of 1944, the V1 was placed in storage and the Ju 287 programme came to what was then believed to be its end. However, in March 1945, for reasons that are not entirely clear, the 287 programme was restarted, with the RLM issuing a requirement for mass production of the jet bomber (100 airframes a month) as soon as possible. The V1 prototype was taken out of storage and transferred to the Luftwaffe evaluation centre at Rechlin, but was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid before it could take to the air again. Construction on the V2 and V3 prototypes was resumed at the Junkers factory near Leipzig, and intended future variant designs (meant for service in 1946) were dusted off. These included the Ju 287B-1, seeing a return to the original powerplant choice of four 1300 kg thrust HeS 011 turbojets; and the B-2, which was to have employed two 3500 kg thrust BMW 018 turbojets. While the Heinkel turbojet was in the pre-production phase at war's end, work on BMW's radical and massively powerful turbine engine never proceeded past three barely-tested prototypes. The final Ju 287 variant design to be mooted was a Mistel combination-plane ground attack version, comprising an unmanned explosives-packed [...] "drone" [...] 287 and a manned Me 262 fighter attached {{to the top of the}} bomber by a <b>strut</b> <b>assembly.</b> The cockpit of the 287 would be replaced by a massive impact-fused warhead. Takeoff and flight control of the combination would be under the direction of the 262's pilot. The 262 would disengage from the 287 drone as the Mistel neared its target, the pilot of the fighter remotely steering the 287 for the terminal phase of its strike mission.|$|E

50|$|Ultimately, the {{evaluation}} demonstrated that she showed promise in both anti-smuggling operations {{and as a}} rapid response search and rescue vessel. But machinery breakdowns, a lack of spare parts for her Rolls Royce turbine, and a collision with a gray whale off the Point Loma Lighthouse that caused $250,000 in damage to her aft <b>strut</b> gearing <b>assembly</b> (and killed the whale) soured the Coast Guard's hopes for her use. It was continually noted in reports that her operation was more like that of an airplane than a ship, particularly her wiring systems which were similar to the wiring used in aircraft. Concerns about weight, habitability, fuel consumption, and overall costs were also prevalent. Her evaluation period ended on 18 February 1975 and she was returned to the Navy.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the {{aircraft}} was almost entirely of wood or plywood with fabric covering, steel detail fittings and struts.

40|$|Laboratory {{investigation}} {{showed that}} damages to the tail <b>strut</b> <b>assembly</b> {{of a helicopter}} were caused instantaneously under high impact load. There were no signatures of progressive failure such as fatigue {{in any of the}} components of the assembly. Also, no metallurgical abnormalities in the material of construction were responsible for the failure. Analysis suggests that the tail <b>strut</b> <b>assembly</b> suffered a high intensity impact load either because of non-absorbance of shock or hard landing.

40|$|Four tubes {{belonging}} to LH and RH <b>strut</b> <b>assembly</b> of an aircraft and the powdery substances collected from these tubes were forwarded to the laboratory for analysis. The powdery substances were brownish in colour, typical of oxide scales produced due to corrosion of steels.

Examination of the inner surface of the tubes confirmed severe corrosion {{in the form of}} pitting. Analysis suggests that the corrosion was due to presence of Cl and the most probable source of this corrodant appears to be the chloride residue left on the inner surface of the tube after the plating operation. In view of the above findings, it is suggested that the tubes in question may be withdrawn from service...|$|E
40|$|A graphite/epoxy {{metering}} truss {{as applied}} to the large space telescope was investigated. A full-scale truss was designed, fabricated and tested. Tests included static limit loadings, a modal survey and thermal-vacuum distortion evaluation. The most critical requirement was the demonstration of the dimensional stability provided by the graphite/epoxy truss concept. Crucial to the attainment of this objective was {{the ability to make}} very sophisticated thermal growth measurements which was provided by a seven beam laser interferometer. The design of the basic truss elements were tuned to provide the high degree of dimensional stability and stiffness required by the truss. The <b>struts</b> and spider <b>assembly</b> were fabricated with Fiberite's AS/ 934 and HMS/ 934 broadgoods. The rings utilized T 300 graphite fabricate with the same materials. The predicted performance of the truss was developed using the NASTRAN program. These results showed conformance with the critical stiffness and thermal distortion requirements and correlated well with the test results...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop an indigenous Magnetorheological damper or shock absorber for automotive application especially to be fitted in passenger vehicle. The research involves the design and development of the MR damper prototype, which the design was considering an optimum number of coils winding for the prototype. The research works also involve {{the development of a new}} control algorithm for the prototype where the algorithm is used to control the operation of the MR damper prototype. The algorithm is also functioning as a tool to improve the performance of the MR damper prototype. The prototype, which was made in a tube form, is suitable to be applied in vehicleรขโฌโขs suspension system. A wider range of damping characteristic of the MR damper made it suitable to be assembled in any passenger vehicleรขโฌโขs suspension system with the capacity of 2. 0 L and below. The tube design is meant for the <b>strut</b> insert <b>assembly</b> where the user just need to replace the MR damper tube in the original strut housing. The result from the tests carried out on the prototype using the dynamic loading machine shows wider damping force range characteristic, as estimated during the design phase.

40|$|A Mars rover {{prototype}} vehicle named Rocky 4 {{was designed}} and built at JPL during the fall of 1991 and spring 1992. This vehicle is the fourth {{in a series of}} rovers designed to test vehicle mobility and navigation software. Rocky 4 was the first attempt to design a vehicle with 'flight like' mass and functionality. It was consequently necessary to develop highly efficient mechanisms and structures to meet the vehicles very tight mass limit of 3 Kg for the entire mobility system (7 Kg for the full system). This paper will discuss the key mechanisms developed for the rover's innovative drive and suspension system. These are the wheel drive and <b>strut</b> <b>assembly,</b> the rocker-bogie suspension mechanism and the differential pivot. The end-to-end design, analysis, fabrication and testing of these components will also be discussed as will their performance during field testing.

40|$|A {{numerical}} study, {{using the}} INS 3 D flow solver, of laminar and turbulent flow around a two dimensional strut, and three dimensional flow around a strut in an annulus is presented. A multi-block procedure {{was used to}} calculate two dimensional laminar flow around two struts in parallel, with each strut represented by one computational block. Single block calculations were performed for turbulent flow around a two dimensional strut, using a Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model to parameterize the turbulent shear stresses. A modified Baldwin-Lomax model {{was applied to the}} case of a three dimensional strut in an annulus. The results displayed the essential features of wing-body flows, including the presence of a horseshoe vortex system at the junction of the strut and the lower annulus surface. A similar system was observed at the upper annulus surface. The test geometries discussed were useful in developing the capability to perform multiblock calculations, and to simulate turbulent flow around obstructions located between curved walls. Both of these skills will be necessary to model the three dimensional flow in the <b>strut</b> <b>assembly</b> of the SSME. Work is now in progress on performing a three dimensional two block turbulent calculation of the flow in the turnaround duct (TAD) and strut/fuel bowl juncture region...|$|E
40|$|A {{variable}} length strut device is illustrated for connecting two associated structures which includes an outer load bearing shell, a drive assembly, a length varying compliance assembly positioned by drive <b>assembly,</b> and a <b>strut</b> rod locking <b>assembly.</b> The load bearing shell includes a connecting part adapted for {{connection to a}} first associated structure. A strut connection rod has a connecting part adapted for connection to a second associated structure and a distal end having a piston driver slidably carried in a housing of compliance assembly. Two compliance pistons act in opposing directions on the piston driver to provide longitudinal compliance in a compliance mode of operation. Locking assembly includes locking balls which are urged in a locking ring as locking bolt is urged to the left by fluid pressure. Microswitches sense the displacement of pistons away from the internal ring to bring the pistons to a neutral position wherein the pistons are {{in contact with the}} internal ring when it is desired to do so as affected by a control source...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion, energy collection, {{communication}} or habitation {{in space}} requires ever larger space structures for {{the exploration of}} our solar system and beyond. Due to the payload size restrictions of the current launch vehicles, deployable structures are the way to go to launch very large structures into orbit. This paper therefore presents the design and simulation of a tensegrity based structure with inflatable rigidizable tubes as compression struts. The literature review showed that inflatable structures are most promising for the development of deployable reflectors larger than twenty meters in diameter. Good compression performance and reliability can be achieved by employing rigidisable inflatable tubes. The concept presented in this paper will focus on the development and simulation of a one meter diameter hexagonal reflector substructure that can be easily expanded to larger diameters due to its modular design. The one meter diameter modular approach was chosen to be able to build a full size benchmark model to validate the numerical data in the future. Due {{to the fact that the}} tensegrity compression elements are not initiating at one specific location, a passive reaction gas inflation technique is proposed which makes the structure independent of any pumps or other active inflation devices. This paper will discuss the use of inflatable rigidizable elements and their counteraction with the rest of the tensegrity structure. Simulations have been undertaken to capture the deployment behaviour of the inflating tube while getting perturbated by the attached tensegrity tension cables. These simulations showed that the use of inflatable rigidisable <b>struts</b> in tensegrity <b>assemblies</b> can greatly decrease the system mass and stowed volume, especially for very large reflectors compared to conventional approaches...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{environmental}} and health concerns with Electroplated Hard Chrome (EHC), the Hard Chrome Alternatives Team (HCAT) has been working to provide an alternative wear coating for EHC. The US Navy selected Tungsten-Carbide Cobalt (WC- 17 Co) High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray coating for this purpose and completed service evaluations on select aircraft components to support the HCAT charter in identifying an alternative wear coating for chrome plating. Other benefits of WC-Co thermal spray coatings over EHC are enhanced corrosion resistance, improved durability, and exceptional wear properties. As part of the HCAT charter and to evaluate HVOF coatings on operational Navy components, the P- 3 aircraft was selected for a service evaluation to determine the coating durability as compared to chrome plating. In April 1999, a VP- 30 P- 3 aircraft was outfitted with a right-hand Main Landing Gear (MLG) shock strut coated with WCCo HYOF thermal spray applied to the piston barrel and four axle journals. The HVOF coating on the piston barrel and axle journals was applied by Southwest United Industries, Inc. This HVOF coated <b>strut</b> <b>assembly</b> has since completed 6, 378 landings. Teardown analysis. for this WC-Co HVOF coated MLG asset is significant in assessing the durability of this wear coating in service relative to EHC and to substantiate Life Cycle Cost (LCC) data to support a retrograde transition from EHC to HVOF thermal spray coatings. Findings from this teardown analysis may also benefit future transitions to HVOF thermal spray coatings by identifying enhancements to finishing techniques, mating bearing and liner material improvements, improved seal materials, and improvements in HVOF coating selection...|$|E
