5|$|For {{some days}} Hendrix {{had been in}} poor health, {{due in part to}} fatigue caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and an illness assumed to be influenza-related. Insecurities about his {{personal}} relationships and disillusionment with the music industry had also contributed to his frustration. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day with Monika Dannemann. During the morning of September18, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel, 22Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., and he was taken to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where an attempt was made to resuscitate him. He was pronounced dead at 12:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|Becca becomes hurt upon {{realising}} that Bradley and Stacey {{are getting}} married. While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got away with it as she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E

60|$|She {{went on in}} silence. Her {{happiness}} was great--as {{great as}} was her pain. <b>She</b> had <b>found</b> <b>him</b> again, the man whom she worshipped, the husband whom she thought never to see again on earth. <b>She</b> had <b>found</b> <b>him,</b> and not even now--not after those terrible weeks of misery and suffering unspeakable--could she feel that love had triumphed over the wild, adventurous spirit, the reckless enthusiasm, the ardour of self-sacrifice.|$|R
25|$|Scholars {{suggest that}} Jefferson was {{particularly}} partial to a romantic attachment {{at this point}} in his life. His wife had died four years before; he had just learned of the death of his youngest daughter Lucy; and his other two daughters were away at school. At least one account held that Cosway began to develop stronger feelings for Jefferson, but when she travelled to Paris to meet him again, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> more distant.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of May 20, Garfield, against his doctor's strict orders, played several strenuous sets of tennis with a friend, {{mentioning}} {{the fact that he}} had not been to bed the night before. He met actress Iris Whitney for dinner, and afterward became suddenly ill complaining that he felt chilled. She took him to her apartment, where he refused to let her call a doctor and instead went to bed. The next morning, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> dead. Long-term heart problems, allegedly aggravated by the stress of his blacklisting, had led to his death at the age of 39.|$|E
25|$|The Brontë {{sisters were}} highly {{amused by the}} {{behaviour}} of the curates they met. Arthur Bell Nicholls (1818–1906) had been curate of Haworth for {{seven and a half}} years, when contrary to all expectations, and to the fury of Patrick Brontë (their father), he proposed to Charlotte. Although impressed by his dignity and deep voice, as well as by his near complete emotional collapse when she rejected him, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> rigid, conventional, and rather narrow-minded 'like all the curates' – as she wrote to Ellen Nussey. After she declined his proposal Nicholls, pursued by the anger of Patrick Brontë, left his functions for several months. However, little by little her feelings evolved and after slowly convincing her father, she finally married Nicholls on 29 June 1854.|$|E

25|$|When in {{the fall}} of 1880 Infanta Paz finally met Ludwig Ferdinand, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> unattractive and did not wish to marry him. Paz rebuffed the {{proposed}} marriage, but Ludwig Ferdinand did not abandon his intentions. After two years, lacking any other matrimonial prospect, Infanta Paz accepted her cousin's proposal. In January 1883, Ludwig Ferdinand returned to Spain to ask Paz in marriage. While walking together in the gardens of La casa de campo on January 22, 1883, he proposed and Paz accepted. The marriage took place in the chapel of the royal Palace of Madrid on April 2, 1883. Paz retained her rights to the Spanish crown and received an annuity of 150,000 pesetas. She was twenty years old. Among her gifts was the Bavarian sunburst tiara, which remained in the princely family until it was sold at auction in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Many of MOBA's works {{generate}} extensive discourse from visitors. Lucy in the Field with Flowers (oil {{on canvas}} by Unknown; acquired from trash in Boston) remains a favorite {{with the news}} media and patrons. [...] As the first work acquired by the museum, Lucy is [...] "a painting so powerful it commands its own preservation for posterity", setting a standard by which all future acquisitions would be compared, and causing MOBA's founders to question if Scott Wilson found Lucy or <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|Janey's {{relationship}} with Rossetti had continued through a correspondence and occasional visits, although <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> extremely paranoid and was upset by his addiction to chloral. She last {{saw him in}} 1881, and he died in April the following year. Morris described his mixed feelings toward his deceased friend by stating that he had [...] "some of the very greatest qualities of genius, most of them indeed; what a great man {{he would have been}} but for the arrogant misanthropy which marred his work, and killed him before his time". In August 1883, Janey would be introduced to the poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, with whom she embarked on a second affair, which Morris might have been aware of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, come, Polly, that won't do. What do {{you know}} about tailors and college matters?" [...] said Tom, looking as much {{confused}} as if <b>she</b> had <b>found</b> <b>him</b> out in something reprehensible.|$|R

500|$|O'Hara's last film of 1947 {{was playing}} a Creole woman {{opposite}} Rex Harrison in John M. Stahl's The Foxes of Harrow, set in pre-Civil War New Orleans. TCM state that O'Hara had been [...] "angling" [...] to star in Forever Amber (1947), Fox's big [...] historical romance at the time, but believe that due to a contractual clause, neither of her joint contract owners, Fox and RKO, would accept her appearing in a [...] "major star vehicle" [...] at the time. During the production O'Hara and Harrison intensely disliked each other from the outset, and <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> to be [...] "rude, vulgar, and arrogant". Harrison had thought that she disliked him simply because he was British. He reportedly belched in her face during dance sequences and accused her of anti-Semitism, being married to a Jewish woman (Lilli Palmer) at the time, which she vehemently denied. Variety, while acknowledging the length, thought that O'Hara and Harrison carried off their dramatic scenes with [...] "surprising skill". The following year, O'Hara starred opposite Robert Young in the commercially successful comedy film, Sitting Pretty. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised O'Hara and Young as husband and wife, remarking that they were [...] "delightfully clever", acting with [...] "elaborate indignation, alternating with good-natured despair".|$|E
500|$|On 13 July 1942, the Franks {{were joined}} by the van Pels family: Hermann, Auguste, and 16-year-old Peter, and then in November by Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family. Frank wrote of her {{pleasure}} at having new people to talk to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing her room with Pfeffer, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> to be insufferable and resented his intrusion, and she clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom she regarded as foolish. She regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly {{in regard to the}} amount of food they consumed. Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance. She received her first kiss from him, but her infatuation with him began to wane as she questioned whether her feelings for him were genuine, or resulted from their shared confinement. Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. He observed that Anne's closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl, [...] "the young typist... the two of them often stood whispering in the corner." ...|$|E
500|$|Around this time, King Carol I of Romania {{was looking}} for a {{suitable}} bride for Crown Prince Ferdinand, in order to secure the succession and assure the continuation of the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Possibly motivated by the prospect of removing tensions between Russia and Romania on the subject of control over Bessarabia, the Duchess of Edinburgh suggested that Marie meet Ferdinand. Marie and Ferdinand first became acquainted during a [...] dinner and the pair conversed in German. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> shy but amiable, and their second meeting went just as well. Once the pair were formally engaged, Queen Victoria wrote to another granddaughter, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, that [...] " [...] is nice & the Parents are charming–but the country is very insecure & the immorality of the Society at Bucharest quite awful. Of course the marriage will be delayed some time as Missy won't be 17 till the end of October!" [...] German Empress Victoria, Marie's aunt, wrote to her daughter, Crown Princess Sophia of Greece, that [...] "Missy is till now quite delighted, but the poor child is so young, how can she guess what is before her?" [...] In late 1892, King Carol visited London {{in order to meet the}} Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Victoria, who eventually agreed to the marriage and appointed him a Knight of the Garter.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with trying}} to make Flavor a success, Khadijah also spent time looking for Mr. Right. <b>She</b> {{eventually}} <b>found</b> <b>him</b> in childhood friend Scooter (Cress Williams) with whom she left the brownstone for the final time in the series finale.|$|R
60|$|Now {{she began}} to think how she never minded her husband leaving her in the morning, and how <b>she</b> never <b>found</b> <b>him</b> {{neglecting}} {{to give her a}} sweet drink out of a gold cup just as she was going to bed.|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke with}} so little emotion, so reasonably, that <b>she</b> <b>found</b> herself {{answering}} <b>him,</b> notwithstanding her bewilderment, almost in the same key.|$|R
500|$|In April 1940 Mitford {{suffered}} {{her second}} miscarriage. Shortly afterwards Rodd, {{who had been}} commissioned into the Welsh Guards, departed overseas. Alone in London, Mitford moved to the family's Rutland Gate house where she remained during the London blitz. The main house had been requisitioned to provide a refuge for Jewish families evacuated from the bombed areas of the East End. Mitford {{spent much of her}} time looking after these families, [...] "so hard-working, clean and grateful". A brief affair with a [...] Free French officer, André Roy, resulted in a third pregnancy. Mitford again miscarried, with complications that led, in November 1941, to a hysterectomy. After convalescence, at a loose end, she began working as an assistant at the Heywood Hill bookshop in Curzon Street. The shop became the centre of Mitford's daily activities, and was a favoured meeting place for London's literati. In September 1942 she met Gaston Palewski, a French colonel attached to General Charles de Gaulle's London staff. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> fascinating, and he became the love of her life—though her feelings were never fully reciprocated—and an inspiration for much of her future writing. For the sake of Mitford's reputation the affair was pursued with discretion, before Palewski left for Algeria in May 1943. Thereafter the relationship was conducted mainly by letters and occasional phone calls, since Palewski was only intermittently in England {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{learning}} of his mistress' arrest, Pasternak telephoned Liuisa Popova {{and asked her}} to come at once to Gogol Boulevard. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> sitting on a bench near the Palace of Soviets Metro Station. Weeping, Pasternak told her, [...] "Everything is finished now. They've taken her away from me and I'll never see her again. It's like death, even worse." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1962 {{under an}} {{arrangement}} with premier Zhou Enlai, Puyi married his fifth and last wife, Li Shuxian, a nurse of Han Chinese ethnicity. They had no children. She {{died of lung}} cancer in 1997. Li Shuxian recounted that they dated for six months before the marriage, and <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> to be, [...] "...a man who desperately needed my love and was ready to give me as much love as he could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{pray for}} you," [...] said she; for <b>she</b> had <b>found</b> <b>him</b> out at last, {{perceived}} {{the nature of}} the bow he sought to draw across her heart-strings, and, having perceived it, contempt awoke in her. He had attempted to move her by unfair, insidious means.|$|R
50|$|In September 1862, Rutherford {{was injured}} in battle in Middleton, Maryland.

2500|$|The Buxton {{family was}} {{involved}} in the Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co brewing company which had originated in the East End of London but had expanded to Burton upon Trent. Cyril Buxton was a director of the company. [...] In 1892, he was troubled by depression, allegedly brought on by liver disease, and was staying at his father's estate in Essex; he told his nurse he was going downstairs and when she went to look for him, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> dead with a gun at his side.|$|E
2500|$|From his children, Boyle {{expected}} obedience, {{although he}} was [...] a genuinely [...] affectionate father, and [...] far [...] more forgiving of opposition from them than from [...] his political enemies. Lady Mary, [...] "my unruly daughter" [...] angered her father by refusing to marry Lord Clanbrassil on the rather modern ground that <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> repulsive, [...] and again by marrying the [...] future Earl of Warwick, who was [...] then a penniless younger son, [...] against her father's wishes; but they were soon reconciled and he furnished [...] her with a generous dowry.|$|E
2500|$|Actor Jed Mills, who competed against Alcala as [...] "Bachelor #2", later {{described}} him as a [...] "very strange guy" [...] with [...] "bizarre opinions". [...] Alcala won the contest, and a date with [...] "bachelorette" [...] Cheryl Bradshaw, who subsequently refused {{to go out with}} him, [...] according to published reports, because <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> [...] "creepy". Criminal profiler Pat Brown, noting that Alcala killed Robin Samsoe and at least two other women after his Dating Game appearance, speculated that Bradshaw's rejection might have been an exacerbating factor. [...] "One wonders what that did in his mind", Brown said. [...] "That is something he would not take too well. [...] don't understand the rejection. They think that something is wrong with that girl: 'She played me. She played hard to get.'" ...|$|E
