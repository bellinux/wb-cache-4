Cyrus cited her various controversial moments {{as the reason}} behind this, claiming she only wanted to travel where she felt [...] "the most love". Following the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus officially parted ways with longtime record label Hollywood Records. With Hannah Montana now officially over, Cyrus announced that she planned to take a hiatus from music to focus on her film career. She commented, [...] "I've not taken, like, acting lessons or anything, but it doesn't mean I don't need to because I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do...</b> I'm probably going to go book an acting coach." [...] She later confirmed {{she would not be}} going to college for the time being, stating that [...] " [...] a firm believer that you can go back at any age you want", and that she [...] " [...] worked hard to get to where [...] now, and [...] to enjoy it while it lasts".|$|E

6000|$|... ‘These {{are both}} friends of yours, Harry?’ said the lady. ‘Delighted, I am <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{remember}} {{to have met}} Mr. Challoner.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> S'pose I'd {{be taking}} {{any of his}} old tea, bought of the British?--fling every teacup in his face first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Ay, my dear, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> ask ye--to be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> now <b>I</b> {{think of}} it--but I had quite forgot it. To ride back with me, did you say, dear Milly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but, father," [...] said Rollo eagerly, in reply, [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not mean}} to. I was picking berries so busy, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not observe where I was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You did as {{you thought}} right.' Strange to say, Theodora had more sympathy for Violet after this awkward evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "----this Iduna {{has thrown}} you over, at which I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wonder, what mistresses {{have you in}} Byzantium, Olaf the Dane?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These {{are both}} friends of yours, Harry?" [...] said the lady. [...] "Delighted, I am <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{remember}} {{to have met}} Mr. Challoner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They did jump, and Louise began apologizing in {{a perfect}} gabble, and mademoiselle said I had de l'esprit, but <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mean it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> for <b>I</b> aimed {{right at}} him, and he wasn't over twenty feet away," [...] was the reply. [...] "Wonder if he'll come back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is {{what comes}} of teazing him,' said Mrs. Hazleby reproachfully to Edward; who {{answered}} in a loud voice, 'I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not make him do it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not want}} to go, dear," [...] said Cicely, with the smile of good-fellowship that always went {{to the heart of}} Miriam.|$|E
6000|$|What {{would have}} {{happened}} I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know; but just then the Vrouw Prinsloo came up and caught her husband by the arm, exclaiming: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} that,' said Miss Castle. 'But {{what is the}} good of it? Does it make them any pleasanter to listen to?' ...|$|E
60|$|Bend. [To DOR.] I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my part {{to poison}} thee, What saint soe'er has {{soldered}} thee again: A dose less hot had burst through ribs of iron.|$|R
6000|$|... "Father," [...] said Alric {{with a look}} of glee, [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not boast. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> but {{point to}} my poor weapons. Besides, I have good legs. If I cannot fight, methinks I can run." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'His father! I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not say a tenth part of {{what the}} fellow richly deserves. If the young gentleman is so touchy, he had better go back to Ireland again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought she}} stared at me too," [...] Edgar said. [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know her. I don't think I have ever seen her face before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} so," [...] {{returned}} Charlotte, timidly glancing her eye at her mother; [...] "besides, I feel bound in honour to remember your original intention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh Yes. <b>Sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think so, myself." [...] Carl said {{it with a}} {{spurious}} society manner. In Gertie's aristocratic presence he {{desired to}} keep aloof from all vulgar persons.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't insulted you, Mrs Stumfold. And if {{you don't}} {{like to tell}} me, you needn't. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{want you to come}} to me and talk in this way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Willie, how comes it {{that you}} know? I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mean to tell you. I promised I never would. I must have let it out inadvertently, or when I was asleep." ...|$|R
60|$|That day, when Breed {{brought me}} my dinner on my gallery, {{he did not}} speak of a visitor. You may be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mention the circumstance. But Breed always told me the outside news.|$|R
6000|$|So Dorothy dried {{her eyes}} and said, [...] "I suppose we must try it; but I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish}} to {{inconvenience}} her," [...] said Marian; [...] "but there must be many young ladies who would be {{only too happy to}} take the part." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no heart}} for it, Mildred, I don't {{feel as though}} I could work; and, if you cannot make me forget, I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know what will." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS TARLETON. Well, I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> {{know what}} youre talking about; and I only hope you know yourselves. However, you shall {{have what you}} want, of course. [She goes {{up the steps and}} leaves the room].|$|R
60|$|To be <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not expect}} that every house in Liverpool {{must be a}} Leaning Tower of Pisa, or a Strasbourg Cathedral; but yet, these edifices I must confess, were a sad and bitter {{disappointment}} to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, he {{got over}} it, {{and perhaps it}} was a bad case and perhaps it was not; but you may be <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not go near it, for I {{considered}} it my duty to keep away, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> keep away, but the trouble is--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not in {{the least}} know what are his lordship's views," [...] said Lizzie in scorn, [...] "and, to tell the truth, I do not very much care." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{would n't}} mind," [...] said the lamb again; [...] "I shall grow more wool by wintertime, and I 'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> n't look {{any worse than}} you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{has been}} so to me, I am <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not know how to}} thank you; only I am grieved that you have hurt yourself. I hope you are better now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} it,' humbly {{answered}} Phoebe. 'He is very kind and amusing, and Miss Charlecote is {{so fond of}} him that, of course, we must be together; but I never meant to neglect you, Robin, dear.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} how we were to get ready, or what we were to do, but my main idea was that no time was to be lost in doing something. The first thing was to awaken our friends.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not say {{anything}} wrong,' said Jane, 'and I suppose it is like that. A gentleman has to find out whom he likes best. And as he liked Miss Bolton best, I think it's a thousand pities they should be parted.' ...|$|R
