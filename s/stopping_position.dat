25|$|Investigators {{have focused}} on {{speeding}} by the 23-year-old driver, Ryūjirō Takami (who was among the dead), as being the most likely cause of the derailment. 25 minutes before the derailment, Takami had run a red light, causing the automatic train stop (ATS) to bring the train to a halt. The train had also overshot the correct <b>stopping</b> <b>position</b> at an earlier stop at Itami Station, requiring him {{to back up the}} train, and resulting in a 90-second delay, about 4 minutes before the disaster.

On lap 40, Coulthard set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:14.710, while moved into fifth after overtaking Diniz and made his pit stop one lap later, rejoining in eleventh. On the next lap, Ralf Schumacher made another pit stop and remerged in 15th. de la Rosa retired with an gearbox failure on lap 46, while Fisichella went out one lap later with engine problems. Race leader Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on lap 49 and retained a ten-second lead over Frentzen. Mazzacane made a pit stop on the same lap and missed his <b>stopping</b> <b>position</b> striking one of his team's mechanics. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 53. By the end of lap 55, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the order was Michael Schumacher, Barrichello, Frentzen, Villeneuve, Coulthard, Diniz, Zonta, Irvine, Alesi, Heidfeld, Wurz, Herbert, Gene, Ralf Schumacher and Mazzacane. Diniz made two more pit stops on laps 58 and 59 and dropped to tenth.|$|E

Alesi became the race's final retirement when he retired with an engine failure on the same lap. Four laps later, Michael Schumacher spun off after putting a wheel onto the grass but retained the lead. He crossed the finish line on lap 73 to win his seventh win {{of the season in}} a time of 1'36:30.883 at an average speed of 190.240 km/h. Barrichello finished second 12.1 seconds behind, ahead of Frentzen in third, Villeneuve in fourth, Coulthard in fifth and Zonta rounding out the points scoring positions in sixth. Irvine in seventh was the last driver on the lead lap, with Diniz, Heidfeld, Wurz, Herbert, and Gené the last of the classified runners, albeit one lap behind.|$|E

40|$|A new sensor {{provides}} an absolute position measurement. A schematic {{view of a}} motorized linear-translation stage that contains, at each end, an electronic unit that functions as both (1) a non-contact sensor that measures the absolute position of the stage and (2) a non-contact equivalent of a limit switch that is tripped when the stage reaches the nominal limit position. The need for such an absolute linear position-sensor/limit-sensor unit arises {{in the case of}} a linear-translation stage that is part of a larger system in which the actual <b>stopping</b> <b>position</b> of the stage (relative to the nominal limit position) must be known. Because inertia inevitably causes the stage to run somewhat past the nominal limit position, tripping of a standard limit switch or other limit sensor does not provide the required indication of the actual <b>stopping</b> <b>position.</b> This innovative sensor unit operates on an electromagnetic-induction principle similar to that of linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs...|$|E

40|$|Braking to a {{full stop}} at a {{prescribed}} target position is a driving manoeuvre regularly used in experiments to investigate driving behaviour or to test vehicle acceleration feedback systems in simulators. Many different performance measures {{have been reported in}} the literature for analysing braking. These may or may not be useful to analyse the stopping manoeuvre, because a number of potential problems exist: 1) the scores on a measure may be insufficiently reliable, 2) the measure may be invalid, or 3) the measure may be strongly intercorrelated. A simulation and empirical study were conducted to analyse various measures. From the simulation study it was concluded that 1) An R 2 measure based on the speed vs time relationship can be used to measure deviations from a constant deceleration, 2) minimum time-to-collision is sensitive to target position offsets, and 3) mean TTC-dot can capture braking behaviour characteristics but the required definition of a begin and end sample-point for its calculation is a disadvantage. The empirical study calculated a set of measures using data of 60 participants driving a simulation-based session of 10 stops. It is concluded that reliable and valid measures for a braking experiment are provided by the speed and distance to the target position at braking onset, the <b>stopping</b> <b>position</b> with respect to the target and the R 2 measure to measure deviations from a constant deceleration. Recommended additional measures are: The mean speed of the complete braking manoeuvre, <b>stopping</b> <b>position</b> consistency, maximum deceleration and onset jerk.
