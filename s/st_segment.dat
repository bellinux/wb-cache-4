25|$|In {{the setting}} of acute chest pain, the {{electrocardiogram}} is the investigation that most reliably distinguishes between various causes. The ECG should be done as early as practicable, including in the ambulance if possible. If this indicates acute heart damage (elevation in the <b>ST</b> <b>segment,</b> new left bundle branch block), treatment for {{a heart attack in}} the form of angioplasty or thrombolysis is indicated immediately (see below). In the absence of such changes, {{it is not possible to}} immediately distinguish between unstable angina and NSTEMI.|$|E
25|$|ST {{elevation}} myocardial infarctions {{have different}} characteristic ECG findings {{based on the}} amount of time elapsed since the MI first occurred. The earliest sign is hyperacute T waves, peaked T-waves due to local hyperkalemia in ischemic myocardium. This then progresses over a period of minutes to elevations of the <b>ST</b> <b>segment</b> by at least 1nbsp&mm. Over a period of hours, a pathologic Q wave may appear and the T wave will invert. Over a period of days the ST elevation will resolve. Pathologic q waves generally will remain permanently.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} few hours the <b>ST</b> <b>segments</b> usually begin to rise. Pathological Q waves may appear within hours or may take greater than 24 hr. The T wave will {{generally}} become inverted in the first 24 hours, as the ST elevation begins to resolve.|$|R
25|$|An ECG {{that reveals}} <b>ST</b> <b>segment</b> {{elevation}} or new left bundle branch block suggests complete blockage {{of one of}} the main coronary arteries. These patients require immediate reperfusion (re-opening) of the occluded vessel. This can be achieved in two ways: thrombolysis (clot-busting medication) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Both of these are effective in reducing significantly the mortality of myocardial infarction. Many centers are now moving to the use of PTCA as it is somewhat more effective than thrombolysis if it can be administered early. This may involve transfer to a nearby facility with facilities for angioplasty.|$|E
25|$|In angina {{patients}} momentarily {{not feeling}} any chest pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically normal unless {{there have been}} other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression, or elevation of the <b>ST</b> <b>segment</b> may be observed. To elicit these changes, an exercise ECG test ("treadmill test") may be performed, during which the patient exercises to his/her maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness, or pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the pulse rate can lead to some conclusion regarding angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischemia: blood pressure response (or lack thereof, in particular, a drop in systolic blood pressure), dysrhythmia and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram (in patients unable to exercise enough {{for the purposes of the}} treadmill tests, e.g., due to asthma or arthritis or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or Stress Echocardiography.|$|E

BACKGROUND Previous studies have shown decreased HF-QRS in the frequency range of 150 – 250 Hz during acute myocardial ischemia. It would be important to know whether the high-frequency analysis could add information to that available from the <b>ST</b> <b>segments</b> in the standard ECG. METHODS The study population consisted of 52 patients undergoing prolonged balloon occlusion during PTCA. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (SAECG) were recorded prior to and during the balloon inflation. The HF-QRS were determined within a bandwidth of 150 – 250 Hz in the preinflation and inflation SAECGs. The ST-segment deviation during inflation was determined in the standard frequency range. RESULTS The sensitivity for detecting acute coronary artery occlusion was 88 % using the high-frequency method. In 71 % of the patients there was ST elevation during inflation. If both ST elevation and depression were considered, the sensitivity was 79 %. The sensitivity was significantly higher using the high-frequency method, p < 0. 002, compared with the assessment of ST elevation.

40|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of patients}} with acute coronary syndromes is directly depends on risk, so it is necessary for the risk stratification to be carried out both at the admittance and during the treatment phase, as well as after the dismissal from hospital. There are many variables that influence the risk, being categorized as either high or low. It is important to emphasise that low risk doesn’t mean that there is no risk at all. The sort of therapic approach that would be applied depends on electrocardiogramic presentation of acute isochemical syndrome. If the patient with persistant elevation of <b>ST</b> <b>segments</b> is in question, then the first step is aimed at achieving reperfusion by the trombolitical therapy application or primary percutanae coronary intervention. Trombolisis is not applied in case of a patient who doesn’t have a persistant ST elevation, but expresses <b>ST</b> <b>segments</b> depression, change of T waves or has a normal electrocardiograme (acute coronary syndrome without persistant ST evaluation). If there is a high risk, the inhibitors of receptors Gp llb/lla and higher coronary angiography are applied. However, if there is a low risk, troponines are determined again. If troponines are positive, the procedure is the same as in patient with high risk; if troponines are negative two times, further procedure depens on the stress test results. A long-term treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome is necessary in order to prevent new cardic events to come into being. It presuposes life style change, modification of risk factors as well a medications for second prevention...|$|R

(1) Changes during cooling Prolongation of R-R, P-Q, and Q-T intervals were marked compared to {{in the case of}} general hypothermia. QRS widened markedly and R wave appeared in earlier stage than in the latter. R wave was rather depressed instead of increase of amplitude which was seen in the case of general hypothermia. There were found no marked changes in R, Q and S waves as in the latter. Invertion of T occurred but no depression of <b>ST</b> <b>segments</b> were observed. (2) Changes during inflow tract occlusion Within ten to fifteen minutes following the occlusion R-R was markedly prolonged, R wave markedly depressed, QRS widened and T wave elevated.
