40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 A new {{pre-tensioned}} precast bridge {{system has}} been developed that provides seismic regions the means to construct high-performance bridges that can be built quickly. The columns are designed to rock as rigid bodies, and their ends are protected against damage by a <b>steel</b> <b>shoe</b> detail. The precast feature of the system will reduce traffic delays by moving construction off-site. The pretensioning feature leads to reduced residual displacements after an earthquake. The use of epoxy-coated strands and the quality control available in a precasting plant lead to enhanced durability. The seismic performance of the system was evaluated with pseudo-static tests of two column-footing sub-assemblies. In one column-footing sub-assembly, a ductile fiber-reinforced concrete (HyFRC developed by Ostertag) was used to fill the <b>steel</b> <b>shoe</b> and the region immediately above it. This column also contained a steel dowel bar that extended down {{from the body of}} the column into the footing. The other column did not possess any ductile concrete or dowel bar. During the tests, the columns had very low residual displacements and negligible damage to the concrete, even after being subjected to drift ratios of over 10 %...|$|E
40|$|Horse {{racing is}} a multi-billion-dollar {{industry}} that has raised welfare concerns due to injured and euthanized animals. Whilst the cause of musculoskeletal injuries that lead to horse morbidity and mortality is multifactorial, pre-existing pathologies, increased speeds and substrate of the racecourse are likely contributors to foot disease. Horse hooves {{have the ability to}} naturally deform during locomotion and dissipate locomotor stresses, yet farriery approaches are utilised to increase performance and protect hooves from wear. Previous studies have assessed the effect of different shoe designs on locomotor performance; however, no biomechanical study has hitherto measured the effect of horseshoes on the stresses of the foot skeleton in vivo. This preliminary study introduces a novel methodology combining three-dimensional data from biplanar radiography with inverse dynamics methods and finite element analysis (FEA) to evaluate the effect of a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>shoe</b> on the function of a Thoroughbred horse 2 ̆ 7 s forefoot during walking. Our preliminary results suggest that the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>shoe</b> shifts craniocaudal, mediolateral and vertical GRFs at mid-stance. We document a similar pattern of flexion-extension in the PIP (pastern) and DIP (coffin) joints between the unshod and shod conditions, with slight variation in rotation angles throughout the stance phase. For both conditions, the PIP and DIP joints begin in a flexed posture and extend over the entire stance phase. At mid-stance, small differences in joint angle are observed in the PIP joint, with the shod condition being more extended than the unshod horse, whereas the DIP joint is extended more in the unshod than the shod condition. We also document that the DIP joint extends more than the PIP after midstance and {{until the end of the}} stance in both conditions. Our FEA analysis, conducted solely on the bones, shows increased von Mises and Maximum principal stresses on the forefoot phalanges in the shod condition at mid-stance, consistent with the tentative conclusion that a <b>steel</b> <b>shoe</b> might increase mechanical loading. However, because of our limited sample size none of these apparent differences have been tested for statistical significance. Our preliminary study illustrates how the shoe may influence the dynamics and mechanics of a Thoroughbred horse 2 ̆ 7 s forefoot during slow walking, but more research is needed to quantify the effect of the shoe on the equine forefoot during the whole stance phase, at faster speeds/gaits and with more individuals as well as with a similar focus on the hind feet. We anticipate that our preliminary analysis using advanced methodological approaches will pave the way for new directions in research on the form/function relationship of the equine foot, with the ultimate goal to minimise foot injuries and improve animal health and welfare...|$|E
40|$|The {{present day}} {{paradigm}} of equine hoof care fails to both define and {{solve some of}} the most common health problems seen in the equine industry. Traditional hoof care methods are unable to maintain soundness, nor bring lasting relief to ailing horses due to reliance on traditional farrier methods which are incompatible with the normal physiologic needs of equine species. The new paradigm of hoof care respects the hoof’s ability to protect sensitive inner structures, adjust itself in response to the environment, promote proper circulation, exfoliate old tissue, replace itself over time and have a keen ability to sense the environment. Application of <b>steel</b> <b>shoes</b> prevents all of these vital functions and alters the form of hooves to such severe degrees that shod horses can not be deemed sound. Instead of providing the hoof protection, support and traction, <b>steel</b> <b>shoes</b> promote weakening and deterioration of the hoof, disrupt natural support mechanisms and disallow normal traction on all terrains. Protection for the hoof should be afforded the horse through the use of boots made of dynamic materials which complement the nature of the hoof. Veterinarians and other equine professionals are obligated to examine the evidence that shoeing horses is harmful and replace traditional hoof care practices with techniques that keep horses sound, return lame horses to health, and abandon the use of nailed on shoes, thus doing no harm to the animals...|$|R

40|$|Scuffing as a {{phenomenon}} {{has been studied}} for many years, however, the mechanism underlying scuffing remains unexplained. Recent {{findings suggest that the}} most significant changes occur in the top 50 ??? 100 nm of the surface, not at the micron level as previously suggested. The goal {{of this study is to}} identify different layers and their material properties on Al 390 -T 6 disk surface and incorporate them into a thermomechanical Finite Element model to compare with tribological testing in a High Pressure Tribometer that simulates the contact in actual air conditioning compressor surfaces. Experimental, analytical and Finite Element studies of the nanoindentation technique are developed and used to investigate the material properties of surface layers less than 100 nm thick. All the methods are first verified in simple cases such as homogeneous materials and deposited thin film, then applied to rougher engineering Al 390 - T 6 sample. The thin surface layers and the corresponding properties obtained from the above studies are then integrated into a thermomechanical FEM model to study the scuffing mechanism for the Al 390 -T 6 disk and <b>steel</b> <b>shoe</b> sliding contact condition experienced in the High Pressure Tribometer that simulates realistic tribological contact in air conditioning compressor surfaces. It is shown that the FEM for nanoindentation is very useful as it is able to obtain additional properties and quantify properties of layers. It is found that a simple thermomechanical macro model does not provide sufficient information about the cause of scuffing. A FEM asperity-based micromodel is then built and successfully shows that the local contact stress and temperature increase could be extremely high under the critical loading. Also, it shows that scuffing should be a combination effect of stress and temperature increase. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 12...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{to better}} {{understand}} scuffing began approximately sixty years ago, when it was postulated that scuffing occurs when a critical temperature of the surface is reached, at which desorption of surface films occurs. An extension to this hypothesis was proposed suggesting interaction of chemically active species with the metal surfaces, notably oxygen and thus scuffing {{would be associated with}} the rate of oxide formation and destruction. In the 1950 ???s another major development in the field of tribology was started which recognized and understood elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) became the focus of study and it was assumed that a system is in danger of scuffing when the thickness of the fluid film between the surfaces. Recent fundamental scuffing studies related to air conditioning compressors under dry sliding conditions were performed by Sheiretov, who proposed a process leading to subsurface failure, which eventually led to scuffing. Further studies carried by Yoon focusing on scuffing under starved lubrication conditions (typical conditions for air conditioning compressors), suggested that scuffing was related to shear failure of the bulk material which was caused by formation of macroscopic adhesions at the sliding interface. In these recent studies the effect of surface topography on scuffing has not been treated thoroughly. Further more their approach was based on macro -tribological experiments and meso-to-micro analysis methods. This was intentional since the surface roughness of typical engineering surfaces is large with Ra values from 0. 1 to 1 mm, thus the previous researchers were seeking average effects in their studies. Also earlier studies did not examine the progression leading to scuffing. In the present study we investigate, first; the progression of surface topography and respective change in surface parameters with tribological testing leading to scuffing; second, changes in chemical composition of the surface and near surface layers of the sample at the micro and nano-meter scales, and investigate its relation to scuffing, this study differs from the ones carried out by its predecessors (Sheiretov, Yoon) in that it tracks topographical and chemical changes of the interface surface of the (softer) aluminum disc as it progresses form its virgin state to its scuffed state. Furthermore the analyses are carried out using macro to nanometer scales and techniques. To our knowledge this is the first such comprehensive study that will investigate the use of techniques that are typically used in semi -conductors and MEMS applications, whose surfaces are by several orders smoother than the engineering surfaces that will be used in this study. A shoe-on-disc geometry, which is used to carry out the experiments consists of a <b>steel</b> <b>shoe</b> on aluminum disc and in an approximate simulation of a swash-plate/shoe contact in an automotive swash [...] plate compressor. The High Pressure Tribometer (HPT) is used to simulate the progression of wear conditions. The refrigerant used in this case is R 410 A with a POE lubricant. Once the experimental samples have been tested on the HPT, two sets of analytical tests are run, the first to measure the surface roughness and extract the statistical parameters, and the second to analyze chemical composition of the surfaces and the nano-meter range sub-surfaces. Based on the study it is suggested that the use of the micro to nano meter range scales in analyzing engineering surfaces is appropriate and correlates well to the macro to meso scale wear results. Thus the goal of this thesis Is to investigate the evolution of both the topographical and chemical characteristics as the surface of an aluminum alloy is worn out in a swash plate compressor using macro to nano-scales.

50|$|The {{controversy}} currently surrounding equine podiatry {{is whether}} or not horses should be shod or left barefoot. Traditionally, the practice of horseshoeing was implemented to prevent wear of the hoof wall; however, the modern argument is that traditional farriery with <b>steel</b> <b>shoes</b> can restrict natural flexion of the hoof wall, cause hoof deformities, induce lameness, and increase the incidence of horse injury. It is stated that these ailments result from the horseshoe’s tendency to distribute concussive forces unevenly across the foot. Proponents of this side are of the belief that horses should be left barefoot and given ample opportunity to develop the internal and external hoof tissues by natural means. For example, regular impact on firm ground stimulates sensory receptors in the hoof that, in turn, induce a physiologic response to promote strengthening of the hoof wall and an increased sole thickness.|$|R
