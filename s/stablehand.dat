500|$|The borough has a {{place in}} several American idioms.

The iconic Flatiron Building {{is said to have}} been the source of the phrase [...] "23 skidoo" [...] or scram, from what cops would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of women's dresses being blown up by the winds created by the triangular building. The [...] "Big Apple" [...] dates back to the 1920s, when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans <b>stablehands</b> to refer to New York City's horse racetracks and named his racing column [...] "Around The Big Apple." [...] Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world's jazz capital, and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau helped popularize the term.|$|R
