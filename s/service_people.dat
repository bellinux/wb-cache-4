25|$|The {{heaviest}} losses among ethnic Poles {{were experienced}} {{by people with}} secondary and higher education, who were targeted by the occupiers and of whom a third or more had not survived. Academics and professional people suffered the most. According to Kochanski, only about 10% of the human losses of Poland were a result of military action; the rest came from intentional exterminations, persecutions, war and occupation hardships and the attendant attrition. 800,000 Poles became permanently disabled and large numbers failed to return from abroad, which further reduced the manpower potential of Poland. 105,000 <b>service</b> <b>people,</b> or about one-half of the soldiers enlisted in the Polish Armed Forces in the West, returned to Poland after the war.|$|E

People with highly variable jobs such as emergency room nurses may appreciate [...] "have a routine day", while mothers of young children may wish to [...] "have a quiet day". Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008book Have a Nice Day Is Not Thank You, and No Problem Is Not You're Welcome that <b>service</b> <b>people</b> should say [...] "thank you" [...] instead of [...] "have a nice day". She argued that [...] "thank you" [...] is shorter and is a [...] "recognition of the ability you have to thank someone", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future. Paul V. Marshall, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem, concurred, writing in the Reading Eagle that he prefers [...] "thank you" [...] to [...] "have a nice day" [...] or [...] "have a great day" [...] even though [...] "thank you" [...] has a [...] "host of socially acceptable responses". He stated that when people say [...] "thank you", they admit that they are dependent on others, {{which leads to a}} healthier, safer society.|$|E

2500|$|La Pietà, another work by Michelangelo, is a 1499 {{example of}} Renaissance {{sculpture}} housed in St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. On 21 May 1972, mentally disturbed geologist Laszlo Toth, aged 33, attacked the statue {{with a hammer}} while yelling [...] "I am Jesus Christ!", chipping the Virgin Mary's left eyelid, neck, head, veil and left forearm; the forearm fell on the floor, causing the fingers to break. Most broken pieces were collected by the <b>service</b> <b>people</b> but some were taken by tourists. The sculpture was repaired and is now protected by bulletproof glass.

The ship was sold, renamed Ruth Alexander in 1923 and put into coastwise passenger and cargo service between Puget Sound and Mexico, typically calling at Seattle, Victoria, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and (by 1931) Ensenada, Mexico, until finally converted to a cargo ship in 1939.|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, Parham {{moved to}} Houston, Texas, {{where he started}} a Bible {{training}} school. One of his students was William J. Seymour, a one-eyed black preacher. Seymour traveled to Los Angeles where his preaching sparked the three-year-long Azusa Street Revival in 1906. The revival first broke out on Monday April 9, 1906 at 214 Bonnie Brae Street and then moved to 312 Azusa Street on Friday, April 14, 1906. Worship at the racially integrated Azusa Mission featured an absence of any order of <b>service.</b> <b>People</b> preached and testified as moved by the Spirit, spoke and sung in tongues, and fell in the Spirit. The revival attracted both religious and secular media attention, and thousands of visitors flocked to the mission, carrying the [...] "fire" [...] back to their home churches. Despite the work of various Wesleyan groups such as Parham's and D. L. Moody's revivals, {{the beginning of the}} widespread Pentecostal movement in the US is generally considered to have begun with Seymour's Azusa Street Revival.|$|E

60|$|Last {{night had}} marked an immense {{step forward in}} her social career; without running after the {{patronage}} of influential personages she had seen it quietly and tactfully put at her <b>service.</b> <b>People</b> such as the Grafin von Tolb {{were going to be}} a power in the London world {{for a very long time}} to come. Herr von Kwarl, with all his useful qualities of brain and temperament, might conceivably fall out of favour in some unexpected turn of the political wheel, and the Shalems would probably have their little day and then a long afternoon of diminishing social importance; the placid dormouse-like Grafin would outlast them all. She had the qualities which make either for contented mediocrity or else for very durable success, according as circumstances may dictate. She was one of those characters that can neither thrust themselves to the front, nor have any wish to do so, but being there, no ordinary power can thrust them away.|$|E

I had {{intended}} to be early with the Secretary this morning, when my man admitted upstairs one Mr. Newcomb,(17) an officer, who brought me {{a letter from the}} Bishop of Clogher, with four lines added by Mrs. Ashe, all about that Newcomb. I think, indeed, his case is hard, but God knows whether I shall be able to do him any <b>service.</b> <b>People</b> will not understand: I am a very good second, but I care not to begin a recommendation, unless it be for an intimate friend. However, I will do what I can. I missed the Secretary, and then walked to Chelsea to dine with the Dean of Christ Church,(18) who was engaged to Lord Orrery with some other Christ Church men. He made me go with him whether I would or not, for they have this long time admitted me a Christ Church man. Lord Orrery, generally every winter, gives his old acquaintance of that college a dinner. There were nine clergymen at table, and four laymen. The Dean and I soon left them, and after a visit or two, I went to Lord Masham's, and Lord Treasurer, Arbuthnot and I sat till twelve. And now I am come home and got to bed. I came afoot, but had my man with me. Lord Treasurer advised me not to go in a chair, because the Mohocks insult chairs more than they do those on foot. They think there is some mischievous design in those villains. Several of them, Lord Treasurer told me, are actually taken up. I heard at dinner that one of them was killed last night. We shall know more in a little time. I don't like them, as the men said.(19) Nite MD.|$|E

6000|$|So {{also the}} terms [...] "republic" [...] and [...] "democracy" [...] are confused, {{especially}} in modern use; {{and both of}} them are liable to every sort of misconception. A republic means, properly, a polity in which the state, with its all, is at every man's service, and every man, with his all, at the state's <b>service</b> (<b>people</b> are apt to lose sight of the last condition); but its government may nevertheless be oligarchic (consular, or decemviral, for instance), or monarchic (dictatorial). But a democracy means a state in which the government rests directly with the majority of the citizens. And both these conditions have been judged only by such accidents and aspects of them as each of us has had experience of; and sometimes both have been confused with anarchy, as it is the fashion at present to talk of the [...] "failure of republican institutions in America," [...] when there has never yet been in America any such thing as an institution; neither any such thing as a res-publica, but only a multitudinous res-privata; every man for himself. It is not republicanism which fails now in America; it is your model science of political economy, brought to its perfect practice. There you may see competition, and the [...] "law of demand and supply" [...] (especially in paper), in beautiful and unhindered operation.[111] Lust of wealth, and trust in it; vulgar faith in magnitude and multitude, instead of nobleness; besides that faith natural to backwoodsmen,--"lucum ligna,"--perpetual self-contemplation, issuing in passionate vanity: total ignorance of the finer and higher arts, and of all that they teach and bestow;[112] and the discontent of energetic minds unoccupied, frantic with hope of uncomprehended change, and progress they know not whither;[113] {{these are the things that}} they have [...] "failed" [...] with in America; and yet not altogether failed--it is not collapse, but collision; the greatest railroad accident on record, with fire caught from the furnace, and Catiline's quenching [...] "non aquá, sed ruinâ." [...] But I see not, in any of our talk of them, justice enough done to their erratic strength of purpose, nor any estimate taken of the strength of endurance of domestic sorrow in what their women and children suppose a righteous cause. And out of that endurance and suffering, its own fruit will be born with time; and Carlyle's prophecy of them (June, 1850), as it has now come true in the first clause, will in the last.|$|E
