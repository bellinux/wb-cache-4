5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog has been {{detected}} {{in a wide}} range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former industrial sites (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found {{in a wide range}} of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid waters that contain predatory fish, whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the breeding site, which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Grassy habitats are usually close at hand to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can tolerate a wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. It spends most of its time within 10cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability to <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> for several minutes.|$|E

25|$|Slave {{characters}} in general {{came to be}} low-comedy types with names that matched the instruments they played: Brudder Tambo (or simply Tambo) for the tambourine and Brudder Bones (or Bones) for the bone castanets or bones. These endmen (for {{their position in the}} minstrel semicircle) were ignorant and poorly spoken, being conned, electrocuted, or run over in various sketches.

500|$|The {{episode was}} mostly well {{received}} by critics. Blogcritics reviewer Aaraon Peck applauded the Perry and Doofenshmirtz B-Plot, considering it {{as both the}} official Pret episode and {{an example of the}} series' ability to allow [...] "adults [...] enjoy the humor" [...] and not strictly focusing on the entertainment of younger viewers. Conversely, Ed Liu of Toon Zone was critical of the episode and other early episodes available on The Fast and the Phineas, calling them [...] "way too manic for their own good, never giving a gag enough time to develop a proper laugh before ripping off to the next one, and refusing to <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> for any length of time." [...] The production staff reacted positively to the episode, and said that they [...] "really liked" [...] its outcome.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June 1966, Lamb {{appeared}} without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was [...] "hyperactive and agitated"; {{he was unable to}} <b>sit</b> <b>still</b> and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room. He was silent for a few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.|$|E

500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not <b>sit</b> <b>still.</b> I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{supposed}} {{behavior of}} frogs illustrating nonaction is {{told in the}} often-repeated story of the boiled frog: put a frog in boiling water and it will jump out, but put it in cold water and slowly heat it, {{and it will not}} notice the danger and will be boiled alive. The story was based on nineteenth century experiments in which frogs were shown to stay in heating water {{as long as it was}} heated very slowly. The validity of the experiments is however disputed. Professor Douglas Melton, Harvard University Biology Department, says: [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die.
