2500|$|A similar fate would befall half of St. Philip's families, and {{the church}} was so despised locally for its Tory {{associations}} that legend has it a mob came together to burn it down {{at one point during}} the later years. They were supposedly dissuaded from doing so by George Washington himself, who <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and said [...] "That, sir, is my church!" [...] In gratitude the stained glass window in the church's vestibule depicts him.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash deduced from [...] “And the Lord {{will pass}} over the door,” that God was at the door at that time. [...] The Midrash thus {{questioned}} why [...] says, “And when He sees the blood upon the lintel.” The Midrash explained that this followed the usual practice, just as a butcher marks with red paint those sheep destined for slaughter to distinguish them from those that the butcher wishes to keep alive. So the Midrash told that God <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and thrust away the Destroyer so {{that he should not}} smite the Israelites.|$|E
2500|$|Marshak had a {{prolific}} career in children's literature. Soviet critic Viktor Shklovsky wrote that [...] "Samuil Marshak understood that many new writers {{would appear in}} the new Soviet republic. He <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of literature, a benevolent angel, armed not with a sword or with a pencil, but with words on work and inspiration." [...] Marshak's contributions {{to the field of}} children's literature was not just limited to his own writings. In 1924, he became the head of the children's branch of the state publishing house Gosizdat (GIZ), a position he held for over a decade. Through his role as editor, Marshak attracted some of Russia's best writers to try their hand at writing for children, including Evgeniy Shvarts and OBERIU member Daniil Kharms.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the King's best attempts, Caroline {{retained}} a strong popularity amongst the masses, and pressed ahead {{with plans to}} attend the coronation service on 19 July 1821 as queen. Lord Liverpool told Caroline that she should {{not go to the}} service, but she turned up anyway. George had Caroline turned away from the coronation at the doors of Westminster Abbey. Refused entry at both the doors to the East Cloister and the doors to the West Cloister, Caroline attempted to enter via Westminster Hall, where many guests were gathered before the service began. A witness described how the Queen <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> fuming as bayonets were held under her chin until the Deputy Lord Chamberlain had the doors slammed in her face. Caroline then proceeded back to an entrance near Poets' Corner, where she was met by Sir Robert Inglis, who held the office of [...] "Gold Staff". Inglis persuaded the Queen to return to her carriage, and she left. Caroline lost support through her exhibition at the coronation; the crowds jeered her as she rode away, and even Brougham recorded his distaste at her undignified behaviour.|$|E
