40|$|We study {{two-dimensional}} flow in a layered heterogeneous medium {{composed of two}} materials whose hydraulic properties and spatial distribution are known statistically but are otherwise uncertain.

Flow parallel and perpendicular to the layering in a two-material composite layered medium is considered. The hydraulic conductivity of each material is log-normally distributed with a much higher mean in one material than in the other. The hydraulic conductivities of points within different materials are uncorrelated. The location of the internal boundary between the two contrasting materials is random and normally distributed with given mean and variance.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of growth rate, back fat thickness, loin eye height and meatiness on the reproductive performance of sows based on the first two reproduction cycles. This study was conducted on 348 sows of the Polish Large White breed maintained in farm conditions. It was observed that the sows from the group with the lowest weight gains (≤ 600 g) were characterised by the latest age of first farrowing, which was 374 days, and the lowest number of live born piglets in a litter (12. 13 <b>heads).</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis also demonstrated that females from the group with the thickest back fat (> 15 mm) bore the lowest number of live piglets in a litter (on average 11. 47 heads), and the difference between this group and the others was highly significant.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the first applications of frame-based cranioplasty, developed by Professor Hannes Haberl at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin. It analyzes the efforts of this unique technique for the treatment of patients with craniosynostosis in comparison to the conventional methods. Furthermore, technical and procedural improvements, supporting the development of a final version, are to be identified. Craniosynostosis, the premature closure of one or more cranial sutures, causes different types of skull deformities. The distinctive features of the resulting shape deviation stigmatises patients in their psychosocial environment. That is why the creation of a discret, normal head shape is the main goal of any craniofacial procedure. Concommitant mild neurocognitive limitations of the patients seemed to be not influenced by surgery. Increased intracranial pressure concerns only a minority of predominantely syndromal patients. Probably due to the historical load of racial discrimination, there is no scientific discussion about aesthetic target criteria in craniofacial surgery. Therefore the current practice of craniofacial surgery remains freehanded and based on the subjectively experience, talent and aesthetic judgement of the surgeon or his team. The goal of this work was to reduce the learning curve related to the individual struggle for a neither referenced nor validated normal skull shape by replacing it with the provision of statistical knowledge represented by a data based model. For this purpose a normative database of MRI images of healthy children was created. One of any number of possible statistical stereolithographic models of average skull shapes was provided. The model represents a <b>statistical</b> normative <b>head</b> conture for a limited age group of patients. A corresponding surgical frame allows for the exact correction, positioning and stable fusion of harvested bone fragments, making up a mono-bloc implant. In a total of 14 clinical applications the expected objectification and simplification of skull mo¬delling was achieved in every case. Due to the time consuming handling of the prototype, neither a reduction in the duration of procedure, related transfusion rates or volumes nor in the length of intensive care and hospital stay could be achieved during these attempts. Necessary further development steps could be identified. Nevertheless, the skull model improves the communication with parents and colleagues and supports the training of surgeons already. An accompanying adjustment of the transfusion regime and the introduction of an antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid has permitted a significant reduction in the transfusion rate from 85 % to 56 %...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} study keyed {{to the analysis}} of the impact on hydraulic head statistics of two selected methodologies for the stochastic simulation of hydro-facies spatial arrangement. We analyze the distribution of hydraulic heads in a confined aquifer under steady-state convergent three-dimensional flow to a fully penetrating well, superimposed to a mean uniform regional gradient. The heterogeneous structure of the system is modeled on the basis of available field information comprising detailed lithological data collected within an aquifer system located in northern Italy. These data are grouped into five litho-type categories and the aquifer system is modeled as a random composite medium. Monte Carlo realizations of the three-dimensional geo-material distributions are generated through the Sequential Indicator and the Truncated Plurigaussian Simulation methods. The latter enables one to integrate geological conceptual information in the simulation procedure, while the former relies mainly on a variogram-based analysis. Point and vertically averaged hydraulic heads, corresponding to typical observations collected within screened boreholes, are analyzed by evaluating the dependence of their sample probability distributions on (i) the hydro-facies generation scheme (ii) the extent of the vertical averaging interval and (iii) the relative distance between the location of observation boreholes, hydrological boundaries and the source term. Theoretical probability density function models are fitted against numerically simulated distributions within a Maximum Likelihood context. Our results indicate that hydraulic heads associated with the Truncated Plurigaussian Simulation method exhibit increased variability when compared to their counterparts evaluated upon relying on a Sequential Indicator based modeling strategy of the system heterogeneity. Covariance matrices and probability distributions of point and vertically averaged hydraulic heads display similar key representative features and patterns. This suggests that typical measurements collected in screened boreholes can be used to infer qualitative information about the correlation structure and the <b>statistical</b> properties of <b>heads...</b>|$|R
40|$|Human surrogates {{for safety}} applications, such as crash dummies, are often {{constructed}} {{to represent the}} mean or average of individuals within a population. Generating accurate mean headforms is particularly challenging, even with three-dimensional (3 D) surface measurement technology, because hair limits the ability to accurately represent {{the shape of the}} head. This report presents a new midsizemale headform generated using <b>statistical</b> analysis of <b>head</b> dimensions and landmark data, combined with a reference shape obtained by averaging the head shapes of two men close in size to the target stature and body weight. The locations of 26 head and face landmarks from 1747 men were extracted from the 1988 U. S. Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR) and registered using a Procrustes superimposition. A linear regression predicted landmark locations as a function of stature and body mass index, using target values of 1755 mm and 27. 3 kg/m 2. To construct a reference head shape, two bald men whose head and face dimensions were within 2 % of the target mean values were extracted from a large database of head scans. The scans were visually aligned using landmark locations, then resampled cylindrically and averaged. The reference head shape was then morphed to match the target landmark locations using a radial-basisfunction (RBF) morphing method with a multiquadric kernel. A second morphing step was performed to match the desired head length, head breadth, and the distance from the tragion landmarks {{to the top of the}} head. In contrast with headforms obtained solely by averaging individuals close to the desired body size, the current headform is generated from a statistical model that represents a large range of head size and shape, and hence a broad set of statistically consistent headforms can be generated programmatically without additional analysis.

40|$|For {{nondestructive}} examination (NDE) methods, {{the most}} common question asked is “What is the smallest flaw detectable?” While common, this has traditionally been of less importance than the largest flaw that might be missed. It {{is also important to}} ask “How often is the technique likely to detect a flaw that isn’t really there?” The rejection of sound parts results in needless investigations, rework and expense. Advances in manufacturing techniques and the ever present desire for lighter, higher performing structures have resulted in components that frequently test and occasionally exceed the detection limits of NDE methods. It is the job of engineers, chemists, and scientists to continuously push the boundaries materials and structural designs. It follows that inspectors and statisticians, whose work establishes NDE method detection limits, must also push the boundaries of existing and developing inspection systems, and take additional rigor in assuring the accuracy of their analyses. Because of this, NASA is reexamining Probability of Detection (POD) methodologies the Agency helped pioneer in the late 1970 ’s in a multi-Center project supported by the NDE Program, NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA). Methods in use within the Agency [1] and international community include the Full POD method described in MIL-HDBK- 1823 A [2] and Point Estimate methods [3]. The procedural recommendations of the handbook provide excellent guidance. However, result inconsistencies in the software developed to support Full POD methods has raised concerns regarding configuration control, the underlying proof property of analysis methods, and overall software validation [4]. An alternate method relying on the statistical confidence of flaw size regions has been developed by NASA under the guidance of the following key subject matter experts: Dr. Bill Vesely, Technical Discipline Manager for Technical Risk Assessment and <b>Statistical</b> Analysis <b>Head</b> Statistician; Floyd Spencer, NDT statistician with 37 + years in the industry recommended by NESC Statistician Ken Johnson; Bill Meeker, Professor of Statistics at Iowa State University; and Edward Generazio, Delegated Program Manager for the OSMA NDE Program.

40|$|Introduction: Peripheral {{blood count}} {{components}} are accessible and evidently predictive in other cancers {{but have not}} been explored in oropharyngeal carcinoma. We examine {{if there is an}} association between the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and lymphopenia, as well as if there is an association between baseline neutrophilia, baseline leukocytosis and lymphocyte nadir in oropharyngeal cancer. Materials and Methods: Analysis started with 150 patients from a previous case to case study design, which retrospectively identified adults with oropharyngeal carcinoma, 100 treated with IMRT in 2010 - 2012 and 50 treated with IMPT in 2011 â 2014. Pretreatment leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and hemoglobin levels were extracted, as were neutrophil and lymphocyte nadir levels during radiotherapy. We retained 137 patients with recorded pre-treatment leukocyte and neutrophil levels for associated analysis and 114 patients with recorded lymphocyte levels during radiation and associated analysis. Multivariate survival analyses were done with Cox regression. Results: The radiotherapy type (IMRT vs. IMPT) was not associated with lymphopenia (grade 3 Pâ¯>â¯. 99; grade 4 Pâ¯=â¯. 55). In univariate analyses, poor overall survival was associated with pretreatment neutrophilia (hazard ratio [HR] 5. 58, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 99 â 15. 7, Pâ¯=â¯. 001), pretreatment leukocytosis (HR 4. 85, 95 % CI 1. 73 â 13. 6, Pâ¯=â¯. 003), grade 4 lymphopenia during radiotherapy (HR 3. 28, 95 % CI 1. 14 â 9. 44, Pâ¯=â¯. 03), and possibly smoking status > 10 pack-years (HR 2. 88, 95 % CI 1. 01 â 8. 18, Pâ¯=â¯. 05), but only T status was possibly significant in multivariate analysis (HR 2. 64, 95 % CI 0. 99 â 7. 00, Pâ¯=â¯. 05). Poor progression-free survival was associated with pretreatment leukocytosis and T status in univariate analysis, and pretreatment neutrophilia and advanced age on multivariate analysis.
