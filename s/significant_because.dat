5|$|Cave 6 is {{historically}} <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> though a Hindu temple, it was converted {{and used as}} a Christian church by the Portuguese in the later years when the island {{was a part of}} their colony.|$|E
5|$|Early in his term, Breathitt won favor {{from both}} Whigs and Democrats by {{opposing}} South Carolina's actions during the Nullification Crisis. Following Breathitt's lead, {{the state legislature}} passed resolutions condemning the doctrine of nullification on February 2, 1833. This action was particularly <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> John C. Calhoun's justification for nullification was largely based on the 1799 Kentucky Resolutions.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{catenary}} stanchions on platform 4 is notably better kept than others, {{and carries}} a small plaque detailing {{the visit of}} Queen Elizabeth II on 7 May 1974, {{after the completion of}} electrification of tracks north of the point where it stands. This was <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> it marked the completion of the total electrification of the West Coast Main Line.|$|E
50|$|In 1974 {{properties}} in the village were subject to <b>significant</b> damage <b>because</b> of the Flixborough disaster.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>significant</b> only <b>because</b> {{it can be}} misdiagnosed as a cancer. It {{may be seen in}} a {{completely}} normal pregnancy.|$|R
50|$|Pahokee has {{received}} <b>significant</b> attention <b>because</b> of nearby Miracle Village, a migrant worker facility converted into housing for registered sex offenders.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} was <b>significant,</b> <b>because</b> it represented the first ceratopsid known from China, {{and possibly the}} only ceratopsid from Asia. The only other possible Asian ceratopsid is Turanoceratops, but recently, its identification as a ceratopsid has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The dune, {{limestone}} {{and salt}} lake vegetation communities on North Island {{are considered to}} have high conservation significance. The dune and limestone communities have high biodiversity, are highly sensitive to disturbance and regenerate slowly. The salt lake community is considered <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> of the rarity of salt lakes on offshore islands.|$|E
5|$|Following the Plitvice Lakes {{incident}} of 1 April 1991, SAO Krajina forces captured three Croatian policemen from nearby Drniš, {{with the intention}} of exchanging them for Croatian Serb troops taken prisoner by the Croatian forces at the Plitvice Lakes. In turn, the militia established by the residents of Kijevo captured several Serb civilians and demanded that the captured policemen be released in exchange for their prisoners. On 2 April, JNA intelligence officers reported on this, and warned how local militias in Kijevo and Civljane, otherwise separated by barricades, were engaged in armed skirmishes that threatened to escalate. Kijevo became strategically <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> its location hindered SAO Krajina road communications.|$|E
50|$|The Laws of Candy is a Jacobean stage play, a tragicomedy that is <b>significant</b> principally <b>because</b> of the {{question}} of its authorship.|$|R
50|$|Marshall County is <b>significant</b> partly <b>because</b> {{of three}} Marshall Countians {{who have served}} as Governor of Tennessee: Henry Horton, Jim Nance McCord, and Buford Ellington.|$|R
50|$|Reitman {{established}} a <b>significant</b> precedent <b>because</b> it held that state assistance or encouragement of private discrimination violated {{the equal protection}} guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers {{have criticized the}} book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown {{was elected}} to the Senate in a special {{election}} to replace Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters. His victory had become <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> of its effects on the legislative process. The first was psychological: the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of passing a bill.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} varied widely, {{but there was more}} {{positive}} reaction than not. The greatest enthusiasm was for Rachel's fathers, though Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) was complimented on his brief scenes, and the scene with Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Karofsky (Max Adler) was also praised. The episode was also <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> it featured an on-screen kiss by Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris), which was the show's first lesbian kiss.|$|E
50|$|Gluten {{challenge}} protocols have <b>significant</b> limitations <b>because</b> a symptomatic relapse generally {{precedes the}} onset of a serological and histological relapse, and therefore becomes unacceptable for most patients.|$|R
2500|$|... 6388 AM (AD 880) – This {{year was}} <b>significant</b> eschatologically <b>because</b> it was 888 {{years from the}} Incarnation (based on 5500 AM as {{the date of the}} Incarnation).|$|R
50|$|The film caused <b>significant</b> {{controversy}} <b>because</b> of its simulated {{sex scenes}} involving underage actresses, {{and because of}} that it was banned in several countries, being labeled as child pornography.|$|R
5|$|The A6 {{motorway}} runs near {{a number}} of Croatian cities, provides access to Risnjak National Park and indirectly to numerous resorts, notably in the Istria and Kvarner Gulf regions. The motorway route was completed in 2008. The motorway is nationally <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> of its positive economic impact on the cities and towns it connects, and because of its contribution to tourism in Croatia. The importance of the motorway as a transit route will be further increased upon completion of a proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node.|$|E
5|$|The Elmer S. Dailey is {{historically}} <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> {{it is the}} only known surviving Erie Canal boat and is one of a few remaining wooden-hulled canal boats. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. It and the other two barges that sank with it are the only shipwrecks in Connecticut listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|The Sava River basin is very <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> of its {{biological}} diversity, and {{it contains}} large alluvial wetlands and lowland forests. This led to designation of six protected areas under {{provisions of the}} Ramsar Convention by {{the countries in the}} basin. Those are Lake Cerknica in Slovenia, Lonjsko Polje and Crna Mlaka in Croatia, Lake Bardača in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Obedska and Zasavica bogs in Serbia.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Deforestation and {{increased}} road-building in the Amazon Rainforest are a <b>significant</b> concern <b>because</b> of increased human encroachment upon wild areas, increased resource extraction and further threats to biodiversity.|$|R
50|$|The bog has {{a number}} of <b>significant</b> fauna <b>because</b> of its {{relatively}} undisturbed natural habitat and its uniqueness in representing a boreal habitat which is normally found much farther north.|$|R
50|$|Various Oncomelania {{species are}} <b>significant</b> medically, <b>because</b> they {{can serve as}} vectors for two serious human diseases: they can carry the {{schistosomiasis}} blood fluke parasite, and the paragonimus lung fluke parasites.|$|R
5|$|The {{document}} today {{exists only}} in a 17th-century transcript by the antiquarian William Dugdale. The Boulogne agreement was largely unknown to modern historians up until the 1960s, but it is now considered <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> {{it is the first}} documented expression of the conflict between king and nobility, which was to dominate so much of the reign of Edward II. Though historians agree on the document's importance, there is still disagreement over its interpretation, particularly whether the signatories should be seen as oppositional or loyal to the king.|$|E
5|$|Trace fossils consist {{mainly of}} tracks and burrows, but also include coprolites (fossil feces) and marks left by feeding. Trace fossils are {{particularly}} <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> {{they represent a}} data source that {{is not limited to}} animals with easily fossilised hard parts, and they reflect organisms' behaviours. Also many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them. Whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is generally impossible, traces may for example provide the earliest physical evidence of the appearance of moderately complex animals (comparable to earthworms).|$|E
5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} {{that religion is}} <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore {{believed that}} religious language is confessional– a confession of what someone feels and believes– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E
50|$|Also in the mid-1990s, Abu Khan saw <b>significant</b> {{potential}} <b>because</b> of {{the size}} of Furnitureland South, and he bought a building for his Abu Oriental Rug and Home, which he later expanded.|$|R
50|$|The genus is <b>significant</b> partly <b>because</b> the ryanoid {{insecticides}} {{are derived}} from - and have the same mode of action as - the alkaloid ryanodine: which was originally extracted from Ryania speciosa.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} banned {{completely}} upon release in Ireland, including - controversially - from cinema clubs, in <b>significant</b> part <b>because</b> the principal characters have Irish names. The ban was later quietly lifted.|$|R
5|$|Dox wrote prolifically {{over the}} course of his career, {{yielding}} nine poem anthologies, numerous books in prose, and sixteen plays along Biblical themes or Malagasy history and folk tales. In addition, he wrote a number of plays on commission for various clients, with many commissioned by Boy Scout troupes, although these have since been lost. His translation from French to Malagasy of three major Western novels was <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> they enriched Malagasy literature by introducing elements of the novel form that had never before been attempted in Malagasy language. These efforts demonstrated to other Malagasy language writers the versatility of the language and the possibility that it could be used for any literary form.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as <b>significant.</b> <b>Because</b> instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
50|$|Numbers are {{represented}} in binary as IEEE-754 doubles, which provides an accuracy of nearly 16 <b>significant</b> digits. <b>Because</b> they are floating point numbers, they do not always exactly represent real numbers, including fractions.|$|R
5000|$|Apple with MacRoman and Sun Microsystems with Solaris OS simply {{replaced}} the generic currency sign (¤). This caused <b>significant</b> difficulty <b>because</b> organisations had found other uses for it, {{such as the}} company logo.|$|R
