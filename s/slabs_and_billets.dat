40|$|Abstract: Today, in the {{industry}} of aluminum, the D. C. casting of billets and slabs is playing the major role. The producers of these <b>slabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>billets</b> are many. The end users of the product are OEMs. The degassing technology for producing these aluminum <b>slabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>billets</b> is provided by very few. There {{are two types of}} degassing methods currently in use. One of these, vacuum degassing, is used primarily in the steel industry and thus not generally used in the aluminum industry. The second method, generally employed in the aluminum industry, is rotary degassing, which uses finely dispersed argon, chlorine, fluorine to remove dissolved hydrogen and various salts from melt. The challenges associated with producing aluminum are reducing porosity due to hydrogen precipitation during casting through degassing processes; which generates detrimental effects on mechanical properties of alloy castings and removing impurities like; the Ca, Mg salts etc. from the molten metal. Looking at the degassing systems provided by these players, are going to be obsolete as the environment norms will become stricter in the next decade, because of the use of Fluorine and Chlorine for removing the Ca, Mg, etc. impurities from the molten metal as the ozone layer is getting depleted and process becomes more cumbersome and hazardous. So, the innovation in the technology is needed; which leads research interest on development of the ultrasonic degassing as a better option. During this research authors would be using ultrasonic technology over existing technology to compare the results of conventional degasser units available in the market such as LARS TM, SNI...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{studies the}} factors that govern {{transverse}} cracking during continuous casting of low carbon, niobium microalloyed and boron microalloyed steels. Crack susceptibility in the thick <b>slab,</b> <b>billet</b> <b>and</b> thin <b>slab</b> casting processes are compared by using typical conditions in laboratory hot ductility tests. There is limited published literature on hot ductility in aluminium-killed and siliconkilled boron microalloyed steels and the proposed mechanisms of failure by transverse cracking are contradictory. Few published papers specifically compare hot ductility behaviour of any steels between thick <b>slab,</b> <b>billet</b> <b>and</b> thin <b>slab</b> continuous casting processes. Thus, {{the basis of this}} research is to assess the influence of casting parameters and compositional variations on hot ductility behaviour in low carbon steels, niobium microalloyed steels, aluminium-killed boron microalloyed steels and silicon-killed, boron microalloyed steels. The typical temperature ranges, cooling rate and strain rate conditions of the continuous casting processes were used in reheated and in situ melted hot tensile tests performed on steel specimens. Solidification, transformation and precipitation temperatures were calculated using solubility equations and modelled using the Thermo-CalcTM thermodynamics program. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to determine the modes of failure in the tested specimens. In the low carbon steels, hot ductility was improved by increasing the strain rate; by calcium treatment, which minimises copper sulphide and iron sulphide formation; and by maintaining a nickel to copper ratio of 1 : 1. It was shown that thin slab casting conditions provided the best hot ductility results for the low carbon steels. All the niobium steels showed poor ductility in the single-phase austenite temperature region, indicating that intergranular precipitation of fine niobium carbonitrides was the cause of the poor ductility. It was shown that the hot ductility was greatly improved by calcium treatment, by decreasing the cooling rate and by increasing the strain rate. Slow iv thin <b>slab</b> <b>and</b> thick <b>slab</b> casting conditions provided the best hot ductility results for the niobium steels. Hot ductility was substantially improved in the aluminium-killed boron steels by increasing the boron to nitrogen ratio from 0. 19 to 0. 75. The results showed that, at cooling rates generally associated with thick <b>slab,</b> bloom <b>and</b> slow thin <b>slab</b> casting, a boron to nitrogen ratio of ≥ 0. 47 was sufficient to avoid a ductility trough altogether. However, under conditions typically experienced in fast thin <b>slab</b> <b>and</b> <b>billet</b> casting, a boron to nitrogen ratio of 0. 75 was required to provide good hot ductility. The mechanism of the ductility improvement with increasing boron to nitrogen ratio was found to be enhanced precipitation of boron nitride, leading to a decrease in nitrogen available for aluminium nitride precipitation. In the silicon-killed boron steels, {{it was found that the}} boron to nitrogen ratio had the overriding influence on hot ductility and hence on crack susceptibility. Excellent hot ductility was found for boron to nitrogen ratios above 1. Additionally, analysis of industrial casting data showed that the scrap percentage due to transverse cracking increased significantly at manganese to sulphur ratios below fourteen. An exponential decay relationship between the manganese to sulphur ratio and the average scrap percentage due to transverse cracking was determined as a tool to predict scrap levels in the casting plant...|$|R

40|$|The {{fluid flow}} in the mold during up-hill teeming is of great {{importance}} {{for the quality of}} the cast ingot and therefore the quality of the final steel products. At the early stage of the filling of an up-hill teeming mold, liquid steel enters, with high velocity, from the runner into the mold and the turbulence on the meniscus could lead to entrainment of mold flux. The entrained mold flux might subsequently end up as defects in the final product. It is therefore very important to get a mild and stable inlet {{flow in the}} entrance region of the mold. It has been acknowledged recently that swirling motion induced using a helix shaped swirl blade, in the submerged entry nozzle is remarkably effective to control the fluid flow pattern in both the <b>slab</b> <b>and</b> <b>billet</b> type continuous casting molds. This result in increased productivity and quality of the produced steel. Due to the result with continuous casting there is reason to investigate the swirling effect for up-hill teeming, a casting method with similar problem with turbulence. With this thesis we will study the effect of swirling flow generated through a swirl blade inserted into the entry nozzle, as a new method of reducing the deformation of the rising surface and the unevenness of the flow during filling of the up-hill teeming mold. The swirling blade has two features: (1) to generate a swirling flow in the entrance nozzle and (2) to suppress the uneven flow, generated/developed after flowing through the elbow. The effect of the use of a helix shaped swirl blade was studied using both numerical calculations and physical modelling. Water modelling was used to assert the effect of the swirling blade on rectifying of tangential and axial velocities in the filling tube for the up-hill teeming and also to verify the results from the numerical calculations. The effect of swirl in combination with diverged nozzle was also investigated in a similar way, i. e. with water model trials and numerical calculations. QC 2010111...|$|R
50|$|Hot rolling is a {{metalworking}} {{process that}} occurs above the recrystallization {{temperature of the}} material. After the grains deform during processing, they recrystallize, which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening. The starting material is usually large pieces of metal, like semi-finished casting products, such as <b>slabs,</b> blooms, <b>and</b> <b>billets.</b> If these products came from a continuous casting operation the products are usually fed directly into the rolling mills at the proper temperature. In smaller operations the material starts at room temperature and must be heated. This is done in a gas- or oil-fired soaking pit for larger workpieces and for smaller workpieces induction heating is used. As the material is worked the temperature must be monitored {{to make sure it}} remains above the recrystallization temperature. To maintain a safety factor a finishing temperature is defined above the recrystallization temperature; this is usually 50 to 100 °C (90 to 180 °F) above the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature does drop below this temperature the material must be re-heated before more hot rolling.|$|R
30|$|This is {{particularly}} true when occurrence of pseudo defects is very limited as can be observed for many hot- and cold-rolled strips. In such cases, detection itself serves a very useful purpose of identifying a particular product as defective in a continuous production line. Appropriate action of segregating the defective product follows naturally. However, without defect classification, corrective actions cannot be taken to stop occurrence of defects in future. Defect detection loses its significances without classification in situations where pseudo defect percentage is significant and/or variable. This is mostly the case with <b>slab,</b> <b>billet</b> <b>and</b> rod/bar. Here, vision-based inspection systems are useful only when features are extracted from RoIs, and classification is achieved between defects and pseudo defects and then between the defects themselves.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{continuous}} {{steel casting}} (CSC) {{technology is a}} dynamically developing method for obtaining steel semi-finished product {{in the form of}} a continuous casting <b>slabs,</b> blooms <b>and</b> <b>billets.</b> During the course of the CSC process, the liquid form of steel offers a possibility of introducing alloy additions to adjust the chemical composition or modify the non-metallic inclusions. The aim of the tests was to verify the degree of chemical homogenization of the steel after the addition of nickel. Design/methodology/approach: The device under examination is a wedge-shaped single-nozzle tundish of a capacity of 30 Mg. Computer simulation of the liquid steel flow and alloy addition behaviour in turbulent motion conditions was done using the Ansys-Fluent® computer program. Due to the complexity of alloy addition dissolution and dispersion in metallurgical processes, a decision was made to use the Species Model available within the Ansys-Fluent® program. Findings: The computer simulation produced a picture of the flow of liquid steel and the spread of nickel within the liquid steel volume. To illustrate the chemical homogenization process spatially and in a greater detail, the Ni diffusion process was monitored at selected measurement points situated in the tundish working space region. Research limitations/implications: Numerical model not include melting process of alloy addition. Practical implications: The results from numerical simulation could be use to elaborate a method of controlled alloy addition feeding to the liquid steel during continuous steel casting process. Originality/value: The paper present results of alloy addition mixing process in the liquid steel flowed through the continuous casting slab tundish...|$|R
40|$|Combination of {{a finite}} element method (FEM) {{algorithm}} with ANSYS codes and post image processing of NDT ultrasonic images along with laboratory cooling experiments and microstructural analysis provides a guideline to determine the optimum cooling rate for any grade of steel in which the highest productivity can be achieved without any degradation of the cast steel products. The suggested FEM algorithm with ANSYS codes is introduced to develop a quasi real models to simulate quenching of as-cast steel with any cooling rate from any initial temperature below steel's melting point. The algorithm builds a model which is capable to approximate the thermodynamic stresses generated by thermal strain and possible solid-solid phase transformation for as-cast steel with any chemical composition. The model is applicable for any casting geometry (<b>slab,</b> <b>billet</b> <b>and</b> bloom, bar, etc.) and adaptable for any method of cooling (unidirectional or multidirectional). Cooling with any cooling agent can be simulated with the algorithm in an ideal case. The phase transformation of the steel in the algorithm can be controlled by Continuous Cooling Transformation (CCT) Diagram obtained from analytical calculation or real time-temperaturetransformation experiments for the cast steel. A function for optimizing cooling rate is suggested...|$|R
