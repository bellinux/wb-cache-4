5|$|Citizen's Briefing Book {{is a work}} of <b>suggestions</b> by {{individuals}} compiled into a book format and submitted to President Barack Obama after his inauguration on January 20, 2009. Internet users originally posted their <b>suggestions</b> at Change.gov, with the plan that after Barack Obama was sworn in as President the website hosting the recommendations would direct users to Whitehouse.gov. The option to participate in the request for comment format was open until January 20, 2009, where users were able to post <b>suggestions</b> to the President, read others' recommendations, and comment on each other's ideas. Users voted on individual recommendations with an up or down vote for each suggestion.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Although the {{corporations}} widely use the <b>suggestion</b> schemes to elicit the creative ideas of their employee, sustaining a <b>suggestion</b> scheme {{is still a}} challenge. Employee <b>suggestion</b> schemes have been studied from many perspectives to illustrate its objectives, nature, content, process, significance and the benefits. Arguments have also been made {{with respect to the}} success and failures of the <b>suggestion</b> schemes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the factors to assess the sustainability of a <b>suggestion</b> system. Design/methodology/approach – This paper thus explores the critical success factors of <b>suggestion</b> scheme through a literature review and filters the critical determinants for sustainability of <b>suggestion</b> using factor analysis. The data collection was done using a survey technique. Findings – The results identity the five major factors as determinants to sustainability of a <b>suggestion</b> system as reported in the paper. Originality/value – This paper has made an attempt to explore the determinants to assess the sustainability of a <b>suggestion</b> system and has contributed toward the new knowledge in terms of sustainability of a <b>suggestion</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Employee <b>suggestion</b> schemes {{have existed}} {{for many years}} and {{numerous}} articles on this subject have been published over the last several decades. These schemes have been studied from many perspectives to illustrate their objectives, nature, content, processes, significance and benefits. Arguments have been made with respect to successes and failures of <b>suggestion</b> schemes. Although organizations widely use <b>suggestion</b> schemes to elicit the creative ideas of their employees, sustaining an effective <b>suggestion</b> scheme is still a challenge. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to extract critical success factors and critical success criteria to <b>suggestion</b> schemes and to discuss the importance of these factors on <b>suggestion</b> system sustainability. This is a literature review paper. It identifies 23 critical success factors and 9 critical success criteria for <b>suggestion</b> schemes. It also discusses the interconnection between critical success factors and critical success criteria. Further, the frequency of each of the factors is also presented. It recognizes the lack of work on assessment frameworks for <b>suggestion</b> scheme sustainability. This paper should be of value to practitioners of <b>suggestion</b> schemes and to academics who are interested in knowing how this program has evolved, where it is today and what future it holds. It offers practical help to an individual starting out on research on sustainability of <b>suggestion</b> schemes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT—We {{examined}} the effects of <b>suggestion</b> on Stroop interference in highly suggestible individuals. Participants completed the Stroop task with and without a <b>suggestion</b> to perceive Stroop words as meaningless sym-bols. Half the participants were given this <b>suggestion</b> in hypnosis, and half were given the <b>suggestion</b> without the induction of hypnosis. <b>Suggestion</b> produced a significant reduction in Stroop inhibition, accounting for about 45 % of the variance in Stroop responding, regardless of wheth-er hypnosis had been induced. These findings indicate that <b>suggestion</b> can at least partially overcome the automaticity associated with the Stroop effect. Cognitive processes are typically categorized as either control-led or automatic (Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977). Some processes are thought to be innately automatic; others become automati...|$|R

For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields.

5|$|Before the {{adjournment}} of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make {{a report}} on <b>suggestions</b> to improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, Hobbes, and Malachy Postlethwayt. While writing the report he also sought out <b>suggestions</b> from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E
