6000|$|After {{spending}} the night in Bridgewater, and picking up a few arrow-heads there in the morning, we took the cars for Sandwich, where we arrived before noon. This was the terminus of the [...] "Cape Cod Railroad," [...] though it is but {{the beginning of the}} Cape. As it rained hard, with driving mists, and {{there was no sign of}} its holding up, we here took that almost obsolete conveyance, the stage, for [...] "as far as it went that day," [...] as we told the driver. We had for-gotten how far a stage could go in a day, but we were told that the Cape roads were very [...] "heavy," [...] though they added that, being of sand, the rain would improve them. This coach was an exceedingly narrow one, but as there was a slight <b>spherical</b> <b>excess</b> over two on a seat, the driver waited till nine passengers had got in, without taking the measure of any of them, and then shut the door after two or three ineffectual slams, as if the fault were all in the hinges or the latch,--while we timed our inspirations and expirations so as to assist him.|$|E

The complete protocol implies a LiH induced reduction of NbCl5 followed by in situ spontaneous oxidation into low-valence niobium nano-oxides. These niobium oxides are exposed to air atmosphere resulting in pure Nb2O5. Finally, the stable Nb2O5 is converted into lithium niobate LiNbO3 nanoparticles during the controlled hydrolysis of the LiH <b>excess.</b> <b>Spherical</b> nanoparticles of lithium niobate with a diameter of approximately 10 nm can be prepared by impregnating a mesoporous silica matrix {{with a mixture of}} an aqueous solution of LiNO3 and NH4NbO(C2O4)2 followed by 10 min heating in an IR furnace.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} {{have several}} potential applications that can benefit society in fields, such as biomedicine, magnetic information storage {{due to their}} reduced size and magnetization properties. In the current research project, we have studied the preparation and analysis of two rare-earth nanoparticles, gadolinium (Gd) and neodymium (Nd). We used the inverse micelle technique to synthesize the nanoparticles, which provides the nanoparticle with a coating made of surfactant didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) that prevents them from oxidizing and aggregating. The samples were further treated for purification using a liquid-liquid extraction method. The size and composition of the clusters are examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. The results of the EDX indicate that NaBH 4 reduces GdCl 3 salt to yield Gd clusters. The SEM images show formation of submicron Gd <b>spherical</b> clusters with <b>excess</b> DDAB and byproducts. Further purification is needed. The EDX results also show that the reaction to synthesize Nd nanoparticles did not take place. Instead, an alternative synthesis reaction is suggested to yield Nd nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|A {{novel and}} {{systematic}} method for sensitive detection of Fe 3 + ions in aqueous media using gold nanorods (Au NRs) as nanosensors is presented. One {{of the most}} rousing achievements is the detection limit which {{is found to be}} 100 ppb for Fe 3 + ions. The whole procedure takes not more than 10 min which uses surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) capped seed instead of a citrate to overcome the formation of <b>spherical</b> particles in <b>excess</b> amount along with rods. This work also presents a low cost and effective solution for separation of seed mediated grown Au NRs from co-produced spherical nanoparticles formed in solution. The characterization of nanomaterials and interaction of Fe 3 + ions with sensor material was studied by UV–vis spectrophotometer to determine optical properties, while scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to determine morphology. The interaction of Fe 3 + ions with Au NRs was investigated by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) using crystal violet (CV) molecule. The aspect ratio (length/diameter) of Au NRs was controlled by the amount of surfactant added. The method reported herein is a simple way to detect and determine Fe 3 + ions in aqueous solution at the ppb levels and easily applicable for monitoring of Fe 3 + ions in water sample...|$|R

50|$|Typical {{distances}} in the Anglo-French {{survey were}} less than 20 miles (32 km): at that distance one second of arc corresponds to lateral or vertical displacements at the target station of approximately 7 inches (17 cm).

The quantity E is called the <b>spherical</b> <b>excess</b> of the triangle. This theorem is named after its author, Albert Girard. An earlier proof was derived, but not published, by the English mathematician Thomas Harriot. On a sphere of radius R both of the above area expressions are multiplied by R2. The definition of the excess is independent of the radius of the sphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{triangulation}} {{itself was}} delayed until 1787 when Ramsden supplied a new theodolite of unsurpassed accuracy: it could measure angles to within one arc second and therefore detect the {{curvature of the}} Earth by measuring the <b>spherical</b> <b>excess</b> of the triangles of the survey. By {{the end of that}} year he had completed measurements at all but two of the trigonometric stations. Many of the measurements, particularly the cross channel sightings, were taken at night using intense flares (handled by the artillery). Others required the placing of the instrument on church towers, or even on scaffolded steeples, and in their absence it was sometimes necessary to use a specially constructed portable tower some 30 feet high.|$|E
50|$|The main survey {{instrument}} from 1802 {{for the primary}} triangles was a Great Theodolite made by William Cary. This was {{very similar to the}} instruments used in France and Britain for previous trigonometrical surveys. It had a horizontal circle that was 36 inches wide and the readings were taken using a microscope. The vertical graduated circle was 18 inches in diameter. It weighed about half a ton and needed twelve men to carry it. Lambton measured all three angles of triangles in several cases to establish the <b>spherical</b> <b>excess</b> (angles of triangles on a sphere sum up greater than 180°). When the survey was carried out from Madras to Bangalore, Lambton was able to compare the Bangalore baseline of 1804 with the calculated measurements and the difference was about three and a half inches.|$|E
5000|$|In {{surveying}} work, {{the most}} common methods of computing the coordinates of a point by (angular) resection are Cassini's Method and the Tienstra formula, though the first known solution was given by Willebrord Snellius (see Snellius-Pothenot problem). For the type of precision work involved in surveying, the unmapped point is located by measuring the angles subtended by lines of sight from it to {{a minimum of three}} mapped (coordinated) points. In geodetic operations the observations are adjusted for <b>spherical</b> <b>excess</b> and projection variations. Precise angular measurements between lines from the point under location using theodolites provides more accurate results, with trig beacons erected on high points and hills to enable quick and unambiguous sights to known points.When planning to perform a resection, the surveyor must first plot the locations of the known points along with the approximate unknown point of observation. If all points, including the unknown point, lie close to a circle that can be placed on all four points, then there is no solution or the high risk of an erroneous solution. This is known as observing on the [...] "danger circle". The poor solution stems from the property of a chord subtending equal angles to any other point on the circle.|$|E

40|$|Let S {{denote the}} unit sphere in Euclidean 3 -space. A spherical {{triangle}} T is a region enclosed by three great circles on S; a great circle is a circle whose center {{is at the}} origin. The sides of T are arcs of great circles and have length a, b, c. Eachof these is ≤ π. The angle α opposite side a is the dihedral angle between the two planes passing through the origin and determined by arcs b, c. The angles β, γ opposite sides b, c are similarly defined. Each of these is ≤ π too [1]. Thesumoftheanglesis ≤ 3 π yet ≥ π. In particular, the sum need not be the constant π. Define the <b>spherical</b> <b>excess</b> E = α + β + γ − π. The sum of the sides is ≥ 0 yet ≤ 2 π. Define the spherical defect D = 2 π − (a + b + c). It can be shown that the area of T is E and a calculus-based proof appears in [2]; see also [3]. Clearly the perimeter of T is 2 π − D. The probability density functions for sides, angles, excess and defect on S will occupy us in this essay.

40|$|Abstract. The {{possible}} gamma-ray excess in {{the inner}} Galaxy and the Galactic center (GC) suggested by Fermi-LAT observations has triggered {{a large number of}} studies. It has been interpreted as a variety of different phenomena such as a signal from WIMP dark matter annihilation, gamma-ray emission from a population of millisecond pulsars, or emission from cosmic rays injected in a sequence of burst-like events or continuously at the GC. We present the first comprehensive study of model systematics coming from the Galactic diffuse emission {{in the inner}} part of our Galaxy and their impact on the inferred properties of the excess emission at Galactic latitudes 2 ◦ < |b | < 20 ◦ and 300 MeV to 500 GeV. We study both theoretical and empirical model systematics, which we deduce from a large range of Galactic diffuse emission models and a principal component analysis of residuals in numerous test regions along the Galactic plane. We show that the hypothesis of an extended <b>spherical</b> <b>excess</b> emission with a uniform energy spectrum is compatible with the Fermi-LAT data in our region of interest at 95 % CL. Assuming that this excess is the extended counterpart of the one seen in the inner few degrees of the Galaxy, we derive a lower limit of 10. 0 ◦ (95 % CL) on its extension away from the GC. We show that, in light of the large correlated uncertainties that affect the subtraction of the Galactic diffuse emission in the relevant regions, the energy spectrum of the excess is equally compatible with both a simple broken power-law of break energy Ebreak = 2. 1 ± 0. 2 GeV, and with spectra predicted by the self-annihilation of dark matter, implying in the case of b̄b final states a dark matter mass of mχ = 49 + 6. 4 − 5. 4 GeV. a...|$|E
40|$|In {{an era of}} {{unprecedented}} sensitivity to cosmic gamma rays, it is timely to study possible signatures rising from Dark Matter (DM) particle interactions. The aim of the present thesis is precisely devoted to that. We start by presenting a broad study on physically motivated Galactic diffuse emission models. These derive from the interaction of Galactic cosmic rays with the interstellar medium and describe the bulk of photons imprinted in the observed gamma-ray sky. We show how gamma-ray data offer a complementary deep diagnostic of the standard paradigm for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation, usually tuned on local cosmic-ray observables. We present a self-contained discussion about the inferred radial gradients in the gamma-ray data relative to the Galactic plane region, and interpret them as a strong hint {{in favor of a}} spatially varying diffusion rate for cosmic rays in the Galaxy. We corroborate this study with a set of distinctive predictions, embracing the available information on TeV high-energy photon data and the expectations for a detection of Galactic neutrino fluxes on the basis of current and future neutrino observatory sensitivities. We, then, scrutinize the claim of a gamma-ray signal from DM particle annihilation observed in the innermost central part of our Galaxy, analyzing the gamma-ray data coming from few tens of degrees around the Galactic center. We show that a <b>spherical</b> <b>excess</b> [...] interpretable as the annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles in the Galactic halo [...] does not stand out in the data any longer when the effect of the observationally inferred high star-formation rate in this complex astrophysical environment is considered. Accounting properly for that in the injection source distribution of cosmic rays, we show that most of the "GeV excess" has a simple explanation in terms of well-motivated cosmic-ray physics. We remark, in particular, that with this correction, counts in the residual map are not only drastically reduced, but also do not spatially correlate anymore with an approximately spherical morphology. Finally, we critically reassess the DM content in the satellites of the Milky Way. In order to do that, we develop a new method, mainly based on the kinematics of the stars in these galaxies, that in the end provides a conservative estimate of the line-of-sight integrated halo profile squared for these objects, the so-called J-factor. After carrying out in detail the study case of Ursa Minor, we present here [...] as last original contribution in the thesis [...] a similar conservative analysis of the J-factor for the whole set of classical satellites of the Milky Way. In light of our novel approach, we conclude that these galaxies offer to us a reliable "DM laboratory" where we can probe the freeze-out mechanism of cold thermal relics in a robust and unique way...|$|E
