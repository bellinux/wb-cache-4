5000|$|It usually {{trades at}} a premium or {{discount}} to its net asset value. An open-end fund trades at its net asset value (to which <b>sales</b> <b>charges</b> may be added; and adjustments may be made for e.g. the frictional costs of purchasing or selling the underlying investments).|$|R
50|$|For example, {{a mutual}} fund with a 5.75% <b>sales</b> <b>charge</b> is sold to someone who invests $10,000. $575 GDC is created by the sale, and the {{investor}} has an initial account balance of $9425. If the sales agent receives 32% of the GDC, he makes $184. If the payout is based on Production Credits or PCs, it would perhaps be about 5.5% of the total sale, or 32% of 550: $176.|$|E
50|$|A {{share is}} also a way of pricing sales charges (loads) on mutual funds in the United States. In an A share, the sales load is up front, {{typically}} at most 5.75% of the amount invested. In contrast is the B share {{that does not have}} an upfront charge, but instead has higher ongoing expenses {{in the form of a}} higher 12B-1 fee, and a contingent deferred <b>sales</b> <b>charge</b> that only applies if the investor redeems shares before a specified period. The maximum A share sales load is decreased for larger investment amounts as a volume discount.|$|E
50|$|Zero-load {{refers to}} a mutual fund that charges no {{commission}} or <b>sales</b> <b>charge.</b> Instead of using a secondary party shares are generally distributed directly by the investment company. Research has shown {{that there is little}} difference in the performance of zero-load funds in comparison to load funds. However, as an investor in a load fund has to pay out fees to buy in or out, a load fund must perform better in order for the investor to get the same outcome. This means that in essence a zero-load fund starts the 'investment race' with a headstart.|$|E
50|$|Most {{universal}} life policies come with {{an option to}} withdraw cash values rather than take a loan. The withdrawals are subject to contingent deferred <b>sales</b> <b>charges</b> and may also have additional fees defined by the contract. Withdrawals permanently lower the death benefit of the contract {{at the time of}} the withdrawal.|$|R
50|$|It's {{similar to}} a {{back-end}} load in that no <b>sales</b> <b>charges</b> are paid when buying the fund. Instead a back-end load may be charged if the shares purchased are sold within a given time frame. The distinction between level loads and low loads as opposed to back-end loads, is that this time frame where charges are levied is shorter.|$|R
5000|$|Back-end load. Some {{funds have}} a {{back-end}} load, which is {{paid by the}} investor when shares are redeemed. If the back-end load declines the longer the investor holds shares, it is called a contingent deferred <b>sales</b> <b>charges</b> (CDSC). Like the front-end load, the back-end load is paid by the investor; it is deducted from the redemption proceeds.|$|R
5000|$|Associated {{with class}} [...] "B" [...] mutual fund shares. Also known as Deferred <b>Sales</b> <b>Charge,</b> {{this is a}} fee paid when shares are sold. Also known as a [...] "back-end load," [...] this fee {{typically}} goes to the Stockbrokers that sell the fund's shares. Back-end loads start with a fee about 5 to 6 percent, which incrementally discounts for each year that the investors own the fund’s shares. The {{rate at which the}} fee declines is disclosed in the prospectus. The amount of this type of load will depend on how long the investor holds his or her shares and typically decreases to zero if the investor holds his or her shares long enough.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{associated}} with class 'A' shares of a mutual fund. Also known as <b>Sales</b> <b>Charge,</b> {{this is a}} fee paid when shares are purchased. Also known as a [...] "front-end load," [...] this fee typically goes to the brokers that sell the fund's shares. Front-end loads {{reduce the amount of}} your investment. For example, let's say you have $1,000 and want to invest it in a mutual fund with a 5% front-end load. The $50 sales load you must pay comes off the top, and the remaining $950 will be invested in the fund. The Maximum sales load under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is 9%. The maximum sales load under NASD Rules is 8%.|$|E

50|$|Variable annuities {{have been}} criticized for their high commissions, {{contingent}} deferred <b>sale</b> <b>charges,</b> tax deferred growth, high taxes on profits, and high annual costs.

40|$|ISSUE Distributors {{of mutual}} funds {{that do not have}} a {{front-end}} <b>sales</b> <b>charge</b> receive fees that are designed to compensate them for the distribution of fund shares. The fees are sometimes received over a specified future period. Copyright © 1986, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution Page 1 The issue is whether the fees that are expected to be received over a specified future period should (1) be accrued at present value and recognized {{at the time of the}} distribution, along with all costs of performance (the income accrual method) or (2) be recognized when received, along with the amortization of deferred incremental direct costs and the expensing of indirect costs when incurred (the cost deferral method, which is the existing accounting practice).

40|$|We {{consider}} a dynamic inventory (production) model with general convex order (production) costs and excess demand {{that can be}} accepted or refused by the firm. Excess demand that is accepted is backlogged and results in a backlog cost whereas demand that is refused results in a lost <b>sales</b> <b>charge.</b> Endogenizing the sales decision is appropriate {{in the presence of}} general convex order costs so that the firm is not forced to backlog a unit whose subsequent satisfaction would reduce total profits. In each period, the firm must determine the optimal order and sales strategy. We show that the optimal policy is characterized by an optimal buy-up-to level that increases with the initial inventory level and an order quantity that decreases with the initial inventory level. More importantly, we show the optimal sales strategy is characterized by a critical threshold, a backlog limit, that dictates when to stop selling. This threshold is independent of the initial inventory level and the amount purchased. We investigate various properties of this new policy. As demand stochastically increases, the amount purchased increases but the amount backlogged decreases, reflecting a shift in the way excess demand is managed. We develop two regularity conditions, one that ensures some backlogs are allowed in each period, and another that ensures the amount backlogged is nondecreasing in the length of the planning horizon. We illustrate the buy-up-to levels in our model are bounded above by buy-up-to levels from the pure lost sales and pure backlogging models. We explore additional extensions using numerical experiments. inventory-production policies, dynamic programming, stochastic...|$|E

50|$|Variable annuities {{are used}} for many {{different}} objectives. One common objective is deferral of the recognition of taxable gains. Money deposited in a variable annuity grows on a tax-deferred basis, so that taxes on investment gains are not due until a withdrawal is made. Variable annuities {{offer a variety of}} funds ("subaccounts") from various money managers. This gives investors the ability to move between subaccounts without incurring additional fees or <b>sales</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Expense ratios are {{important}} to consider when choosing a fund, as they can significantly affect returns. Factors influencing the expense ratio include {{the size of the}} fund (small funds often have higher ratios as they spread expenses among a smaller number of investors), <b>sales</b> <b>charges,</b> and the management style of the fund. A typical annual expense ratio for a U.S. domestic stock fund is about 1%, although some passively managed funds (such as index funds) have significantly lower ratios.|$|R
