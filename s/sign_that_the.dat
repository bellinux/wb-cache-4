5|$|Anxious {{to protect}} the Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope and granted Momolo's request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single meeting, as the first <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mortara case would take on a special significance.|$|E
5|$|Billy Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider {{who rode}} the express trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute {{uprising}} of 1860 he was chased by {{a band of}} Paiute Indians on horseback {{and was forced to}} retreat into the hills behind some big rocks where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Paiutes honored their enemy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe asked for a {{cigarette}} to smoke {{in the middle of}} reading a kvitel, it was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a follower of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe asked for a cigarette while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} match, {{which was}} not broadcast in the United Kingdom, pitted Crush against the Repo Man. Crush used his size advantage to perform a Gorilla press slam on Repo Man. Repo Man performed a back suplex, but Crush showed no <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> move affected him. Crush continued to dominate the match with such moves as a belly to belly suplex. Repo Man eventually tried to attack Crush by jumping off the top rope, but Crush caught him and performed the Cranium Crunch to win the match by submission.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no records}} {{relating}} to {{the administration of the}} Mysore territory during the Vijayanagara Empire's reign (1399–1565). Signs of a well-organised and independent administration appear from the time of Raja Wodeyar I who {{is believed to have been}} sympathetic towards peasants (raiyats) who were exempted from any increases in taxation during his time. The first <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kingdom had established itself in the area was the issuing of gold coins (Kanthirayi phanam) resembling those of the erstwhile Vijayanagara Empire during Narasaraja Wodeyar's rule.|$|E

5|$|According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona {{asked the}} {{guardian}} of Matsatso, {{one of the three}} most prominent royal idols, to ask the idol which of his sons should rule after him. The guardian hesitated to declare the idol's choice, but after the king promised no ill reaction to the decision, the man declared the successor to be Andrianavalonimerina. However, the king had hoped that the successor would be another son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He decided to test the prophecy by sending one of his wives to the guardian's house, where the population showed her respect by offering zebu for her to eat. The zebu cooked inconsistently, and the king interpreted this as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> guardian was dishonest and intended to seize power himself, so Andriamasinavalona ordered him put to death and had the idol Matsatso discarded in a lake. He then asked the guardians of the two other idols (Kelimalaza and Soratra) to declare a successor; {{the guardian of}} Soratra fled, while the guardian of Kelimalaza stated that only the king could choose his successor.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as a sure <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others {{were not interested in}} being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print {{for the first time}} in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E

5|$|However, as {{the fifth}} season's {{production}} period entered its final months, rumors began to circulate – {{especially among the}} production crew members in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada – {{about the future of}} the series, particularly concerning whether the show would be moving to Los Angeles, California for the sixth season and whether the new recurring character of Jeffrey Spender was planned (in case David Duchovny cut back his commitment to the series) to become a replacement for Duchovny's character of Fox Mulder – either as a part-time or full-fledged substitute. Other, contradictory rumors that Owens heard were that either he or Duchovny would appear in only eight episodes of the sixth season and that his casting as Spender was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series would either be leaving Vancouver or staying there. According to the actor himself, he always knew that Duchovny would not be leaving the series but only discovered that The X-Files would indeed be moving to Los Angeles when the official announcement was made.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, {{at a time when there}} is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Initially Guerrero worked lower card matches, in the first-to-third {{match on}} the show with some success. On September 11, 1998 he {{defeated}} Mr. Águila in his first ever Lucha de Apuestas match, forcing his opponent to unmask and reveal his real name {{as part of the}} CMLL 65th Anniversary Show. Mr. Águila already worked for the World Wrestling Federation without his mask, so it was not seen as a surprise that he lost to Guerrero. In 1999 Último Guerrero teamed up with veteran Blue Panther to win the Gran Alternativa ("Grea Alternative") tournament, a tournament where a young wrestler teams with a veteran. Winning the Gran Alternativa tournament is often a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> promotion has plans to move a wrestler up the rankings. Shortly after winning the tournament, Guerrero won a match that made him the number one contender for Great Sasuke's NWA World Middleweight Championship. Último Guerrero did not win the match but the fact that he worked a featured match in CMLL's main arena, Arena México, showed that the company had plans for him.|$|E

5|$|Potential Republican gubernatorial {{candidates}} were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as a sure <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others {{were not interested}} in being on the defense against the inevitable Democratic attacks on the Bradley administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Party leaders were encouraged, however, by the deep Democratic divisions at the Music Hall Convention. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Republican senator William Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state Auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was the choice of Governor Bradley, while the latter was supported by Lexington Herald editor Sam J. Roberts. Taylor, like Goebel, was a skilled political organizer. He was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations and seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|The Song court {{returned}} to Hangzhou in 1133, {{and the city}} was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Hangzhou later that same year, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court had in practice established Hangzhou as the Song capital without a formal declaration. It {{was treated as a}} temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Hangzhou. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Hangzhou won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Hangzhou, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Hangzhou the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Hangzhou would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.|$|E
5|$|The emperor was the {{ultimate}} authority in policy- and decision-making, {{but in the early}} Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of life, and to deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually. The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen. After Nero, the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council (consilium) became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater transparency. Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions {{until the end of the}} Antonine dynasty, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium. The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions. Plotina exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian. Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published, as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> emperor was reasonable in his exercise of authority and listened to his people.|$|E

5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also threatened the long-term prospects for the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor's heir was his eldest daughter, Isabel, who had no interest in, nor expectation of, becoming the monarch. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still a very traditional, male-dominated society, and the prevailing view was that only a male monarch would be capable as head of state. PedroII, the ruling circles and the wider political establishment all considered a female successor to be inappropriate, and PedroII himself believed that {{the death of his}} two sons and the lack of a male heir were a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Empire was destined to be supplanted.|$|E
5|$|Zapp spawned {{several more}} albums in close {{succession}} within the 1980s, retaining the heavily electronic style that Zapp II had adopted. Zapp III {{was released in}} 1983, {{but it did not}} reach the same chart positions as Zapp's previous efforts. While still gaining a gold certification, it only peaked at 39 on the Billboard 200 and nine on the R chart. Zapp IIIs poorer commercial performance became a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band's popularity and impact were beginning to decline toward the mid 1980s, with post-disco music falling out of trend. By the release of The New Zapp IV U on October 25, 1985, Zapp's popularity declined more. The album gained gold status, but only in 1994, almost a decade after its initial release. Zapp's presence began to fade {{in the latter half of}} the 1980s, and Troutman's attention was focused on his solo career. The final release by Zapp before Troutman's death was Zapp V, on September 12, 1989, which was met with moderate commercial success and failed to receive an RIAA certification.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse's {{treatment}} of quarterback Doug Williams caused resentment {{not only on}} the team, but in the entire Bay Area community. Williams led the Buccaneers to the playoffs in three of his five years with the team, and was considered to be their single most important player. However, he was only paid $120,000 a year, which ranked 42nd among NFL quarterbacks, was less than what some teams' third-string quarterbacks made, and was lower than the salary of Terdell Middleton, a running back who had two total carries in his two years in Tampa Bay. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract that would pay him among the league's top quarterbacks. Culverhouse refused to budge from his initial offer of $400,000, which he said would make Williams one of the five highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Williams' agent disputed this, saying that Culverhouse's offer was substantially less than what several other quarterbacks made. With negotiations at a standstill, the Buccaneers traded the following season's first-round draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Jack Thompson, a backup quarterback who had been unable to unseat Ken Anderson, as an insurance policy should Williams prove impossible to sign, or have trouble recovering from offseason knee surgery. Williams interpreted this as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team did not want him, and instead signed a contract with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the United States Football League.|$|E
