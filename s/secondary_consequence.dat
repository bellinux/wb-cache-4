40|$|Several studies {{estimate}} the immediate impact {{of climate change}} on agricultural societies in terms of changes in crop yields or farm income, though few studies concentrate on the immediate <b>secondary</b> <b>consequences</b> of climate change. This synthetic analysis uses a set of indicators to assess the repercussions of predicted income reductions resulting from climate change on food consumption, nutrition, health expenditure, education, and recreation in Zimbabwe, Cameroon, South Africa and Ethiopia. We also assess the potential decline in human development potential among smallholder dryland farmers in these sub-Saharan African countries. In contrast to previous efforts, the current study directly integrates the uncertainties in estimations of income changes and <b>secondary</b> <b>consequences</b> through a weighting scheme. The results reveal moderate {{to high levels of}} secondary impacts which could lead to increased vulnerability to diseases, susceptibility to nutritional disorders, deprivation of educational opportunities, and ultimately to a reduction in human and societal development potential among the considered nations.

40|$|Molecular Aspects of Alcohol and Nutrition is a {{valuable}} resource for nutrition researchers and nutritionists who study or treat alcohol-related diseases. Experts from across the field of alcohol research explain how alcohol disrupts normal fat, carbohydrate, and protein metabolic processes occurring in the liver {{as well as other}} parts of the body. The book discusses how this can lead to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) as well as contribute to the onset of Type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. It also explores how alcohol affects nutrient absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to anemia and reduced amounts of fat soluble vitamins. This book explores both the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>consequences</b> of alcohol consumption. Chapters in the first section investigate the basic science of alcohol metabolism – focusing on how alcohol and its toxic metabolites disrupt and impair normal nutrient regulation at the molecular level. Further chapters explore how alcohol affects many extra-hepatic organs and tissues as well as the <b>secondary</b> <b>consequences</b> of alcohol consumption such as reduced levels of minerals like magnesium, calcium, and trace elements like zinc...|$|R

5000|$|As in {{classical}} economics, supply-side economics proposed that production or supply {{is the key}} to economic prosperity and that consumption or demand is merely a <b>secondary</b> <b>consequence.</b> Early on, this idea had been summarized in Say's Law of economics, which states: [...] "A product is no sooner created, than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value." [...] John Maynard Keynes, the founder of Keynesianism, summarized Say's Law as [...] "supply creates its own demand." [...] He turned Say's Law on its head in the 1930s by declaring that demand creates its own supply.|$|E
5000|$|It is the organism's {{physical}} properties which directly determine its {{chances of survival}} and reproductive output, while the inheritance of {{physical properties}} occurs only as a <b>secondary</b> <b>consequence</b> of the inheritance of genes. Therefore, to properly understand {{the theory of evolution}} via natural selection, one must understand the genotype-phenotype distinction. The genes contribute to a trait, and the phenotype is the observable expression of the genes (and therefore the genotype that affects the trait). Say a white mouse had the recessive genes that caused the genes that cause the color of the mouse to be inactive (so [...] "cc"). Its genotype would be responsible for its phenotype (the white color).|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the above}} {{mentioned}} observations NFAP may {{get into the}} cell within 30  min in a concentration below the detectable level which might be enough {{to interfere with the}} actin localization and chitin distribution and to cause apoptosis. It could be also possible that these effects are <b>secondary</b> <b>consequences</b> of the NFAP action: NFAP may bind to a surface receptor which activates a signalling pathway that leads to apoptosis and defective polar growth. The susceptibility tests with A. nidulans signalling mutants indeed point towards signalling pathways affected by NFAP.|$|R
40|$|Phenethyl alcohol (PEA) caused Escherichia coli {{to take up}} greatly {{increased}} amounts of acriflavine, a compound to which healthy growing cells are impermeable. PEA also caused an increased rate of efflux (leakage) of cellular potassium under conditions which do not greatly alter the influx of potassium via the energy-dependent potassium pump. We therefore propose that the primary effect of PEA is a limited breakdown of the cell membrane. The inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and other cellular functions would then be <b>secondary</b> <b>consequences</b> of the alteration in the membrane structure...|$|R

The length of the season attempted to reflect the current abundance of the fishery, with bigger populations supporting longer seasons. This turned fishing into a race, driving the industry to bigger, faster boats, which in turned caused regulators to repetitively shorten seasons, sometimes to {{only a few days}} per year. Landing all boats over an ever-shorter interval also led to glut/shortage market cycles with prices crashing when the boats came in. A <b>secondary</b> <b>consequence</b> was that boats sometimes embarked when the fishery was [...] "open" [...] regardless of weather or other safety concerns.|$|E

50|$|Cross-cousin {{marriage}} also {{establishes a}} division between prescribed and prohibited relatives who, {{from the viewpoint}} of biological proximity, are strictly interchangeable. Lévi-Strauss thought that this proved that the origin of the incest prohibition is purely social and not biological. Cross-cousin marriage in effect allowed the anthropologist to control for biological degree by studying a situation where the degree of prohibited and prescribed spouses were equal. In understanding why two relatives of the same biological degree would be treated so differently, Lévi-Strauss wrote, {{it would be possible to}} understand not only the principle of cross-cousin marriage but of the incest prohibition itself. For Lévi-Strauss cross-cousin marriage was not either socially arbitrary or a <b>secondary</b> <b>consequence</b> of other institutions like dual organization or the practice of exogamy. Instead, the raison d'etre of cross-cousin marriage could be found within the institution itself. Of the three types of institution of exogamy rules, dual organization, and cross-cousin marriage, the last was most significant, making the analysis of this form of marriage the crucial test for any theory of marriage prohibitions.|$|E

However, pyrochlore is also a more unstable structure and it undergoes irreversible amorphisation at potentials below 1.6  V. This phenomenon {{is due to the}} loss of structural water dislodged from the channels and has <b>secondary</b> <b>consequences</b> on partial electrolyte degradation [38]. However, the pyrochlore structure seems also to produce much better distributed composites with carbonaceous additives leading to a longer-lived cathode material [30, 36].|$|R

30|$|The main {{regulatory}} implication raising {{from this}} picture {{is that the}} real challenge for labour regulation is to find a design to address the use of temporary employment as a flexible way to enter in the market allowing firms to screen new workers towards more stable form of jobs, instead of as a structural cheaper form of work. Probably, only in those conditions labour market outcomes could be able to benefit from all the advantages in terms of flexibility induced by TE, without suffering the <b>secondary</b> <b>consequences</b> on labour productivity. Hence, the future agenda of labour market research should certainly include the identification of such kind of regulation.|$|R
