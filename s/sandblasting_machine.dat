40|$|Aim : The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the effects of six in-office reconditioning methods (direct flaming, <b>sandblasting,</b> modified BigJane <b>machine</b> method, direct flaming followed by sandblasting, flaming followed by electropolishing, Buchman method) on standard edgewise metallic brackets. Materials and methods : One hundred and five brackets were divided into seven groups. The six experimental brackets were reconditioned using six different reconditioning methods. The brackets were rebonded on human premolar teeth and were tested for shear bond strength, slot dimensions and bracket base appearance. Results : Significant differences in the shear bond strength and slot dimensions were seen between the control and the experimental groups. Conclusion : This study suggests sandblasting as the simplest, most efficient manner of immediately recycling debonded brackets...|$|R
40|$|Some implant {{manufactures}} use Al 2 O 3 instead TiO 2 {{powder to}} <b>sandblast</b> the <b>machined</b> dental implant, because Al 2 O 3 powder is commercially more easily available and is cheaper than TiO 2 powder. However, Al 2 O 3 powder usually leaves aluminum oxide contamination on the surface, which is potentially toxic. In this work, we subjected Ti discs previously sandblasted with Al 2 O 3 powder to 5 different acid etchings {{in order to}} verify which treatment is able to remove incorporated particles of Al 2 O 3 from the surface. One group of samples were only sandblasted and served as control. The samples were analyzed by electron microscopy (SEM, EDS), scanning probe microscopy, and grazing incidence XRD. The control group showed presence of Al 2 O 3 on the surface. Three acid etchings were efficient in removing the alumina from the tested samples. Almost all the tested samples showed higher roughness parameters values than the control samples. Titanium hydride was found in almost all test groups. Moreover, {{the results suggest that}} there is no incorporation of the whole Al 2 O 3 particle into the titanium surface after the collision, conversely a particle fragmentation occurs and what remains on the titanium surface are Al 2 O 3 residues...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{fabricating}} an adhesive resistance surface is presented. <b>Sandblasting</b> and electrochemical <b>machining</b> {{were introduced to}} prepare micro-nano structures on the sample surface. Then, the prepared sample was immersed in a tridecafluoroctyltriethoxysilane ethanol solvent. The surface of the aluminum alloy sample roughened and covered with low-surface-energy chemical groups was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Surface wettability and adhesive resistance of the treated sample were characterized by water contact angles, area fraction, sliding angle and solid surface energy. Furthermore, the effects of some process parameters, such as sand size, current density, electrochemical machining time, and electrolyte concentration, on the contact angle, area fraction, sliding angle and the solid surface-energy of the modified sample surfaces were provided. The {{results show that the}} combination of binary micro-structures and surface modification of tridecafluoroctyltriethoxysilane plays a role to improve adhesive resistance of the aluminum alloy surface...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the earlier phase of the osseointegration of a laser-treated implant surface in terms of human protein adsorption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Titanium surfaces were divided into <b>machined</b> (M), <b>sandblasted</b> (SB), and laser-treated (LT). The LT surfaces were created with an Nd diode-pumped laser in Q-switching, whereas the SB were treated with Al 2 O 3. An x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of titanium surface was performed. Titanium discs were used for albumin and fibronectin adsorption evaluation through fluorescence intensity. Fibronectin evaluation was also made with Western Blot analysis on experimental implants. RESULTS: LT discs appeared to trigger a higher albumin and fibronectin adsorption with a regular pattern. The mean count of albumin adsorption was 0. 29 and 3. 8 for SB and LT, respectively (P = 0. 016), whereas fibronectin values were 0. 67 and 4. 9 for (SB) and (LT) titanium (P = 0. 02). XPS analysis showed that titanium, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen were found on all 3 surfaces. CONCLUSION: Laser-engineered porous titanium surface seems to promote, in vitro, the adsorption of albumin and fibronectin more than <b>sandblasted</b> (SB) or <b>machined</b> (M) implants...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{properties of}} commercial pure titanium (cp-Ti) dental implants {{can be improved}} by surface treatment. In this study, the cp-Ti surfaces were prepared to enable machined surfaces (TM) to {{be compared to the}} <b>machined,</b> <b>sandblasted,</b> laser irradiated and dual-acid etched surfaces (TA). The surface elements and roughness were characterized. The biocompatibility was evaluated by cell and organ culture in vitro. The removal torque was measured in rabbit implantation. Surface characterization revealed that TA surface was more oxidized than TM surface. The TA surface had micrometric, beehive-like coarse concaves. The average roughness (2. 28 mu m) was larger than that typical of acid-etched surfaces. Extracts of both materials were not cytotoxic to bone cells. The morphology of cells attached on the TA surface was superior to that on the TM surface. TA promoted cell migration and repaired damaged bones more effectively in organ culture. The formation of bone-like nodules on TA disk exceeded that on TM disk. Rabbit tibia implantation also proved that TA implant had greater removal torque value. These results suggested that TA had good osteoconductivity and was a potential material for dental implantation...|$|R
40|$|For dental implants, it {{is vital}} that an initial soft tissue seal is {{achieved}} as this helps to stabilize and preserve the peri-implant tissues during the restorative stages following placement. The study of the implant-soft tissue interface is usually undertaken in animal models. We have developed an in vitro three-dimensional tissue-engineered oral mucosal model (3 D OMM), which lends itself {{to the study of the}} implant-soft tissue interface as it has been shown that cells from the three-dimensional OMM attach onto titanium (Ti) surfaces forming a biological seal (BS). This study compares the quality of the BS achieved using the three-dimensional OMM for four types of Ti surfaces: polished, <b>machined,</b> <b>sandblasted</b> and anodized (TiUnite). The BS was evaluated quantitatively by permeability and cell attachment tests. Tritiated water (HTO) was used as the tracing agent for the permeability test. At the end of the permeability test, the Ti discs were removed from the three-dimensional OMM and an Alamar Blue assay was used for the measurement of residual cells attached to the Ti discs. The penetration of the HTO through the BS for the four types of Ti surfaces was not significantly different, and there was no significant difference in the viability of residual cells that attached to the Ti surfaces. The BS of the tissue-engineered oral mucosa around the four types of Ti surface topographies was not significantly different...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the surface {{characteristics}} and values of removal torque of an implant surface subjected to sandblasting with 125 µm Al 2 O 3 particles with a following immersion in biomimetic fluid and to compare that surface with a machined implant surface. Study protocol: Forty-eight conical implants were initially made of second-grade titanium alloy. The diameter of implants was 4 mm at the head and 2. 6 at the apex, all implants were of 8 mm length and of large variable thread design. Half of them were subjected to sand blasting and immersion in biomimetic fluid at 37 ⁰C for four weeks with daily replenishment of solution until the moment of placement; another 24 implants were left with untreated machined surface. Three-dimensional roughness values were obtained with the help of confocal laser scanning microscope. Forty-eight implants were implanted in 12 dogs. Twenty-four implants were retrieved after a 6 -week healing period following installation, and the remaining 24 were removed upon the completion of 16 weeks, using a torque calibrator ((BTG 150 CN-S TOHNICHI) with a 20 cN•m - 150 cN•m scale of force registration was applied for the measurements of the removal torque. Results: The mean 3 -dimensional roughness value of biomimetically treated implant surfaces was 1. 34 ± 0. 24 µm and the mean roughness value measured for the machined surfaces was 0. 33 ± 0. 04 µm (P< 0. 05). As to the average parameters of maximum peak-trough distance, these were equal to 2. 85 for machined and 24. 25 for incubated <b>sandblasted</b> implants. <b>Machined</b> implants demonstrated 49. 5 ± 10. 3 removal torque values after the 6 -week healing period. But for the immersed sandblasted implants the same parameter was equal to 72. 7 ± 15. 98 Ncm. During a 16 -week recovery period, these values increased up to 77. 5 ± 15. 16 Ncm and 89. 7 ± 11. 83 Ncm for machined and biomimetically treated sandblasted implants, respectively, P< 0. 05. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated the rapid recovery time for biomimetically incubated sandblasted dental implants in comparison to machined surface implants based on findings of early (6 weeks healing period) removal tests. Although there was established only a 13. 4...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Studies of peri-implant {{soft tissue}} on invivo models are {{commonly}} based on histological sections prepared using undecalcified or fracture' techniques. These techniques require the cutting or removal of implant during the specimen preparation process. The {{aim of this}} study is to explore a new impression technique that does not require any cutting or removal of implant for contour analysis of soft tissue around four types of titanium (Ti) surface roughness using an invitro three-dimensional oral mucosal model (3 D OMM). Methods: The 3 D OMM was constructed by co-culturing a keratinocyte cell line TR 146 and human oral fibroblasts on to an acellular dermis scaffold. On the fourth day, a Ti disk was placed into the model. Four types of Ti surface topographies, i. e. polished, <b>machined,</b> <b>sandblasted</b> and anodized were tested. After 10 d of culture, the specimens were processed based on undecalcified (ground sectioning), electropolishing and impression techniques for contour analysis of the implant-soft tissue interface. Results: Under light microscopic examination of the ground and electropolishing sections, it was found that the cell line-based oral mucosa formed a peri-implant-like epithelium attachment on to all four types of Ti surfaces. In contour analysis, the most common contour observed between the cell linebased oral mucosa and Ti surface was at an angle ranging between 45 and 90. Conclusion: The in vitro cell line-based 3 D OMM formed a peri-implant-like epithelium at the implant-soft tissue interface. The contour of the implant-soft tissue interface for the four types of Ti surface was not significantly different...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of surface}} {{treatment}} on the electrochemical behavior of commercially pure titanium (cpTi) exposed to mouthwashes was tested. Seventy-five disks {{were divided into}} 15 groups according to surface treatment (<b>machined,</b> <b>sandblasted</b> with Al 2 O 3, and acid etched) and electrolyte solution (artificial saliva - control, 0. 12 % chlorhexidine digluconate, 0. 05 % cetylpyridinium chloride, 0. 2 % sodium fluoride, and 1. 5 % hydrogen peroxide) (n = 5). Open-circuit-potential and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were conducted at baseline and after 7 and 14 days of immersion in each solution. Potentiodynamic test and total weight loss of disks were performed after 14 days of immersion. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, white light interferometly and profilometry were conducted for surface characterization {{before and after the}} electrochernical tests. Sandblasting promoted the lowest polarization resistance (R-p) (P <. 0001) and the highest capacitance (CPE) (P <. 006), corrosion current density (I-corr) and corrosion rate (P <. 0001). In contrast, acid etching increased R-p and reduced CPE, independent to the mouthwash; while hydrogen peroxide reduced R-p (P <. 008) and increased I-corr and corrosion rate (P <. 0001). The highest CPE values were found for hydrogen peroxide and 0. 2 % sodium fluoride. Immersion for longer period improved the electrochemical stability of cpTi (P <. 05). In conclusion, acid etching enhanced the electrochemical stability of cpTi. Hydrogen peroxide and sodium fluoride reduced the resistance to corrosion of cpTi, independent to the surface treatment. Chlorhexidine gluconate and cetylpyridinium chloride did not alter the corrosive behavior of cpTi. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The main used {{processes}} of {{modification of the}} implant surface are: <b>machining,</b> <b>sandblasting,</b> etching and oxiding. They have the purpose to reduce the times of the osseointegration and to improve its quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate how these processes macroscopically (at 5 m depth) modify the implant surface and its chemical composition. The originality of this investigation was that all the implants were tested as manufactured for clinical use. Ten of the major used implant systems were the object of this study: they were divided by the surface treatment in: Machined: Mk III Branemark; Sandblasted: Ankylos, Silhouette and Galant (experimental fixture); Etched: Osseotite, Mac System, MK 4 (experimental fixture), ITI; Oxided: Ti Unite, Pilot. Each fixture was analyzed by SEM (Leo 420) at 50 x and 5000 x at 15 KV of scanning power. The EDX analysis (Energy Dispersion X-ray analysis) was considered to study eventual inclusion of material left from the {{processes of}} surface modification, cleaning and decontamination. The EDX analysis scans the implant surface at a 5 m of depth and is performed during SEM observations using a specific micro tip that identify the chemical elements. The results from SEM analysis shown macroscopical residuals of aluminum oxide on the SLA surface and some oil spots on the machined surface. The results from the EDX analysis are below summarized: Sandblasted surfaces showed particles of Alumina Oxided surfaces showed very high peaks of O 2 Etched surfaces showed only Titanium peaks Machined surfaces showed low peaks of O...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of different ceramic surface treatments after machining grinding on the biaxial flexural strength (BFS) of machinable dental ceramics with different crystalline phases. Materials and Methods: Disk-shape specimens (10 mm in diameter and 1. 3 mm in thickness) of machinable ceramic cores (two silica-based and one zirconia-based ceramics) were prepared. Each type of the ceramic surfaces was then randomly treated (n= 15) with different treatments as follows: 1) machined finish as control, 2) <b>machined</b> finish and <b>sandblasting</b> with alumina, and 3) machined finish and hydrofluoric acid etching for the leucite and lithium disilicate-based ceramics, and for the zirconia; 1) machined finish and post-sintered as control, 2) machined finish, post-sintered, and <b>sandblasting,</b> and 3) <b>machined</b> finish, post-sintered, and Nd;YAG laser irradiation. The BFS were measured in a universal testing machine. Data based were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons post-hoc test (α= 0. 05). Results: The mean BFS of machined finish only surfaces for leucite ceramic {{was significantly higher than}} that of sandblasted (P= 0. 001) and acid etched surfaces (P= 0. 005). A significantly lower BFS was found after sandblasting for lithium disilicate compared with that of other groups (P< 0. 05). Sandblasting significantly increased the BFS for the zirconia (P< 0. 05), but the BFS was significantly decreased after laser irradiation (P< 0. 05).     Conclusions: The BFS of the machinable ceramics was affected by the type of ceramic material and surface treatment method. Sandblasting with alumina was detrimental to the strength of only silica-based ceramics. Nd:YAG laser irradiation may lead to substantial strength degradation of zirconia.  </p...|$|R
