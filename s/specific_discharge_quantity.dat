We selected the Toriisawa basin at the Tokyo University Forest in Chiba, a Tertiary sedimentary rock, and the Shirasaka basin at the Tokyo University Forest in Aichi, a weathered granite basin. We measured <b>discharge</b> <b>quantities</b> at 4 (12. 0 - 39. 4 ha) and 9 (2. 6 - 88. 5 ha) points respectively. The ratios of <b>specific</b> <b>discharge,</b> which were calculated by dividing each <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> value by the <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> value at the basin outlet, varied from 0. 25 to 1. 0 at the Tertiary basin and from 0. 83 to 1. 31 at the granite basin. At the Tertiary basin, the <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> increased {{with an increase in}} basin area, whereas there was relatively little difference between the <b>specific</b> <b>discharges</b> at the granite basin. The electrical conductivity showed the same tendencies as <b>specific</b> <b>discharge.</b> At the Tertiary basin, the electrical conductivity increased with an increase in the basin area while it remained almost constant at the weathered granite basin. These results indicate that much water infiltrates into bedrock at the upstream basin and this infiltrated water containing much dissolved material re-emerges through bedrock at the downstream area in the Tertiary basin. 降雨流出過程の相違を明らかにする目的で，異なる基盤地質における流域面積と比流量の関係を解析した。解析対象流域を新第三紀層堆積岩の千葉演習林内鳥居沢流域と風化花崗岩地帯の愛知演習林内白坂流域とし，鳥居沢流域内で 4 地点（ 12. 0 ～ 39. 4 ha），白坂流域内で 9 地点（ 2. 6 ～ 88. 5 ha）渓流流量を測定した。比流量比を，流域出口での比流量で流域内の各比流量を除して計算したところ，比流量比の値は鳥居沢流域で 0. 25 ～ 1. 0 ，白坂流域で 0. 83 ～ 1. 31 であった。また，鳥居沢流域内では流域面積が増大するに従い比流量も増加するが，白坂流域内では流域面積に関わらず比流量は比較的差が無いという特徴が見られた。電気伝導度の調査でも同様の傾向が見られ，鳥居沢流域内では流域面積の増大に伴い電気伝導度の値が増加することが分かった。これらのことは，上流の流域で基岩への深部浸透が多くあり，これが下流の河道に湧出しているという新第三紀層流域の基底流出形成機構の特徴を示している...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{hydraulic}} {{head and the}} <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> fluctuations depend nonlinearly on the hydraulic conductivity. However, the methods most commonly used in the stochastic analysis of groundwater flow are based upon the linearization of these relations. In this paper we apply a numerical spectral approach to investigate the range of validity of the small perturbation approximation for head and <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> moments in two-dimensional finite domains. We find that the small perturbation approximation tends to underestimate the variance of large-scale head and <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> fluctuations and error increases with increasing log-conductivity variance and increasing domain size. The head fluctuations do not appear ergodic even when the small perturbation approximation predicts they will be ergodic. The <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> fluctuations, on the other hand, do appear ergodic. The small perturbation approximation performs well in estimating <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> variance in the longitudinal direction but significantly underestimates transverse <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> variance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>discharge</b> {{variations}} {{within a}} mesoscale catchment were studied {{on the basis}} of three synoptic sampling campaigns. These were conducted during stable flow conditions within the Krycklan catchment study area in northern Sweden. During each campaign, about 80 individual locations were measured for discharge draining from catchment areas ranging between 0. 12 and 67 km 2. These discharge samplings allowed for the comparison between years within a given season (September 2005 versus September 2008) and between seasons within a given year (May 2008 versus September 2008) of <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> across this boreal landscape. There was considerable variability in <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> across this landscape. The ratio of the interquartile range (IQR) defined as the difference between the 75 th and 25 th percentiles of the <b>specific</b> <b>discharges</b> to the median of the <b>specific</b> <b>discharges</b> ranged from 37 % to 43 %. Factor analysis was used to explore potential relations between landscape characteristics and the <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> observed for 55 of the individual locations that were measured in all three synoptic sampling campaigns. Percentage wet area (i. e., wetlands, mires, and lakes) and elevation were found to be directly related to the <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> during the drier September 2008 sampling while potential annual evaporation was found to be inversely related. There was less of a relationship determined during the wetter post spring flood May 2008 sampling and the late summer rewetted September 2005 sampling. These results indicate the ability of forests to “dry out” parts of the catchment over the summer months while wetlands “keep wet” other parts. To demonstrate the biogeochemical implications of such spatiotemporal variations in <b>specific</b> <b>discharge,</b> we estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports with available data for the May 2008 and September 2008 samplings using both the spatially variable observed <b>specific</b> <b>discharges</b> and the spatially constant catchment average values.

40|$|Improving the {{understanding}} of how stream flow dynamics are influenced by landscape characteristics, such as soils, vegetation and terrain, is a central endeavor of catchment hydrology. Here we investigate how spatial variability in stream flow is related to landscape characteristics using <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> time series from 14 partly nested subcatchments in the Krycklan basin (0. 12 – 68 km 2). Multivariate principal component analyses combined with univariate analyses showed that while variability in landscape characteristics and <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> were strongly related, the spatial patterns varied with season and wetness conditions. During spring snowmelt and at the annual scale, <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> {{was positively related to}} the sum of wetland and lake area. During summer, when flows are lowest, <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> was negatively related to catchment tree volume, but positively related to deeper sediment deposits and catchment area. The results indicate how more densely forested areas on till soils become relatively drier during summer months, while wet areas and deeper sediment soils maintain a higher summer base flow. Annual and seasonal differences in <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> can therefore be explained to a large extent by expected variability in evapotranspiration fluxes and snow accumulation. These analyses provide an organizing principle for how <b>specific</b> <b>discharge</b> varies spatially across the boreal landscape, and how this variation is manifested for different wetness conditions, seasons and time scales...|$|R

40|$|Temperature {{measurements}} {{have been}} used by a variety of researchers to gain insight into groundwater discharge patterns.
