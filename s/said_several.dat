Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship.

5|$|The Cubs {{appointed}} Banks a player-coach for the 1967 season. Banks {{competed with}} John Boccabella for a starting position at first base. Shortly after, Durocher named Banks the outright starter at first base. Banks hit 23 {{home runs and}} drove in 95 runs, {{and went to the}} All-Star Game that year. After the 1967 season, an article in Ebony said Banks was not thought to have made more than $65,000 (equal to $ today) in any season. He had received a pay increase from $33,000 to $50,000 between his MVP seasons in 1958 and 1959, but Ebony <b>said</b> <b>several</b> MLB players were making $100,000 at the time.|$|E

Two crewmen drowned after crash-landing in the ocean.

25|$|Idema's {{allegations}} of withheld evidence were originally made during his Afghan trial in 2004. When {{the men were}} arrested in early July, the tapes were confiscated by the FBI. Caraballo's lawyer, Michael Skibbie, claims {{that he was only}} allowed to access a portion of the tapes weeks after he requested access. Several of the tapes were used; however, Skibbie <b>said</b> <b>several</b> important tapes were damaged, missing or partly erased after the FBI took custody of them. Some of the footage Skibbie obtained was shown in court. The court tapes showed Idema being greeted at an airport by high level Afghan officials, Idema being thanked by Yunus Qanuni, Qanooni's troops working with Idema, captured suspects confessing during interrogation, and ISAF forces helping Idema.|$|E

25|$|Ventura filed a {{defamation}} {{suit against}} Kyle in January 2012. Ventura initially considered dropping the lawsuit, but <b>said</b> <b>several</b> retired Navy SEALs (including {{the owner of}} McP's) demanded that Ventura continue his lawsuit, which Ventura did after Kyle failed {{to agree on a}} settlement in which he would state that the incident never happened. In a motion filed by Kyle's attorney in August 2012 to dismiss two of the suit's three counts, declarations by five former SEALs and the mothers of two others supported Kyle's account. However, in a motion filed by Ventura, Bill DeWitt, a close friend of Ventura and former SEAL who was present with him at the bar, suggested that Ventura interacted with a few SEALs but was involved in no confrontation with Kyle, and said that Kyle's claims were false. DeWitt's wife also said she never witnessed any fight between Kyle and Ventura.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the initial}} season of Survivor, {{there were two}} {{elements}} of controversy raised that involved Boesch. One was a claim from a voted-out contestant that show producer Mark Burnett had at one point influenced tribal council members to vote her out and not Rudy, because he had more appeal to viewers. This was adamantly denied by Burnett and CBS. Another was a claim from a different cast member that Boesch had told them that he had known Burnett before the show. By some accounts, Boesch had been cast by responding to a newspaper advertisement. However, he had also previously worked in 1996 {{as part of the}} logistics team for Burnett's earlier adventure race show Eco-Challenge. Boesch <b>said</b> <b>several</b> hundred others had also worked on the show in that capacity and that he had not known Burnett personally, and Burnett said he had not realized Boesch's earlier involvement until after Survivor had begun.|$|E
500|$|White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano <b>said</b> <b>several</b> {{times on}} Sunday talk shows that [...] "the system had worked", a {{statement}} that engendered some controversy. The next day they retracted the statements, saying that the system had in fact [...] "failed miserably." [...] According to Napolitano, her initial statement had referred to the rapid response to the attack that included alerts sent to the 128 other aircraft in U.S. airspace at the time, and new security requirements for the final hour of flight, rather than the security failures that allowed the attack to happen. Napolitano had originally stated on This Week that [...] "once this incident occurred, everything went according to clockwork" [...] and that [...] "once the incident occurred, the system worked".|$|E

500|$|Wilson conferred {{with his}} officers, {{none of whom}} was {{particularly}} optimistic about their prospects: [...] "This is the end" [...] said one. British soldier and historian Roger Marston postulates that the patrol might still have been safe had it not now pursued the king, but Wilson decided to proceed: [...] "Let's ride on Lobengula," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>Several</b> analysts comment that this was perhaps excessively rash. Marston says that Wilson's actions [...] "had a flavour of doomed resignation about them", and suggests that the major believed no other path was open, and was therefore going for broke. The Matabele hovered around the vicinity, {{waiting to see what}} Wilson would do next. On the southern side of the river, the 300 Matabele riflemen took up a well-covered position near the riverbank, about [...] to the left of Forbes's position. Hidden by a patch of scrub, they remained undetected by the Company troops.|$|E
500|$|The Peronist unions opposed De la Rúa {{and held}} seven general strikes against him. He sent a bill [...] {{known as the}} labour {{flexibility}} law to deregulate labor conditions, attempting to reduce the political influence of unions, to the Congress. This project was opposed by the PJ and was changed from the original draft. It was finally approved but Álvarez <b>said</b> <b>several</b> legislators were bribed to support the bill. Álvarez asked {{for the removal of}} the labor minister Alberto Flamarique, but De la Rúa instead promoted him to be his personal secretary. Álvarez resigned the following day and the political scandal divided the coalition. Several deputees who initially supported De la Rúa switched to the opposition. Alfonsín tried to prevent a breakup of the UCR. Some months later, it was proposed that Álvarez returned as Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers; he initially supported the idea but De la Rúa opposed it. Cavallo was also proposed for the office before he was appointed Minister of Economy. De la Rúa intended to include the Frepaso in the new cabinet but to exclude Álvarez himself because he still resented the latter's resignation. The negotiations failed and the new cabinet included no Frepaso politicians, but the Alliance was still working as a coalition in the Congress. It also included several radical politicians from Alfonsín's internal faction. The new Chief of Cabinet was Chrystian Colombo, who mediated between Alfonsín and the president.|$|E
500|$|Described {{as one of}} [...] "R's most {{important}} artists" [...] during the 1990s, her second studio album, One in a Million, {{became one of the}} most influential R albums of the decade. Music critic Simon Reynolds cited [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] as [...] "the most radical pop single" [...] of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that rather than being the song's focal point, Aaliyah [...] "knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line", and consequently [...] "helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny's Child owe a clear debt to 'Are You That Somebody'." [...] Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah [...] "had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years." [...] Music publication Popdust called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground due mainly to her influence on the underground alternative music scene, which consists of heavy sampling and references to her music by underground artists. Popdust also mentioned that the forward-thinking music Aaliyah did with Timbaland and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artists are somewhat cut from the same cloth. While compiling a list of artists that take cues from Aaliyah, MTV Hive mentioned that it's easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and lo-fi R movements. With sales of 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide, Aaliyah earned the nicknames [...] "Princess of R" [...] and [...] "Queen of Urban Pop", as she [...] "proved she was a muse in her own right". Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone dubbed her as the [...] "undisputed queen of the midtempo come-on". Aaliyah has been referred to as a pop icon and a R icon for her impact and contributions to those respective genres. Japanese pop singer Hikaru Utada has <b>said</b> <b>several</b> times that [...] "It was when I heard Aaliyah's Age Ain't Nothing but a Number that I got hooked on R", after which Utada released her debut album First Love with heavy R influences. Another Japanese pop singer Crystal Kay has expressed how she admired Aaliyah when she was growing up and how she would practice dancing while watching her music videos.|$|E
