25|$|The first {{computer}} keyboards were for mainframe computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor {{was introduced in}} 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip 8048 microcontroller variant since it became available in 1978. The keyboard <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional {{to the extent that}} the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights.|$|E
2500|$|Diodes {{are also}} used in {{electronic}} musical keyboards. To {{reduce the amount of}} wiring needed in electronic musical keyboards, these instruments often use keyboard matrix circuits. The keyboard controller scans the rows and columns to determine which note the player has pressed. The problem with matrix circuits is that, when several notes are pressed at once, the current can flow backwards through the circuit and trigger [...] "phantom keys" [...] that cause [...] "ghost" [...] notes to play. To avoid triggering unwanted notes, most keyboard matrix circuits have diodes soldered with the switch under each key of the musical keyboard. The same principle is also used for the <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> in solid-state pinball machines.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Switch</b> <b>Matrix</b> {{is made up}} of RF {{switches}} and signal conditioners that are mounted together in a mechanical infrastructure or housing. Cables then interconnect the {{switches and}} signal conditioners. The <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> then employs a driver circuit and power supply to power and drive the switches and signal conditioners. The <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> uses connectors or fixtures to route the signal paths from the sourcing and measurement equipment to the DUT. The <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> is typically located close to the DUT to shorten the signal paths, thus reducing insertion loss and signal degradation.|$|E
40|$|A <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> (30) {{connects to}} an access network (10) {{and a set}} of at least two {{operator}} networks (41). A controller (51) performs a method of establishing new connections across the <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> (30) in response to new connection requests. The new connection requests involve a sub-set of the set of operator networks. The controller determines (103) if the new connections can be established across the <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> by rearranging only existing connections across the <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> to the sub-set of operator networks and, in response, establishes (104) the at least one new connection. Otherwise, the controller rearranges (105) existing connections across the <b>switching</b> <b>matrix</b> to at least one other of the set of operator networks to establish the new connections. The controller (51) minimises the number of other operator networks which are involved when rearranging existing connections.

40|$|Integrated circuit {{technologies}} are enabling intelligent, chip-based, optical packet <b>switch</b> <b>matrices.</b> Rapid real-time re-configurability at the photonic layer using integrated circuit technologies {{is expected to}} enable cost-effective, energy-efficient, and transparent data communications. InP integrated photonic circuits offer high-performance amplifiers, switches, modulators, detectors, and de/multiplexers in the same wafer-scale processes. The complexity of these circuits has been transformed as the process technologies have matured, enabling component counts to increase to many hundreds per chip. Active–passive monolithic integration has enabled <b>switching</b> <b>matrices</b> with up to 480 components, connecting 16 inputs to 16 outputs. Integrated <b>switching</b> <b>matrices</b> route data streams of hundreds of gigabits per second. Multi-path and packet time-scale switching have been demonstrated in the laboratory to route between multiple fibre connections.
