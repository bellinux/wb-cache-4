40|$|During the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), {{automated}} {{measurements of}} snow water equivalent (SWE) {{were made at}} the Sodankylä (Finland), Weissfluhjoch (Switzerland) and Caribou Creek (Canada) SPICE sites during the northern hemispheric winters of 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15. Supplementary intercomparison measurements were made at Fortress Mountain (Kananaskis, Canada) during the 2013 / 14 winter. The objectives of this analysis are to compare automated SWE measurements with a reference, comment on their performance and, where possible, to make recommendations on how to best use the instruments and interpret their measurements. Sodankylä, Caribou Creek and Fortress Mountain hosted a Campbell Scientific CS 725 passive gamma radiation SWE sensor. Sodankylä and Weissfluhjoch hosted a Sommer Messtechnik SSG 1000 <b>snow</b> <b>scale.</b> The CS 725 operating principle is based on measuring the attenuation of soil emitted gamma radiation by the snowpack and relating the attenuation to SWE. The SSG 1000 measures {{the mass of the}} overlying snowpack directly by using a weighing platform and load cell. Manual SWE measurements were obtained at the intercomparison sites on a bi-weekly basis over the accumulation–ablation periods using bulk density samplers. These manual measurements are considered to be the reference for the intercomparison. Results from Sodankylä and Caribou Creek showed that the CS 725 generally overestimates SWE as compared to manual measurements by roughly 30 – 35  % with correlations (r 2) as high as 0. 99 for Sodankylä and 0. 90 for Caribou Creek. The RMSE varied from 30 to 43  mm water equivalent (mm w. e.) and from 18 to 25  mm w. e. at Sodankylä and Caribou Creek, which had respective SWE maximums of approximately 200 and 120  mm w. e. The correlation at Fortress Mountain was 0. 94 (RMSE of 48  mm w. e. with a maximum SWE of approximately 650  mm w. e.) with no systematic overestimation. The SSG 1000 <b>snow</b> <b>scale,</b> having a different measurement principle, agreed quite closely with the manual measurements at Sodankylä and Weissfluhjoch throughout the periods when data were available (r 2 as high as 0. 99 and RMSE from 8 to 24  mm w. e. at Sodankylä and from 56 to 59  mm w. e. at Weissfluhjoch, where maximum SWE was approximately 850  mm w. e.). When the SSG 1000 was compared to the CS 725 at Sodankylä, the agreement was linear until the start of ablation when the positive bias in the CS 725 increases substantially relative to the SSG 1000. Since both Caribou Creek and Sodankylä have sandy soil, water from the snowpack readily infiltrates into the soil during melt, even if the soil is frozen. However, the CS 725 does not differentiate this water from the unmelted snow. This issue can be identified, at least during the late spring ablation period, with soil moisture and temperature observations like those measured at Caribou Creek. With a less permeable soil and surface runoff, the increase in the instrument bias during ablation is not as significant, as shown by the Fortress Mountain intercomparison...|$|E

This study examines the temporal consistency of <b>snow</b> depth <b>scaling</b> features at two sites using snow depth distributions derived from lidar datasets collected in 2003 and 2005. The temporal snow accumulation patterns in these two years were substantially different, but both years represent nearly average 1 April accumulation depths for these sites, with consistent statistical distributions. Two distinct fractal regions are observed in each log–log variogram, separated by a scale break, which indicates a length scale at which a substantial change in the driving processes exists. The lag distance of the scale break is 15 m at the Walton Creek site and 40 m at the Alpine site. The datasets show consistent fractal dimensions and scale break distances between the two years, suggesting that the scaling features observed in spatial snow depth distributions are largely determined by physiography and vegeta-tion characteristics and are relatively insensitive to annual variations in snowfall. Directional variograms also show consistent patterns between years, with smaller fractal dimensions aligned with the dominant wind direction at each site...|$|R

Algorithms to {{calculate}} the threshold wind speed {{and the effect of}} exposed vegetation on saltation and to describe vertical profiles of humidity in blowing snow, permit the calculation of point blowing snow transport and sublimation fluxes using standard meteorological and landcover data or simple interfaces with climate models.

Blowing <b>snow</b> fluxes <b>scaled</b> in this manner were used to calculate snow mass balance and to simulate seasonal snow accumulation at a southern Saskatchewan prairie and an arctic site. Ficld measurements at these sites indicated that from 48 % to 58 % of snowfall was removed by blowing snow before melt began. Simulations suggest that the ratios of snow removed and sublimated by blowing snow to that transported were 2 :l and 1 :l at the prairie and arctic sites respectively. The resulting methodology was capable of estimating winter season mass balances for these snowpacks that compared well with snowfall and snow accumulation measurements. 1...|$|R

Though sublimation dominates the ablation process in this region, measurable increases in soil moisture and insulation from temperature extremes provide more favorable conditions with respect to subnivian soil communities. While precipitation is not substantial, significant amounts of snow can accumulate, via aeolian redistribution, in topographic lees along the valley bottoms, forming thousands of discontinuous snow patches. These patches {{have the potential to}} act as significant sources of local melt water, controlling biogeochemical cycling and the landscape distribution of microbial communities. Therefore, determining the spatial and temporal dynamics of <b>snow</b> at multiple <b>scales</b> is imperative to understanding the broader ecological role of snow in this region. High-resolution satellite imagery acquired during the 2009 – 2010 and 2010 – 2011 austral summers was used to quantify the distribution of snow across Taylor and Wright Valleys. Extracted snow-covered area from the imagery was used as the basis for assessing seasonal variability and seasonal controls on accumulation and ablation of <b>snow</b> at multiple <b>scales.</b> In addition, fifteen 1 km 2 plots (3 in each of 5 study regions) were selected to assess the prevalence of snow cover at finer spatial scales. Results confirm that snow patches tend to form in the same locations each year with some minor deviations observed. At the snow-patch scale, neighboring patches often exhibit considerable differences in aerial ablation rates, and particular snow patches do not reflect trends for snow-covered area observed at the landscape scale. These differences are presumably related to microtopographic influences over snow depth and exposure.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Snow becomes patchy while melting, {{giving a}} {{heterogeneous}} surface with large contrasts in {{characteristics such as}} albedo. It is therefore necessary for surface schemes used in atmospheric and hydrological models to represent the influence of hetero-geneities in <b>snow</b> cover on <b>scales</b> smaller than the model grid; this is typically done by introducing a snow-cover depletion (SCD) curve relating fractional snow cover to aver-age depth.

The energy available for melt may be heterogeneous, however, and can be influenced by factors that also influence snow distribution, such as slope, aspect and vegetation cover. Themodification of SCD curves by spatial variations in melt energy is investigated, and resulting curves are found to be similar to those which would be given by homogeneous melting of a snow cover with greater initial variance. This influence is increased by any negative correlation between snow depth and melt rate...|$|R

Many engineering and environmental problems require a comprehensive understanding of snow behavior which arises {{as a consequence}} of phenomena spanning a wide spectrum of spatial length <b>scales.</b> <b>Snow</b> is classically described as a granular heterogeneous medium consisting of air and three water phases: ice, vapor, and liquid. The ice phase consists of grains arranged on a matrix according to a random load-bearing skeleton.

It was suggested that the fractal dimension can be adopted as a relevant parameter for quantifying snow morphology, in terms of the distribution of voids, and density over a wide range of spatial scales. In this work this concept is further developed. Snow density is simulated by means of a lacunar fractal, namely, a generalized Menger sponge.

In this study, data for three winter seasons (2002 – 03, 2003 – 04, 2004 – 05) from ten Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS) in northern Saskatchewan were used to assess the relation-ships between local <b>scale</b> <b>snow</b> depth variability, ascertained from snow survey transects, and single point mea-surements made with sonic depth sensors.

40|$|International audienceTesting of the Integrated Nitrogen {{model for}} Catchments (INCA) {{in a wide}} range of {{ecosystem}} types across Europe has shown that the model underestimates N transformation processes to a large extent in northern catchments of Finland and Norway in winter and spring. It is found, and generally assumed, that microbial activity in soils proceeds at low rates at northern latitudes during winter, even at sub-zero temperatures. The INCA model was modified to improve the simulation of N transformation rates in northern catchments, characterised by cold climates and extensive snow accumulation and insulation in winter, by introducing an empirical function to simulate soil temperatures below the seasonal snow pack, and a degree-day model to calculate the depth of the snow pack. The proposed snow-correction factor improved the simulation of soil temperatures at Finnish and Norwegian field sites in winter, although soil temperature was still underestimated during periods with a thin snow cover. Finally, a comparison between the modified INCA version (v. 1. 7) and the former version (v. 1. 6) was made at the Simojoki river basin in northern Finland and at Dalelva Brook in northern Norway. The new modules did not imply any significant changes in simulated NO 3 - concentration levels in the streams but improved the timing of simulated higher concentrations. The inclusion of a modified temperature response function and an empirical snow-correction factor improved the flexibility and applicability of the model for climate effect studies.

40|$|Arctic {{terrestrial}} {{ecosystems are}} major global sources of methane (CH 4); hence, {{it is important}} to understand the seasonal and climatic controls on CH 4 emissions from these systems. Here, we report year-round CH 4 emissions from Alaskan Arctic tundra eddy flux sites and regional fluxes derived from aircraft data. We find that emissions during the cold season (September to May) account for >= 50 % of the annual CH 4 flux, with the highest emissions from noninundated upland tundra. A major fraction of cold season emissions occur during the "zero curtain" period, when subsurface soil temperatures are poised near 0 degrees C. The zero curtain may persist longer than the growing season, and CH 4 emissions are enhanced when the duration is extended by a deep thawed layer as can occur with thick <b>snow</b> cover. Regional <b>scale</b> fluxes of CH 4 derived from aircraft data demonstrate the large spatial extent of late season CH 4 emissions. Scaled to the circumpolar Arctic, cold season fluxes from tundra total 12 +/- 5 (95 % confidence interval) Tg CH 4 y(- 1), similar to 25 % of global emissions from extratropical wetlands, or similar to 6 % of total global wetland methane emissions. The dominance of late-season emissions, sensitivity to soil environmental conditions, and importance of dry tundra are not currently simulated in most global climate models. Because Arctic warming disproportionally impacts the cold season, our results suggest that higher cold-season CH 4 emissions will result from observed and predicted increases in snow thickness, active layer depth, and soil temperature, representing important positive feedbacks on climate warming...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of snow water equivalent and other properties {{play an important}} role in weather, natural hazard, and hydrological forecasting and climate modeling over a range of scales in space and time. Remote sensing-derived estimates have traditionally been of the "snapshot" type, but techniques involving models with assimilation are also being explored. In both cases, forward emission models are useful to understand the observed passive microwave signatures and developing retrieval algorithms. However, mismatches between passive microwave sensor resolutions and the scales of processes controlling subpixel heterogeneity can affect the accuracy of the estimates. Improving the spatial resolution of new passive microwave satellite sensors is a major desire in order to (literally) resolve such subpixel heterogeneity, but limited spacecraft and mission resources impose severe constraints and tradeoffs. In order to maximize science return while mitigating risk for a satellite concept, it is essential to understand the <b>scaling</b> behavior of <b>snow</b> in terms of what the sensor sees (brightness temperature) as well as in terms of the actual variability of snow. NASA's Cold Land Processes Experiment- 1 (CLPX- 1 : Colorado, 2002 and 2003) was designed to provide data to measure these scaling behaviors for varying snow conditions in areas with forested, alpine, and meadow/pasture land cover. We will use observations from CLPX- 1 ground, airborne, and satellite passive microwave sensors to examine and evaluate the scaling behavior of observed and modeled brightness temperatures and observed and retrieved <b>snow</b> parameters across <b>scales</b> from meters to 10 's of kilometers. The conclusions will provide direct examples of the appropriate spatial sampling scales of new sensors for snow remote sensing. The analyses will also illustrate the effects and spatial scales of the underlying phenomena (e. g., land cover) that control subpixel heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Hydrologists {{and water}} {{managers}} have been attempting to accurately estimate watershed <b>scale</b> <b>snow</b> water equivalent (SWE) {{for over a}} century. Extensive monitoring networks, remote sensing technology, and sophisticated modeling approaches have greatly improved these estimates; however, water inputs from snow in mountainous areas are still subject to considerable uncertainty due to SWE spatial variability. In an attempt to improve the understanding of physical processes and controls influencing SWE spatial variability, a field campaign to measure the spatial and temporal distribution of SWE within the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed (DCEW) was conducted during 2009 and 2010. These measurements are compared to a distributed SWE data assimilation and modeling product from the National Weather Service called the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) to estimate the sub-pixel variability and accuracy of the model estimates, as well as attempt to understand model deviation from observed conditions. These data are evaluated using the variogram to assess the evolution of SWE variability and spatial correlation lengths throughout the winter. Correlations between snow depth and landscape characteristics are explored to determine the most influential physical processes influencing SWE distribution. Specifically, this work indentifies {{the relative importance of}} differential accumulation, redistribution, and differential ablation at three spatial scales. Results from this work indicate that at the watershed scale (27 km 2), elevation is the most important control on snow distribution, while at the SNODAS pixel scale (1 km 2), and 1 meter spaced transect scale, differential solar radiation is a stronger control on SWE distribution during ablation. Comparison of transect scale and SNODAS pixel scale observations with SNODAS show the model under-predicts SWE throughout the winter at two out of three sites, and over-predicts during ablation at one site. SNODAS captures the watershed scale elevation trend, but under-predicts the magnitude of SWE at assumed maximum accumulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} climate change {{prediction}} has {{focused attention on}} the Surface Mass Balance (SMB) of the Antarctic continent and on how it influences the sea level. The SMB of the Antarctic plateau is governed by the equilibrium between precipitation and ablation processes such as sublimation and wind-borne <b>snow</b> redistribution. At <b>scales</b> of hundreds of kilometres snowfall variability dominates the snow accumulation process (Dery and Yau, 2002); at smaller scales, postdepositional process such as wind-borne redistribution, surface sublimation and snowdrift sublimation becomes more important. In recent years the sublimation phenomenon has received much attention from the glacial-meteorological community, and some theoretical studies have tried to model it (Bintanja, 1998; Dery & Yau, 2001 b; Frezzotti, 2004). There are {{two different types of}} sublimation: surface sublimation and blowing snow sublimation. Surface sublimation is mostly determined by the continual exchange of water between the air (in the vapour phase) and the snow pack (in the solid phase) due to solar irradiance. Blowing snow sublimation is possibly the more effective of the two sublimation processes. It occurs when snow particles at the surface are blown by winds exceeding a certain threshold value. Particles suspended in the sub saturated Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) sublimate at a relatively fast rate, cooling air mass transported by the wind and increasing the local atmospheric moisture content. When the first few meters of the ABL are completely saturated, the process is dumped. It {{takes a long time to}} meet this condition because katabatic winds transport saturated air masses to the coast, thereby reactivating sublimation. The role of sublimation in snow accumulation and its high variability at local scales are not fully understood due to the few available measurements in Antarctica. Further study and field experiments are required...|$|R
40|$|The glaciers {{of central}} Asia provide {{suitable}} locations {{from which to}} recover continuous, high-resolution glaciochemical records on a continental scale. Although the glaciochemical investigations undertaken to date in central Asia are few in number and limited in terms of spatial coverage and length of record, some preliminary observations can be made concerning regional and seasonal trends in snow chemistry in this region. The sodium chloride ratio for most snow samples collected in central Asia approaches the ratio found in sea water (0. 86 in /Leq kg-I), reflecting a marine source for these constituents. Sodium and chloride concentrations are, on average, 3 - 10 times higher in the Himalayas than in the Karakoram, demonstrating the greater influence of monsoonal sources of moisture in the Himalayas. Very high sodium concentrations from Khel Khod Glacier probably reflect a local crustal source from surrounding ice-free areas. Low nitrate concentrations were found in snow collected from the southern margin of the Himalayas and high concentrations in snow deposited on the north margin of the Himalayas. This strong regional trend in the spatial distribution of nitrate suggests the influx of continental aerosols, rich in nitrate, originating from the arid regions of central Asia. High calcium concentrations measured in snow from Mount Everest and the north-west corner of China are also indicative of dust derived from the arid regions of central Asia. Very high sulfate concentrations found in snow from the Tien Shan and the Bogda Shan most likely reflect local anthropogenic sources. The altitude effect on isotopic composition is not apparent from snow samples collected in central Asia. Understanding the processes which control the chemical content of <b>snow,</b> the local-to-regional <b>scale</b> complexities, and the seasonal variability are fundamental steps necessary to assess the potential for recovering representative long-term glaciochemical records from central Asia...|$|R
40|$|Our {{changing}} climate {{will affect}} human lives in manifold ways. Especially sea-level rise {{is driven by}} diminishing amounts of snow and land ice. The cryosphere {{as part of the}} Earth’s climate system provides interconnecting feedbacks between its components, leading to multifaceted changes. To understand these feedback mechanisms we have to consider the various interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans and the ice covering both polar land and seas. The state and evolution of Earth’s glaciers and ice sheets play a key role therein and thus profound ice physics knowledge with respect to ice sheet dynamics is required. Ice sheet dynamics on multiple scales, from microscopic processes to continental-sized phenomena, are in the focus of scientific attention to improve climate predictions on a global <b>scale.</b> <b>Snow</b> and ice physics are mutual research interests for AWI glaciologists and ILTS researchers. The state and evolution of ice sheets and glaciers is partly recorded in deep ice cores drilled through the Antarctic and Greenlandic ice. Two upcoming drilling projects will further strengthen the Japanese-German cooperation in glaciological research: EGRIP(Greenland) focusing on questions concerning the dynamics of ice streams and IPICS Oldest Ice (Antarctica) focusing on obtaining oldest paleao-climate information from ice cores. Advanced analysis of ice core material can teach us the climate history of our planet and reveal physical mechanisms leading to ice motion. Selected ice-related research topics relevant for AWI and ILTS will be presented, as for example, the mapping of ice micro-structures, which are reflecting the deformation and recrystallisation processes that control ice sheet flow. The connection between ice dynamics, microstructures, and climatic changes is tackled by additional application of palaeo-climate record methods on impurities measured in ice cores. Experiments on pure and doped ice material (e. g. with solved or insoluble chemicals and antifreeze proteins) provide better understanding of basic processes in ice polycrystals. Process modelling as well as phenomenological modelling of ice deformation then tests and completes our current understanding of ice sheet dynamics and result in improved future projections...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{fluorinated}} {{organic compounds}} are emerging environmental contaminants of concern, {{due to their}} persistence, ubiquitous distribution, bioaccumulation potential and toxicity. Ski waxes are sources of highly fluorinated chemicals to the environment {{that have not been}} investigated so far. Some contain fluorinated additives such as semifluorinated n-alkanes (SFAs). This thesis investigated the fate of SFAs after abrasion onto snow through skiing activities. Furthermore, perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs) were found to be present in fluorinated ski waxes. A lot of {{attention has been paid to}} elucidating the environmental fate of PFAAs during the past decade. However, nothing was known so far about their release from melting snow packs. Analytical methods for quantification of SFAs in different environmental matrices were developed. The methods were used to investigate the fate of SFAs during snow melt and to study their occurrence in ski areas. Laboratory snow melt experiments and model-based fate simulations suggested that SFAs will sorb to the snow grain surface and particles in the bulk snow and, after snowmelt, will end up on the underlying (soil) surface. SFAs were detected and quantified for the first time in snow and soil samples taken from a ski area in Sweden. Comparison of concentrations in snow and soil did not give any evidence for long-term accumulation of SFAs in surface soil, but suggested volatilization of shorter chain homologues during snow melt. Such a volatilization could also explain an observed SFA pattern difference between snow and soil samples. Laboratory <b>scale</b> <b>snow</b> melt experiments were also used to investigate the behavior of PFAAs during snowmelt. PFAAs were released with the melt water from the snow pack in pulses. The pulses occurred early, late or with a so far unknown peak elution in the middle of the snowmelt, depending on the hydrophobicity of the PFAAs. These peak releases were further influenced by the age of the snow pack and thus the snow surface area and to a lesser extent by pH and ion concentrations...|$|R
