40|$|SUMMARY Thirty-six {{patients}} were assessed by thallium- 201 myocardial imaging {{before and after}} aortocoronary bypass operations {{and the results were}} compared with evaluation based on symptomatic assessment, exercise testing, and electrocardiography. After operation, the majority of {{patients were}} free from symptoms or symptomatically improved with increased exercise duration. Perioperative myocardial damage was shown in eight patients and myocardial ischaemia in 15 patients when assessed by thallium imaging during exercise. Thallium imaging proved more sensitive than electrocardiography in the demonstration of perioperative infarction and in the detection of postoperative ischaemia. Exercise electrocardiography may be misleading after aortocoronary bypass operations. Thallium imaging offers a simple, objective evaluation ofthe results ofrevascularisation procedures, throws light on the mechanisms of relief of angina by operation, and helps in the assessment of the patient whose progress is unsatisfactory after operation.

We identified a girl {{at the age of}} five yr with clinical homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia presenting with achilles tendon xanthomas and arcus lipoides. Her total cholesterol reached up to 1050 mg/dL. Molecular characterization of the LDL-receptor gene revealed a homozygous p. W 577 R mutation. Despite intensive treatment interventions with the combination of diet, statins, colestipol, and LDL-apheresis, the patient developed <b>symptomatic</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> at the age of 16 yr.

40|$|Abstract Coronary stenting is {{routinely}} utilized to treat <b>symptomatic</b> obstructive <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease.</b> However, {{the efficacy of}} bare metal coronary stents has been historically limited by restenosis, which is primarily due to excessive neointima formation. Drug-eluting stents (DES) are composed of a stainless steel backbone encompassed by a polymer in which a variety of drugs that inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation and excessive neointima formation are incorporated. DES have significantly reduced the incidence of restenosis but are also associated with a small (~ 0. 5 % per year) but significant risk of late stent thrombosis. In that regard, estrogen-eluting stents have also undergone clinical evaluation in reducing restenosis with the additional potential benefit of enhancing reendothelialization of the stent surface to reduce stent thrombosis. Estrogen directly promotes vasodilatation, enhances endothelial healing, and prevents smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. Due to these mechanisms, estrogen has been postulated to reduce neointimal hyperplasia without delaying endothelial healing. In animal studies, estrogen treatment was effective in decreasing neointimal hyperplasia after both balloon angioplasty and stenting regardless o...|$|R
50|$|In 2007 the New England Journal of Medicine {{published}} {{the results of}} a trial called COURAGE. The study compared stenting as used in PCI to medical therapy alone in <b>symptomatic</b> stable <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> (CAD).

After this trial there were widely publicized reports of individual doctors performing PCI in patients who did not meet any traditional criteria. A 2014 meta-analysis showed there may be improved mortality with second generation drug-eluting stents, which were not available during the COURAGE trial. Medical societies have since issued guidelines as to when it is appropriate to perform percutaneous coronary intervention. In response the rate of inappropriate stenting was seen to have declined between 2009 and 2014. Statistics published related to the trends in U.S. hospital procedures, showed a 28% decrease in the overall number of PCIs performed in the period from 2001 to 2011, with the largest decrease notable from 2007.|$|R

Methods: Totally, 98 patients with <b>symptomatic</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> and a chronic total occlusion observed during coronary angiography were recruited. Genotyping of two vascular endothelial growth factor promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (− 152 G>A and − 165 C>T) and the C 1772 T single nucleotide polymorphism of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α were performed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The presence and extent of collateral vessel filling was scored by blinded observers using the Rentrop grade. Results: We found no association between the vascular endothelial growth factor − 152 G>A, − 165 C>T and hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α − 1772 C>T with the presence and filling of coronary collateral vessels. A history of percutaneous coronary intervention and transient ischaemic attack/cerebrovascular accident were associated with the presence of enhanced collateral vessel formation following binary logistic regression analysis.

All costs and effects were discounted at 3 % annually. All costs are reported in US dollars of the financial year 2007. The incremental effects are 0. 002 (95 % confidence interval - 0. 039 to 0. 041) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the sirolimus- and - 0. 001 (- 0. 040 to 0. 038) QALYs for the paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES). The incremental costs are $ 2790 for the sirolimus- and $ 3838 for the PES. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is <$ 1, 000, 000 per QALY for the sirolimus-eluting stent.
