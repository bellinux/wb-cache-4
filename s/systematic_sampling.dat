25|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>sampling</b> (also {{known as}} {{interval}} sampling) relies on arranging {{the study population}} according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. <b>Systematic</b> <b>sampling</b> involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element from then onwards. In this case, k=(population size/sample size). It {{is important that the}} starting point is not automatically the first in the list, but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the kth element in the list. A simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory (an 'every 10th' sample, also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10').|$|E
25|$|However, <b>systematic</b> <b>sampling</b> is {{especially}} vulnerable to periodicities in the list. If periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used, the sample {{is especially}} likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population, making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling.|$|E

25|$|As {{long as the}} {{starting}} point is randomized, <b>systematic</b> <b>sampling</b> is a type of probability sampling. It is easy to implement and the stratification induced can make it efficient, if the variable by which the list is ordered is correlated with the variable of interest. 'Every 10th' sampling is especially useful for efficient sampling from databases.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, <b>systematic</b> <b>sampling</b> is an EPS method, {{because all}} elements {{have the same}} probability of selection (in the example given, one in ten). It is not 'simple random sampling' because different subsets {{of the same size}} have different selection probabilities – e.g. the set {4,14,24,...,994} has a one-in-ten probability of selection, but the set {4,13,24,34,...} has zero probability of selection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>sampling</b> {{theory can}} be used to create a {{probability}} proportionate to size sample. This is done by treating each count within the size variable as a single sampling unit. Samples are then identified by selecting at even intervals among these counts within the size variable. This method is sometimes called PPS-sequential or monetary unit sampling in the case of audits or forensic sampling.|$|E

50|$|The {{best way}} to avoid a biased or unrepresentative sample is to select a random sample, also known as a {{probability}} sample. A random sample is defined as a sample where each individual member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected as part of the sample. Several types of random samples are simple random <b>samples,</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>samples,</b> stratified random samples, and cluster random samples.|$|R
40|$|In large {{multipurpose}} surveys, it {{is common}} to select the sample systematically proportional to some measure of size (PPS) that is correlated with an important variable of interest. Assuming the frame is sorted in a useful deterministic manner, <b>systematic</b> <b>sample</b> methodologies provide an additional control on the sample allocation, beyond the control provided from the stratification. This makes it less likely to select a "bad sample. " This should reduce the variability of the estimates as compared to a comparable nonsystematic selection procedure. The problem with <b>systematic</b> <b>samples</b> is that variance estimators are biased. This paper presents a bootstrap variance estimator, which can have less bias than standard methodologies, such as half-sample replication. The results will be demonstrated with a simulation study based on an important National Center for Education Statistics survey, the Schools and Staffing Survey. An appendix demonstrates the consistency of the proposed estimators. (Contains 8 tables and 12 references.)

50|$|Using this {{procedure}} each {{element in the}} population has a known and equal probability of selection. This makes <b>systematic</b> <b>sampling</b> functionally similar to simple random sampling (SRS). However {{it is not the}} same as SRS because not every possible sample of a certain size has an equal chance of being chosen (e.g. samples with at least two elements adjacent to each other will never be chosen by <b>systematic</b> <b>sampling).</b> It is however, much more efficient (if variance within systematic sample is more than variance of population).|$|E

The {{most common form of}} <b>systematic</b> <b>sampling</b> is an equiprobability method. In this approach, progression through the list is treated circularly, with a return to the top once the end of the list is passed.
