2500|$|Their final {{actions of}} the war were fought around Bellicourt during the Battle of the St. Quentin Canal in late September and early October 1918. In a single day in late September, the pioneers lost 64 men {{fighting}} alongside Americans from the US 105th Engineers, as the battalion became caught up in close quarters fighting, having to [...] "down tools" [...] and deal with isolated pockets of resistance, before working to capture several machine gun positions that had been bypassed by the assaulting infantry in the <b>smoke</b> <b>haze.</b> After this, they were withdrawn from the line with the other units of the Australian Corps for rest {{at the behest of}} the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes. Following the armistice in November 1918, the battalion remained on the continent as the demobilisation process began. [...] Personnel were repatriated to Australia via the United Kingdom, where they undertook various education courses to prepare them to return to civilian life. The final 130 men of the battalion departed for the United Kingdom on 15 May 1919, returning to Australia later in the year.|$|E

Then he made out a black smear that moved across it amidst a turmoil of foam and a haze of smoke. It grew larger while he watched it, and there was a red streak of flame from one of the two funnels that took shape rapidly, but he could see no masts or hull, and the speed with which the <b>smoke</b> <b>haze</b> was coming on {{appeared}} incredible. Then he sprang forward, and lowered the latine into the boat.|$|E

50|$|Atmospheric {{particulate}} matter was {{the form of}} air pollutant that predominantly contributed to the haze and degradation in ambient air quality standards during this crisis. In all countries affected by the <b>smoke</b> <b>haze,</b> an increase of acute health outcomes was observed. Health effects; included emergency room visits due to respiratory symptoms such as asthma, upper respiratory infection, decreased lung function as well as eye and skin irritation, were caused mainly by this {{particulate matter}}. In Singapore, for instance, health surveillance showed a 30% increase in hospital attendance due to air quality related symptoms. Generally, children and the elderly, {{as well as those}} with pre-existing respiratory and cardiac diseases were the most susceptible to adverse health outcomes from the haze exposure. The <b>smoke</b> <b>haze</b> episode has added to the urban and industrial air pollution in Southeast Asia, causing it to reach alarming levels in many metropolitan areas.|$|E

Both the Germans and the Americans watched the <b>smoke</b> and <b>haze</b> clear from the explosion and were shocked to see the bridge was still standing. Only the charge on the southeast pier, two-thirds of the way across, had exploded, but the weak industrial explosive had failed to bring down the well-built steel bridge.|$|R

50|$|Singapore {{has been}} {{regularly}} hit by <b>smoke</b> <b>haze</b> from forest fires in nearby Sumatra, Indonesia, brought over by wind. These forest fires {{have been attributed}} to the slash-and-burn method favoured by several large plantation owners to clear their land, as opposed to a more expensive and inconvenient mechanical approach using excavators and bulldozers. In June 2013, severe haze hit Singapore, pushing the nation's PSI into Hazardous levels {{for the first time in}} its history. Presently, the highest 3-hour PSI reading on record in Singapore is 401 on 21 June 2013 at 12 noon (GMT+8).|$|E
5000|$|In {{a letter}} written that year, Pissarro himself {{describes}} the painting: [...] "The theme is the bridge near the Placede la Bourse {{with the effects of}} rain, crowds of people coming and going, smoke from the boats, quays with cranes, workers in the foreground, and all this in grey colors glistening in the rain." [...] He further wrote, [...] "what particularly interests me is the motif off the iron bridge in wet weather with all the vehicles, pedestrians, workers on the embankment, boats, <b>smoke,</b> <b>haze</b> in the distance; it's so spirited, so alive.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were four}} signal {{stations}} in close succession, and each {{was required to}} give [...] "line clear" [...] having ascertained that the drawbridges and other hazards were in the correct position. The men had been working 16 or 17 hour shifts consistently, {{and one of them}} gave line clear even though the drawbridge was open. A red warning light was exhibited automatically by the bridge being open, but the train driver was struggling to get his engine working on slippery rails; it was a tank engine running bunker first and the driver consequently had his back to the direction of travel. In addition there was <b>smoke</b> <b>haze</b> from copper smelting works, limiting visibility. He and his fireman lost their lives by drowning in the accident.|$|E
50|$|The {{documentary}} {{was produced}} {{on a budget}} of $125,000, utilizing eight color lasers, LED lights, <b>smoke</b> and <b>haze</b> machines, video projectors, a surround sound system, donated voice talent, song, animation modeling, and animation drawn by Manick Sorcar. The laser show was preceded by a Sanskrit prayer to the Holy Trio (Paramhansa Ramakrishna, Sarada Devi, and Swami Vivekananda), and ‘Vandana’, based on a composition of Swami Vivekananda in Bengali. The prayer and Vandana were live performances in combination with laser animation and atmospheric effects. In total, combined with the 56 minute laser documentary, the show had a running time of 75 minutes.|$|R
60|$|My brother {{noticed a}} pale grey <b>smoke</b> or <b>haze</b> rising among {{the houses in}} front of them, and veiling the white facade of a terrace beyond the road that {{appeared}} between {{the backs of the}} villas. Mrs. Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky. The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of waggons, and the staccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads.|$|R
50|$|Haze is {{traditionally}} an atmospheric phenomenon in which dust, smoke, and other dry particulates obscure {{the clarity of}} the sky. The World Meteorological Organization manual of codes includes a classification of horizontal obscuration into categories of fog, ice fog, steam fog, mist, <b>haze,</b> <b>smoke,</b> volcanic ash, dust, sand, and snow. Sources for haze particles include farming (ploughing in dry weather), traffic, industry, and wildfires.|$|R
5000|$|However, Pekanbaru {{regularly}} {{suffers from}} haze problems due to forest fires, {{particularly in the}} dry season, since {{there is very little}} rain to put the fires out. Large land concessions are granted to commercial interests and huge areas are under the control of palm oil companies that need to clear the land to plant palm oil and other commercial interests. These fires can be seen by satellite. They are not small fires started by local farmers. Corporate plantation owners use the slash-and-burn method to clear the land.

5|$|The {{smoke and}} {{airborne}} particulates from the fires posed {{a threat to}} local communities on several occasions. Smoke and particulates were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, {{the location of the}} park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels. <b>Smoke</b> and <b>haze</b> made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous. A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas.|$|R
