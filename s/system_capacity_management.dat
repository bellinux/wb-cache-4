40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{research}} into the applicability of intelligent agents in the airline scheduling environment. The methodology employed was to look at intelligent agent research and then, based on this, to build models {{that can be used}} to solve some of the airline scheduling problems. The following was done: · An agent-based model was developed that can assist airline schedulers in the maintenance of a disrupted schedule. The agent model consists of a hybrid approach combining elements of machine learning and expert systems. · A multiagent model was developed that can generate a profitable and flyable schedule. The multiagent model developed extends the traditional control structures of the hierarchical agent organisation to a matrix structure. This new model can be extended to any problem domain that deals with resource allocation and capacity management. To guide the thinking behind this research, a few questions were posed regarding the problem to be solved: Q 1. Can intelligent agents play a role in the airline industry, with specific focus on the scheduling creation and maintenance process? Q 2. What will the design of the agent models be if the scheduling needs of an airline have to be addressed? Q 3. If the models as envisioned in question 2 can be created, what will the practical implications be? At a conceptual level the research produced three results: R 1. No references were found to multiagent technology in the production or maintenance of airline schedules. This theoretical research into agent systems shows that there is applicability in the scheduling environment, with specific reference to schedule maintenance and generation. R 2. An agent model was created that combines declarative knowledge with empirical learning to assist human schedulers in the day-to-day maintenanceof the schedule. Multiple solutions to a scheduling problem are generated by the agent using embedded scheduling rules. The agent then uses the Qlearning algorithm to learn the preferences of the human scheduler. This approach combines the best of expert systems and machine learning. To solve the problem of schedule generation, a multiagent system with a matrix governance model was introduced. Aircraft and airports were modelled as buying and selling agents. The business manager agent that assigns individual aircrafts to specific routes was defined. This was accomplished by matching individual aircraft capacity to origin-destination demand. The agent model was then expanded to show how the inclusion of a resource manager agent can handle <b>system</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>management.</b> This is a matrix governance model, as an aircraft agent is managed by a business manager agent, as well as by a resource manager agent. The initial results from the prototype show that this model can generate profitable and flyable schedules. The multiagent model developed extends the traditional hierarchical agent organisation to that of a matrix structure. The contract net protocol used for typical multiagent coordination was adapted to work in this new control structure. This new model can be extended to any problem domain that deals with resource allocation and capacity management. R 3. A few airlines use expert systems to handle schedule disruptions. By introducing machine learning, a flexibility is achieved that is currently not available. The approach proposed for schedule generation is not guaranteed to provide optimal results like traditional operations research techniques, but it is useful for high-level analysis, long-term planning, new hub or alliance planning and research. It also has potential as a catalyst for integrated planning. Keywords: Multiagent systems, airline schedulingEhlers, E. M., Prof...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to present}} a unified {{approach}} for effective <b>capacity</b> <b>management,</b> with the flexibility to position the organization across differing market-orientations, anywhere from produce-to-stock to purchase-and-produce-to-order. Design/methodology/approach - The unified planning <b>system</b> combines <b>capacity</b> <b>management</b> with the external market through the customer order decoupling point (CODP). The approach starts by determining the CODP, using commonality and effect-cause-effect analysis. The resulting CODP information is then {{used to determine the}} optimal master production schedule (medium-term), as well as the detailed schedule (short-term) at the bottleneck resource, using mathematical programming; to support decisions across different planning horizons in an integrated fashion. Findings - This unified approach was applied to an electronics manufacturing company in the Netherlands. The unified <b>capacity</b> planning <b>system</b> not only reduces the number of capacity problems to be solved by production planners, but also more importantly enhances the organization's capabilities to respond faster and more focused to market changes. Research limitations/implications - Further studies may test the robustness of this planning approach with additional empirical evidence. Practical implications - The structured unified approach provides a comprehensive solution to a complex <b>capacity</b> <b>management</b> problem, in competitive environments where organizations {{have to be able to}} respond to dynamically changing market conditions, given the process choices within which they are operating.

40|$|An {{assembler}} needs sets of components, each {{produced by}} a different supplier. To produce the components and assemble the final product, the firms involved need to construct their individual production capacities before observing the actual demand. The firms have an incentive scheme (contract) to induce a "proper" capacity build-up. The key parameters of the contract are the set of transfer prices the assembler pays each supplier for a unit of its component. We consider two game settings {{as to how the}} terms of the contract are determined. The first is one where the assembler sets the prices, and the second is for the suppliers to simultaneously select the prices each wants to charge for its component. We first characterize the optimal capacity decision when the system is centralized, and then derive the decentralized equilibrium capacities under each of the two game settings. We show that the decentralized channel performances depend heavily on system structure/parameters. In particular, under the first setting, the performance improves as the assembler's share of the systemwide capacity cost increases and it is not affected by the number of suppliers in the system, while under the second setting, the performance degrades both in the assembler's share of capacity cost and in the number of suppliers. We show that the first setting dominates the second in terms of system performance if and only if the assembler's share of capacity cost is larger than the reciprocal of the number of firms involved.

40|$|Customer {{service has}} assumed {{strategic}} importance in most manufacturing environments. Corporate reputations often {{depend on how}} reliably promised lead times are met. A goal of filling orders within a service window of T time units is often encountered in practice. This goal ignores the differences among types of units, treating all customers as equally important. Keeping finished goods inventory of all items is only one, and often not the best, way to achieve this objective. High-demand items naturally have safety stock assigned to them, but in many organizations {{there are so many}} very-low-demand items that keeping any stock in these items is prohibitively expensive. Customer service can be maintained for these low-demand items by giving them higher production priority when a demand occurs. In this paper, stochastic analysis and simulation are employed to test the merit of this idea.

40|$|<b>Capacity</b> <b>management</b> is a core {{activity}} when designing and operating distributed software systems. It comprises the provisioning of data center {{resources and the}} deployment of software components to these resources. The goal is to continuously provide adequate capacity, i. e., service level agreements should be satisfied while keeping investment and operating costs reasonably low. Traditional <b>capacity</b> <b>management</b> strategies are rather static and pessimistic: resources are provisioned for anticipated peak workload levels. Particularly, enterprise application systems are exposed to highly varying workloads, leading to unnecessarily high {{total cost of ownership}} due to poor resource usage efficiency caused by the aforementioned static <b>capacity</b> <b>management</b> approach. During the past years, technologies emerged that enable dynamic data center infrastructures, e. g., leveraged by cloud computing products. These technologies build the foundation for elastic online <b>capacity</b> <b>management,</b> i. e., adapting the provided capacity to workload demands based on a short-term horizon. Because manual online <b>capacity</b> <b>management</b> is not an option, automatic control approaches have been proposed. However, most of these approaches focus on coarse-grained adaptation actions and adaptation decisions are based on aggregated system-level measures. Architectural information about the controlled software system is rarely considered. This thesis introduces a model-driven online <b>capacity</b> <b>management</b> approach for distributed component-based software systems, called SLAstic. The core contributions of this approach are a) modeling languages to capture relevant architectural information about a controlled software system, b) an architecture-based online <b>capacity</b> <b>management</b> framework based on the common MAPE-K control loop architecture, c) model-driven techniques supporting the automation of the approach, d) architectural runtime reconfiguration operations for controlling a <b>system’s</b> <b>capacity,</b> e) as well as an integration of the Palladio Component Model.
