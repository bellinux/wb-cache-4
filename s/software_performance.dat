25|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to advance methods of {{improvisation}} and active listening, proposing live audio soundscapes that mesh canine sounds with electroacoustic practice. In {{the process of developing}} this performance, a custom built theremin, that incorporates a rug as an interface, was created to allow Tom to use scratch and digging gestures to create sound, accompanied by a diverse range of vocalization. These studio performances are audio recorded for use later in the live performance where they are remixed into a new experimental improvisational soundscape. Andreyev accompanies Tom's vocals and rhythms with her own live theremin and <b>software</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} model, the job demands-resources (JD-R) model, {{grew out}} of the DCS model. In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains {{more or less the same}} as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen job demands, or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, <b>software,</b> <b>performance</b> feedback from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Developers need to {{evaluate}} <b>software’s</b> <b>performance</b> to make <b>software</b> efficient. This paper suggests a performance evaluation system for embedded software. The suggested system consists of code analyzer, testing agents, data analyzer, and report viewer. The code analyzer inserts additional code dependent on target system into source code and compiles the source code. The testing agents execute performance test. The data analyzer translates raw-level results data to class-level APIs for reporting viewer. The report viewer offers users graphical report views {{by using the}} APIs. We hope that the suggested tool will be useful for embedded-related software development, because developers can easily and intuitively analyze <b>software’s</b> <b>performance</b> and resource utilization...|$|R
