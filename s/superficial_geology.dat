Focusing on three UK river catchments with contrasting bedrock and <b>superficial</b> <b>geologies,</b> N 2 O and nitrate (NO 3 -) concentrations were analyzed in 651 river water samples collected from 2011 to 2013. Unconfined Cretaceous Chalk bedrock regions yielded the highest median N 2 O-N concentration (3. 0 μg L- 1), EF 5 r (0. 00036) and N 2 O-N flux (10. 8 kg ha- 1 a- 1). Conversely, regions of bedrock confined by glacial deposits yielded significantly lower median N 2 O-N concentration (0. 8 μg L- 1), EF 5 r (0. 00016) and N 2 O-N flux (2. 6 kg ha- 1 a- 1), regardless of bedrock type. Bedrock permeability is an important control in regions where groundwater is unconfined, with a high N 2 O yield from high permeability Chalk contrasting with significantly lower median N 2 O-N concentration (0. 7 μg L- 1), EF 5 r (0. 00020) and N 2 O-N flux (2. 0 kg ha- 1 a- 1) on lower permeability unconfined Jurassic mudstone.

Many current groundwater vulnerability maps, and the geological maps on which they are based, do not adequately account for regional and vertical variations in the characteristics of superficial deposits.

40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} scale-dependency of {{relationships}} between novel geodiversity measures and 26 both native and alien vascular plant species richness. Location: Great Britain Time period: Data collected 1995 - 2015 Major taxa: Vascular plants Methods: We calculated terrestrial native and alien vascular plant species richness (6, 932 species in total) across the island of Great Britain at 1 km 2 (N= 219, 964) and 100 km 2 (N= 2, 121) grain sizes and regional extents 25 - 250 km in diameter, centred around each 100 km 2 cell. We compiled geodiversity data on landforms, soils, hydrological and geological features using existing national datasets, and used a newly developed geomorphometric method to extract landform coverage data (e. g. hollows, ridges, valleys, peaks). We used these as predictors of species richness, alongside climate, commonly used topographic metrics, land-cover variety and human population. We analysed species richness across scales using boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling and compared models with and without geodiversity data. Results: Geodiversity significantly improved models over and above widely used topographic metrics, particularly at smaller extents and the finer grain size, and slightly more so for native species richness. For each increase in extent, the contribution of climatic variables increased and that of geodiversity decreased. Of the geodiversity variables, automatically extracted landform data added the most explanatory power, but hydrology (rivers, lakes) and materials (soil, <b>superficial</b> deposits, <b>geology)</b> were also important. Main conclusions Geodiversity improves our understanding of, and ability to model, the relationship between species richness and abiotic heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales by allowing us {{to get closer to}} the real-world physical processes that affect patterns of life. Greatest benefit comes from measuring the constituent parts of geodiversity separately, rather than one combined variable (as for most of the few studies to date).

The Quaternary succession in the area is dominated by glacigenic sediments, comprising till (gravelly clay), glaciofluvial deposits (gravels and sands) and lesser amounts of glaciolacustrine clays and silts. The tills and glaciofluvial deposits are intercalated in some areas, with intervals of sand and gravel within the till modelled as lenses. The superficial deposits vary laterally and vertically across short distances, making extrapolation difficult in areas where borehole data are absent. Holocene sediments, comprising tidal flat deposits, peat and alluvium occupy {{the northern part of the}} study area forms a tract through the middle {{of the area}}. The northern part of the model covers the southern bank of the Mersey estuary where tidal flat deposits, dominated by silt and clay, are mapped/modelled with till underneath. A laterally persistent peat layer within the tidal flat deposits is modelled where proven in boreholes. The River Gowy runs south-north through the middle of the model area to join the Mersey at Stanlow Point. An arbitrary mapped line separates alluvium associated with the River Gowy from the Mersey estuary tidal flat deposits, with which they are transitional. A large area of peat is mapped/modelled at surface in a marshy area in the River Gowy floodplain. Boreholes prove that much of this peat is underlain by alluvium.

This work addresses this research gap through a detailed investigation of permeability on a hillslope in the Eddleston Catchment, Scottish Borders UK, {{to evaluate the}} impact of land cover, <b>superficial</b> <b>geology</b> and soil types on permeability using measurements of field saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) supported by detailed topsoil profile descriptions and counting of roots with diameters > 2 mm. Kfs was measured at depth 0. 04 – 0. 15 m using a constant head well permeameter across four paired landcover sites of adjacent tree and intensely grazed grassland. The measured tree types were: 500 -year-old mixed woodland; 180 -year-old mixed woodland; 45 -year-old Pinus sylvestris plantation; and 180 -year-old Salix caprea woodland. The respective paired grids of trees and grassland were compared on similar soil texture and topography. This study highlights the significant impact of broadleaf woodland at a hillslope scale on Kfs in comparison to grassland areas: median Kfs values under 180 -year-old S. caprea woodland (8 mm h− 1), 180 -year-old mixed woodland (119 mm h− 1) and 500 -year-old broadleaf woodland (174 mm h− 1) {{were found to be}} respectively 8, 6 and 5 times higher than neighbouring grazed grassland areas on the same <b>superficial</b> <b>geology.</b> Further statistical analysis indicates that such Kfs enhancement is associated with the presence of coarse roots (> 2 mm diameter) creating conduits for preferential flow and a deeper organic layer in the topsoil profile under woodlands. By contrast the P. sylvestris forest had only slightly higher (42 mm h− 1), but not statistically different Kfs values, when compared to adjacent pasture (35 mm h− 1). In the grassland areas, in the absence of course roots, the <b>superficial</b> <b>geology</b> was dominant in accounting for differences in Kfs, with the alluvium floodplain having a significantly lower median Kfs (1 mm h− 1) than surrounding hillslope sites, which had a range of median Kfs from 21 to 39 mm h− 1. ...|$|E

To assist in the planning of earthing installations a geographic information system (GIS) layer has been created. In its simplest form it consists of a colour coded map that indicates the most likely earthing installation: a single vertically driven rod (indicated by dark green); multiple vertically driven rods (indicated by light green); a horizontal trench, where a rod installation is unlikely (indicated by yellow); for difficult ground, a specialist installation (i. e. drilling; indicated by red).

40|$|Government-led {{regeneration}} {{schemes and}} policies encouraging {{the use of}} brownfield land present a challenge, particularly in coalfield areas. Coalfields have typically experienced multiple phases of development and can be susceptible to a suite of problematic ground conditions that may be rooted in the near-surface geology or result from anthropogenic activity. Such problems, related {{to the nature of}} void backfill, undermined and unstable ground and the presence of contaminated land in the near-surface, may deter investment in the very areas earmarked for redevelopment. An understanding of previous developments within coalfields is required to identify potential geological hazards, so that regeneration proposals include measures that address these issues. Public records of landfill and site investigations, and minerals exploration including opencast mine plans can reveal the distribution, thickness and high-level descriptions of fill materials, although the coverage of data typically precludes a comprehensive analysis of entire cities. The best way to show the spatial distribution of fill materials is currently as a two dimensional national/regional scale dataset. Depending on the distribution of data points, however, 3 D modelling can be possible, which is much more detailed and accurate.

The work involved the acquisition of geophysical field data alongside traditional site investigation techniques to aid in 3 D geological modelling of the shallow sub-surface. The first part of the report introduces the various geophysical techniques applied during site investigations, followed by a best practice guide to georeferencing geophysical data. It then goes on to describe how this data can be used in support of model development in GSI 3 D (Geological Surveying and Investigation in 3 D). This report can be consulted as a guide to how near-surface geophysics can be used as an aid to building site-scale soil-geology models using GSI 3 D, and suggests that work of this kind should be carried out using an integrated approach utilising appropriate geophysical techniques alongside standard geotechnical practices. Geophysical techniques have demonstrated that Sand and Gravel (SAGR) deposits at Shelford are laterally variable in terms of their distribution and morphology, and a 3 m drop in-filled with SAGR has been mapped in 3 D along with siltstone beds along the valley slopes. Depth to the base of peat was identified using ground-truthed geophysical data at Talla Linnfoots, and demonstrates that the distribution and thickness of peat vary across the site. Information regarding the location of in-filled channels in the underlying glacial deposits has been used to add resolution to the 3 D model and to suggest targets for further investigation.

40|$|International audienceStudies of {{soil and}} subsoil, also called regolith, are at the {{crossroads}} of scientific new challenging questions as well as new environmental needs. Historically, geological maps were focussed on solid geology. Present societal needs increasingly require knowledge of regolith properties: <b>superficial</b> studies combining <b>geology,</b> geochemistry and geophysics become essential to better understand the natural processes which govern the repartition and evolution of subsoil formations. Such progress is critical to better orient the use and management of natural and groundwater resources. Among other techniques, airborne geophysics is appropriate to provide information on near surface, because of i) its high spatial coverage ii) the rapidity of acquisition and iii) the variety of available sensors (magnetic, spectral radiometry, electromagnetic...). We illustrate the results of an airborne geophysical survey carried out in France, in “Région Centre” administrative region {{in the southern part of}} the Paris Basin. Spectral radiometry data were collected throughout “Région Centre” with a line spacing of 1 km. This method provides maps of potassium (K), uranium (U) and thorium (Th) which are the only naturally occurring elements with direct or indirect radioisotopes that produce gamma rays of sufficient intensity to be measured at airborne survey heights. Gamma-rays emitted from the Earth surface are related to the primary mineralogy and geochemistry of the bedrock and/or the nature of secondary weathering including regolith materials. Obtained images are confronted with former geological investigations (1 : 50 000 e geological maps). Geophysical data and geological maps are generally consistent on most of the covered area since the first-rate information delivered by the spectrometry derives from the geochemistry of the solid geology. Second-rate gamma-ray responses come from superimposed allochtonous deposits as well as in situ geochemical modifications. For instance, spectrometric data in the southern part of the region reveal a wide K-depleted area which is absolutely unexpected from the existing geological maps. Careful analysis of the available geological descriptions reveals that this geochemical signature is linked to the weathering, erosion and transport of specific source rock materials. In this context, K-depleted alluviums derive from clay with flint, (weathering product of the upper cretaceous chalk), whereas K-enriched alluviums are drainage products of the Loire River which were eroded in the Massif Central crystalline basement. In conclusion, spectrometric data allows the discrimination and cartography of new geochemical signatures. This new form of visualisation of the geology provides the opportunity to enrich our perception of the regolith and will necessitate an update of our methods of cartography. As briefly developed in this paper, outcomes are expected both for human environmental applications (better understanding of the centre France alluvial system dynamics) and for scientific geological understanding (basin geodynamic) ...|$|R
40|$|The World Heritage site of “Cinque Terre, Portovenere and the Islands” is {{probably}} one of the best-known examples of protected landscapes. Due to its horography and the absence of roads, the site remained relatively inaccessible until the opening of the railway in the 19 th century; a conservation policy, which began before the Second World War, has managed to save it from drastic transformations in the 20 th century. Nevertheless, even this landscape is not free from risk as shown by the recent floods which has hit two villages and caused landslides in the adjoining terraced landscape, made vulnerable by abandon and neglect in the upper hillsides. Furthermore, the substantial reduction of agricultural activity has been accompanied by the exploitation of its enviable position as a world-known tourist attraction. To fulfil renewed requests for amenities and functionality, minor but widespread modifications to traditional buildings have influenced the change in the coastal landscape along the last ten years, with the risk of irreparably encroaching on that edified heritage which is an intrinsic component of the whole terraced landscape. The proposed paper deals with the results of a recent research commissioned by the Regional Directorate of Liguria for Cultural and Landscape Heritage to the Universities of Genoa and Pavia. The research focuses on the formulation of criteria to set up Guidelines for eco-efficiency in traditional rural buildings and for the installation of renewable energy source applications (mainly intended for domestic or agricultural use) and faces a real new challenge for such a kind of site. Two factors have guided the development of the research. On the one hand, a continuous passage of scale, from the territorial one to constructive detail. On the other hand, the constant dialogue between specialists within a trans-disciplinary team has been fundamental. The results of theoretical models of calculation of behaviour and of energy requirements (applied by experts in Building Physics) have been confronted with the evaluation of actual state of conservation of the buildings, comparing it with the conditions of weather and sun exposure, with the relative climatology data and <b>superficial</b> and profound <b>geology,</b> and with the reasons for preservation and protection to discern the possible adoptable solutions. Hence, the Guidelines considerations converge on: -	environmental resources; -	interpretation of the landscape as a system, of revealing visual relations, of views and of panoramic places; -	energy need of buildings, outcome of the analysis on thermal characteristics of the sample buildings; -	framework of the interventions of environmental and building refurbishment and panorama of the compatible technical solutions (isolation and installation systems for production of hot water also produced by solar energy, for heating/cooling by geothermal, hydrothermal, biomass, heated pumps, for the production of electricity and for the recycling of rain water); -	criteria of compatibility and impact of various technologies: the visual impact, most of all for solar and wind powered devices (due to the chromatic feature of the solar cells, their shape, the reflection from the surface), the impact on the eco-system and on the territory (considering the consumption of environmental resources and the modifications caused by new interventions) ...|$|R

Some {{of the differences between the}} approaches are considered, and their influence on the resulting risk assessment are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Maule 2010, Chile, and the Tohoku-Oki 2011, Japan, {{earthquakes}} have reconfirmed that <b>superficial</b> <b>geology</b> {{is critical}} in the seismic intensity, and for predicting the occurrence of soil liquefaction, {{one of the most}} damaging seismic effects. From 1998 to 2012 multihazard maps, land-use plans for reducing risk, and disaster mitigation project profiles were developed for 175 Peruvian cities by Peru's Civil Defense (INDECI) and UNDP. During the Ica, Peru, 2007, earthquake, the actual damage distribution in Pisco, Tambo de Mora and other cities, agreed very well with the multihazard map developed six years before, showing how useful those maps are Kuroiwa and Delgado (2012). In 2013 the author proposal to Peruvian Engineers Association (CIP) and INDECI to complete the SCP, so that in 2021, the year of Peru's Bicentennial of its Independence, most of the 175 cities may have their SCP implemented...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the GSI 3 D {{model of the}} <b>superficial</b> <b>geology</b> of the ground seaward of the Drigg Low Level Waste Repository site, West Cumbria.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the geology of the Newbury district {{and the southern}} part of the Abingdon district, including most of the Berkshire Downs and adjacent portions of the valleys of the River Kennet and its tributaries. Together with a printed geological map of the Newbury district at 1 : 50 000 scale, it was produced as part of the BGS Regional Mapping Programme. A geological map at 1 : 50 000 scale covering the catchments of the River Pang and the River Lambourn, together with adjacent portions of the Chalk escarpment to the north, is also available from BGS as a print-on-demand product. This was produced as part of the infrastructural information provided for the LOCAR (Lowland Catchment Research) Project, under the NERC Thematic Programme. The introduction {{describes the}} topographical and geological setting of the area. Subsequent chapters describe the bedrock (or ‘solid’) <b>geology,</b> the <b>superficial</b> (or ‘drift’) <b>geology</b> and the geological structure. They are followed by a section on Applied Geology. The final section, Information Sources, lists all the BGS publications relevant to the district and gives information on how to gain access to BGS collections and databases, including borehole records and geophysical, geochemical and geotechnical data. Most of the area is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous Chalk Group, which forms the downlands (Cover picture). The Lower Cretaceous Upper Greensand and Gault, and a small area of the Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay, occur in the north. The Upper Greensand Formation also appears from beneath the Chalk to form inliers in the south-west of the district, in the core of anticlinal folds aligned with the Vale of Pewsey. At depth, the area is partly underlain by a thin discontinuous Lower Greensand sequence, attenuated Jurassic and Triassic successions, Westphalian-aged deposits of the Berkshire Coal Basin, and thin Tournaisian/Visean and thick Devonian strata resting on Lower Palaeozoic basement. Overlying the Chalk, {{the southern part of}} the district includes the western end of the Palaeogene (Tertiary) outcrops of the synclinal London Basin. The Palaeogene succession extends from the Lambeth Group (mostly made up of clays and sands of the Reading Formation, with a thin basal Upnor Formation) up into the London Clay Formation (Thames Group), which in this district includes relatively thick beds of sand and some pebble gravels within the usual clays. The bedrock formations are commonly obscured by superficial deposits of Quaternary age. These include river terrace deposits at nine identified levels (including the ‘plateau gravels’ of previous terminology); alluvial deposits, peat and tufa forming the modern river flood plains; clay-with-flints and sand forming a residual cover over the higher parts of the downs; and head (solifluction deposits) on slopes and valley floors in most parts of the district. Areas of worked ground, made ground, infilled ground and landscaped ground have also been delineated. Landslides occur locally on the Palaeogene formations around Newbury. Other potential geological hazards in the area include cambering and valley bulge, ground heave, subsidence, flooding and radon emission. The possibility of risk from these factors should be taken into consideration in any construction or land development project. The most important natural mineral resources in the area are water and aggregates (sand and gravel). In the past, clay, chalk, flint and peat were exploited on a small scale.

40|$|ANOVA {{is used to}} {{show that}} {{approximately}} 25 % of the total variation of indoor radon concentrations in England and Wales {{can be explained by}} the mapped bedrock and <b>superficial</b> <b>geology.</b> The proportion of the total variation explained by geology is higher (up to 37 %) in areas where there is strong contrast between the radon potential of sedimentary geological units and lower (14 %) where the influence of confounding geological controls, such as uranium mineralisation, cut across mapped geological boundaries. When indoor radon measurements are grouped by geology and 1 -km squares of the national grid, the cumulative percentage of the variation between and within mapped geological units is shown to be 34 – 40 %. The proportion of the variation that can be attributed to mapped geological units increases with the level of detail of the digital geological data. This study confirms the importance of radon maps that show the variation of indoor radon concentrations both between and within mapped geological boundarie...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{and provides}} an initial {{interpretation of the}} bedrock and <b>superficial</b> <b>geology</b> of 1 : 10, 000 Geological Sheet SS 91 SE Tiverton (Devon). The geology of the area consists of Carboniferous sandstones and mudstones, which belong to the Bude Formation (Culm), in-turn these are unconformably overlain by Permian sandstone and breccias. The sandstone, typically a fine-grained sandstone or sandy mudstone, is informally called the ‘Tidcombe Sands’, whilst two breccias can be recognised and distinguished {{on the basis of}} clast morphology and lithology – the Chevithorne Breccia and Cadbury Breccia. Previous studies suggest that the ‘Tidcombe Sands’ and Chevithorne Breccia intercalate to the north of Tiverton, whilst present mapping to the south of the town reveals that the sands are also inter-digitated with the southern Cadbury Breccia, and the latter is derived from the southwest. Resting unconformably upon the Permian strata are thick accumulations of Palaeogene and Quaternary deposits. These include terrace deposits and alluvium associated with the rivers that drain the sheet, and a significant distribution of blanket head, regolith and colluvium...|$|E
