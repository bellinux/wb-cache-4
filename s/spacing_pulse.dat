40|$|Cell {{patterning}} commonly employs photolithographic {{methods for}} the micro fabrication of structures on silicon chips. These require expensive photo-mask development and complex photolithographic processing. Laser based patterning of cells {{has been studied}} in vitro and laser ablation of polymers is an active area of research promising high aspect ratios. This paper disseminates how 800 nm femtosecond infrared (IR) laser radiation can be successfully used to perform laser ablative micromachining of parylene-C on SiO 2 substrates for the patterning of human hNT astrocytes (derived from the human teratocarcinoma cell line (hNT)) whilst 248 nm nanosecond ultra-violet laser radiation produces photo-oxidization of the parylene-C and destroys cell patterning. In this work, we report the laser ablation methods used and the ablation characteristics of parylene-C for IR pulse fluences. Results follow that support the validity of using IR laser ablative micromachining for patterning human hNT astrocytes cells. We disseminate the variation in yield of patterned hNT astrocytes on parylene-C with laser pulse <b>spacing,</b> <b>pulse</b> number, pulse fluence and parylene-C strip width. The findings demonstrate how laser ablative micromachining of parylene-C on SiO 2 substrates can offer an accessible alternative for rapid prototyping, high yield cell patterning with broad application to multi-electrode arrays, cellular micro-arrays and microfluidics...|$|E
40|$|Waveguides for optical {{radiation}} and nanostructures {{are essential for}} new and future optical technologies. The generation of waveguides with femtosecond laser radiation by moving a focus is exemplarily demonstrated with longitudinaly written volume waveguides and ridge waveguides in thin films. Combining element of both waveguide types are periodic subwavelength structures on the surface (ripples, germ. Riffel, also laser induced periodical surface structures (LIPSS)) and in the volume (nanoplanes). The subwavelength ripples emerging at ablation with ultra short pulsed laser radiation are investigated in-depth in theory and experiments {{as well as their}} influence on the structure precision and their analogy with nanoplanes. The volume waveguides in fused silica (length 9 mm, diameter 1 - 5 µm) are homogeneous and continuous at fluences below ~ 5 kJ/cm³. Homogeneous monomode waveguides with a refractive index change Delta-n up to 2. 8 * 10 ^(- 4) and a damping below 2 dB/cm are demonstrated. The generation of surface ridge waveguides (pulse duration t= 100 fs, wavelenth l= 800 nm and 400 nm, NA 0, 55, width 100 µm in a 1 µm thick thin film of Er:ZBLAN on magnesium fluoride) are demonstrated. Due to ripples the orientation of the polarisation is essential. The achieved smoothness of the edges is 100 - 300 nm at a grove depth up to 1. 8 µm. A damping below 5 dB/cm is demonstrated and the possibility of a damping below 1 dB/cm is indicated. To complement the established models for classical ripples for the explanation of subwavelength ripples at pulse durations below a few nanoseconds some valuations are made such as the influence of longitudinal fields at tight focusing, near field scattering including resulting field enhancements and the significance of surface plasmons. For the first time it is suggested that for the modelling of the ripple spacing the dynamic variation of the dielectric function during the irradiation has to be taken into account. From the surface plasmon model constraints are elaborated for the real and imaginary part of the complex dielectric function of the material during the irradiation, under which ripples develop at domination of polaritons. To understand the initial becoming of the ripples a seed model is suggested, which is evaluated {{on the basis of the}} experimental results. The analogy between subwavelenth ripples on the surface and nanoplanes in the volume are discussed in relation to their phenomenology and a common model to explain their development. The experimental investiagtions of the subwavelenth ripples in this work give a contribution to the phenomenological description and the comprehension of the subwavelength ripples. Investigated variations are: wavelength l= 800 nm, 532 nm, 400 nm and 266 nm, linear und circular polarisation, repition rate between f= 1 kHz und 1 Hz, lateral pulse <b>spacing,</b> <b>pulse</b> energy, the surface morphology before the irradiation and the pulse duration between t= 80 fs and 40 ps. Investigated materials are: gold, copper, Silicon, lithium niobate, zirconium oxide, diamond, fused silica, sapphire, magnesium fluoride, lithium fluoride, ZBLAN, PTFE, human hair. The ripples are orientated perpendicular to the polarisation of the laser radiation and are coherently expanded at moving the focus. For the generation of grids this also is possible in two dimensions. The ripples predominantly evolve from ablation and not from relocation of material. The ripple spacing L depends on the material and the wavelength l. At l= 800 nm it was measured: dielectrics L= 190 to 330 nm (L/l= 0. 24 to 0. 41), metals and semiconductors L= 500 to 600 nm (L/l= 0. 63 to 0. 75). The ripple spacing gets smaller with the wavelength. The ratio L/l for l= 400 nm is bigger for dielectrics and silicon than at l= 800 nm. After five pulses the typical characteristics of ripples are accomplished. A surface structure, e. g. due to a previous pulse or a shallow scratch about perpendicular to the radiation promote the development of ripples. In silicon directly below the ablation threshold a lateral periodic modification of the density is observed. This has a periodicity comparable with the ripple spacing of silicon, indicating that Nanoplanes and subwavelenth ripples probably can be ascribed to the same principles, which is consistent with the suggested seed model. At a focus movement parallel to the polarisation “detached ripples” with their closest neighbour more than two focus diameters away are observed for the first time. Detached ripples can not be explained by the established models, but by the combined subwavelenght/nanoplanes model...|$|E
