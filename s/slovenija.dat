5|$|Because the new Olimpija is {{supported}} {{by most of the}} fans of the previous Olimpija, including their ultras group, the Green Dragons, who have a long-standing rivalry with Maribor's own ultras group Viole Maribor, many see the matches between Maribor and the new club as the continuation of the rivalry and refer to it by the same name. However, there are many fans, either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana, that do not share the same view and do not share similar beliefs, including part of the media such as RTV <b>Slovenija</b> and Večer. The overall statistics of {{the old and the new}} Olimpija are tracked separately by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1. SNL. The first match between Maribor and the new Olimpija took place on 24 October 2007 in a Slovenian cup quarter-final match that was won by Maribor, 3–1. At the time, Olimpija was still competing under the name Olimpija Bežigrad. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club either in the case of matches from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the whole period from 1962 to present day.|$|E

25|$|Norkring {{was awarded}} a ten-year {{concession}} to operate Multiplex B (Mux B) in Slovenia by the Agency for Post and Electronic Communications on 19 December 2008. Radiotelevizija <b>Slovenija</b> (RTV) operated Multiplex A (Mux A). The permit stipulated that Mux A would only be used for RTV's own channels and that commercial operators would have to use Mux B. Because Mux A became operational before Mux B, RTV was permitted to temporarily provide channels in their multiplex. Regular operations with Mux B started on 1 September 2010 and the analog turn-off took place on 1 December. Initially Pink SI was the only channel to switch to Mux B, although TV3 followed in October. Pink SI switched back to Mux A in 2011, which also hosted the commercial channels Pop TV and Kanal A. Norkring issued a criminal complaint to the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, claiming RTV was violating regulatory decisions through hosting commercial channels, arguing that European Union law prohibits commercial channels from being broadcast on national multiplexes. RTV stated that they were obliged to charge the commercial channels {{for the use of}} their multiplex.|$|E
500|$|Slovenian singer Maja Slatinšek {{had entered}} her song, [...] "Time to Rise", {{composed}} by herself and Ziga Pirnat, into {{not only the}} Irish final, but also the Slovenian and Romanian finals as well. Slovenian broadcaster Radiotelevizija <b>Slovenija</b> (RTV SLO) did not choose Slatinšek's song to compete in EMA 2008, the Slovenian final, but RTÉ and the Romanian broadcaster Televiziunea Română (TVR) allowed her to compete in their respective national finals. Slatinšek withdrew from the Romanian final, with her and Pirnat saying that the chance of competing in Ireland was {{higher than that of}} Romania, with the Romanian national final, Selecţia Naţională 2008, containing 24 songs over two semi-finals. The [...] "possibility of being among the Irish finalists, one of the biggest powers in Eurovision, was an offer we could not turn down," [...] said Slatinšek. Slatinšek's performance involved her singing {{for the first half of}} the song with four male dancers coming in later on, and performing artistic moves around her. The end of the performance involved her being raised on a box, with her plain white dress being lowered over it.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1840s, the Slovene {{national}} movement developed far beyond literary expression. In 1848, the first Slovene national political programme, called United Slovenia (...) , {{was written in}} the context of the Spring of Nations movement within the Austrian Empire. It demanded a unification of all Slovene-speaking territories in an autonomous kingdom, named <b>Slovenija,</b> within the empire and an official status for the Slovene language. Although the project failed, it served as an important platform of Slovene political activity in the following decades, particularly in the 1860s and 1870s, when mass Slovene rallies, named tabori, were organised. The conflict between Slovene and German nationalists deepened. In 1866, some Slovenes were left to Italy, and in 1867 some remained in the Hungarian part of the Austria-Hungary. This significantly affected the nation and led to further radicalisation of the Slovene {{national movement}}. In the 1890s, the first Slovene political parties were established. All of them were loyal to Austria, but they were also espousing a common South Slavic cause.|$|E
