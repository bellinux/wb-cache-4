50|$|Cylinder <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> clopen <b>sets.</b> As {{elements}} of the topology, cylinder <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> by definition open sets. The complement of an open <b>set</b> <b>is</b> a closed <b>set,</b> but the complement of a cylinder <b>set</b> <b>is</b> a union of cylinders, and so cylinder <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> also closed, and are thus clopen.

5|$|In early {{editions of}} the setting, The Realms shared a unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With {{the release of the}} 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei If... was {{developed}} as a change from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles, focusing on a small-scale environment and threat rather than a large-scale environment as in previous titles. Upon release, If... received a positive reception from critics and fans, and inspired multiple tie-in print adaptations and a mobile prequel. Its well-received high school <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> {{the impetus for the}} creation of the spin-off Persona series.|$|E
5|$|The Zelda story <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{supposed to}} include technological elements, {{such as a}} time-travelling main character and a Triforce made of electronic circuits.

5|$|The {{work was}} first {{performed}} in Leipzig in 1723. In May that year Bach assumed {{his position as}} Thomaskantor and embarked on an ambitious series of compositions. The Magnificat was sung at vesper services on feast days, and, according to recent research, Bach's <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> written for a performance on 2 July, celebrating the Marian feast of the Visitation. For Christmas the same year, he performed it at the Nikolaikirche with the insertion of four seasonal movements.|$|E
5|$|Ubisoft Montreal, the game's developer, studied player {{feedback}} from the first game to assess what could be improved in Watch Dogs 2 and the <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> researched by making frequent trips to California. Ubisoft Reflections was responsible for overhauling the driving mechanic. Real hackers were consulted to validate scripts and game mechanics for authenticity and references to real life hacktivism were fictionalized, like the Project Chanology protest. The original soundtrack for Watch Dogs 2 was composed by Hudson Mohawke.|$|E

5|$|A {{remake of}} the game, simply titled Ever 17, was {{developed}} for Xbox 360 by 5pb. in collaboration with Cyberfront. It was originally planned to be released on July 28, 2011, but was delayed to December 1, 2011. It was made available in both a standard edition and a limited edition, the latter including a 2-disc soundtrack. The remake was redone from the ground up, and includes new event graphics, re-recorded voices, new routes, and a new ending. It uses 3D models for the conversation scenes; this move from 2D to 3D was made as 3D character models were seen as easier to animate than 2D sprites, {{as they can be}} posed without the need to draw new poses manually. The <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> redesigned, with newly added facilities, and Tsugumi was given redesigned clothes.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, {{gameplay}} is centred around Nights {{flying through the}} dreams of the two children. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fly through rings while gathering enough keys to proceed to the next level. Development of Journey of Dreams began shortly after the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features. The game's <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E
5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E

5|$|Between 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, {{film and}} stage {{productions}} appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It {{has long been}} said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written {{in collaboration with the}} English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} was handled {{by a team of}} seven people over the course of ten months. It was {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. While the original version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> more obvious.|$|E
5|$|Reception for {{individual}} elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed {{sufficient for the}} needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> criticized by ANN and Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen {{just for the sake of}} coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag, both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes.|$|E

5|$|The first-generation iPad {{features}} an Apple A4 SoC, which comprises a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. There are four physical {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, moving the rotation lock function to an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, a <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute. Unlike its successors, the first-generation iPad has no cameras.|$|E
5|$|The game's open world <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> {{modelled}} on Los Angeles {{and other}} areas of Southern California. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled to increase its draw distance render capabilities. Key team members conducted field trips around Southern California to gather research and footage, and Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used to help design the city's road networks. For {{the first time in}} the series, players control three protagonists throughout the single-player mode. The team found the multiple protagonist design an intrinsic change to the gameplay and narrative devices. They refined the shooting and driving mechanics and tightened the narrative's pacing and scope.|$|E
5|$|The {{underground}} {{prison was}} shot in real caves left by mining at Griffith Park, in the Bronson Canyon, previously used as the Batcave and in the 1930s Flash Gordon serial. Shots of {{the interior of the}} mine were captured at night so it appeared like the <b>setting</b> <b>was</b> underground. Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for lights in mine shafts, illumination had to come from practical lights that appeared {{to be part of the}} set. The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by pasting fake rocks to a canvas being cranked in the background of the scene. While Zimmerman believed Shatner would hate the fight between Kirk and his doppelgänger, the actor enjoyed the theatrical sequence, and contributed to the choreography with his knowledge of judo and karate.|$|E
