5|$|In 1848, King Christian VIII of Denmark {{died and}} his only son, Frederick ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, {{had been through}} two {{unsuccessful}} marriages, and {{was assumed to be}} infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and the <b>succession</b> <b>rules</b> of each territory differed. In Holstein, the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the great powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.|$|E

2500|$|On {{government}} instructions, the Northfield Committee {{began to}} review the country's agricultural system in 1977. [...] It did not report until July 1979, by which time Margaret Thatcher's administration held power. [...] The report influenced ongoing discussions between the NFU and the Country Landowners Association (CLA), {{who were trying to}} reach an agreement on new Agricultural Holdings legislation that could be presented to Parliament as having industry-wide support. [...] This was agreed in 1984, but the two sides {{had not been able to}} agree a fundamental change to the security of tenure legislation. [...] It did change the <b>succession</b> <b>rules</b> for existing tenancies such that a farmer might pass on his tenancy on retirement as well as on death—but no new tenancies from 1984 were to include succession rights.|$|E

By means of the theory of Riordan arrays, we solve the enumeration problem and we give a particular <b>succession</b> <b>rule,</b> called jumping and marked <b>succession</b> <b>rule,</b> which describes the growth of such words according to their number of ones. Moreover, the problem of associating a word to a path in the generating tree obtained by the <b>succession</b> <b>rule</b> is solved by introducing an algorithm which constructs all binary words and then kills those containing the forbidden pattern.

2500|$|When a non-Muslim boy was {{recruited}} under the devşirme system, he would first {{be sent to}} selected Turkish families in the provinces to learn Turkish, the rules of Islam (i.e. to be converted to Islam) and the customs and cultures of Ottoman society. After completing this period, acemi (new recruit) boys were gathered for training at the Enderun [...] "acemi oğlan" [...] school in the capital city. There, young cadets would be selected for their talents in different areas to train as engineers, artisans, riflemen, clerics, archers, artillery, and so forth. Janissaries trained under strict discipline with hard labour and in practically monastic conditions in acemi oğlan ("rookie" [...] or [...] "cadet") schools, where {{they were expected to}} remain celibate. Unlike other Muslims, they were expressly forbidden to wear beards, only a moustache. These rules were obeyed by Janissaries, at least until the 18th century when they also began to engage in other crafts and trades, breaking another of the original rules. In the late 16th century a sultan gave in to the pressures of the Janissary Corps and permitted Janissary children to become members of the Corps, a practice strictly forbidden for 300 years. They also became rent-seeking and set goals to protect their special rights and advantages. Consequently, <b>succession</b> <b>rules,</b> formerly strict, became open to interpretation. They gained their own power but kept the system from changing in other progressive ways.|$|E
2500|$|While it {{is clear}} that under the Twelfth Amendment the {{original}} constitutional qualifications of age, citizenship, and residency apply to both the President and Vice President, it is unclear whether a two-term president could later serve as Vice President. Some argue that the Twenty-second Amendment and Twelfth Amendment bar any two-term president from later serving as Vice President as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the United States presidential line of succession. Others contend that the Twelfth Amendment concerns qualification for service, while the Twenty-second Amendment concerns qualifications for election, and thus a former two-term president is still eligible to serve as vice president. The practical applicability of this distinction has not been tested, as no former president has ever sought the vice presidency, although in 1980, former president Gerald Ford was mentioned as a possible running mate for Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan and there were some [...] negotiations between the two camps. Nothing ever became of the idea, and had Ford been selected, he would have still been eligible for election as President, as he had only served less than one full term in finishing out Richard Nixon's second term. During Hillary Clinton's 2016 candidacy, she jokingly said that she had considered naming Bill Clinton as her Vice President, but had been advised it would be unconstitutional. Others contend that a [...] "termed out" [...] President would be eligible to ascend to the Presidency via Presidential <b>succession</b> <b>rules</b> given the text's explicit reference to election.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a general method for the random {{generation}} of some classes of combinatorial objects. Our basic idea is to translate ECO method (Enumerating Combinatorial Objects) from a method for the enumeration of combinatorial objects into a random generation method. The algorithms we illustrate {{are based on the}} concepts of <b>succession</b> <b>rule</b> and generating tree: the former is a law that predicts the combinatorial object class growth according to a given parameter. The generating tree related to a given <b>succession</b> <b>rule</b> is a particular labelled plane tree that represents the rule in an extensive way. Each node of a generating tree can also be seen as a particular combinatorial object and so a random path in the generating tree coincides with the random generation of that combinatorial object. The generation is uniform if we take the probability of each branch to be selected into account when the path is generated. We also give the formulae evaluating complexity. Finally, we take the class of m-ary trees into consideration in order to illustrate our general method. In this case, the average time complexity of the generating algorithm can be estimated as O(mn) ...|$|R
