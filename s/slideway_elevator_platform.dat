50|$|Escalators from Memorial Drive go {{down two}} levels to the mezzanine, where {{customers}} may purchase tickets at vending machines and {{pass through the}} faregates. Escalators {{on the other side}} of the faregates then go up to the <b>platforms.</b> <b>Elevators</b> go directly to the platforms with one two-way faregate for each <b>elevator</b> at <b>platform</b> level.|$|R
40|$|Apparatus for {{transferring}} and manipulating {{a plurality}} of containers in a sequence is disclosed including a mechanical manipulator arm having a gripping device which automatically picks up a container at a fixed pickup position P and transfers it to a processing station. At a processing station X, the container is loaded with silicon wafers and thereafter returned by the arm to the fixed position P at the pickup and return station Y. A plurality of the containers may be processed in sequence from the fixed pickup position by providing a movable carriage upon which container pedestal platforms are supported, {{at least one of}} which is an <b>elevator</b> <b>platform.</b> The platforms include abutments for properly positioning the containers for accurate pickup by the manipulator arm...|$|R
5000|$|Stereolithography {{requires}} {{the use of}} supporting structures which attach to the <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> to prevent deflection due to gravity and to hold cross sections in place in order to resist lateral pressure from the resin-filled blade or retain newly created sections during the [...] "vat rocking" [...] of bottom-up printing. Supports are created automatically during the preparation of 3D Computer Aided Design models and can also be made manually. With more expensive stereolithography models, these supports must be removed from the finished product manually.|$|R
50|$|In models {{featuring}} {{an elevator}} apparatus, an <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> descends a distance {{equal to the}} thickness of a single layer of the design (typically 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm) into the photopolymer vat. Then, a resin-filled blade sweeps across {{a cross section of}} the layer, re-coating it with fresh material. The subsequent layer is traced, joining the previous layer. A complete 3D object can be formed using this process. Designs are then immersed in a chemical bath in order to remove any excess resin and cured in an ultraviolet oven.|$|R
50|$|The player {{character}} is not given a name throughout the game. The game cursor identifies him only as 'hero'. He {{is standing on}} an electric <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> attached to {{the exterior of the}} building when 'Ed the boss' opens a window to reprimand him for slacking by banging his fist against the window ledge and shouting. The player then can enter the building and, while playing a prank on Ed, he discovers a secret passage leading to a machine room. There he acquires some documents in an alien language which he keeps in the inventory.|$|R
5000|$|BMW Welt {{operations}} are coordinated {{with the other}} local BMW facilities, the BMW Museum and BMW Headquarters. It has a showroom with the current model lineup of BMW cars and motorcycles, {{and the other two}} BMW Group brands, Mini and Rolls-Royce. Customers picking up special ordered cars are given a dramatic [...] "staged experience" [...] in which they await their new car in an enormous glass-walled hall, and their cars are lifted up from lower levels on round <b>elevator</b> <b>platforms.</b> BMW Welt also has shops selling BMW-branded promotional merchandise and accessories, and a restaurant.|$|R
50|$|There are <b>elevators</b> {{between both}} <b>platforms</b> and the ticket gates.|$|R
50|$|On Platform 1 for Yagoto, Akaike and Toyotashi (Toyota City), door 8 is {{closest to}} the <b>elevator,</b> and <b>Platform</b> 2 for Fushimi and Kamiotai, door 12 {{is closest to}} the elevator.|$|R
50|$|There is an <b>elevator</b> {{between the}} <b>platform</b> and {{ground-level}} {{at the western}} entrance.|$|R
25|$|This uses {{low-voltage}} {{electricity to}} transmit {{the action of}} the organ keys to the pipes. Earlier church instruments used a mechanical linkage of rods and wires to connect the keys to the pipes. With the new system, the console (also known as a key-desk) could be placed at virtually any distance from the organ's pipes and could be somewhat portable, as just an electrical cable and flexible wind line connected the console with other parts of the instrument. This also allowed the console to achieve its ubiquitous place—on an <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> in front of the stage, low in the orchestra pit for accompanying the film, and rising majestically to stage height for organ solos.|$|R
50|$|New {{pedestrian}} tunnels, <b>elevators,</b> {{and accessible}} <b>platforms,</b> were completed in 2016 {{in accordance with}} the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act..|$|R
50|$|This two-level, {{elevated}} station features two side platforms, two exits, and a <b>platform</b> <b>elevator</b> {{located on}} the north side of the concourse level.|$|R
50|$|This three-level, {{elevated}} station features two side platforms, two exits, and <b>platform</b> <b>elevators</b> {{located on}} {{the east and west}} sides of the concourse level.|$|R
2500|$|Stairs, escalators, and an <b>elevator</b> {{along the}} <b>platform</b> lead to various mezzanines. There are [...] "TS" [...] tile mosaics along the station walls. An office {{is located at}} the north (compass east) end of the <b>platform.</b> An <b>elevator</b> was {{recently}} installed and connects with the Downtown IRT Seventh Avenue platform and then the mezzanine. The <b>elevators</b> make this <b>platform,</b> along with the platform at Grand Central accessible to wheelchair passengers (unlike the shuttle platforms, which are not accessible to wheelchairs).|$|R
2500|$|Cinematic platformers are a {{small but}} {{distinct}} subgenre of platform games, usually distinguished by their relative realism compared to traditional platformers. [...] These games focus on fluid, lifelike movements, without the unnatural physics found in nearly all other platform games. To achieve this realism, many cinematic platformers, beginning with Prince of Persia, have employed rotoscoping techniques to animate their characters based on video footage of live actors performing the same stunts. Jumping abilities are typically roughly {{within the confines of}} an athletic human's capacity. To expand vertical exploration, many cinematic platformers feature the ability to grab onto ledges, or make extensive use of <b>elevator</b> <b>platforms.</b> Other distinguishing characteristics include step-based control, in which an action is performed after the character completes his current animation, rather than the instant the button is pressed, and multi-screen stages that do not scroll.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the player}}'s performance, the player {{may be asked}} to {{participate}} in this chapter where the behind-the-scenes plot is revealed. First the mysterious ninja Gale challenges the three in a duel inside the hangar, then it continues with the three fighting Joe Fang clones throughout an <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> leading to the real body of Joe Fang, in which much of the game's plot becomes revealed. Joe Fang then started to mutate into his monstrous, demon-like form known as [...] "Dino Fang" [...] by using the dinosaur genes combined with his human DNA and the Virtua Cops faced him in the final battle once again. Ultimately, they defeated Dino Fang and ECM's main facility self-destructs as the Virtua Cops narrowly escapes from the explosion. Thus, the case is closed and ECM's plot is recorded on VCPD's file.|$|R
50|$|There is an ADA-accessible <b>elevator</b> from <b>platform</b> {{level to}} the {{mezzanine}} at the platform's extreme south end, connecting to the mezzanine, which has elevators {{to the rest of}} the station via the IND Eighth Avenue Line platform. The Marine Grill Murals, salvaged from the restaurant of the same name in the Hotel McAlpin, reside near these elevators.|$|R
50|$|All {{stations}} on the Orange Line are handicapped accessible. These {{stations are}} equipped with high-level platforms for easy boarding, as well as <b>elevators</b> for easy <b>platform</b> access.|$|R
50|$|The Green Line {{platforms}} {{are served}} by five <b>elevators,</b> making the <b>platforms</b> fully handicapped accessible. Several of these elevators were added during recent renovations of the station.|$|R
50|$|On Platform 1 for Akaike, door 16 is {{closest to}} the <b>elevator,</b> and on <b>Platform</b> 2 for Fushimi and Kamiotai, door 18 {{is closest to}} the elevator.|$|R
50|$|Built in 2003, this single-platform {{station is}} located 50 metres below the surface, with three {{high-speed}} <b>elevators</b> linking the <b>platform</b> {{to the single}} access at Avinguda Rasos de Peguera.|$|R
25|$|The Metro Gold Line is a light-rail {{line that}} passes through Union Station as it travels between Azusa and East Los Angeles. Trains use Tracks 1 and 2 of Union Station's 14 outdoor tracks. The {{platform}} is accessible {{from the main}} passenger tunnel via staircase and <b>elevator.</b> The <b>platform</b> features an art installation, entitled Images of Commonality/Nature and Movement, created by Beth Thielen.|$|R
2500|$|In 1992, San Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG) {{purchased}} the historic depot from Santa Fe. [...] While Amtrak and Metrolink stopped using the depot in favor {{for a much}} smaller newer structure {{on the west side}} of the older one, SANBAG acquired over $15 million from federal and local grants and funds to begin an extensive restoration of the historic depot beginning in 2002. [...] In 2004, SANBAG and Metrolink moved some of their offices there. [...] After renovations are complete, SANBAG will share ownership with the City of San Bernardino and both agencies intend on leasing space in it. The historic depot waiting area, along with a new snack shop, opened again for Amtrak and Metrolink passengers on 2 May 2008. A new <b>elevator,</b> <b>platforms,</b> tracks, and an overpass are being built in March and April 2017 as part of the Downtown San Bernardino Passenger Rail Project, an extension of Metrolink service to the San Bernardino Transit Center.|$|R
50|$|During the Opening Ceremony {{there were}} more than 75,000 people within the Olympic Stadium with a then record of 3,057 {{competitors}} from 61 nations. The President of South Korea, Roh Tae-Woo, presented the new Paralympic flag to the President of the ICC, Jens Bromann. Paul Croft, competing in his second Paralympic Games, was the flag bearer for Australia during the Opening Ceremony. Parachutists in the Paralympic colors of blue, black, red, yellow, and green swept down into the Olympic Stadium following a procession of children in wheelchairs. The Olympic Torch was carried in by a one-legged South Korean Paralympic volleyball player and handed to 19 year old Cho Hyun-hui, a wheelchair bound athlete with cerebral palsy. Cho Hyun-hai was wheeled around the stadium by her 7-year-old daughter before handing the Torch to blind runner Lee Jae-oon, who linked hands with women's handball Olympic gold medalist Kiifi Hyun-mi, who together, were carried up by <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> to light the Olympic Flame.|$|R
