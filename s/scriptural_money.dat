Doubts on the real nature of EU electronic money have arisen, since calls have been made in connection with the 2007 EU Payment Services Directive in favor of merging payment institutions and electronic money institutions. Such a merger could mean that electronic money is of the same nature as bank money or <b>scriptural</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

As of 2010, Iran’s Central Bank, is not able to conduct a “proactive” monetary policy (e.g. it needs Majlis approval before issuing participation bonds) and has no control over the government’s fiscal policy.|$|E
30|$|The Swiss {{people will}} vote in 2018 on an {{initiative}} for monetary reform. The proposal {{is to have}} sovereign money, where only the Swiss National Bank (SNB) can issue money and where money includes banknotes and <b>scriptural</b> <b>money</b> from non-banks. 1 In principle, <b>scriptural</b> <b>money</b> means sight deposits included in M 1. The reform would imply that all sight deposits in Swiss francs would be transferred outside commercial banks’ balance sheets and would be deposited at the SNB. The SNB would control the quantity of these sight deposits. The initiative also proposes that the SNB distributes funds to the state or directly to households. These funds would come from the existing sight deposits the SNB receives and from new money creation.|$|E
40|$|The {{technological}} innovations {{applied to the}} systems of payment have been tremendous these two last decades. A system of payment is a whole of mechanisms whose {{the objective is to}} transfer the various forms of <b>scriptural</b> <b>money</b> between the economic agents. These transfers are realised by several telecommunications networks and so can be baptised: Electronic Fund Transfers (EFT). The EFT can then be defined as the whole of financial fund transfers carried out between economic agents. Traditionally, the EFT are dissociated in EFT of small amounts on one hand, and EFT of large amounts on the other hand. The first cover the transfers of money (transfers below 100 000 euros) between banks and their customers (check, credit card, [...] .). The second relates to the transfers of money (up to 100 000 euros) between commercial banks (in the activities of market and the operations on financial contracts, the payments of large amounts of the non-financial agents) and the operations of the central bank on the monetary market. This distinction practically takes place by th...|$|E

Legal rules relating to bills of rights realization is a perfect rigorous regime. The special regime, derogating governing procedure execution quality bills is justified and bills of exchange, promissory note and check to be instruments of <b>scriptural</b> <b>money,</b> qualified as a legal system requires great rigor. The procedural and enforcement proceedings taken by the legislature to ensure fulfillment of trade are much stricter in the right bills to go faster and safer way to realization of rights emerge. Debt securities notes (bills of exchange, promissory notes and check), by their specificity, have boosted the feature of incorporating the right way, so the title itself forms a unit with built right, subject as such forms and rules special, simple operation, formation, movement and recovery, and their binding force is a substantial, not procedural, as the essence of such securities, as their constitution and other necessary items...|$|E
40|$|The {{very concept}} of legal money has been {{evolving}} over the last decades, {{and particularly in the}} last years. <b>Scriptural</b> <b>money</b> or “bank money” is now widely considered as an equivalent of paper money and coins, and as such a main part of “sovereign money”. In the last years, new species of “money”, free money and virtual money, have increasingly been accepted as a mean of payment. The common characteristic of these currencies is loss of referral to a central issuing authority directly or indirectly controlled by a sovereign State. However, until very recently free and virtual money have been circulating within small sized communities or among limited online operators. This has changed when a new encryption based virtual money, Bitcoin, has been created. The success of Bitcoin have caused economists, sociologists and law scholars to investigate its nature and scope. The paper examines the history and possibile prospects of Bitcoin, taking both its characteristic as technical device and its juridical nature into account. Given the experience of abnormal fluctuations in its value (compared to fiat money and common currencies) the conclusion is that Bitcoin {{does not seem to be}} able to be considered as “proper” money, rather than a financial instrument of speculative nature...|$|E
40|$|The essay {{outlines}} the birth and devolopment of the Ufficio arisen in 1419, {{in spite of}} previous sporadic episodes and different historiographical interpretations. The Ufficio was designed by the civil and religious power and was composed by the archibishop and four lay members elected by the civil authorities with aim of seeking, defending and distributing pious legacies of citizens. In such a way the Ufficio takes shape as a magistrature of the Commune with full administrative and judicial jurisdiction {{in the field of}} charity, so that in 1482 the archibishop urge the Pope for the aknowledgement of all the proceedings issued in favor of the institution. The Ufficio witnesses that civic religion characterising Italy of XV Century. Thanks to the broader responsibilities assigned to it – redemption of captives, appointment of the Genoese consul in Alexandria of Egypt, protection of abandoned children, administration of hospitals –, the Ufficio becomes also an actual economic power by virtue of management of pious legacies concentrated in the Bank of St. George so as to be defined an office of exchange. The Ufficio carries on an active solidarity, by supporting the establishment of local pawnshop too, transforms the <b>scriptural</b> <b>money</b> into cash and moves to the virtuous cycle of money every kind of pious legacy, of licit or illicit origin, making it available to the community in spite of many difficulties.  Indeed it works both against the interests of potential heirs and the public treasury that attempts to take possession of pious legacies...|$|E
