40|$|Abstract — One {{of the key}} {{research}} efforts associated with a redun-dant seven degree of freedom (7 -DOF) upper limb exoskeleton robot that is mechanically coupled to {{the human body is}} to develop high and low level control algorithms that enable the system to become a natural extension of the human body. Improving the synergistic relationship between the exoskeleton and the operator is manifested in part by decreasing the force exchange between the two entities. Such a reduction is accomplished in part by developing criteria for resolving the human arm redundancy. The redundancy may be represented by a <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> which is defined as the angular rotation of the elbow around an axis that passes through the shoulder and wrist joints. The proposed criteria for defining the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> takes into account the dynamics of the human arm along with a viscoelastic muscle-like model with variable damping. The <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> is estimated using the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian with a secondary objective function that estimates the desired joint angles during human arm movement. The result is then fed to the muscle model to create a more realistic human motion. The estimated <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> is then compared with the actual <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> measured experimentally by a motion capture system. Results indicate that the average error between the estimated and measured <b>swivel</b> joint <b>angle</b> is 4. 4 degrees (in the range [3. 7 - 6] degrees), which are lower than the kinematically based redundant resolution criterion.

40|$|Abstract — According to {{the seven}} {{degrees of freedom}} (DOFs) human arm model {{composed}} of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, positioning of the wrist in space and orientating the palm is a task requiring only six DOFs. Due to this redundancy, a given task can be completed by multiple arm configurations, {{and there is no}} unique mathematical solution to the inverse kinematics. The redundancy of a wearable robotic system (exoskeleton) that interacts with the human is expected to be resolved {{in the same way as}} that of the human arm. A unique solution to the system’s redundancy was introduced by combining both kinematic and dynamic criteria. The redundancy of the arm is expressed mathematically by defining the swivel angle: the rotation angle of the plane including the upper and lower arm around a virtual axis connecting the shoulder and wrist joints which are fixed in space. Two different <b>swivel</b> <b>angles</b> were generated based on kinematic and dynamic constraints. The kinematic criterion is to maximize the projection of the longest principle axis of the manipulability ellipsoid for the human arm on the vector connecting the wrist and the virtual target on the head region. The dynamic criterion is to minimize the mechanical work done in the joint space for each two consecutive points along the task space trajectory. These two criteria were then combined linearly with different weight factors for estimating the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle.</b> Post processing of experimental data collected with a motion capturing system indicated that by using the proposed synthesis of redundancy resolution criteria, the error between the predicted <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> and the actual <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> adopted by the motor control system was less then five degrees.

Resolving this redundancy is becoming critical as the human interacts with a wearable robotic system(exoskeleton) which includes the same redundancy as the human arm. Therefore, the inverse kinematics solution resolving the redundancy of these two coupled systems must be identical in order to guarantee a seamless integration. Creating a proper control scheme between a wearable robot and human arm starts from an understanding of the redundant nature of the human arm. The redundancy of the arm can be formulated kinematically by defining the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> - the rotation angle of the plane {{including the}} upper and lower arm around a virtual axis connecting the shoulder and wrist joints fixed in space. Then a global exoskeleton robot control scheme targeted for the natural human robot interaction will be achieved by providing a robot with the precise <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> estimation for the given kinematic and dynamic states of the human arm. In order for this, we first study human motor control mechanism for the simple reaching and grasping tasks from a kinematic point of view. Analyzing reaching tasks recorded with a motion capture system indicates that the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle,</b> which defines the redundancy of the human arm, is selected such that when the elbow joint is flexed, the palm moves toward the head for any wrist position. Based on these experimental results, a new criterion to resolve the human arm redundancy is formed and this criterion is to maximize the projection of the longest principle axis of the manipulability ellipsoid for the human arm on the vector connecting the wrist and the virtual target on the head region. For more realistic and natural human arm movement, we additionally considered the redundancy based on the dynamic criterion which minimizes the mechanical work done in the joint space for each two consecutive points along the task space trajectory. The the <b>swivel</b> <b>angles</b> from the kinematic and dynamic criteria were linearly combined with different weight factors for the unified the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle.</b> Post processing of experimental data collected with a motion capturing system indicated that by using the proposed synthesis of redundancy resolution criteria, the error between the predicted <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> and the actual <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> adopted by the motor control system was less then five degrees. This result outperformed the prediction based on a single criteria and showed that the kinematic constraint is dominant in a simple reaching and grasping tasks that frequently occurs in our daily life. In order to define the redundancy resolution mechanism for more generalized human arm movement, the effect of the wrist orientation on the redundancy of the human arm was superimposed onto the wrist position based <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> estimation. By applying the above inverse kinematics mechanism mimicking the natural human arm movement to the wearable robot, wearer can expect the synchronized movement with robot for unconstrained natural human arm movements. Finally, to accommodate the unnatural movement pattern such as avoiding obstacle, purely reactive task space admittance control based on multiple force sensors is combined with the above control schemes for a global exoskeleton robot control scheme. Five subjects performed a peg in hole task for three different target locations to verify the performance of the proposed control scheme. The velocities and interaction forces at the upper arm, lower arm, handle and tip were recorded during the experiments. Power exchange between the subject and device was calculated for performance evaluation. Result shows that proposed control scheme outperforms purely reactive task space admittance control with energy exchange lowered by 11. 22 %. Based on the proposed exoskeleton control scheme, the exoskeleton robot is applied to the stroke patient rehabilitation research project as a clinical trial. In order for this, 3 -D video games directly interacting with the robotic system were designed and the assistive force mechanism for the patients was implemented in the exoskeleton robot. In addition a new metric called instantaneous efficiency(IE) was established to evaluate the therapeutic improvement. This metric is designed to reveal the degree of patient's improvement in terms of natural human arm movements by looking at the joint angle configuration, speed and frequency of using uncomfortable joints comprehensively. As their movements are getting closer to the natural human arm movement of normal people, the IE index increases. Ten subjects participated in this pilot research project either as an unilateral or a bilateral therapy group for six weeks.

40|$|Reaching {{is a basic}} {{component}} of human movements requiring the coordination of the eyes and multiple body segments including the hand, forearm, arm and torso. Although this movement has been studied extensively, the theory bridging the explicit reaching behavior (coordinated movement of body segments) and the implicit reaching strategy (control mechanisms) is limited. Hence, modeling unconstrained reach movements {{as a result of}} coordination remains a difficult task. The aims of the present study were to investigate the relationships defining the coordination pattern, control mode composition and movement phase transition in order to develop a model of coordinated reach movements. This work focuses more particularly on the characterization of body segment kinematics in movement phases and control mode transition in relation to visual information. A novel approach to determine control mode transition is proposed by using changes in curvature of the elbow <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> (ESA) combined with the content of visual information. The results show that this approach seems to be a good indicator of control mode transition in reach movements. The relative durations of movement control modes were therefore determined and modeled as a function of reaching requirements. In addition, the use of the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> enables the reduction of the degrees of freedom and contributes to a simplification of arm movement models. Two strategies of movement execution were observed {{as a function of the}} availability of the visual information. In absence of vision, the movement variability was significantly reduced in order to constrain the system degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the orientation of the movement errors strongly support that in the present context, movements are planned in a local coordinate system and the head is the origin of that frame of reference. A coordination model was developed to describe the timing and kinematics of three-dimensional reach movements. This model also includes the relationship between the eyes and body segment movements. With a generalized hand trajectory, the proposed model generates the sequence of movement phases and drives a multi-linkage system as a function of target locations...|$|R

The arm posture is quantified by a <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> that is ex-perimentally measured when a healthy subject is reaching for targets in a spherical workspace.

This observed posture consistency indicates that human motor con-trol chooses a unique arm posture associated to a 3 D hand position. From the per-spective of posture consistency, this work further examines the posture predictions based on two hypotheses on human arm control strategies: one that maximizes the movement efficiency towards the head, particularly toward the mouth; and the other that minimizes the power consumption in joint space. The arm posture predictions based on these two control strategies are compared and the prediction errors for each control strategy are analyzed. ...|$|R

The transparency can be improved by integrating the admittance control along with an arm redundancy resolution algorithm. Recent research effort resulted in a new criterion for the human arm redundancy resolution for unconstrained arm motions estimating the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> with prediction errors of less than 5 ◦. The proposed criterion for the arm redundancy resolution defines the mouth as the primary target of the the human hand during unconstrained arm motions in free space. It was postulated based on experimental data analysis that this criterion {{is based on a}} neural mechanism directing the hand towards the head for self-feeding. In conjunction with the proposed redundancy resolution criteria a task space admittance control algorithm is introduced based on multiple force sensor inputs obtained at the interface between the human arm and the exoskeleton system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis has been to design and {{simulate}} different concepts of a secondary controlled swing drive for a wheel excavator. Secondary control is a known technology {{in the field of}} hydraulics that offers precise positioning as well as the possibility of energy recuperation. Secondary control is today used in certain industrial applications and is rather unemployed in mobile machinery. An excavator moves high loads in cyclic motions which are ideal conditions for energy recuperating systems. A study of the potential of a secondary controlled swing drive is therefore interesting. The focus has been on testing different circuit architectures and emergency brake concepts. The results of the design process have been three types of circuit architectures and two types of hydraulic safety concepts. The results of the simulation have shown that the open and closed circuit architecture have similar energy efficiency. The closed circuit with low pressure accumulator however offers the best controllability. At least 20 % energy savings can be achieved by storing thekinetic energy when braking. A hydraulic emergency brake must function, independent on the direction of rotation of the excavator during a failure. The first principle recognises the rotation direction and changes the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> of the secondary unit so that a braking torque is created. In the second principle a pressure difference is built up over the secondary unit that always results in a braking torque.

50|$|Closed-loop: Motor-return is {{connected}} {{directly to the}} pump-inlet. To keep up pressure on the low pressure side, the circuits have a charge pump (a small gearpump) that supplies cooled and filtered oil to the low pressure side. Closed-loop circuits are generally used for hydrostatic transmissions in mobile applications. Advantages: No directional valve and better response, the circuit can work with higher pressure. The pump <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> covers {{both positive and negative}} flow direction. Disadvantages: The pump cannot be utilized for any other hydraulic function in an easy way and cooling can be a problem due to limited exchange of oil flow. High power closed loop systems generally must have a 'flush-valve' assembled in the circuit in order to exchange much more flow than the basic leakage flow from the pump and the motor, for increased cooling and filtering. The flush valve is normally integrated in the motor housing to get a cooling effect for the oil that is rotating in the motor housing itself. The losses in the motor housing from rotating effects and losses in the ball bearings can be considerable as motor speeds will reach 4000-5000 rev/min or even more at maximum vehicle speed. The leakage flow as well as the extra flush flow must be supplied by the charge pump. A large charge pump is thus very important if the transmission is designed for high pressures and high motor speeds. High oil temperature is usually a major problem when using hydrostatic transmissions at high vehicle speeds for longer periods, for instance when transporting the machine from one work place to the other. High oil temperatures for long periods will drastically reduce the lifetime of the transmission. To keep down the oil temperature, the system pressure during transport must be lowered, meaning that the minimum displacement for the motor must be limited to a reasonable value. Circuit pressure during transport around 200-250 bar is recommended.|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2012 In this {{dissertation}} control algorithms {{are developed}} and {{tested for the}} EXO-UL 7 towards a control strategy for stroke rehabilitation. EXO-UL 7 is a seven degree of freedom (Dof) powered upper limb exoskeleton that was initially designed at the University of Washington and further refined at the University of California Santa Cruz. Admittance control, <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> prediction and neural control of the device have been implemented and subjects tested performance of the device and control strategy. After an initial summery {{of the state of}} the art and details of the existing system. Each control strategy and performance from testing is explored. Admittance control uses force sensors on EXO-UL 7 to control the movement of the device by moving in the direction that that user pressed on the device. Because EXO-UL 7 is a redundant manipulator and supports the entire configuration of the arm, a single force sensor on the device end effector is not enough to fully define the movement. Additional force sensors on the device that are located at each attachment point of the machine interface allows for the full configuration of the device to be specified. This turns the under defined problem into an over defined problem (to many force signals for the number of Dof). Two strategies are developed to project the signals onto a seven degree subspace. The first adds the force vectors in task space then uses the Inverse kinematic to develop joint trajectories. The second uses the Jacoban transpose to map the forces first to instantaneous joint torques then the torques are added in joint space and finally joint trajectories are developed from joint torques. Six subjects performed a peg in hole experiment and it was found that task based admittance control had about 11 % lower interaction energy required to do the task. It was also shown that with both admittance controlers the subjects did the tasks slower then with no Control at all. Kinematic and dynamic constraints requced the bandwith of the system. To improve the bandwith, Predictive algorithms are employed. <b>Swivel</b> <b>angle</b> prediction is the first predictive algorithm implements to improve the performance of the device. With this control strategy the configuration of the redundant space is related to the end effector position. by observing human behavior it was noted that one of the fundamental task preformed by the human arm was to bring food to the mouth. By maximizing the manipulability of the device in the direction of the mouth, a simple stable closed form prediction of the configuration of the device was achived. Comparing movement from motion capture to predicted motion showed a good correlation and testing of the algorithm on the exoskeleton device was conducted. 4 Subjects conducted a peg in hole task. An 11. 22 % reduction of interaction energy was achieved when compared to Admittance control alone. This algorthm can be used for motion folowwing as in teh current set up, or to predict where what the arm configuration should be whne workingwith disabled populations. Although this method predicted motion very well, it only provided prodiction of the one Dof redundant space of the arm. To further extend the prediction capability and motion following of the device, neural control was implemented in which electro myography (EMG) is used to read the nerve impulsed to the muscle. Although this signal only relates muscle force to isometric muscle contraction, using other system parameters read from Exo-UL 7 such as the joint, position and velocity, A Hill based muscle model predicts the muscle force and ultimately the muscle torque. Due to an inherent delay between when the nerve impulse can first be detected and when the muscle contracts (some where o the order of 50 - 100 ms) the motion can be predicted before the arm begins to move. The model has many variable that need to be predicted for each individual so before each subject test an parameter fitting is conducted. Four subjects preformed a peg in hole test. It was shown that the interaction power increased compared to admittance control, but the completion time decreased. With further examination in was noted that the interaction force and energy when using the neural control was the same as with the admittance control. This implies that with the same force we achieved a higher velocity, which means that the system had a higher overall gain. The performance gains were not uniform through out all the subjects. The parameter fit conducted for each subject did not guarantee convergence to even a local minimum and there is still opportunities to improve the system performance. Admittance control did a good job of motion following and neural and swivel prediction improved upon this control scheme. There is still further work to be done on the system.

40|$|The synergy {{of human}} arm and {{wearable}} robot systems studies the compatibility of a wearable robot {{system and its}} operators. Ideally, the motion of a wearable robot system should be dynamically transparent to a healthy operator, sensitively responsible to the voluntary and involuntary motions of its operator. When used for robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation and/or power augmentation, a wearable robot system is expected to provide assist to the operator's motor skills and correct the abnormal movements resulted from motor disabilities. Inspired by the control strategies of human motor system, the robot systems can be more dexterous in manipulations and more adaptable to various tasks and uncertain environments. The study on synergy of human arm and wearable robot systems intends {{to find out the}} motor control strategies that dominate human arm movements, in order to apply to the control of robotic systems, such as the upper limb exoskeletons and the surgical robot systems. This research experimentally investigated the arm movements in various tasks, to enhance the understanding of human motor control and to benefit the control robotic systems. With the data collected from point-to-point reaching movements, it proposed a redundancy resolution methodology based on multi-criterion performance optimization, which provides real-time predictions of arm postures with improved accuracy. Based on the comparison between reaching and reach-to-grasp movements, it further studied arm postures affected by grasping orientations and pointed out the control strategy that dominates the macro- and micro- structure coordination. From both healthy subjects and stroke patients, experimental data of unimanual and bimanual movements are recorded for identical tasks. The statistical analysis shows that motor function of the paretic arm can be improved when moving symmetrically with the non-paretic arm, which reveals the beneficial effects of the inter-arm coupling on stroke rehabilitation. The dissertation contributed to answer the following three research questions:*	How to predict the natural arm postures of reaching movement?The kinematic redundancy of the human arm enables the elbow position to rotate about the axis going through the shoulder and wrist, which results in infinite possible arm postures when the arm reaches to a target in a 3 -dimensional workspace. To infer the control strategy the human motor system uses to resolve redundancy in reaching movements, this research compares five redundancy resolution criteria and evaluates their arm posture prediction performance using data on healthy human motion. Two synthesized criteria are developed to provide better real-time arm posture prediction than the five individual criteria. Of these two, the criterion synthesized using an exponential method predicts the arm posture more accurately than that using a least squares approach, and therefore is preferable for inferring the contributions of the individual criteria to motor control during reaching movements. As a methodology contribution, this paper proposes a framework to compare and evaluate redundancy resolution criteria for arm motion control. A cluster analysis which associates criterion contributions with regions of the workspace provides a guideline for designing a real-time motion control system applicable to upper-limb exoskeletons for stroke rehabilitation. *	How do the arm joints coordinate in reach-to-grasp movement?Reach-to-grasp movements are widely observed in activities of daily living, particularly in tool manipulations. In order to reduce the complexity in redundancy resolution and facilitate upper-limb exoskeleton control in reach-to-grasp tasks, we studied joint coordination in the human arm during such movements. Experimental data were collected on reach-to-grasp movements in a 3 -dimensional (3 D) workspace for cylinder targets of different positions and grasping orientations. For comparison, reaching movements toward the same targets are also recorded. In the kinematic analysis, the redundant degree of freedom in human arm is represented by the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle.</b> The four grasping-relevant degrees of freedom (GR-DOFs), including the <b>swivel</b> <b>angle</b> and the three wrist joints, behave differently in reach-to-grasp movements comparing to how they behave in reaching movements. The ratio of active motion range (R-AMR) is proposed for quantitatively comparison the task-relevance of the GR-DOFs. Analysis on the R-AMR values shows that the task-relevant GR-DOFs are more actively used, while the task-irrelevant joints are left uncontrolled and maintain their neutral positions. Among the task-relevant GR-DOFs, the smaller joints (micro-structure) are more actively used than the larger joints (macro-structure). The coordination of the task-relevant GR-DOFs is shown to be synergistic. Analysis of the acceleration/deceleration at the GR-DOFs indicates different levels of voluntary control in three phases of the movements. The study of the characteristics of the joint coordination in reach-to-grasp movements provides guidelines for simplifying the control of the upper limb exoskeleton. *	Can the bilateral training benefit the post-stroke stroke recovery?Bilateral training has been used for post-stroke rehabilitation of patients with paretic upper arms. This training method exploits the inter-arm coupling in bimanual movements which tends to synchronize the paretic arm with the non-paretic arm for motor function recovery. Different levels of motor function recovery have been reported in clinical studies, yet the efficacy of bilateral training is still not clear. As a result, this paper collected data on bimanual symmetric reaching movements in a 3 -dimensional (3 D) workspace from ten healthy subjects and eight chronic stroke patients, to investigate the effects of inter-arm coupling. In reaching experiments, identical tasks are also performed unimanually and recorded. Mapping variables are proposed to measure arm behavior changes and to quantify the similarity of the movements of the two arms. Among the four proposed mapping variables, mapping linearity and mapping complexity were found to reflect both the motion complexity and the task-relevance of a joint, while the other two variables captured changes in motion range and relative velocity. Statistical analysis shows that inter-arm coupling increases inter-arm symmetry more at task-relevant joints than at task-irrelevant joints. To achieve symmetric bimanual movement, the dominant arm of healthy subjects and the non-paretic arm of stroke patients deviate more from their unilateral behavior than the non-dominant/paretic arms. For stroke patients, the effect of inter-arm coupling on arm function depends on the task-relevance of a joint. During bimanual movement, joint behavior at task-irrelevant joints is different from behavior during unimanual movement, which implies that bimanual rehabilitation may help break abnormal movement patterns for these joints. For task-relevant joints, the average arm posture of the paretic arm is significantly higher in bimanual movement, which indicates the possible efficacy of bilateral rehabilitation...|$|R
