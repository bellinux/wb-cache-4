The <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> was given for use as a flag pole on the keep (where it twice suffered lightning damage), and the present flagpole is a fibreglass replica. In an episode of Antiques Roadshow from Pembroke Castle, broadcast in April 2017, a relative of a crew member brought photographs, and a damask tablecloth and some cutlery from the yacht, to be appraised.|$|R
50|$|To {{increase}} its performance even further, the Tornado was modified in 2000, {{with a new}} sail-plan which included a <b>Spinnaker</b> and <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> {{as well as an}} increased sail area of the existing sails. An additional trapeze was also added, and the jib was made self tacking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thompsontown was a seaside resort, {{and rather}} a lively {{place in the}} season. There was a large hotel for summer {{visitors}} who could afford to pay good prices, and several smaller houses of entertainment, such as the <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>Boom,</b> where people of moderate means were made very comfortable.|$|R

"There {{was that}} {{matter of the}} deck-calking, the bronze rudder-irons, the {{overhauling}} of the engine, the new <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> the new davits, and the repairs to the whale-boat.

6000|$|... "Toward {{the middle}} of the {{afternoon}} they reached Thompsontown, where the young clergyman said he was going to stop for the night, and go on by train the next day.

6000|$|... "The honeymoon of Mr. and Mrs. Twitty {{was spent}} in Thompsontown, and lasted three days; for {{at the end of}} that time the bride's brother demanded to be {{released}} from the care of the toll-gate, having other duties which were incumbent upon him. But when Sam and his wife spoke of leaving the <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>Boom,</b> Captain Abner was perfectly willing to go with them. His face bore an expression of contented resignation.|$|R
60|$|Marston {{looked at}} the high topsail and bending <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom.</b> He {{would have liked to}} haul the topsail down, but his comrade's voice had a strange gay note that he had heard before. Harry meant to carry on; he would drive the boat until {{something}} broke. Then Marston looked ahead. The big promontory was not far off and moonlight touched the towering crags. The sea was all white, for the current, setting strongly round the head, ran in angry combers against the wind.|$|R
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of the boats from the 1883 race have remained the standard ever since. Despite the small hulls, the dinghies carried substantial rigging. Although square topsails were reportedly in use in the 1880s, the form used today soon developed, basically scaled down from the larger sloops. One early example, the Reckless, was fitted with a 28 ft mast, 28 ft boom, 14 ft bowsprit, and 20 ft <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom.</b> She carried 70 square yards of canvas going upwind, while the spinnaker increased this to 92 square yards running downwind.|$|R
50|$|The {{foot of a}} Bermuda sail may be {{attached}} to the boom along its length, or in some modern rigs the sail is attached to the boom only at its ends. This modern variation of a Bermuda mainsail is known as a loose-footed main. In some early Bermudian vessels, the mainsails were attached only to the mast and deck, lacking booms. This is the case on two of the three masts of the newly built Spirit of Bermuda, a replica of an 1830s British Royal Navy sloop-of-war. Additional sails were also often mounted on traditional Bermudian craft, when running down wind, which included a spinnaker, with a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> and additional jibs.|$|R
60|$|Ten {{years ago}} all the bawleys were clinker-built--that is, with the streaks {{overlapping}} each other, as in boats; {{but the new}} bawleys are now all carvel-built, the planks being placed edge to edge, so as to give a smooth surface, as in yachts and large vessels. They now {{for the most part}} carry <b>spinnakers,</b> <b>boomed</b> out when running before the wind, and balloon foresails, thereby greatly adding to their speed in light winds. One peculiarity of the bawleys is that, when at anchor, the mainsail, instead of being stowed with its spars parallel to the deck, is made up on its gaff, which is then hoisted with the throat seven or eight feet up the mast, while the peak rests on the stern.|$|R
50|$|Explicit {{requirements}} {{exist for}} drainage requirements on ships with well decks. On many vessels the cargo hatches and cargo handling <b>booms</b> and <b>winches</b> were {{located on the}} well decks between a central superstructure and raised forecastle and poop.|$|R

50|$|The {{ship had}} hydrographic <b>booms</b> and <b>winches</b> on her bridge deck on both her port and {{starboard}} sides. The booms had mechanical travelers to which lowering blocks were attached which regulated {{the distance of the}} lowering wire from the rail.|$|R
5000|$|Boom - use an {{adjustable}} <b>boom</b> with a <b>winch</b> to recover vehicles from a ditch, over an embankment, or any place the vehicle cannot be safely reach backing-up. Some booms are fixed, some heavy pivoting A-frames, others hydraulic-powered telescoping tubes. In the past boom trucks used a [...] "hook and chain" [...] system where chains are looped around the vehicle frame or axle, then lifted by a <b>boom</b> <b>winch.</b> A towbar with heavy rubberized mats connects {{the truck and}} vehicle, {{so it can be}} towed on its other axle. [...] "Slings" [...] and [...] "belt lifts" [...] are an evolution, with rubber straps replacing part of the chains. Slings are not used much today because they can scratch the bumpers of cars. But they are sometimes used for towing vehicles that have been in an accident or have {{one or two of the}} front or rear wheels missing or for pickup trucks and other vehicles that have steel bumpers. Cars equipped with all-wheel drive cannot be towed with a sling, since it can cause problems with the car's drivetrain.|$|R
60|$|He beckoned {{the paid}} hand and they crawled along the deck. Red Rose rolled savagely and main <b>boom</b> and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> tossed their ends aloft. The spars {{must be kept}} down, lest they swing across, and Marston, {{clasping}} the varnished pole with arms and legs, crawled {{out as far as}} he dared. Sometimes he swung high above the combers that rushed past below; and sometimes swung down until his body was wet by the foam. He could hold on if Harry kept her straight, but if she swerved much the big sails would lurch across and he and Charley would hardly escape with broken bones. He looked aft. Wyndham's figure cut against the light; it was tense and his head was motionless, as if his glance was fixed. Marston knew he meant to bring Red Rose in on her time allowance or sail her under.|$|R
50|$|Originally named Plaisance, this estate {{included}} a huge mansion surrounded by 10 acre of grounds {{and was the}} home of Sir Bertram Falle. It {{was put on the}} market in 1937 for the sum of £25,000. At the time Davis was seeking a suitable site to erect a statue of King George V. He purchased the site and employed Mr. J. A. Colledge, a famous landscape gardener, to lay out the grounds {{in the form of a}} park. Early in 1938 the landscaping of the park began. By August 1939 the work was so well advanced it was decided to prepare everything for an early public opening of the Park. The Park was officially handed over as a gift to the people of Jersey in September 1939. A statue of King George V by William Reid Dick was erected within the main entrance and the flagstaff was made from the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> of Davis's racing yacht Westward. A Hall of Remembrance was also established in the grounds.|$|R
60|$|Scrambling forward, {{he crawled}} {{out along the}} <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> to which he clung precariously, lifted up high one moment and the next swung down until his feet were just above the foam. Sometimes they splashed in, and Frank, bracing himself until every nerve was strung up, felt horribly uneasy. In spite of that, the wild rush through the {{glittering}} water which boiled about the boat was wonderfully exhilarating. She seemed a mass of straining sail which swayed in the moonlight above an insignificant strip of hull half buried in snowy foam. Over her black mainsail peak dim wisps of clouds went streaming by, and from all around there was a tumult of stirring sound--the clamor at the bows, the swish of water as the canoe came charging up to her, and the splash of tumbling seas. Everything ahead, however, was hidden by the sail, and he was wondering where the other boat was when Harry called to him.|$|R
60|$|He floundered {{forward to}} the foot of the mast, and when he came back the {{spinnaker}} was drawing steadily and the sloop had changed her mode of progress. She no longer rolled viciously or screwed up to windward as she lifted on a sea, but swayed from side to side with a smooth and easy swing, and Frank could steer her with a touch upon the tiller. In spite of that, steering was ticklish work, for the mainboom and the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> went up and came down until they raked the glittering brine alternately, and Frank realized that it would be singularly easy to bring one crashing over upon the other. There was no doubt that the boat was sailing very fast, and he hazarded one swift glance over his shoulder at the canoe. She was surging along astern, hove up with her forward half out of the water, and a seething mass of foam hiding the rest of her. Harry, however, glanced forward somewhat anxiously.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was {{constructed}} on Georges Head and {{was designed to}} prevent enemy submarines from entering into Sydney Harbour. The boom net spanned the entire width of Port Jackson and a <b>boom</b> net <b>winch</b> house was located on Liangs Point, Watsons Bay.|$|R
60|$|Frank {{was very}} {{cautious}} as he eased the rope out around a cleat, after which, when the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom</b> had drawn forward, {{he found that}} he could luff the boat. When she had swerved from her course a trifle {{he could see the}} other boat close ahead, and it gave him some idea how fast both craft were traveling. She seemed nothing but sail. Indeed, except for the torn-up track of foam that marked her passage, she looked much less like a boat than some wonderful phantom thing flying at an astonishing speed across the sea. Swiftly as she sped, however, there was no doubt that the sloop was creeping up on her, and Frank felt himself quivering all through as the distance between them lessened yard by yard. Then suddenly the contour of her canvas changed and she swung around from leeward across the sloop's bows. Frank's heart gave a sudden leap as he wondered what he must do and his nerve almost deserted him, until Harry called again.|$|R
50|$|Masts were fitted on the {{centerline}} of {{the vessel}} between hatches Nos. 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 4 and 5, to which cargo booms were rigged. Two king posts, one port and one starboard, were fitted at both the forward and after ends of the deck house. Hatches Nos. 1 and 5 were provided with two 5-ton <b>booms</b> and two <b>winches</b> each. Nos. 2, 3 and 4 hatches were provided with four 5-ton <b>booms</b> and four <b>winches</b> each.

No other Tiger tanks modified in this manner were ever recovered.|$|R
50|$|The Bermuda sloop {{is a type}} of fore-and-aft rigged {{sailing vessel}} {{developed}} on the island of Bermuda in the 17th century. In this sense, the term is applied to small ships, rather than boats. In its purest form, it is single-masted, although ships with such rigging were built with as many as three masts. Its original form had gaff rig, but evolved to use what is now known as Bermuda rig, making it the basis of nearly all modern sailing yachts. Although the Bermuda sloop is often described as a development of the narrower-beamed Jamaica sloop, which dates from the 1670s, the high, raked masts and triangular sails of its Bermuda rig are rooted in a tradition of Bermudian boat design dating from the early 17th century. Part of that tradition included long, horizontal bowsprits and large jibs. Three jibs were commonly used on Bermudian ships. Triangular sails appeared on Bermudian boats early in the 17th century, a development of the Dutch bezaan, or leg-of-mutton rig, itself derived from the Lateen rig. This became the Bermuda rig, and was appearing on Bermudian ships by the early 19th century. A large spinnaker was carried on a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>boom,</b> when running down-wind.|$|R
50|$|The anti-submarine boom net was {{demolished}} {{soon after}} World War II, {{and all that}} remains are {{the foundations of the}} old <b>boom</b> net <b>winch</b> house, which can be viewed on Green (Laings) Point, Watsons Bay. Today, the Australian War Memorial has on display a composite of the two midget submarines salvaged from Sydney Harbour. The conning tower of one of the midget submarines is on display at the RAN Heritage Centre, Garden Island, Sydney.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, and in {{particular}} Ontario, the donkey engine was often mounted on a barge that could float and thus winch itself over both land and water. Log <b>booms</b> would be <b>winched</b> across water with the engine and it would often be reconfigured with a saw to mill the timber.|$|R
25|$|Enterprise was the {{smallest}} J-Class to be built, her size being an early {{indication of the}} ruthless efficiency that was employed by the renowned naval architect Starling Burgess. The efficiency of design was coupled {{to a number of}} pioneering features such as the Park Avenue <b>Boom,</b> hidden lightweight <b>winches</b> and the world’s first duralumin mast.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the term}} Bermuda sloop {{is applied to}} refer {{specifically}} {{to the type of}} small sailing ships discussed above, the term also was used to describe the small working boats used for moving freight about Bermuda's islands, for fishing, and other coastal activities, and is today widely used for all single-masted, Bermuda-rigged yachts. Motor vehicles were banned in Bermuda until after the Second World War, and the roads were few and poor until the requirements of that war advanced their development. Boats, as a consequence, remained the primary method of moving people and materials around Bermuda well into the 20th century. The Bermuda rig had begun its development in such small boats in the 17th century, before being adapted to ships, and by the 19th century the working boats of the island conformed to an almost pure design, with high, raked masts, long bowsprits, and vast areas of sail. They were, in appearance, scale models of the seagoing sloops. Although such small sloops are rare today (the one pictured at right is a 19th-century survivor), the design was further scaled down to produce the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy, a class of racing vessel used in traditional competition between Bermudian yacht clubs. The term Bermuda sloop has come to be used outside Bermuda, today, to describe any single masted, Bermuda rigged boat, also known as Marconi sloops, although most are far less extreme in their design than was once the norm in Bermuda, with bowsprits omitted, masts vertical and shortened, and <b>booms</b> similarly shortened. <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>booms</b> and multiple jibs are rarely seen. The reduced sail area makes modern boats much more manageable, especially for small or inexperienced crews.|$|R

5000|$|The Mil OKB's {{response}} drew {{heavily on}} the Mi-6, utilising the dynamic components and [...] Soloviev D-25V turboshaft engines, on a slim fuselage sitting on four tall strut braced undercarriage legs, with a wide track allowing the helicopter to taxi over loads, or for mobile loads to be moved underneath. The fuselage can carry 28 passengers inside the cabin as well as 3 tonnes lb of cargo loaded through a side door in the aft fuselage, by an integral <b>boom</b> and <b>winch.</b> Underslung loads can be attached directly to the fuselage by hydraulically operated clamps, or carried on a 8.5 x 3.6 m pallet lifted by the winch and braced by cables and/or struts to the undercarriage legs. The external sling system, with a capacity of 8 tonnes lb, of the Mi-6 could also be fitted under the centre fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|Conifers {{engineering}} plant {{consisted of}} two Cooper-Bessemer straight-8 cylinder, 4-cycle diesel engines. Because of their distinctive rumble, the Coopers were {{referred to as the}} [...] "rock-crushers". Each diesel drove a Westinghouse DC generator. The DC electricity powered a single Westinghouse main-motor, which was coupled directly to the propeller shaft. The 5-bladed prop measured 8 ft 6 in (2.59 m) in diameter. The cargo <b>boom</b> and hoist <b>winches</b> were electric powered. The boat davits were hand-cranked, while the falls were fair-led to the aft towing capstan.|$|R

The Army General reporting {{on the progress of}} the works stated: Through a number of innovative methods, we succeeded in making dynamic <b>booms,</b> and <b>winches</b> etc. After the operation, we have placed static and dynamic booms at strategic points in the Harike Lake to hold back the floating mats of water hyacinth so that it doesn’t spread. At the end of six months of untiring labour by our team, we had opened four channels, which had got choked with silt over the years. We also planted 750 saplings of plants of two years of age on the island for birds to nest and roost in future.|$|R
