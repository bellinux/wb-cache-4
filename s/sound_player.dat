25|$|Owen Sound {{could not}} build on that success and it wasn't until 1999-2000 that the Greys {{returned}} to the playoff final. Coincidentally, it also marked the return of an Owen <b>Sound</b> <b>player</b> {{to the top of}} the league scoring parade, as Ryan Dudgeon put up 59 goals and 104 points to tie Mike Carter of the Cambridge Winterhawks. The Greys reeled off series wins over Kitchener and Stratford—marking the first time the Cullitons had been swept from the playoffs since 1983—but fell short against Cambridge, losing 4-2. The Winterhawks did not lose again that year, rolling to their first Sutherland Cup championship.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1964–65 NBA {{season the}} Bullets {{pulled off a}} {{blockbuster}} trade, sending Dischinger, Rod Thorn and Don Kojis to the Detroit Pistons for Bailey Howell, Don Ohl, Bob Ferry and Wali Jones. The trade worked out well; Howell {{proved to be a}} hustler and a fundamentally <b>sound</b> <b>player.</b> He helped the Bullets get into the playoffs {{for the first time in}} franchise history. In the 1965 NBA Playoffs, the Bullets stunned the St. Louis Hawks 3–1, and advanced to the Western Conference finals.

25|$|An {{orthodox}} batsman with {{a penchant}} for forcing strokes in front of square {{on both sides of the}} wicket he was regarded as a very <b>sound</b> <b>player</b> of fast bowling.

While his commitments outside of cricket limited the number of games he played he was a key member of the very strong Yorkshire sides who won 6 county championships during his career (although this did include 1901 when Jackson did not appear in the county championship). His performances in 1896 and 1898 in particular showed what his statistics could have been if he had been able to dedicate more time, scoring over 1,000 championship runs at better than 40.00 in each season and taking over 100 wickets across the two seasons at an average of under 20.|$|E
