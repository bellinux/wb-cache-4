40|$|Membrane {{structures}} {{have a wide}} {{field of}} application in modern engineering due to their low weight-to-area ratio, which is especially exploited in kite design. The internal pressure of ram-air kites has to be well distributed over all cells {{in order to maintain}} the aerodynamic <b>shape.</b> <b>By</b> <b>cutting</b> holes in each rib the stagnated air can provide the required pressure in each cell. The question is, where to cut the holes such that the structural performance does not cause a decrease in aerodynamic performance? For that reason the membrane finite element (FE) solver developed in TU Delft in combination with geometrically non-linear topology optimization was utilized. The membrane FE solver is based on the tension field theory which allows the use of low density meshes and still being able to determine the membrane states: taut, wrinkled, or slack. Topology optimization supplies the user with an optimum material distribution in a design space for a given load. The combination of membrane FE solver and topology optimization resulted in an efficient method, which successfully reduced slack and wrinkled areas in membranes. The rib structure was optimized in a combination of two flight conditions, and the results indicate hole positions similar to the real ram-air rib model.

40|$|A new {{technique}} for sample preparation and trace analysis of organic pollutants in water using mixed-phase thin film (MPTF) devices, combined with direct thermal desorption, cold trapping, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is presented {{for the first}} time. Two novel analytical devices, Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) and polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) TF samplers were fabricated using spin coating technique and glass wool fabric mesh as substrate. The samplers were easily tailored in size and <b>shape</b> <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> tools. Good durability and flat-shape stability were observed during extractions and stirring in water. The latter characteristic obviates {{the need for an}} extra framed holder for rapid thin film microextraction (TFME) and makes the samplers more robust and user-friendly. The analytical performance of the MPTF devices was satisfactorily illustrated and compared with those of solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers and PDMS thin film membrane using water samples spiked with seven N–nitrosamines (NAs), known as disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water. Marked enhancement of extraction efficiencies (typically more than one order of magnitude) for the N-nitrosamines, including the hydrophilic ones, was obtained with the MPTF devices under generally pre-equilibrium conditions, compared to the SPME fibers and PDMS thin film membrane. The analytical results obtained in this study, including linearity, repeatability and detection levels at low ng/L for the tested compounds, indicate that the new thin film devices are promising for rapid sampling and sample preparation of trace levels of polar organic pollutants in water with sensitivities higher than SPME fibers and with a wide application range typical of mixed-phase coatings. The user-friendly format and robustness of the novel devices are also advantageous for on-site applications, which is the ultimate use of thin film samplers. Moreover, the thin film fabrication approach developed in this study offers the possibility of making other novel samplers with PDMS or different absorptive polymers such as polyacrylate (PA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as particle-free, or as particle-loaded thin films with a variety of adsorptive solid particles. In another development {{in the course of this}} research, the performance and accuracy of the SPME fiber approach for sample preparation of selected DBPs were demonstrated and compared with the conventional liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) method by real drinking water samples analysis in collaboration with Health Canada. Four regulated trihalomethanes (THMs) and seven other DBPs known as priority by-products, including four haloacetonitriles, two haloketones and chloropicrin, were analyzed in real samples during two separate comparative studies. In each study, duplicate samples from several water treatment and distribution systems in Canada, collected and stabilized under the same protocol, were analyzed in parallel by two independent labs; in the University of Waterloo by an optimized headspace SPME-GC-MS and in Health Canada by a LLE-GC-ECD (electron capture detection) method equivalent to EPA 551. 1. The values for the concentration of the analytes in the samples obtained by the two methods were in good agreement with each other in majority of the cases indicating that SPME affords the promise of a dependable sample preparation technique for rapid DBPs analysis. In particular, it was shown that the SPME fiber approach combined with GC-MS is a fast reliable alternative to the LLE-GC-ECD (EPA 551. 1) method for analysis of the regulated THMs in the concentration ranges that are typical and relevant for drinking water samples. 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|Peripheral milling {{is a very}} {{important}} procedure in terms of work piece <b>shaping</b> <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> in wood industry. Because of the kinematic principle of this procedure a more or less wavy structure on the cutting area of the work piece appears, the so called cutter marks. That is why in many cases after cutting, expensive extra finishing procedures like sanding must be applied to smoothen the work piece surface. An approach to improve this situation is given by an actuator controlled motion of the tool spindle position to realize a linear cutting motion during the edge approach to the work piece. A control strategy was created and first experiments with a test setup using magnetic bearings have been done successfully...|$|R
40|$|Scholars {{who have}} a reductive view of the {{cognitive}} abilities of Neandertals have often considered that they were incapable of using sophisticated techniques specifically conceived for bone materials, based not just on percussion but on <b>shaping</b> <b>by</b> <b>cutting,</b> scraping, grinding and polishing. The evidence {{presented in this paper}} suggests, in contrast, that {{there is no reason to}} assume that the Buran-Kaya III artisans were AMHs just because they produced bone tools. The fact that similar objects are found in the Aurignacian should not be automatically considered, as it has in the past, as proof that Neandertals were acculturated by Aurignacian moderns. This interpretation, not supported by the archaeological record, is based on the assumption that technocomplexes such the Châtelperronian and the Uluzzian are contemporary with the first Aurignacians or even that they developed after the arrival of AMH. This contemporaneity, however, neither seems demonstrated by the stratigraphic, nor by the radiocarbon evidence. The Buran-Kaya III stratigraphic pattern, with a thick Kiik-Koba Middle Palaeolithic assemblage separating the Aurignacian from the level which has yielded the worked bones, provides further corroboration that, if made by Neandertals, level C worked bones might represent the material expression of an independent cultural development of Eastern European late Neandertals...|$|R

Sandblasted concrete with a heavy aggregate content has an appearance similar to rough granite, and is often used as a substitute when use of real granite is impractical.

Granite block is usually processed into slabs, which can be cut and <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> a <b>cutting</b> center.

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} problem of {{describing}} the mean object for a set of planar shapes in the case that the considered dissimilarity measures are semi-metrics, i. e. in the case that the triangle inequality is generally not fulfilled. To this end, a matching of two planar <b>shapes</b> is computed <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> an appropriately defined graph the edge weights of which encode the local similarity of respective contour parts on either shape. The cost of the minimum cut can be interpreted as a semi-metric on the space of planar shapes. Subsequently, we introduce the notion of a mean shape for the case of semi-metrics and show that this allows to perform a shape retrieval which mimics human notions of shape similarity. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrodes}} of today's lithium-ion {{cells are}} produced as a compound made of copper or aluminium foil several micrometres thick. This film {{functions as a}} conductor and is coated {{on both sides with}} an active material with the capacity to store energy. In battery production, <b>shaping</b> <b>by</b> shear <b>cutting</b> of these planar electrodes is an essential stage in the process chain. However, advanced techniques established in mass production, such as laser cutting and water jet cutting, are not always suitable for the manufacturing process particularly in case of avoiding thermal and chemical impact on the composite material. Conventional shear cutting (fine shear cutting) is also problematic, since the very thin film makes for very tight clearances. One way to circumvent the problems in shear cutting described above results from superposing the punch with vibrations. In the example described in the paper, frequencies from 20 to 40 kHz at vibration amplitudes greater than 3 ?m were used. It was recognised that superposition of vibrations enhances breakage at the cutting edge and, consequently, reduces formation of flash on the electrode contour...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an interactive computer program, called “KiriSim”, which allows manipulation of a virtual paper for modeling purposes. KiriSim is primarily designed and developed for modeling leaf <b>shapes</b> <b>by</b> folding and <b>cutting</b> a simulated sheet of paper. In many plants, leaves grow folded inside the bud, where the final {{shape of the}} leaf {{is affected by the}} way it is folded within the bud. Inspired by this observation, the final shape of the leaf can be modeled by folding a sheet of paper properly, and cutting it along a curve delimiting the leaf’s margin [14]. Consequently, KiriSim is used to explore the strong points and shortcomings of modeling leaf shapes with kirigami (the art of making models with folding and cutting paper). Aside from its application for modeling leaf shapes, KiriSim can be used to simulate and visualize some origami and kirigami models by manipulating a virtual paper, such as origami frogs and butterflies.

40|$|In {{this work}} we use Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{to study the}} phase behavior of spherical caps confined between two parallel hard walls separated by a distance H. The particle model consists of a hard sphere of diameter σ cut off by a plane at a height χ, and it is loosely based on mushroom cap-shaped particles whose phase behavior was recently studied experimentally [E. K. Riley and C. M. Liddell, Langmuir, 26, 11648 (2010) ]. The geometry of the particles {{is characterized by the}} reduced height χ^* = χ/σ, such that the model extrapolates between hard spheres for χ^* ← 1 and infinitely thin hard platelets for χ^* 0. Three different particle shapes are investigated: (a) three-quarter height spherical caps (χ^* = 3 / 4), (b) one-half height spherical caps or hemispheres (χ^* = 1 / 2), and (c) one-quarter height spherical caps (χ^* = 1 / 4). These three models are used to rationalize the effect of particle <b>shape,</b> obtained <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> off spheres at different heights, on the entropy-driven self-assembly of the particles under strong confinements; i. e., for 1 < H/χ < 2. 5. As H is varied, a sequence of crystal structures are observed, including some having similar symmetry as that of the structures observed in confined hard spheres on account of the remaining spherical surface in the particles, but with additional features on account of the particle shapes having intrinsic anisotropy and orientational degrees of freedom. The χ^* = 3 / 4 system is found to exhibit a phase diagram that is most similar to the one obtained experimentally for the confined mushroom cap-shaped colloidal particles under. A qualitative global phase diagram is constructed that helps reveal the interrelations among different phases for all the particle shapes and confinements studied.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{latitudinal}} body size clines can illuminate processes of local adaptation, {{but there is}} a need for an increased understanding of the relative roles of genetic variation, environmental effectstions or this reason, we combined an investigation of a museum collection of the common blue butterfly Polyommatus icarus (Rottemburg) (Lycaenidae: Polyommatini) from Sweden with a common-garden experiment in the laboratory, using strains reared from individuals collected from three different latitudes. Sizes of the field-collected butterflies tended to smoothly decrease northwards in a latitudinal cline, but suddenly increase at the latitude where the life cycle changes from two to one generations per year, hence allowing more time for this single generation. Further north, the size of the field-collected butterflies again decreased with latitude (with the exception of the northernmost collection sites). This is in accordance with the “converse Bergmann” pattern and with the “saw-tooth model” suggesting that insect size is <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> season length and number of generations along latitudinal transects. In contrast, under laboratory conditions with a constant long day-length there was a different pattern, with the butterflies pupating at a higher mass when individuals originated from southern populations under time stress to achieve a second generation. This is indirect evidence for field patterns being <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> end-of-season cues <b>cutting</b> development short, and also suggests counter-gradient variation, as butterflies from the time-stressed populations over-compensated for decreasing larval development time by increasing their growth rates, thus obtaining higher mass. Hence, we found support for both adaptive phenotypic plasticity and local genetic adaptation, with gene-environment interactions explaining the observed field patterns...|$|R
