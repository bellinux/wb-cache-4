25|$|When a {{space is}} needed, the {{operator}} touches the <b>spaceband</b> lever {{just to the}} left of the keyboard. This releases a <b>spaceband</b> from the <b>spaceband</b> box. Spacebands are stored separately from the matrices because they are too big to fit in the magazine.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} size, spacebands are not {{held in the}} magazine, but in a <b>spaceband</b> box and {{released}} {{one at a time}} by pressing the <b>spaceband</b> lever at the left edge of the keyboard.|$|E
25|$|In {{justified}} text, {{the spaces}} are not fixed width; they expand {{to make all}} lines equal in width. In linotype machines this is done by spacebands. A <b>spaceband</b> consists of two wedges, one similar in size and shape to a type matrix, one with a long tail. The wide part of the wedge {{is at the bottom}} of the tail, so pushing the tail up expands the <b>spaceband.</b>|$|E

25|$|Justification {{is done by}} a {{spring-loaded}} ram (5) {{which raises}} the tails of the <b>spacebands,</b> unless the machine was equipped with a Star Parts automatic hydraulic quadding attachment or Linotype hydraquadder.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Diagram of the {{justification}} process. The composed line is locked {{up between the}} jaws (1 and 2) of the vise. The justification ram (5) then moves up to expand the <b>spacebands</b> to fill {{the space between the}} vise jaws.|$|R
25|$|After casting is completed, the {{matrices}} {{are pushed}} to the second elevator which raises them to the distributor {{at the top of}} the magazine. The space bands are separated out at this point and are returned to the <b>spaceband</b> box.|$|E
25|$|The {{linotype}} keyboard has {{the same}} alphabet arrangement given twice, once for lower-case letters, the keys in black, {{on the left side}} of the keyboard, and once for upper-case letters, the keys in white, located on the right side of the keyboard. The blue keys in the middle are punctuation, digits, small capital letters and fixed-width spaces. In proper keyboard operation, an experienced operator's left hand operates only the <b>spaceband</b> key and the left column of keys. The operator's right hand strokes the remaining keys on the entire keyboard.|$|E
25|$|Matrices {{released}} from the magazine, and spacebands {{released from}} the <b>spaceband</b> box, drop down into the assembler. This is a rail that holds the matrices and spacebands, with a jaw on the left end set to the desired line width. When the operator judges that the line is close enough to full, he raises the casting lever {{on the bottom of}} the keyboard to send the line to the casting section of the linotype machine. The remaining processing for that line is automatic; as soon as the finished line has been transferred to the casting section, the operator can begin composing the next line of text.|$|E
5000|$|Klempen is a {{constructed}} {{word from}} the German plenken (meaning [...] "to add inappropriate spaces", itself a borrowing from the English blank) and klemmen ("to wedge", possibly a reference to Linotype machine operators' slang term wedges for the <b>spacebands</b> used to implement justified spacing), exchanging the K and P {{in such a way}} as to suggest both phonetically and orthographically its relationship and opposite meaning.|$|R
25|$|From the assembler, the {{assembled}} line moves via the first {{elevator to the}} justification vise. The vise has two jaws (1 and 2 in the illustration) which are set to the desired line width. The <b>spacebands</b> are now expanded to justify the line. When the line is justified, the matrices fit tightly between the vise jaws, forming a tight seal which will prevent the molten type metal from escaping when the line is cast.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pattern of}} teeth is a 7-bit binary code, with the {{innermost}} pair of teeth {{at the bottom}} of the notch being the most significant bit. The codes count up from the left side of the main magazine. [...] Code0 (no teeth) is for <b>spacebands,</b> which are not carried up to the distributor. Code1 is skipped (no reason for this is given in the Linotype manual). Codes2 through 92 are for the 91-channel main magazine, and the codes above that are for the auxiliary magazine, if one is installed on the machine. The widest auxiliary magazine has 34channels, so its rightmost channel is code125. Code 126 is unused.|$|R

2500|$|If the {{operator}} did not assemble enough characters, the line will not justify correctly: {{even with the}} <b>spacebands</b> expanded all the way, the matrices are not tight. A safety mechanism in the justification vise detects this and blocks the casting operation. Without such a mechanism, {{the result would be}} a squirt of molten type metal spraying out through the gaps between the matrices, creating a time consuming mess and a possible hazard to {{the operator}}. If a squirt did occur, it was generally up to the operator to grab the hell bucket and catch the flowing lead. It was so called because the bucket would often [...] "go to hell", or melt, while holding the molten lead that was still extremely hot. Also, in conjunction with possible hazards facing an operator, toxic lead fumes were possible, as they were the result of melting the lead ingots for casting.|$|R
