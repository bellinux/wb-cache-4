25|$|VLDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.880–0.915nbsp&g/cm3. VLDPE is a {{substantially}} linear polymer {{with high levels of}} short-chain branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene). VLDPE is most commonly produced using metallocene catalysts due to the greater co-monomer incorporation exhibited by these catalysts. VLDPEs are used for hose and tubing, ice and frozen food bags, food packaging and <b>stretch</b> <b>wrap</b> as well as impact modifiers when blended with other polymers.|$|E

25|$|Costco has a {{wide variety}} of {{changing}} inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products. Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the <b>stretch</b> <b>wrap</b> off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages. The produce items that require refrigeration are kept in a walk-in refrigerator, and several locations even have a walk-in refrigerator for dairy items.|$|E

A load is placed on a turntable, which rotates relative to the film roll, which is housed in a carriage attached to a vertical [...] "mast" [...] on which it may move up and down. In the simplest turntable systems, stretch is achieved by rotating the load at a speed in which the take-up demand on the load surface is faster than {{the rate at which}} the film is allowed to be fed, being limited by a brake system.|$|R
