40|$|Following {{a request}} from European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety of <b>synthetic</b> <b>lycopene</b> {{for use as a}} novel food ingredient taking into account the various EFSA opinions on all forms and proposed uses of lycopene. The applicant proposes to use <b>synthetic</b> <b>lycopene</b> both as a food supplement and as a food ingredient. The novel food ingredient consists of synthetic (crystalline) lycopene to be marketed in three different formulations. These are lycopene 10 %, lycopene 10 cold water dispersion (CWD) and lycopene dispersion 20 %. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>lycopene</b> is suggested by the applicant to be used in food supplements at levels of 8 or 15 mg/dosing, in beverages and dairy products at levels of up to 2. 5 mg/ 100 g, in breakfast cereals up to 4 mg/ 100 g, in cereal bars up to 8 mg/ 100 g, in fats and dressings up to 4 mg/ 100 g and in dietary foods for special medical purposes at levels in accordance with the particular requirements of the person for whom the products are intended. The applicant provides an intake estimate of lycopene based on three sources including 1) normal dietary intake from food, 2) intake from dietary supplements and 3) intake fro...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the Commission, the Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety in use of <b>synthetic</b> <b>lycopene</b> as a food colour {{for use in the}} food categories specified in the dossier. The Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food has also been asked to evaluate the safety in use of lycopene from Blakeslea trispora as a food colour in the food categories and use levels as proposed in the dossier. In addition, in view of the re-evaluation of lycopene from tomatoes within the re-evaluation programme of all food colours, the Panel decided to make a global safety assessment of lycopene from all sources. Thus, in the present opinion the Panel evaluates the safety in use of lycopene from different sources as a food colour. Results from animal and human intervention studies with <b>synthetic</b> <b>lycopene</b> or tomato extract as lycopene source indicate that lycopene from these sources is bioavailable. It is expected that lycopene from B. trispora when used in foodstuffs of comparable composition will be bioavailable to a similar extent as lycopene from tomatoes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bioavailability {{studies with}} {{lycopene}} {{have focused on}} natural sources. A synthetic source has recently become available. Aim of the study: To determine the relative bioavailabilities of <b>synthetic</b> and tomato-based <b>lycopene</b> in free living volunteers in a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial. Methods: Three groups (n = 12 /group) of healthy, normolipemic male and female subjects with a mean baseline serum lycopene concentration of 0. 36 μmol/L took a dose of 15 mg/day total lycopene for 28 days from either Lycovit 10 % (beadlets, BASF, Germany) or Lyc-O-Mato (beads, LycoRed Natural Products, Israel) or a placebo (without lycopene) together with the main meal. The increase in serum lycopene from baseline {{was used as the}} parameter of bioavailability. Results: Synthetic and tomato-lycopene resulted in significant increases above baseline of serum total lycopene by 0. 58 and 0. 57 μmol/L, trans-lycopene by 0. 34 and 0. 41 μmol/L, and total-cis-lycopene by 0. 24 and 0. 16 μmol/L, whereas no significant changes were found in the placebo treatment. The mean serum total <b>lycopene</b> response to <b>synthetic</b> and natural <b>lycopene</b> was not significantly different. Neither lycopene source affected the other serum carotenoids, viz. α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin and lutein. Conclusion: We conclude that <b>synthetic</b> and natural <b>lycopene</b> are equivalent sources of lycopene and that there is no interaction with other circulating carotenoids...|$|R
40|$|Background: Accurate {{interpretation}} of quantitative PCR (qPCR) data requires normalization using constitutively expressed reference genes. Ribosomal RNA {{is often used}} as a reference gene for transcriptional studies in E. coli. However, the choice of reliable reference genes has not been systematically validated. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify a set of reliable reference genes for transcription analysis in recombinant protein over-expression studies in E. coli. Results: In this study, the meta-analysis of 240 sets of single-channel Affymetrix microarray data representing over-expressions of 63 distinct recombinant proteins in various E. coli strains identified twenty candidate reference genes that were stably expressed across all conditions. The expression of these twenty genes and two commonly used reference genes, rrsA encoding ribosomal RNA 16 S and ihfB, was quantified by qPCR in E. coli cells over-expressing four genes of the 1 -Deoxy-D-Xylulose 5 -Phosphate pathway. From these results, two independent statistical algorithms identified three novel reference genes cysG, hcaT, and idnT but not rrsA and ihfB as highly invariant in two E. coli strains, across different growth temperatures and induction conditions. Transcriptomic data normalized by the geometric average of these three genes demonstrated that genes of the <b>lycopene</b> <b>synthetic</b> pathway maintained steady expression upon enzyme overexpression. In contrast, the use of rrsA or ihfB as reference genes led to the mis-interpretation that lycopene pathway genes were regulated during enzyme over-expression. Conclusion: This study identified cysG/hcaT/idnT to be reliable novel reference genes for transcription analysis in recombinant protein producing E. coli. Singapore-MIT Allianc...|$|R
30|$|The {{efficiency}} of multi-gene expression systems is mainly affected by promoters, transcription factors, and translation levels. Nevertheless, the gene order is also important. Within an operon, the transcription {{efficiency of}} a gene decreases as its position {{moves away from the}} promoter. The expression {{of a gene}} at the first position is therefore higher than that of an identical gene at the second position, which should be higher than that of an identical gene at the third position, and so on (Han et al. 2011). A novel approach for metabolic pathway optimization, oligo-linker mediated assembly (OLMA), was applied in the <b>lycopene</b> <b>synthetic</b> pathway to swap the order of crtE, crtB and crtI, which led to selection of the best strain EBI, the lycopene yield of which was 36 times higher than that of the least productive strain IEB (Zhang et al. 2015 a). In our study, the productivity of strain IEB was 3 times higher than that of the least productive strain BEI, which suggested that the order of genes had a great influence on lycopene synthesis. An improper gene order can result in a severe imbalance in the pathway, which in turn affects the product yield. Through sequential control of the downstream, upstream, and competing pathways of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) via a predetermined order of key genes in the crucial metabolic node in the biosynthesis of terpenoids, a carotenoid production of 1156  mg L− 1 (20.79  mg g− 1 DCW) was achieved (Xie et al. 2015). These strategies indicate that multi-gene expression requires the orderly arrangement of genes to balance their translation levels. Combined with the size and expression of enzymes, a high level of synergy is needed to achieve higher yields.|$|R
