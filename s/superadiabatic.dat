In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as provided by the <b>superadiabatic</b> theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed up the adiabatic quantum behavior. In this dissertation we introduce two different models to perform universal <b>superadiabatic</b> quantum computing, which are based on the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. The first model is based on the use of <b>superadiabatic</b> quantum teleportation, introduced in this dissertation, as a primitive to quantum computing. Thus, we provide the counter-diabatic driving for arbitrary n-qubit gates. In addition, our approach maps the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an arbitrary n-qubit gate teleportation into the implementation of a rotated counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an n-qubit state teleportation. In the second model we use the concept of controlled <b>superadiabatic</b> evolutions to show how we can implement arbitrary n-controlled quantum gates. Remarkably, this task can be performed by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. These two models can be used to design different sets of universal quantum gates. We show that the use of the quantum speed limit suggests that the <b>superadiabatic</b> time {{evolution is}} compatible with arbitrarily small time intervals, where this arbitrariness is constrained to the energetic cost necessary to perform the <b>superadiabatic</b> evolution.

We show that changing the metallicity alters properties of the convective gas dynamics, {{and the structure of}} the <b>superadiabatic</b> layer and atmosphere. Our grid of simulations show that the amount of superadiabaticity, which tracks the transition from efficient to inefficient convection, is sensitive to changes in metallicity. We find that increasing the metallicity forces the location of the transition region to lower densities and pressures, and results in larger mean and turbulent velocities throughout the <b>superadiabatic</b> region.

40|$|A TMOSPHERIC {{conditions}} in which the air has a vertical temperature strati- fication such that portions tend to rise and become turbulent, are frequently observed in temperate climates. These turbulent conditions, in which the atmosphere {{is said to have}} an unstable or <b>superadiabatic</b> temperature gradient are commonly caused by solar heating of the earth's surface and the transfer of some of the earth's heat to ' the atmosphere. Such conditions produce the vertical transport of moisture evidenced by cumulus clouds. Although the Arctic is generally characterized by a stable or quiescent atmospheric structure, unstable conditions 1 as shown by <b>superadiabatic</b> temperature gradients do occur. They were recorded during a field obser-vational program a t Eielson Air Force Base, near Fairbanks, Alaska.

Although these turbulent or <b>superadiabatic</b> situations are much less frequent during the arctic winter than are inversions or stable conditions, they appear to be important in some arctic weather situations, of which ice fog is one example.

The chemical mechanism of this phenomenon has not been systematically studied. In this paper, the structure of planar freely propagating premixed flames of mixtures of CH 4 /air, CH 4 /O 2, C 2 H 2 /H 2 /O 2, C 2 H 4 /O 2, C 3 H 8 /O 2 and H 2 /O 2 was computed using detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties to gain an insight into the common chemical mechanism responsible for this phenomenon in these flames. It was found that <b>superadiabatic</b> temperatures occur only in hydrocarbon flames when the equivalence ratio of the mixture is greater than a critical value, but not in hydrogen flames. The <b>superadiabatic</b> temperature in these hydrocarbon flames is associated with superequilibrium concentrations of some hydrocarbon species and H 2 O, and with negative heat production rates {{at the end of}} main heat release reactions. The net negative heat production is caused by the endothermic dissociation reactions of these superequilibrium larger hydrocarbon molecules into smaller ones and of H 2 O into H 2 and OH. In hydrogen flames, neither the concentration of H 2 O nor the flame temperature exceeds their superequilibrium level.
