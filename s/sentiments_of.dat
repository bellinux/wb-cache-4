5|$|Madgulkar did {{not make}} any attempt to provide new {{interpretation}} or meaning to the Ramayana but told the same story in the simpler and poetic format. With inclusion of characters like Ahalya and Shabari, he included the <b>sentiments</b> <b>of</b> religious devotion (Bhakti) and also gave divine touch to the story while describing the marriage of Sita and Rama as a union of Maya and Brahman. He composed songs on all seven chapters or Kāṇḍa of Ramayana. Out of 56 songs, poet composed twelve songs on Balakanda, seven on Ayodhya Kanda, fourteen on Aranya Kanda, three on Kishkindha Kanda, four on Sundara Kanda, twelve on Yuddha Kanda and three on Uttara Kanda.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasid–Saffarid {{partnership}} in Iran was most clearly expressed in their joint effort against the general Rafi ibn Harthama, {{who had made}} his base in Rayy and posed a threat to both caliphal and Saffarid interests in the region. Al-Mu'tadid sent Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz to seize Rayy from Rafi, who fled and made common cause with the Zaydis of Tabaristan {{in an effort to}} seize Khurasan from the Saffarids. However, with Amr mobilizing the anti-Alid <b>sentiments</b> <b>of</b> the populace against him and the expected assistance from the Zaydis failing to materialize, Rafi was defeated and killed in Khwarazm in 896. Amr, now at the pinnacle of his power, sent the defeated rebel's head to Baghdad, and in 897 the Caliph transferred control of Rayy to him. The partnership finally collapsed after Mu'tadid appointed the Saffarid ruler Amr ibn al-Layth in 898 as governor of Transoxiana, which was ruled by his rivals, the Samanids. Al-Mu'tamid deliberately encouraged Amr to confront the Samanids, only for Amr to be crushingly defeated and taken prisoner by the latter in 900. The Samanid ruler, Isma'il ibn Ahmad, sent him in chains to Baghdad, where he was executed in 902, after al-Mu'tadid's death. Al-Mu'tadid in turn conferred Amr's titles and governorships to Isma'il ibn Ahmad. The Caliph also moved to regain Fars and Kirman, but the Saffarid remnant under Tahir proved sufficiently resilient to thwart the Abbasid attempts at capturing these two provinces for several years. It was not until 910 that the Abbasids managed to regain the coveted Fars province.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} of the meic Somairle to establish the Benedictines on Iona completely contrasted the ecclesiastical actions of Somairle himself, and provoked a prompt and violent response from Colum Cille's familia. According to the Annals of Ulster, after Cellach, Abbot of Iona built the new monastery in 1204, a large force of Irishmen, led by the Bishops of Tyrone and Tirconell and the Abbots of Derry and Inishowen, made landfall on Iona and burnt the new buildings to the ground. The <b>sentiments</b> <b>of</b> the familia may well be preserved in a contemporary poem which portrays Colum Cille lamenting the violation of his rights, and cursing the meic Somairle. Unfortunately for the familia, the Benedictine presence on Iona was there to stay, and the old monastery of Colum Cille was nearly obliterated by the new monastery. Somairle's attempt to revive Iona brought him into conflict with secular and ecclesiastical power in northern Ireland. If Ragnall was indeed responsible for {{the foundation of the}} Benedictine monastery about four decades afterwards, it may indicate that he was following in his father's footsteps, and asserting himself as a king in the Isles.|$|E

30|$|The <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} communities {{regarding a}} specific topic is calculated as follows. First, for each community, the tweets posted by its users are selected. Second, the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> each tweet is determined and weighted by its retweet count. Third, the weighted {{negative and positive}} <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> tweets is aggregated for each user and summed over all users in the community. Finally, the leaning of a community towards a specific topic is computed as the polarity of the aggregated weighted sentiment multiplied by the ratio <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> carrying tweets (subjectivity) of the respective community. The polarity and subjectivity measures are adapted from [29]. The pseudo-code for community sentiment computation is presented in Algorithm 1.|$|R

40|$|Negation words, such as no and not, play a {{fundamental}} role in modifying <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> textual expressions. We will {{refer to a}} negation word as the negator and the text span within the scope of the negator as the argument. Commonly used heuristics to estimate the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> negated expressions rely simply on the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> argument (and not on the negator or the argument itself). We use a sentiment treebank to show that these existing heuristics are poor estimators <b>of</b> <b>sentiment.</b> We then modify these heuristics to be dependent on the negators and show that this improves prediction. Next, we evaluate a recently proposed composition model (Socher et al., 2013) that relies on both the negator and the argument. This model learns the syntax and semantics of the negator's argument with a recursive neural network. We show that this approach performs better than those mentioned above. In addition, we explicitly incorporate the prior <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> the argument and observe that this information can help reduce fitting errors. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
