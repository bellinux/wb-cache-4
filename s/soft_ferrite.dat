5000|$|Dual-phase steel (DP steel) is a {{high-strength}} steel {{that has a}} ferritic-martensitic microstructure.DP steels are produced from low or medium carbon steels that are quenched from a temperature above A1 but below A3 determined from continuous cooling transformation diagram.This results in a microstructure consisting of a <b>soft</b> <b>ferrite</b> matrix containing islands of martensite as the secondary phase (martensite increases the tensile strength).Therefore, the overall behavior of DP steels is governed by the volume fraction, morpology (size, aspect ratio, interconnectivity, etc.), the grain size and the carbon content.For achieving these microstructures, DP steels typically contain 0.06-0.15 wt.% C and 1.5-3% Mn (the former strengthens the martensite, and the latter causes solid solution strengthening in ferrite, while both stabilize the austenite), Cr & Mo (to retard pearlite or bainite formation), Si (to promote ferrite transformation), V and Nb (for precipitation strengthening and microstructure refinement).The desire to produce high strength steels with formability greater than microalloyed steel led the development of DP steels in the 1970s.|$|E

30|$|<b>Soft</b> {{magnetic}} <b>ferrites</b> {{have attracted}} much attention in recent years because they have large saturation magnetization (Ms), low electrical conductivity, and excellent chemical stabilities [1, 2] {{and can be used}} as ferrofluids [3], in magnetic resonance imaging [4], and in microwave devices [5, 6]. Furthermore, nanoscale <b>soft</b> magnetic <b>ferrites</b> exhibit special magnetic-like, magneto-resistive, and magneto-optical properties compared with bulk magnetic materials [7]. Because the surface-to-volume ratio becomes very large with the reduction of the particle size at nanoscale, they are potentially useful for a broad range of applications. <b>Soft</b> magnetic <b>ferrites</b> have a potential application in electronic devices when used in the gigahertz (GHz) range. This is because in this frequency region, magnetic metals exhibit strong eddy current loss [8] compared to <b>soft</b> magnetic <b>ferrites</b> [9, 10]. For <b>soft</b> magnetic <b>ferrites,</b> there is magnetic resonance, resulting in magnetic losses. This provides some limitations (like threshold frequency) of the application. Nakamura [11] and Tsutaoka et al. [12] reported that the resonance frequency of bulk <b>soft</b> magnetic <b>ferrites</b> is much lower than 1 GHz. It seems to be an urgent issue to improve the resonance frequency of <b>soft</b> magnetic <b>ferrites.</b> Guo et al. reported that Ni-Zn ferrite thin films exhibit much higher natural resonance frequency, thanks to bianisotropy [13]. There is strong surface anisotropy in ferrite nanoparticles (NPs), which has been reported before [14 – 16]. Owing to this surface anisotropy, ferrite NPs will likely show high resonance frequency. NiFe 2 O 4 is a typical <b>soft</b> magnetic <b>ferrite</b> with high electrical resistivity [17], and it is an inverse spinel with metal ions occupying the octahedral and tetrahedral sites. The magnetic moments placed in the tetrahedral site and octahedral site couple in an antiparallel manner by a superexchange interaction which is mediated through adjacent oxygen atoms and forms a collinear ferrimagnetic ordering. Additionally, the magnetic behaviors of nanoscale NiFe 2 O 4 are extremely sensitive to their size [18]. There is already a significant interest in synthesizing NiFe 2 O 4 NPs for achieving optimal magnetic properties [19 – 21]. In this work, NiFe 2 O 4 NPs were prepared using the sol–gel method. The morphology, structure, and magnetic characterization of the NiFe 2 O 4 NPs have been systemically investigated. Importantly, an adjustable magnetic resonance has been observed in the GHz range, implying that NiFe 2 O 4 is a candidate for microwave devices in the GHz range.|$|R
