At last Saavedra was convinced that López de Salcedo had been authorised directly by the crown, and allowed him to come ashore.|$|E

Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a <b>standoff</b> <b>with</b> the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers.

Charges of war crimes were brought against seven soldiers of the brigade, specifying that they executed Korade's orders to kill one VRS prisoner and one unknown man {{in the village of}} Halapić near Glamoč, and four VRS prisoners in the village of Mlinište. Five defendants were convicted and the remaining two acquitted in October 2011.

5|$|The chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic {{training}} for the U.S. Army. Michael Fortier, McVeigh's accomplice, was his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <b>standoff</b> <b>with</b> Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge {{as well as the}} Waco siege—a 1993 51-day standoff between the FBI and Branch Davidian members which began with a botched ATF attempt to execute a search warrant leading to a fire fight (it is unknown whether ATF agents or Branch Davidians fired the first shot) and ended with the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and then again after its conclusion. McVeigh later decided to bomb a federal building {{as a response to the}} raids.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. In {{the middle}} of the month, President George H. W.

On 7 August, Wisconsin and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for Operation Desert Shield, and they arrived in the Persian Gulf on 23 August. On 15 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced operations, and Wisconsin found herself serving alongside her younger sister Missouri, just as she had done in Korea forty years previously. Both Wisconsin and Missouri launched Tomahawk Missile attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. Wisconsin served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. Wisconsin also assumed the responsibility of the local anti-surface warfare coordinator for the Northern Persian Gulf Surface Action Group.|$|E

50|$|In 1849, Drummond {{accompanied}} an overland {{party to}} the Champion Bay district, where a small mining settlement was being formed. He helped to handle a number of delicate and dangerous <b>standoffs</b> <b>with</b> the local indigenous tribe, and his return to Toodyay was greatly regretted. On returning to Toodyay, Drummond found himself constantly quarrelling with the newly appointed Protector of the Natives at York, Walkinshaw Cowan, who accused him of leaving his district while on duty. These accusations were probably correct, as Drummond was courting Mary Eliza Shaw of Guildford at the time. In April 1850, a court of inquiry was held at York to enquire into Cowan's complaints against Drummond. The inquiry was eventually closed without any findings, and shortly afterwards the problem was solved by transferring Drummond to Champion Bay as First Constable of the newly established police force there.|$|R

They understand what they got involved in only after they find themselves in the middle of some action." [...] However, Vyacheslav Veremiy, a Vesti Reporter (Вести. Репортер) journalist traveling to Euromaidan, was pulled out of his car by a Titushky squad and shot to death point-blank from a concealed gun, indicating more than just a happenstance action. Veremiy's killing was confirmed on Wednesday 19 February 2014 at 6.45 am.|$|R

50|$|According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies {{numerous}} large-scale land {{disputes and}} <b>standoffs</b> <b>with</b> officials over land have erupted in Vietnam in recent years, {{and the number}} of incidents appears to have increased since the beginning of 2012. Land in Vietnam is the property of the people (or government), and there is no legal concept of private land ownership. Under the country’s 1992 Constitution, the government is responsible for the allocation of land to individuals and organizations and allows land users to transfer land use rights. Seventy percent of complaints filed nationwide against the government and officials are related to land. Under current law, after the government approves a new development project, district-level officials have the authority to use coercive measures to clear a site if users of the land refuse to relocate at any cost. As a result, there have been a string of cases of forced evictions, especially in rural areas.|$|R
