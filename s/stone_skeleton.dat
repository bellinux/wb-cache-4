50|$|Stone {{mastic asphalt}} (SMA), also called stone-matrix asphalt, was {{developed}} in Germany in the 1960s. It provides a deformation-resistant, durable surfacing material, suitable for heavily trafficked roads. SMA has found use in Europe, Australia, the United States, and Canada as a durable asphalt surfacing option for residential streets and highways. SMA has a high coarse aggregate content that interlocks to form a <b>stone</b> <b>skeleton</b> that resists permanent deformation. The <b>stone</b> <b>skeleton</b> is filled with a mastic of bitumen and filler to which fibres are added to provide adequate stability of bitumen and to prevent drainage of binder during transport and placement. Typical SMA composition consists of 70−80% coarse aggregate, 8−12% filler, 6.0−7.0% binder, and 0.3 per cent fibre.|$|E

50|$|The {{deformation}} resistant {{capacity of}} SMA {{stems from a}} coarse <b>stone</b> <b>skeleton</b> providing more stone-on-stone contact than with conventional dense graded asphalt (DGA) mixes (see above picture). Improved binder durability {{is a result of}} higher bitumen content, a thicker bitumen film, and lower air voids content. This high bitumen content also improves flexibility. Addition of a small quantity of cellulose or mineral fibre prevents drainage of bitumen during transport and placement. There are no precise design guidelines for SMA mixes available in Europe. The essential features, which are the coarse aggregate skeleton and mastic composition, and the consequent surface texture and mixture stability, are largely determined by the selection of aggregate grading and the type and proportion of filler and binder. In the US, detailed mix design guidelines have been developed for SMA and published by the US National Asphalt Pavement Association in their Quality Improvement Publication QIP 122 as given in the references.|$|E
5000|$|Shusha's Armenian {{minority}} {{was expelled}} from the city when the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict began in February 1988. The cathedral was turned into an armory. According to Armenian political analyst Levon Melik-Shahnazaryan the cathedral was set to fire three times between 1988 and 1991 using car tires. Azerbaijanis dismantled the stone statues of angels on the bell tower in 1989. They reportedly sold off its bronze bell, which was later found in a market in Donetsk, Ukraine and was bought by an Armenian officer for 3 million rubles and sent it back to Armenia. When Shusha was captured by Armenian forces on May 9, 1992, it {{was a turning point}} of the war. Prior to the fall of Shusha, Azerbaijani forces stored hundreds of boxes of Grad missiles as the cathedral was safe from potential Armenian bombardment. Shusha was used as a base for shelling of Stepanakert, the largest city of Karabakh, with Grad launchers for several months. Armenian volunteers, including noted activist Igor Muradyan, carried the wooden boxes of artillery and rocket shells out of the church immediately after the capture of the city. The flag of Armenia was raised on top of the damaged dome by Armenian troops. Melik-Shahnazaryan wrote that by the time of its capture [...] "practically, only a <b>stone</b> <b>skeleton</b> had remained of the magnificent structure." [...] Its [...] "windows were missing but the interior was in reasonable condition," [...] noted one foreign visitor.|$|E
5000|$|Mighty Ray (voiced by Ian James Corlett) - Classified as 025, Mighty Ray is {{a warrior}} of First Squad. Mighty Ray {{was once a}} member of Mr. No Hands' giant foosball team. They were playing a match, but it was {{postponed}} as HighRoller, the Zebra Brothers, Bear Stomp {{and some of the}} toughest animal kings attacked the stadium. Mighty Ray defeated the animal kings, but the Zebra Brothers used their ghost lanterns to turn Mighty Ray's eyes to stone. Mr. No Hands took Mighty Ray to a temple where Commander ApeTrully took Mighty Ray to see a giant <b>stone</b> <b>skeleton</b> monkey, who traded his own eyes for Mighty Ray's eyes. He has the power to shoot electrical bolts of energy from his eyeballs. To recharge his eyeballs, Mighty Ray must eat more bananas which he dislikes. The reason Mighty Ray dislikes bananas is because when he first tried out his magical electrical eyeballs, he figured that the more bananas Mighty Ray eats at once, the more powerful his eyes get. But when Mighty Ray tried to defeat HighRoller (for payback on turning his original eyes to stone), Mighty Ray ate too many bananas, which overloaded his eyeballs causing bolts of electricity to fire every where. ApeTrully said Mighty Ray was lucky he didn't go blind. He can also form a giant eyeball and emit sonic waves to confuse his enemy as seen in [...] "Rabbit Castle". His eyeballs are also removable. He is able to change the properties of the lightning by pressing on his left eye which allows him to shoot at single targets or at a whole group. Even though his energy bolts are his main attack, he is quite formidable at close range with his bare hands. He is intensely jealous of Lin Chung being praised as the finest warrior in First Squad and jumps at chances to best him. Mighty Ray also goes by the name of Mr. Comedy when performing all sorts of comedy. Mighty Ray is definitely the burly force of First Squad. More of a doer than a thinker, Mighty Ray takes great pride in being the right guy for any job even if he's actually not. However, his overzealous and sometimes inept nature can occasionally win the day. Mighty Ray enjoys loud burps, farts and bad comedy all of which are usually his own. His eyeballs can also be used as lanterns or thrown like grenades. Sometimes they pop out of his head and slide away, making them very difficult to find. Mighty Ray's signature yell is [...] "I am Mighty Ray! Fear my eyeballs!" [...] Mystique Sonia is the only member of First Squad who knows Mighty Ray is afraid of the dark as seen in [...] "Crocodile Castle". One of the symbols on his eye seems to be [...] "電" [...] or [...] "Diàn", meaning [...] "electricity". In the Chinese dub, he touches his eyeballs to charge them up to shoot instead of eating bananas. In [...] "Animals Inside", it is revealed that Mighty Ray holds the Boar Spirit when he, Lin Chung, and Mystique Sonia enter the Spirit Cave and are transformed into their inner animals. In this form, he passes himself off as the Boar King in a plot to rescue Commander ApeTrully from High Roller. Mighty Ray's boar form involves him eating bananas in order to shoot electric bolts from his tusks.|$|E

With this goal, four collapse mechanisms have been selected on account of mechanical and engineering considerations, and closed form expressions for the multipliers {{for each of them}} has been derived. Those expressions have allowed us to perform extensive parametric analyses, varying the geometrical ratios that determine the portal configuration. As a result, the ranges of the main geometrical ratios, in which one or another mechanism may prevail have been derived. An abacus is also provided to evaluate the collapse multiplier of any portal, once its geometrical characteristics are known. Finally, a simplified expression is proposed, whose results show scatters from the exact solution almost always below 6 %. Such an expression may turn out valuable for designers {{from the point of view}} of seismic vulnerability assessment...|$|E

The indirect tensile strength tests have been also performed on wet samples, in order to analyse the moisture resistance of the mixes. The positive results of the experimental investigation have demonstrated that the marginal aggregates analysed are completely suitable for totally replacing natural aggregates, for the production of foamed bitumen bound mixtures in the road construction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe pavement's {{structural}} distresses {{are linked}} to resilient and permanent deformations, which are accumulated during the pavement lifetime. The material choice for base and sub-base {{is important to have}} a good performance of the pavement. Crushed granular material particle size selection is important to decrease permanent deformation, but it is not common to practice. In order to this information, the present study aims show that the distribution of unbound granular material particle size can affect the structure of the pavement. For this purpose, two similar types of granite-gneiss crushed stone were studied in two distinct granulometric curves in specimens 10 x 20 cm by repeated triaxial loading permanent deformation tests using nine pairs of different stresses at a frequency of 1 and 2 Hz for load cycles greater than 150. 000 to predict the shakedown and the Guimarães model parameters. The different granulometric curves are similar for both materials and based on Fuller method and the Bailey method. The article shows new parameters of Guimarães model and the necessity of attention to granulometric distribution analysis of the <b>stone</b> <b>skeleton</b> for granular base and sub-base layers...|$|E

The paper describes the permanent deformation evaluation of both conventional and high performance asphalt concretes (Stone Mastic Asphalt, wearing course and binder course asphalt concretes), for motorway pavements, made using Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel slags in substitution of the natural aggregates. The experimental investigation, conducted at the University of Padova Road Research Laboratory, involved a chemical, physical, and mechanical characterization of the EAF steel slags, followed by the mix design and the permanent deformation evaluation of the asphalt concretes, by means of Repeated Load Axial Tests (RLAT) and Wheel Tracking Tests (WTT). The requisites for acceptance in the main Italian Contract Specifications were completely satisfied (Indirect Tensile Strength up to 1. 42 MPa, depending on the mixture) and the mechanical performance, in terms of permanent deformation resistance, resulted really interesting and promising. Therefore it has been experimentally verified that the EAF steel slags can be successfully recycled in the <b>stone</b> <b>skeleton</b> of the asphalt concretes investigated, moreover with extremely high content (above the 89 % and up to 93 %, on the weight of the aggregates) ...|$|E

The physical-geotechnical properties and the leaching behaviour of four different EAF steel slags have been evaluated, by means of the most relevant laboratory procedures used in the road technical sector. Hydraulic bound mixtures, characterized by the 100 % content of EAF steel slags, have been studied in terms of Proctor, compression and indirect tensile tests. The results have clarified that the four steel slags investigated present selective applicability, dependant primarily on the appropriate grading size distribution. For one of them, the associated hydraulically bound mixtures have widely met the main Italian Contract Specifications (especially, in terms of compression and indirect tensile strength at 7 days, which were equal to 3. 70 MPa and 0. 40 MPa respectively), while for other two EAF steel slags, partially satisfactory results have been achieved, but still really promising and encouraging. The investigation has demonstrated that the recycle of the EAF steel slags, in total substitution of the natural aggregates for the road foundations mixes, is feasible, but has to be carefully evaluated and designed...|$|E
40|$|Tire-road {{noise is}} a serious problem, but can be {{significantly}} reduced {{by the use of}} porous asphalt concrete. Here, the sound absorption of the porous asphalt concrete is important and can be predicted by ground impedance models. Yet, modeling porous asphalt concrete is complex, especially when nonlocal effects and scattering effects are considered. The objective of this research is to predict the sound absorption coefficient for a three-dimensional porous structure. The proposed solution is obtained using a novel modeling approach, in which the total solution of the sound field is found by combining the solutions of two subsystems: a background sound field and a scattered sound field. The background sound field contains the (analytical) solution of the sound field including the viscothermal energy dissipation inside the pores of the porous asphalt concrete. In the second subsystem, the (numerical) solution for the scattering on the rigid <b>stone</b> <b>skeleton</b> of the pavement is found. For both subsystems, we use a model containing two layers: an air layer and a viscous air layer with a certain granular structure. The main advantage of this modeling approach is the (relatively) low computation time. In this paper, the proposed modeling approach and the validation of this approach are described. The modeling approach is validated for normal incident plane waves absorbed and scattered by various structures of stacked marbles, using the impedance tube technique. This approach can be applied to predict the absorption coefficient of porous structures, like asphalt concrete roads. Moreover, it can be used as design tool to optimize the sound absorption of new road surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) {{is widely}} used {{throughout}} the world {{as one of the}} preferred asphalt surfacings. The history of use of this material dates back some 30 years ago, and like every product stone mastic asphalt needs to be modified and adapted to conform modern materials and manufacture, as well as suit the various local conditions. This dissertation develops and analyses the variances in all properties of SMA within a tropical climate. The aim is to provide background information into the history of the product and the current best practice, before moving into the specifications and requirements of the North Queensland region. The methodology will take the format of the testing of trial sections, analysing data and results, compiling details and collating information within the prioritized sections. The aim is to make definite correlations between specific criteria and then hypothesis on the possibilities. The outcome is the actual design criteria that leads to particular properties and arrive at the failure mechanisms of stone mastic asphalt. The applicability of this paper will be a document which aligns with the Government Standards for Asphalt design to either reinforce or alter current practices. The impacts of filler and binder components of the mastic are assessed on the performance of SMA. The paper develops a design method to ensure that the important features of the coarse aggregate <b>stone</b> <b>skeleton</b> are attained, providing a rut resistant long life asphalt. Analysis is provides in the combining of criteria on rut resistance and fatigue performance to arrive at a mix design shows good strength, texture and stability for use in surfacing works with heavy traffic condition. Elastic and fatigue properties are assessed by analyzing the affects of fillers, binders and temperature and the relationship between stiffness and fatigue. SMA is an unforgiving mix and requires changes and modifications to the mix design to enhance the characteristics of its performance. This is evident through the varying specifications across the State, and the North Queensland developments form a major topic within the report. Whilst SMA a premium asphalt product it is not a panacea for all pavement situations. Its use and specification requires exercising sound engineering judgment. This research will provide a rational basis for such judgment...|$|E
