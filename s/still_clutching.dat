5|$|Lieutenants Nuge and Klaus, {{the other}} two Yellow Jacket {{commanding}} officers, were also soon shot and killed. The Yellow Jackets began to fall back from the main line, retreating with the sentinels. The warriors followed the retreating unit and entered the camp. Colonel Bartholomew requested a detachment of 25 regular troops and led a bayonet charge that repulsed the warriors. During the charge Bartholomew was shot through the lower arm, breaking both bones. He was <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> his sword when he was treated hours later. For his leadership during the Battle of Tippecanoe, Bartholomew was promoted to brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|Genjurō is {{visited by}} a noblewoman and her female servant, who order several pieces of pottery {{and tell him}} to take them to the Kutsuki mansion. Genjurō learns that Nobunaga's {{soldiers}} have attacked the manor and killed all who lived there, except Lady Wakasa and her servant. He also learns that Lady Wakasa's father haunts the manor. Genjurō is seduced by Lady Wakasa, and she convinces him to marry her. Meanwhile, Nakanogō is under attack. Miyagi and her son hide from soldiers and are found by an elderly woman who hurries them to safety. In the woods, several soldiers desperately search her for food. She fights with the soldiers and is stabbed. She collapses with her son <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> her back.|$|E
25|$|As the {{creature}} attacks the crowd, Agent Yellow is released, {{which appears to}} stun {{the creature}}. Gang-du pulls Hyun-seo out of its mouth and sees her <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> Se-joo. The boy is still alive, but Hyun-seo is already dead.|$|E

25|$|Luther's brother, Dr. Jacob H. Gotwald, was {{the chief}} surgeon on board the ship Keystone State {{under the command of}} Rear-Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont in the fight at Charleston, South Carolina. His ship was {{participating}} in the blockade of Charleston Harbor, when, on January 31, 1863, a Confederate shell hit the ship's boiler causing it to explode and kill several of its crew. Jacob H. Gotwald was scalded to death while rendering surgical aid to one of the wounded men. He was found <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> the bandage.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 February 1945, Freisler was {{conducting}} a Saturday session of the People's Court when United States Army Air Forces bombers attacked Berlin. Government and Nazi Party buildings were hit, including the Reich Chancellery, the Gestapo headquarters, the Party Chancellery and the People's Court. Hearing the air-raid sirens, Freisler hastily adjourned the court and ordered that the prisoners before him be taken to an air-raid shelter, but stayed behind to gather files before leaving. A sudden direct hit on the court-building at 11.08 A.M. caused a partial internal collapse, with Freisler being crushed by a masonry column and killed while still in the courtroom. His body was found beneath the rubble <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> the files he had stopped to retrieve.|$|E
500|$|The oil {{and paint}} {{stored in the}} shop caused the fire to burn out of control, and when the fire {{services}} were eventually able to enter the premises {{the rest of the}} family were found dead. The body of Henry Chandler was found on the staircase, <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> a locked strongbox filled with the shop's takings, while the badly burnt remains of Mary Ann Chandler were found lying next to a first floor window, the body of six-year-old Henry by her side. Ayres's condition deteriorated and she died in Guy's Hospital on [...] 1885. Her last words were reported as [...] "I tried my best and could try no more". Elizabeth, the last of the children to be rescued, had suffered severe burns to her legs and died shortly after Ayres.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of the play, December 10, 1929, Caresse, Crosby's mother Henrietta Grew, and Hart Crane met for dinner before the play, but Crosby was a no-show. It was unlike him to worry Caresse needlessly. She called their friend Stanley Mortimer at his mother's apartment, whose studio Crosby was known to use for his trysts. He agreed to check his studio. Mortimer had to enlist help to break open the locked door [...] and found Crosby and Josephine's bodies. Crosby was in bed with a [...]25 caliber bullet hole in his right temple next to Josephine, who had a {{matching}} hole in her left temple, {{in what appeared to be}} a suicide pact. Crosby was <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> the Belgian automatic pistol in one hand, Josephine in the other.|$|E
2500|$|Reports {{initially}} {{stated that}} Nagai {{was hit by}} stray bullets fired by soldiers or possibly shot from the front. The [...] "stray bullet" [...] explanation was proposed {{by the government of}} Myanmar as an explanation for Nagai's death. However, video footage obtained by Japanese television appears to show a Burmese soldier shoving Nagai to the ground and shooting him at point-blank range. A still image photographed by Adrees Latif showed the soldier standing over Nagai, who was sprawled on the ground and <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> his camera. This photograph appeared {{on the front page of}} The New York Times on September 28, 2007. A subsequent shot showed Nagai's body sprawled in the street as the soldier walked away. Judging from the patch, the soldier responsible is believed to be from one of the Light Infantry Divisions (possibly LID 66) in charge of crowd control in Yangon at the time of protests. At the Japanese embassy in Myanmar, a physician established the trajectory of the fatal bullet that killed Nagai, determining that the bullet entered Nagai's chest from the lower right side and pierced his heart before exiting from his back.|$|E
2500|$|On 15–16 December 1944, Havildar Umrao Singh was a field gun {{detachment}} {{commander in}} an advanced {{section of the}} 30th Mountain Regiment, Indian Artillery, attached to the 81st West African Division. Singh's gun was in an advanced position, supporting the 8th Gold Coast Regiment. After a 90-minute sustained bombardment from 75mm guns and mortars, Singh's gun position was attacked by at least two companies of Japanese infantry. Using a Bren light machine gun he directed the rifle fire of the gunners, holding off the assault, and was wounded by two grenades. A second wave of attackers killed all but Singh and two other gunners, but was also beaten off. The three soldiers {{had only a few}} bullets remaining, and these were rapidly exhausted in the initial stages of the assault by a third wave of attackers. Undaunted, Singh picked up a [...] "gun bearer" [...] (a heavy iron rod, similar to a crow bar) and used that as a weapon in hand-to-hand fighting. He was seen to strike down three infantrymen, before succumbing to a rain of blows. Six hours later, after a counterattack, he was found alive but unconscious near to his artillery piece, almost unrecognisable from a head injury, <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> his gun bearer. Ten Japanese soldiers lay dead nearby. His field gun was back in action later that day.|$|E

6000|$|Harper {{turned and}} glared at him, but Appleby <b>still</b> <b>clutched</b> his {{shoulder}} resolutely, and his face relaxed. “Well,” he said more calmly, “I guess I’ve hurt more than the feelings of one of them. What did that fellow shove us out for, anyway?” ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>still</b> <b>clutched</b> {{the face}} of the escarpment--not with the frenzied hold of despair, but with a dogged {{determination}} {{to make the most of}} his every jot of endurance, and so give the longest possible scope to Elfride's intentions, whatever they might be.|$|R
2500|$|On March 16, 1991, a year {{prior to}} the Los Angeles riots, {{storekeeper}} Soon Ja Du physically confronted black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins by grabbing her sweater and backpack over whether the 15-year-old {{had been trying to}} steal a bottle of orange juice from Empire Liquor, the store Du's family owned in Compton. After Latasha hit Du, Du shot Latasha {{in the back of the}} head, killing her. (Security tape showed the girl, already dead, was <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> $2 in her hand when investigators arrived.) Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and forced to pay a fine of $500, but not sentenced to any prison time. As a result, relations between the African-American and Korean communities significantly worsened, and the former became increasingly mistrustful of the criminal justice system. Racial tensions had been simmering underneath the surface for several years. Many African Americans were angry toward a growing Korean merchant community in South Central Los Angeles earning a living in their communities, and felt disrespected and looked down on by many Korean merchants. Cultural differences and a language barrier further fueled tensions in an already fragile environment. [...] The probation Soon Ja Du received for killing Latasha Harlins combined with the acquittal of the four LAPD officers in Rodney King's trial resulted in the ensuing Los Angeles riots, and much of that anger was directed at Koreans.|$|E
2500|$|With Geoff Pullar {{unable to}} play Colin Cowdrey opened for England again, a role {{he did not}} relish and after making two runs he was out, mis-hitting a ball from Alan Davidson to Neil Harvey at {{backward}} short-leg, who darted forward to take it at grass height. David Sheppard became Neil Hawke's first Test wicket, catching a full blooded cover drive off his own bowling. This made England 39/2 after 108 minutes and with Ken Barrington entrenched at one end the crowd were looked to Ted Dexter to produce some excitement. The wicket was dead {{and the sky was}} clear, so there was no chance of the ball swinging and the famous Sydney Hill was becoming restless, Barrington raising his cap when he was jeered and a slow hand clap started around the ground as Dexter played himself in. This was briefly curtailed when Barrington glanced a full toss from Garth McKenzie for four and Dexter hit three fours off Bobby Simpson. Norm O'Neill caught Barrington on the pads and appealed, but no else joined in and the Englishman stayed put. Australia were running through 14-15 overs an hour, the fastest so far in the series, but with such defensive play the effort was wasted. Dexter was out after lunch edging O'Neill (1/38) to Simpson at first slip for 47 and Tom Graveney almost went the same way to Benaud. At 5:15 pm the batsmen appealed for light, but were turned down and five minutes later he glanced McKenzie (1/57) off his legs, but [...] "Harvey, anticipating, shot out his left hand; he somersaulted and momentarily stood on his head, then he rolled over and sat up, <b>still</b> <b>clutching</b> the ball." [...] Barrington usually woke up when his century was in sight, and a sweep of Simpson was dropped by Brian Booth, but a drive found its way to the boundary and a single brought up his hundred and a surprisingly generous round of applause from the stadium. He drove Benaud straight to Harvey in the covers, who bruised a finger taking his third catch, out for 101 after 320 minutes. Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus lasted until stumps, with England 195/5 after a full day's play. The second day continued in the same dull way, or perhaps worse as only three boundaries were hit between the two sides. Illingworth (27) and Titmus (34) produced, long, slow innings occasionally interrupted by drizzle before they were both caught by Wally Grout, one off Davidson and the other off Hawke (2/57). Even Fred Trueman played a subdued innings before he was caught by Harvey off Benaud for 30. Alan Smith was bowled by Simpson (1/51) and David Allen and Brian Statham finally livened things up with a last wicket stand of 28 in 35 minutes until Benaud caught Allen off Davidson (3/43). England's 321 had taken them nine and a half hours, an innings more akin to saving a lost cause than trying to win a match.|$|E

60|$|Reassured {{as to the}} mouse, Maude {{approached}} with her saucepan <b>still</b> <b>clutched</b> in her hand. There could be no doubt either as to the woman or the sleep.
