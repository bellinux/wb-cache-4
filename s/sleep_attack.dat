40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Sleep {{attacks were}} {{initially}} described in 1999 {{in patients with}} Parkinson disease (PD) treated by dopamine agonists (DAs). Because the respective role of DAs or PD-induced excessive daytime sleepiness is still unclear, reports of sleep attacks in non-PD patients treated with DA would support the specific role of these drugs. Piribedil, a nonergot dopamine D 2 /D 3 agonist with alpha(2) -noradrenergic properties, is indicated {{in the treatment of}} PD as well as in patients with circulatory disorders. After a spontaneous report of <b>sleep</b> <b>attack</b> associated with piribedil use in a non-PD patient, we reviewed other cases from the French pharmacovigilance database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases of piribedil associated with sleep attacks recorded between 1988 and December 2008 were identified in the French Pharmacovigilance database. Cases were retained for analysis only if patients were treated for conditions other than PD. RESULTS: Overall, a total of 35 cases of piribedil-induced sleep disorders were retrieved, and 7 cases suggestive of sleep attacks were retained for analysis. The mean time to onset after starting piribedil was 2. 5 days. Piribedil was the only suspected drug in all but 1 patient. Complete recovery was noticed after piribedil discontinuation in all patients, and recurrence of symptoms was observed after piribedil reintroduction in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our series suggests that piribedil may be associated with <b>sleep</b> <b>attack</b> disorders independently of the treated disease and supports the prominent role of DAs in sleep disorders...|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES Previous {{laboratory}} studies in narcolepsy patients showed altered core body and skin temperatures, which are hypothesised {{to be related}} to a disturbed sleep wake regulation. In this ambulatory study we assessed temperature profiles in normal daily life, and whether <b>sleep</b> <b>attacks</b> are heralded by changes in skin temperature. Furthermore, the effects of three months of treatment with sodium oxybate (SXB) were investigated. METHODS Twenty-five narcolepsy patients and 15 healthy controls were included. Core body, proximal and distal skin temperatures, and sleep-wake state were measured simultaneously for 24 hours in ambulatory patients. This procedure was repeated in 16 narcolepsy patients after at least 3 months of stable treatment with SXB. RESULTS Increases in distal skin temperature and distal-to-proximal temperature gradient (DPG) strongly predicted daytime <b>sleep</b> <b>attacks</b> (P < 0. 001). As compared to controls, patients had a higher proximal and distal skin temperature in the morning, and a lower distal skin temperature during the night (all P < 0. 05). Furthermore, they had a higher core body temperature during {{the first part of the}} night (P < 0. 05), which SXB decreased (F = 4. 99, df = 1, P = 0. 03) to a level similar to controls. SXB did not affect skin temperature. CONCLUSIONS This ambulatory study demonstrates that daytime <b>sleep</b> <b>attacks</b> were preceded by clear changes in distal skin temperature and DPG. Furthermore, changes in core body and skin temperature in narcolepsy, previously only studied in laboratory settings, were partially confirmed. Treatment with SXB resulted in a normalisation of the core body temperature profile.

40|$|AbstractWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{can be used}} {{to monitor}} environments, and {{therefore}} have broad range of interesting applications. The applications which may use WSN can be of sensitive nature and therefore might require enhanced secured environment. As sensors are used to monitor sensitive areas therefore Security and energy efficiency is essential consideration when designing wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The Sensor nodes get their power from batteries. Since the sensor nodes are deployed in harsh environment they cannot be recharged. Due to unattended deployment and inability of recharging, the power consumption of the nodes should be optimal. To implement minimum power consumption Sensor networks periodically place nodes to sleep. This is achieved by using the media access control (MAC) protocols. These protocols are designed {{in such a way that}} they reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes by keeping the antenna in sleep mode as much as possible. This leads to power saving. The MAC protocols change the sleep time based on the type of communication required. However, malicious nodes can be introduced in the network and these attackers use their information about the MAC protocol, by manipulating the sleep time of the node, so that life time of the node reduces. This is called as Denial of <b>sleep</b> <b>attack.</b> This paper, addresses the Denial of <b>sleep</b> <b>attack</b> in WSN while at the same time proposing a scheme for authenticating the new nodes which try to change the sleep schedule of the nodes. Only transmissions from valid nodes are accepted. Our scheme uses zero knowledge protocol (ZKP) for verifying the authenticity of the sensor nodes which pass the sleep synchronization messages. Also to enhance security further the interlock protocol is used during key exchange.

40|$|Abstract — A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} is a wireless network organized {{with a large number}} of sensor nodes with specialized sensors that can monitor various physical attributes such as temperature, pressure, vibration, and sound. Sensor nodes are powered up with batteries. Due to unattended nature of the deployment, the sensor nodes ’ batteries cannot be recharged. In such conditions, the nodes must optimally consume power. Various protocols are designed to reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes by keeping the antenna in sleep mode 90 % of time, so that power is saved. MAC protocols are designed to adaptively vary the sleep time based on the communication need. But attackers use their knowledge of their underlying MAC protocol, to reduce the sleep time for the node, so that the lifetime of a node reduces. This problem is popularly known as Denial of <b>sleep</b> <b>attack.</b> In this paper, we propose an effective solution}to defend against such attacks in a sensor network.

In 'Diagnostic Classification of Sleep and A rousal Disorders'by the A ssociation of Sleep Disorders Centers (A SDC, 1979),it is reported that the prevalence of this isolated form of sleep paralysis is 3 - 6 % among normal population. On the other hand,in Japan,there is a set of psychological and physical ex periences involving paralysis,usually with terror or anx iety,and with or without hallucinations,during the transitional period between sleep and wakefulness.

40|$|When warriors {{fall asleep}} within Heorot?s {{decorated}} walls, they initiate {{a sequence of}} events that ultimately ends in slaughter and death. This pattern of <b>sleep,</b> <b>attack,</b> and death predictably appears {{in each of the}} monster episodes. Humans sleep and fall prey to an otherworld attacker, who eventually receives death as punishment. Interestingly, the roles of the characters are reversed in the dragon scene. Here, the dragon?s sleep exposes him to harm {{at the hands of a}} human, the thief, whose guilt is transferred to Beowulf. In this way, sleep designates the victims and the attackers, but it also helps the audience predict the judgment that will take place at the end of each episode. This judgment becomes specifically Christian when contextualized by other Anglo-Saxon accounts of sleep. As in these texts, sleep in Beowulf functions as a liminal zone connecting the world of the humans with an Otherworld. The intersection of these worlds in Beowulf follows the structural paradigm of the popular ?Doomsday motif,? in which an angry Christ comes to earth to surprise a sleeping humanity. A study of the verbal and thematic similarities of Beowulf and Christ III best exemplifies this connection. Other mythographic traditions of Christian judgment within Anglo Saxon texts appear throughout Beowulf. Motifs of Christ?s second coming surround Grendel as he approaches Heorot, and his entrance echoes Christ?s harrowing of Hell. The fight in Grendel?s mother?s lair recalls redemption through water: Beowulf?s immersion represents baptism and the hilt of the sword which saves the Danish nation depicts the great Flood.

40|$|PAVLOV, {{working with}} dogs, has {{produced}} evidence tending {{to show that}} the cerebral cortex may be represented as a mosaic of constantly shifting areas of excitation and areas of inhibition, each opposing the irradiation of the other. Applying his observations to man, I have tried {{to show that the}} interplay of excitation and inhibition sometimes leads to phenomena interpretable as manifestations of the 'crowding ' of either of these functional states into particular cerebral areas. A few examples will show what I mean. ' Crowding ' of Inhibition. -In a recent paper 1 I have referred (p. 9) to five cases of narcolopsy, reported respectively by Kinnier Wilson, Cave and Rosenthal, in which the attempt to ward off an impending <b>sleep</b> <b>attack</b> sometimes led to an attack of powerlessness. (Later I came across the same observation in Case I of Wenderowic. 7) This phenomenon may be under-stood in the light of Pavlov's view that sleep (an inhibitory state) results from the irradiation of inhibition over a sufficiently large part of the cortex. When a person is falling asleep, we may infer that inhibitory processes are irradiating over his substrate of consciousness. When he tries to resist sleep, a multitude of excitatory processes come into play, opposing the spread of the inhibitory processes. The latter, deflected, so to speak, from their original goal, will invade those areas where they meet with the least opposition. Thus, in the cases cited, they were evidently deflected from the substrate of consciousness to the motility substrate. This deflection reminds one of what happens in a football game, when the player rushing the ball is crowded by his opponents, as they advance upon him, into that part of the field where he sees the least opposition.

We show how adversary nodes can exploit clustering algorithms to ensure their selection as cluster heads {{for the purpose of}} launching attacks that prevent victim nodes from sleeping. We present two such attacks: the barrage <b>attack</b> and the <b>sleep</b> deprivation <b>attack.</b> The barrage attack bombards victim nodes with legitimate requests, whereas the <b>sleep</b> deprivation <b>attack</b> makes requests of victim nodes only as often as is necessary to keep the victims awake. We show that while the barrage attack causes its victims to spend slightly more energy, it is more easily detected and requires more effort on behalf of the attacker. Thus we have focused our research on the <b>sleep</b> deprivation <b>attack.</b> Our analysis indicates that this attack can nullify any energy savings obtained by allowing sensor nodes to enter sleep mode. We also analyze three separate methods for mitigating this attack: the random vote scheme, the round robin scheme, and the hash-based scheme.

It affects around 33 % patients and culminates in <b>sleep</b> <b>attacks</b> (without prodroma) in 1 to 4 % of the patients. When monitored, short, narcolepsy-like naps with abnormal intrusion of REM sleep during daytime (and hypnagogic hallucinations as wakeful dreams) are observed in 33 - 41 % patients, while other patients display naps with non REM sleep. Although insomnia, sleep apnea and periodic leg movements are common in these patients, {{there is no clear}} link between the night events and the level of sleepiness. Patients treated with dopamine agonists are two to three fold more exposed to <b>sleep</b> <b>attacks</b> than those on levodopa, with large variability between patients.

40|$|Abstract: Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) {{is characterized}} by paraesthesias–dysesthesias and motor restlessness worsening at rest–in the evening, with at least temporary relief by activity. Its etiology is unknown, though it could be secondary to various conditions. It is well known, however, that dopamine {{plays a crucial role}} in the pathophysiology of RLS, as dopaminergic agonists achieve marked improvement. Pramipexole is a nonergoline compound with selectivity for D 3 dopamine receptors. This drug is very effective in the treatment of idiopathic and secondary RLS and in treatment-resistant patients, as shown by double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults. In children, studies are much more limited, and RLS is often misdiagnosed as “growing pain ” or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Pramipexole has been successful in open studies, eliminating clinical symptoms. This medication has the advantage of being free of the frequently encountered problems seen with ergot derivatives. The side-effects are limited, particularly at the dosages usually prescribed for RLS treatment: They are much lower than in Parkinson’s disease, and inappropriate sleepiness and <b>sleep</b> <b>attacks,</b> particularly while driving, or compulsive behavior have not been seen. Compared with the adverse reactions of levodopa, including tolerance, rebound, and augmentation phenomena in RLS, which led to usage of dopamine agonists as first line of treatment for RLS, pramipexole has had one of the best profiles.
