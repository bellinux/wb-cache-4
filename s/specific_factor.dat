25|$|After {{a series}} of {{clinical}} studies, George Richards Minot and William Murphy set out to partly isolate the substance in liver which cured anemia in dogs, {{and found that it}} was iron. They also found that an entirely different liver substance cured pernicious anemia in humans, that had no effect on dogs under the conditions used. The <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> treatment for pernicious anemia, found in liver juice, had been found by this coincidence. Minot and Murphy reported these experiments in 1926. This was the first real progress with this disease. Despite this discovery, for several years patients were still required to eat large amounts of raw liver or to drink considerable amounts of liver juice.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the impact and creation of institutions during early state formation, economic historians Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff examined the economic development of the Americas during colonization. They found that the beginnings of {{the success or failure of}} American colonies were based on the <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> endowments available to each colony. These endowments included the climate, soil profitability, crop potential, and even native population density. Institutions formed to take advantage of these factor endowments. Those that were most successful developed an ability to change and adapt to new circumstances over time. For example, the development of economic institutions, such as plantations, was caused by the need for a large property and labor force to harvest sugar and tobacco, while smallholder farms thrived in areas where scale economies were absent. Though initially profitable, plantation colonies also suffered from large dependent populations over time as slaves and natives were given few rights, limiting the population available to drive future economic progress and technological development.|$|E

2500|$|With David Schkade, Kahneman {{developed}} {{the notion of}} the focusing illusion (Kahneman & Schkade, 1998; Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz & Stone, 2006) to explain in part the mistakes people make when estimating the effects of different scenarios on their future happiness (also known as affective forecasting, which has been studied extensively by Daniel Gilbert). The [...] "illusion" [...] occurs when people consider the impact of one <b>specific</b> <b>factor</b> on their overall happiness, they tend to greatly exaggerate the importance of that factor, while overlooking the numerous other factors that would in most cases have a greater impact. A good example is provided by Kahneman and Schkade's 1998 paper [...] "Does living in California make people happy? A focusing illusion in judgments of life satisfaction". In that paper, students in the Midwest and in California reported similar levels of life satisfaction, but the Midwesterners thought their Californian peers would be happier. The only distinguishing information the Midwestern students had when making these judgments was the fact that their hypothetical peers lived in California. Thus, they [...] "focused" [...] on this distinction, thereby overestimating the effect of the weather in California on its residents' satisfaction with life.|$|E

40|$|Does {{globalization}} widen inequality {{or increase}} income risk? In the <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> continuum model of this paper, globalization widens inequality, amplifying the positive (negative) premia for export (import- competing) sectors. Globalization amplifies the risk from idiosyncratic relative productivity shocks but reduces risk from aggregate shocks to absolute advantage, relative endowments and transfers. Aggregate-shock-induced income risk bears most {{heavily on the}} poorest <b>specific</b> <b>factors,</b> while non-traded sectors are insulated. Heterogeneous shocks to firms induce Darwinian competition for sector <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> that is harsher the more productive the sector.

40|$|A new {{presentation}} of the <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> model shows how labor fares under international trade by considering how the price elasticity of the nominal wage rate responds {{to the terms of}} trade as well as factor endowments.

This provides the basis for suggested time series studies contrasting the <b>specific</b> <b>factors</b> model with the Heckscher-Ohlin model.
