5|$|The {{need for}} strong leaders {{who could take}} charge and steer America out of its crisis is seen in Gabriel Over the White House (1933), about a benevolent {{dictator}} who takes control of the United States. Walter Huston stars as a weak-willed, ineffectual president (likely modeled after Hoover) who is inhabited by the archangel Gabriel upon being knocked unconscious. The spirit's behavior {{is similar to that}} of Abraham Lincoln.

5|$|The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep inelastic {{scattering}} experiments {{of the late}} 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data {{in a way that}} did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number <b>solves</b> <b>the</b> Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the bonus}} round begins, the winning {{contestant}} chooses {{one of three}} categories {{for his or her}} puzzle (prior to season 35, the puzzle and category were predetermined). After doing so, the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize. He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed. The contestant provides three more consonants (four if he/she is holding the Wild Card) and one more vowel, then has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle after his or her other letters (if any) are revealed. The contestant may make as many guesses as necessary, so long as the contestant begins the correct answer before time expires. Whether or not the contestant <b>solves</b> <b>the</b> puzzle, the host opens the envelope {{at the end of the}} round to reveal the prize at stake. Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts (with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000), a vehicle (or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams), and a top prize of $100,000.|$|E
5|$|Celeste gives Natasha the waitressing job at Charlie's and {{she moves}} in with Summer and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), after her house is sold. Natasha also decides {{to drop out}} of her {{university}} course, upon realising that it is not right for her. Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she <b>solves</b> <b>the</b> problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with conditional probability, which they use to predict the outcome of a game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of guys at Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple of police officers walks in. Natasha convinces Ed to hold a game at the Men's Shed, so they can continue to test the theory and make some money. Andrew comes up with an idea to use the theory to make an odds calculator mobile app. When Natasha goes to asks Ed about the idea, he introduces her to the hobby of LARPing, before agreeing to sign Andrew's contract.|$|E

5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player <b>solves</b> <b>the</b> cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E
5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player <b>solves</b> <b>the</b> puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, weather {{prediction}} was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 Cleveland Abbe, founder of the United States Weather Bureau, proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century. In 1904, Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions, which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that <b>solves</b> <b>the</b> initial value problem. He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: pressure, temperature, density, humidity, and the three components of the flow velocity vector. Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity, conservation of momentum, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the ideal gas law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods. With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics, these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present-day weather models.|$|E
