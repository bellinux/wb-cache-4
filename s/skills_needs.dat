The data is {{organized}} by assessing the members of BigCo’s Corporate IT group regarding their present IT skill levels and the perception of <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> both now and three years in the future. This work relies on a categorization drawn from both academic and professional literature regarding <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> for IT professionals. In doing this work we draw on surveys, interviews, focus groups and archival documents to build a rich and detailed perspective on <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> for the IT professionals at BigCo’s Corporate IT group. Findings show that there is an implicit set of conceptual IT skills that IT professionals are expected to have. Further, the non-IT <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> are presently very important and are expected to become even more important. Finally, there are important department-level, experience, and gender variations in the responses suggesting that IT roles are growing both more numerous and more specialized...|$|R

50|$|In {{seeking to}} address the level of {{vulnerable}} employment, TVET systems have focused on increasing the employability of graduates and enhancing their capacity to function effectively within existing vulnerable labour markets and to adjust to other labour market constraints. This has meant enhanced coordination among government departments responsible for TVET and employment policies. It has also created the need for TVET systems to develop mechanisms that identify <b>skills</b> <b>needs</b> early on and make better use of labour market information for matching skills demands and supply. TVET systems {{have focused more on}} developing immediate job skills and wider competencies. This has been accomplished by adopting competency-based approaches to instruction and workplace learning that enable learners to handle vulnerable employment, adjust to changing jobs and career contexts, and build their capacity to learn and agility to adapt.|$|E

If a child is deaf or hard of hearing, the team {{is required}} to consider the child's language and communication needs, including the need to communicate with school personnel and peers, and the child's need for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode.

40|$|Widening {{university}} {{participation is}} arguably {{one of the}} largest changes occurring within the contemporary university (Biggs and Tang 2011); with many universities offering enabling programs to provide a supported transition to university for students from equity groups. In order to better inform enabling program curriculum, 2012 commencing students at UniSA College were surveyed to determine the <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> they identified as important. These needs were compared to a known framework for university preparedness. There was found to be a significant match between the students’ identified <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> and Conley’s framework (2008) with regard to academic literacy. However other enabling program student identified <b>skill</b> <b>needs,</b> such as personal development, community input, and career preparation, were not supported by the framework. The research concludes that a separate framework should be determined for enabling program student <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> and that academics should engage in regular dialogue with students to develop curriculum which meets the specific needs of this growing cohort.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question of}} organizational scale and scope, with applications to various industries, including financial services. We build a model in which new opportunities arise for firms, but the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to exploit them effectively are unknown. Early investments in these new opportunities expand scope and allow firms to learn the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to make more efficient production decisions later on. The value of scope expansion is thus increasing in the strategic uncertainty about the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for future success in exploiting new opportunities. The disadvantage of early scope expansion is that it requires irreversible investments before actual demand is known. This demand uncertainty means potential losses since the investment cannot be recovered when demand does not materialize. Thus, early entry into a new activity involves a tradeoff, and this tradeoff works in favor of early entry under two conditions. First, theremustbesufficiently high strategic uncertainty about the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for success in th...|$|R
50|$|Typically (and {{depending}} on the topic) people have {{a limited number of}} genuinely different constructs for any one topic: 6 to 16 are common when they talk about their job or their occupation, for example. The richness of people's meaning structures comes from the many different ways in which a limited number of constructs can be applied to individual elements. A person may indicate that Tom is fairly keen, very experienced, lacks social skills, is a good technical supervisor, can be trusted to follow complex instructions accurately, has no sense of humour, will always return a favour but only sometimes help his co-workers, while Mary is very keen, fairly experienced, has good social and technical supervisory <b>skills,</b> <b>needs</b> complex instructions explained to her, appreciates a joke, always returns favours, and is very helpful to her co-workers: these are two very different and complex pictures, using just 8 constructs about a person's co-workers.|$|E
50|$|The 2012 Education for All Global Monitoring Report {{concluded}} that 'all countries, regardless of income level, {{need to pay}} greater attention {{to the needs of}} young people who face disadvantage in education and skills development by virtue of their poverty, gender or other characteristics'. The report found that several barriers and constraints reduced the success of TVET in meeting social equity demands. First, national TVET policies in most cases failed to address the <b>skills</b> <b>needs</b> of young people living in urban poverty and in deprived rural areas. Second, additional funds were needed to support TVET learning opportunities on a much larger scale. Third, the training needs of disadvantaged young women were particularly neglected. The 2012 EFA Global Monitoring Report also noted that skills training alone was not su cient for the most disadvantaged of the rural and urban poor. Coherent policies that link social protection, micro- nance and TVET are considered critical for ensuring better outcomes for marginalized groups.|$|E

40|$|Data from {{a survey}} of 800 {{employers}} were used to investigate the effects of employer <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> on the wage levels and employment of newly hired workers, and especially on how these outcomes differ by race, gender,'and educational group. Results showed that very few new jobs were available to workers who lacked credentials such as diplomas or experience, or the job <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for daily task performance. This was true even of jobs that did not require college degiees. The hiring and task performance requirements of new jobs were associated with lower employment of blacks relative to whites within each gender. They also had significant effects on starting hourly wages, even after controlling for educational attainment of the worker. The effects of employer <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> on employment patterns help to account {{for some of the}} observed differences in hourly wages across racial and educational groups, especially among men.
