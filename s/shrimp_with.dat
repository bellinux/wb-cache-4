5|$|Food {{selection}} at {{the restaurant}} comes from the traditional cuisine of the United States. Popcorn is served as a free hors d'oeuvre. Other food items include milkshakes, hot fudge sundaes, seafood salad, turkey sloppy joes, fried pickles, St. Louis-style barbecue ribs, beef-and-blue-cheese salads, sautéed <b>shrimp</b> <b>with</b> farfalle, French fries, cucumber salads, Buffalo wings, Boca Burgers, Tofutti, and steaks. Drinks include souvenir phosphorescent ice cubes. The desserts are served in larger portions than are customary elsewhere. There are vegetarian options. The chefs at the Sci-Fi Dine-In sometimes cater for special requests in advance. The cookbook Delicious Disney Just for Kids contains a recipe for the BLT soup served at the Sci-Fi Dine-In.|$|E
25|$|Integrated multi-trophic {{aquaculture}} (IMTA) {{provides the}} byproducts, including waste, from one aquatic species as inputs (fertilizers, food) for another. Farmers combine fed aquaculture (e.g., fish, <b>shrimp)</b> <b>with</b> inorganic extractive (e.g., seaweed) and organic extractive (e.g., shellfish) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environment remediation (biomitigation), economic stability (improved output, lower cost, product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).|$|E
25|$|The diet of bay whiting {{has been}} the focus of a study {{investigating}} trophic relations between this species, Sillago sihama, and other similarly distributed fish of the South China Sea. In this location, it was found bay whiting predominantly prey on a variety of shrimp species, polychaete worms and Mantis <b>shrimp,</b> <b>with</b> minor amounts of crabs, sea urchins, bivalves and copepods. Unlike other species of sillaginid, the bay whiting doesn't have a large dietary shift as it moves to adulthood, causing parents to compete with offspring to an extent. The diet is, however, offset from the co-occurring S. sihama, preventing significant competition from this species.|$|E

25|$|Many {{invertebrates}} have {{color vision}}. Honeybees and bumblebees have trichromatic color vision which is insensitive to red but sensitive to ultraviolet. Osmia rufa, for example, possess a trichromatic color system, which they use in foraging for pollen from flowers. In {{view of the}} importance of color vision to bees one might expect these receptor sensitivities to reflect their specific visual ecology; for example the types of flowers that they visit. However, the main groups of hymenopteran insects excluding ants (i.e., bees, wasps and sawflies) mostly have three types of photoreceptor, with spectral sensitivities similar to the honeybee's. Papilio butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision. The most complex color vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the mantis <b>shrimp)</b> <b>with</b> up to 12 spectral receptor types thought to work as multiple dichromatic units.|$|E
500|$|According to one suggestion, gumbo is a reinterpretation of {{traditional}} African cooking. [...] West Africans used the vegetable okra {{as a base}} for many dishes, including soups, often pairing okra with meat and <b>shrimp,</b> <b>with</b> salt and pepper as seasonings. In Louisiana, the dish was modified to include ingredients introduced by other cultural groups. Surviving records indicate that by 1764 African slaves in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is little}} {{agreement}} among taxonomists concerning the phylogeny of crustaceans. Within the decapods [...] "every study gives totally different results.

Some taxonomists identify <b>shrimp</b> <b>with</b> the infraorder Caridea and prawns with the suborder Dendrobranchiata. While different experts give different answers, there is no disagreement that the caridean species are shrimp. There are over 3000 caridean species.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine the effect of dietary beta 1 - 3 glucan (BG) and a megadose of vitamin C on the nutrition (growth and survival, blood glucose, lactate, acylglycerides, cholesterol, hemocyanin [He], digestive gland glycogen [DGG]) and the immunological system (blood cells, prophenoloxidase [ProPO]) in Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles. Each treatment was replicated five times. Nutritional condition and immunological response of shrimp were recorded after 40 days of feeding with specific diets and during 48 h after a salinity shock (35 - 0 parts per thousand). A significantly greater growth rate was observed in <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> BG or vitamin. C diets than in the control group. Higher blood protein, total blood cells, granular cells, and ProPO activity were recorded in <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> vitamin C as compared to the remaining treatments. That means that BG was degraded in the digestive gland by beta-glucanases to produce energy, permitting the use of more proteins for growth, whereas vitamin C was used to improve animal health, enhancing general metabolism in shrimp. The salinity stress induced a rapid use of reserves, triacylglycerols (TAGs), and cholesterol were reduced in blood and probably used as a source of energy or synthesis in the digestive gland. The increase in digestive gland glycogen 24 h after the salinity shock evidenced the use of these reserves by <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> all diets. In general, after the salinity, shock blood cells increased in <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> glucans and decreased in <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> vitamin C, whereas ProPO decreased in all shrimp after the salinity shock. This could mean that after the salinity, shock <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> glucans could synthesize cells and ProPO, whereas in <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> vitamin C, blood cells were just used to respond to the stress. After the salinity shock, an increment in the ProPO/granular cell ratio was observed in <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> vitamin C, indicating that these shrimp could rapidly increase the components of their immune system. In contrast, a continuous reduction in ProPO/granular cell ratio was observed in <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> glucans, revealing that with this type of immunostimulant, shrimp drive their immunological equipment to respond continuously to the stress. These results could explain why <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> immunostimulants presents immunological fatigue in contrast to <b>shrimp</b> fed <b>with</b> additives that improve their nutritional status, like vitamin C.

2500|$|L.amboinesis {{like other}} cleaner shrimp has a {{symbiotic}} relationship with 'client' fish in which both organisms benefit; the shrimp gain a meal from eating parasites living on large fish and the clients benefit from the removal of parasites. Cleaning organisms including shrimp and fish can congregate in one location on a reef in {{what is called a}} [...] "cleaning station" [...] which fish will visit when required; cleaning shrimp perform a rocking dance from side to side to signal their services when fish approach. L.amboinesis is also commonly found living in caves with their client fish, such as moray eels, providing the <b>shrimp</b> <b>with</b> protection from predators.|$|E
2500|$|Polychaete {{worms and}} {{crustaceans}} are the predominant sources {{of food for}} the masked stingaree; on occasion [...] sipunculid worms, molluscs, and echinoderms are also taken. This species preys on both sedentary polychaetes, which generally inhabit deeply buried tubes, and on errant polychaetes, which are generally more mobile and shallowly buried. The expanded lobes and sensory papillae adjacent to its mouth likely aid in locating and excavating such burrowing prey. Young rays feed mainly on crustaceans, including mysids, amphipods, cumaceans, tanaids, and <b>shrimp.</b> <b>With</b> age polychaetes {{are added to the}} diet; sedentary polychaetes are significant to rays [...] across, while errant polychaetes become progressively more important such as that the largest rays eat little else.|$|E
2500|$|Gobies {{sometimes}} form symbiotic {{relationships with}} other species, such as with burrowing shrimps. The shrimp maintains a burrow in the sand in which both the shrimp and the goby live. The shrimp has poor eyesight compared to the goby, but if it sees or feels the goby suddenly swim into the burrow, it will follow. The goby and shrimp keep in contact with each other, the shrimp using its antennae, and the goby flicking the <b>shrimp</b> <b>with</b> its tail when alarmed. These gobies are thus sometimes known as [...] "watchmen gobies" [...] or [...] "prawn gobies". Each party gains from this relationship: the shrimp gets a warning of approaching danger, and the goby gets a safe home {{and a place to}} lay its eggs. Only the alpha male and female reproduce, other fish in the colony eat sparingly to resist being eaten by the alpha male or female. This way, only the largest and fittest are able to reproduce.|$|E

2500|$|Eureka's {{founding}} and livelihood was {{and remains}} linked to Humboldt Bay, the Pacific Ocean, and related industries, especially fishing. Salmon fisheries sprang {{up along the}} Eel River as early as 1851, and within seven years 2,000 barrels of cured fish and [...] of smoked salmon were processed and shipped out of Humboldt Bay annually from processing plants on Eureka's wharf.

2500|$|Meats are {{centered}} on the European introduced beef, pork and chicken as many native game animals {{are in danger of}} extinction. Meat dishes are frequently accompanied by vegetables such as squash, chayote and carrots. Black beans are the favored type. Beef is favored, especially a thin cut called tasajo usually served in a sauce. Pepita con tasajo is a common dish at festivals especially in Chiapa de Corzo. It consists of a squash seed based sauced over reconstituted and shredded dried beef. [...] As a cattle raising area, beef dishes in Palenque are particularly good. Pux-Xaxé is a stew with beef organ meats and mole sauce made with tomato, chili bolita and corn flour. [...] Tzispolá is a beef broth with chunks of meat, chickpeas, cabbage and various types of chili peppers. Pork dishes include cochito, which is pork in an adobo sauce. In Chiapa de Corzo, their version is cochito horneado, which is a roast suckling pig flavored with adobo. [...] Seafood is a strong component in many dishes along the coast. [...] Turula is dried <b>shrimp</b> <b>with</b> tomatoes. Sausages, ham and other cold cuts are most often made and consumed in the highlands.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of various levels of ACV® and Propionic acid (PA) on expression of immune related genes and growth performance in white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Three hundred and seventy-five <b>shrimps</b> <b>with</b> an average initial weight of 10. 2  ±  0. 04  g were collected and acclimatized for two weeks. Five experimental diets including control diet, 0. 5 % PA diet and 1 %, 2 % and 4 % ACV® diets were applied to feed the shrimps. They were fed 4 times a day with 2. 5 % of body weight. After 60 days of culture, <b>shrimps</b> fed <b>with</b> ACV® and PA diets showed {{no significant difference in}} growth performance. Expression of prophenoloxidase (proPo), lysozyme (Lys), penaeidin- 3 a (Pen- 3 a) and Crustin (Cru) genes were determined from hepatopancreas, using the real-time PCR after 15, 30 and 60 days. Expression of Lys and proPo genes was significantly up regulated in <b>shrimps</b> fed <b>with</b> ACV® and PA diets compared to the control group after 30 and 60 days of treatment. After 15 days, Pen- 3 a gene expression was significantly higher in PA group compared to the control group.
