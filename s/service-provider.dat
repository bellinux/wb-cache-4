40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} why patients {{chose to}} attend two, nurse-led, minor injury units (MIUs) to access primary healthcare services rather than attend their GP practice. Background: Since the 1980 ’s, healthcare organisations in the UK and elsewhere have implemented an increasingly consumer-orientated model of healthcare provision. As a result, patients with non-urgent presentations are attending Emergency Departments (EDs) and other urgent care facilities in growing numbers. Methods: A comparative case study approach was adopted and between October 2014 and May 2015 the researcher was embedded {{as a participant}} observer {{as part of the}} emergency nurse practitioner team at two, nurse-led, MIUs (site A and B). During this time, 40 patients, 17 <b>service-providers</b> and 1 senior manager were interviewed. Results: Patients and <b>service-providers</b> at both sites identified convenience and quality of care as the principle reasons patients presented for primary healthcare services at MIUs rather than their GP practice. <b>Service-providers</b> were aware that by providing treatment, they established a precedent and a sense of expectation for future care. Conclusion: Patients are acting rationally and predictably in response to healthcare policy promises regarding choice, expectation created by <b>service-providers,</b> and local demographic factors...|$|R
40|$|Resident {{participation}} {{is a vital}} factor and key prerequisite to the planning, {{development and implementation of}} community-driven projects. Early implementation evaluations, especially during the planning stages of project development, are critical to ensuring effective resident participation. Understanding the nature of resident participation, including the activities involved, facilitators, barriers, and outcomes of engagement, is essential for laying the foundation for program success and sustainability. This study was an implementation evaluation of a small community-based initiated project that examined resident participation, varying by degrees of involvement throughout the early stages of implementation. The sample (N = 11) consisted of three <b>service-providers,</b> two highly-engaged residents, four less-engaged residents and two project staff. The qualitative data analysis found that during the exploration stage, highly-engaged residents and <b>service-providers</b> participated in similar activities. However, as the implementation process progressed into the following installation stage, highly-engaged residents expressed desires to reduce involvement and responsibilities, while project staff, <b>service-providers</b> and those less involved wished to remain as involved or increase participation. Additionally, findings revealed that project challenges were perceived differently by residents, regardless of level of involvement, than by <b>service-providers</b> and project staff. The findings of this study produced recommendations for increasing facilitators and reducing barriers to resident participation during the early stages of an implementation process of a community-based project...|$|R

[...] Since the Montfort Hospital was the only hospital in the region operating primarily in French, it amounted to a protected parallel <b>service-provider,</b> much as New Brunswick's French-language and English-language school systems are parallel service providers, and therefore as an essential component of the collective rights of Ottawa's Franco-Ontarian population.

40|$|Background: Existing {{literature}} {{indicates that}} young people in state care have particular sexual health needs that include addressing their social and emotional well-being, yet little has been published as to how these components of sex education are actually delivered by <b>service-providers.</b> Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the processes involved in delivering relationship and sexuality education to young people in state care from the perspectives of a sample of <b>service-providers</b> with a role in sexual health-care delivery. Design: Qualitative methodological strategy. Setting: Service-delivery sites at urban and rural locations in Ireland. Method: A total of 22 <b>service-providers</b> were interviewed in depth, and data were analysed using a qualitative analytical strategy resembling modified analytical induction. Findings: Participants proffered their perceptions and examples of their practices of sex education in relation to the following themes: (1) acknowledging the multi-dimensional nature of sexual health in the case of young people in care; (2) personal and emotional development education to address poor self-esteem, emotional disconnectedness and an inability to recognise and express emotions; (3) social skills’ education as part of a repertoire of competencies needed to negotiate relationships and safer sex; (4) the application of positive social skills embedded in everyday social situations; and (5) factual sexuality education. Conclusion: Insights into service-providers’ perceptions of the multi-dimensional nature of the sexual health needs of young people in state care, and the ways in which these <b>service-providers</b> justified their practice make visible the complex character of sex education and the degree of skill required to deliver it to those in state care...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Service-oriented {{computing}} (SOC) is a {{new paradigm}} that allows organizations to tailor their business processes, {{in such a way}} that efficiency and effectiveness goals will be achieved by outsourcing (parts of) business processes to web-based <b>service-providers.</b> In order to find the computing <b>service-providers</b> that provide the organizations with the biggest benefits, it is paramount that the service-requesting organization (SRO) has a precise description of the service it wants to have delivered by the service delivering organization (SDO). In this paper we will illustrate how enterprises that play the SDO and SRO roles can be conceptually integrated by creating conceptual models that share the definitions of the business processes within the service oriented architecture (SOA) framework...|$|R

We use the Critical Incident Technique and Narrative Inquiry as the data collection technique and analytical approach respectively. The findings reveal that guests and <b>service-providers</b> use a number of strategies to exert power and gain control during their interactions, including subjective essentialism and stereotyping, to achieve their goals. The implications for tourism and hospitality management include providing cross-cultural sensitivity training to <b>service-providers,</b> ensuring a cultural-diverse employee composition, and to foster cross-cultural understanding amongst employees. We further suggest to develop strategies to facilitate effective cross-cultural service interactions based on evidence about cultural norms, expectations and behaviours from specific cultural groups. Further research is recommended to connect specific interactions between the interacting parties to examine whether the various strategies used leads to effective cross-cultural communication...|$|R
