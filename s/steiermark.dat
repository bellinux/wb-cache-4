5|$|Central Europe {{became the}} centre of silver {{production}} during the Middle Ages, as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. Silver mines were opened in Bohemia, Saxony, Erzgebirge, Alsace, the Lahn region, Siegerland, Silesia, Hungary, Norway, <b>Steiermark,</b> Salzburg, and the southern Black Forest. Most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native silver were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, {{but a few of}} them remained active until the Industrial Revolution, before which the world production of silver was around a meagre 50tonnes per year. In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead cupellation technology was developed by pre-Inca civilizations as early as AD 60–120; silver deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film {{industry}} {{came out with}} a talkie: G'schichten aus der <b>Steiermark</b> (Stories from Styria), an Eagle Film–Ottoton Film production. On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, Das Land ohne Frauen (Land Without Women), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, about one-quarter of the movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music. The response was underwhelming. Sweden's first talkie, Konstgjorda Svensson (Artificial Svensson), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film came out with Le Collier de la reine (The Queen's Necklace), shot at the Épinay studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence—the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, Les Trois masques debuted; a Pathé-Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like Blackmail, at the Elstree studio, just outside London. The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richebé talkie La Route est belle, also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later.|$|E

25|$|The Styria {{municipal}} {{structural reform}} (German: Steiermärkische Gemeindestrukturreform) {{is a local}} government reform in Styria, Austria, which merged small towns in 2015, among 542 municipalities into 287, to reduce costs and ease election of new town officials. It became effective on January 1, 2015 and is now complete. Its basis is the Styrian municipality Structural Reform Act (StGsrG). This law was adopted on December 17, 2013 Landtag <b>Steiermark</b> and promulgated on April 2, 2014.|$|E

The Italians imprisoned him in 1918, and upon his release, in 1919, he enrolled at the University of Graz where he studied German and English and received his doctorate with a thesis on Arno Holz, directed by Bernhard Seuffert. At the University of Vienna he got a teaching qualification in 1924, then taught school.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s, {{disparities between}} the {{conventional}} warship {{strength of the}} Kriegsmarine (German Navy) and other nations caused by the Treaty of Versailles led the German military to recognise that auxiliary cruisers engaged in commerce raiding would be of use during future wars, and that suitable vessels should be identified. The merchant ship <b>Steiermark</b> was one such vessel; she was {{taken up by the}} Kriegsmarine at the start of World War II. Renamed , she was the largest and newest of nine raiders, referred to as Hilfskreuzer (auxiliary cruisers) or Handelsstörkreuzer (trade disruption cruisers).|$|E
25|$|<b>Steiermark</b> was one {{of these}} ships. Receiving the {{designation}} Schiff 41 (Ship 41) for administrative purposes, she was taken into dockyard hands following the outbreak of World War II. Conversion of the merchant ship commenced in early 1940, and was prioritized as second only to work on the U-boat fleet. The conversion work included installation of camouflaged weapons, fitting of bunks for the sailors, creation of internal passageways leading to their stations. Prisoner accommodation, consisting of an open area for hammocks and facilities to keep ship's masters and women separate from the general population, were constructed. The raider was also provided with equipment with which to modify her appearance and allow her to masquerade as other merchant vessels. While the ship was being refitted, her future crew underwent training aboard the blockade runner Monte Pascoal.|$|E
25|$|Graz lies in Styria, or <b>Steiermark</b> in German. Mark {{is an old}} German word {{indicating}} a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight {{in the case of}} an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was often assaulted (unsuccessfully), e.g. by the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and by the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 23 May, Jellacic's column marched into Mautern in <b>Steiermark,</b> 16km {{northwest}} of Sankt Michael on the Mur River and 60km northwest of Archduke John at Graz. At the same time, Eugène's main body reached Judenburg on the Mur, 33km southwest of Sankt Michael, with elements only 20km away. For his part, Archduke John warned Jellacic that Eugene was heading for Bruck an der Mur, 40km north of Graz. The axes of advance for both Eugene and Jellacic intersected at Sankt Michael. At about this time, Eugene became aware of Jellacic's presence and ordered General of Division Grenier to force-march the two nearest divisions, those of Generals of Division Jean Mathieu Seras and Pierre François Joseph Durutte, to the northeast and intercept the Austrians. At some point, Jellacic sent away {{the bulk of the}} Salzburger Landwehr and most of his artillery, retaining only four cannons.|$|E
500|$|The Raid at Ožbalt was an {{operation}} on 31 August 1944 in which 105 Allied {{prisoners of war}} (POWs) were rescued by Slovene Partisans. The majority were liberated from a work site at the village of Ožbalt (...) about [...] west of Maribor on the railway line to Dravograd in the German Reichsgau <b>Steiermark</b> (Styria), now part of modern-day northern Slovenia. Six of the liberated POWs were separated from the group during an engagement with the Germans {{a few days after}} their liberation, but following a 14-day trek across [...] they were flown out of a Partisan airfield at Semič to Bari, Italy.

500|$|In April 1941, Germany and {{its allies}} invaded and {{occupied}} the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which was then partitioned. Some Yugoslav territory was annexed by its Axis neighbours, Hungary, Bulgaria and Italy. The Germans engineered and supported {{the creation of the}} puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia ( [...] , NDH), which roughly comprised most of the pre-war Banovina Croatia, along with rest of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and some adjacent territory. The Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians occupied other parts of Yugoslavian territory. Germany did not annex any Yugoslav territory, but occupied northern parts of present-day Slovenia and stationed occupation troops in the northern half of the NDH. The German-occupied part of Slovenia was divided into two areas that were placed under the administration of the Gauleiters of the neighbouring Reichsgau Kärnten and Reichsgau <b>Steiermark.</b>|$|E

He avoided being caught in the capitulation of Ulm and fell back toward Mikhail Kutuzov's Russian army. With 6,000 soldiers in six line and ten Grenz infantry battalions plus 14 squadrons of cavalry, Merveldt made for Styria, hoping to join the army of Archduke Charles. Napoleon detached Louis Davout's III Corps in pursuit. Slowed by heavy snow in the mountains, his [...] "poorly-handled corps" [...] was overtaken by the French at Gross-Ramig, also called Mariazell, in the Austrian <b>Steiermark,</b> on 8November. His exhausted troops were routed by General of Brigade Etienne Heudelet de Bierre's advanced guard of Davout's III Corps; half, about 2,000, were taken prisoner, and they lost four colors and 16guns.|$|E
500|$|On 13 April, the 1st and 2nd Motorized Brigades {{occupied}} Novi Sad, {{then pushed}} south across the Danube into {{the northern part}} of Croatian Syrmia capturing Vinkovci and Vukovar on 18 April. These brigades then drove southeast to capture the western Serbian town of Valjevo a day later. Other Hungarian forces occupied the Yugoslavian regions of Prekmurje and Međimurje. A later American assessment concluded that German forces had to take the brunt of the fighting, observing that Hungarian forces had [...] "displayed great reluctance to attack until the enemy had been soundly beaten and thoroughly disorganized by the Germans." [...] When a Yugoslav delegation signed an armistice with German and Italian representatives at Belgrade on 17 April, the Hungarians were represented by a liaison officer, but he did not sign the document because Hungary was [...] "not at war with Yugoslavia." [...] The armistice came into effect at noon the next day. News {{of the success of the}} Hungarian armed forces in Yugoslavia was welcomed in the Hungarian Parliament. German forces occupied a narrow slice of northeastern Prekmurje along the German–Yugoslav border, which included four Volksdeutsche villages. In mid-June 1941, this area was absorbed into Reichsgau <b>Steiermark.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 25 January 1945, {{in spite}} of Himmler's lack of {{military}} experience, Hitler appointed him as commander of the hastily formed Army Group Vistula (Heeresgruppe Weichsel) to halt the Soviet Red Army's Vistula–Oder Offensive into Pomerania. Panzer general Heinz Guderian considered Himmler's appointment [...] "idiocy" [...] and regarded the officers Himmler chose to organize the defense as [...] "uniformly incapable of performing their allotted tasks". Knowing that Himmler would {{need all the help}} he could get, Guderian appointed General Walther Wenck, an experienced staff officer, as his chief of staff. Himmler established his command centre at Schneidemühl, using his special train, Sonderzug <b>Steiermark,</b> as his headquarters. The train had only one telephone line, inadequate maps, and no signal detachment or radios with which to establish communication and relay military orders. Himmler seldom left the train, only worked about four hours per day, and insisted on a daily massage before commencing work and a lengthy nap after lunch. Operation Solstice, an attack from Pomerania against the northern flank of Marshal Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belarusian Front, was launched on 16 February 1945, but could make little headway against Pavel Alexeyevich Belov's 61st Army and Semyon Bogdanov's 2nd Guards Tank Army. Zhukov responded by redirecting two Soviet tank armies against the German forces. Within five days, tanks of the Red Army had reached the Baltic, trapping the German forces, who sought to escape by sea. Himmler was unable to devise any viable plans for completion of his military objectives. Under pressure from Hitler over the worsening military situation, Himmler became anxious and unable to give him coherent reports.|$|E

2500|$|Cave bear skeletons {{were first}} {{described}} in 1774 by Johann Friederich Esper {{in his book}} Newly Discovered Zoolites of Unknown Four Footed Animals. While scientists at the time considered that the skeletons could belong to apes, canids, felids, or even dragons or unicorns, Esper postulated that they actually belonged to polar bears. Twenty years later, Johann Christian Rosenmüller, an anatomist at the Leipzig University, gave the species its binomial name.

6000|$|One year, {{instead of}} the Highlands, Alt Aussee, in the <b>Steiermark,</b> was chosen for the holidays; and the place, the people, and the life delighted Fleeming. He worked hard at German, which he had much {{forgotten}} {{since he was a}} boy; and what is highly characteristic, equally hard at the patois, in which he learned to excel. He won a prize at a Schutzen-fest; and though he hunted chamois without much success, brought down more interesting game {{in the shape of the}} Styrian peasants, and in particular of his gillie, Joseph. This Joseph was much of a character; and his appreciations of Fleeming have a fine note of their own. The bringing up of the boys he deigned to approve of: 'FAST SO GUT WIE EIN BAUER,' was his trenchant criticism. The attention and courtly respect with which Fleeming surrounded his wife, was something of a puzzle to the philosophic gillie; he announced in the village that Mrs. Jenkin - DIE SILBERNE FRAU, as the folk had prettily named her from some silver ornaments - was a 'GEBORENE GRAFIN' who had married beneath her; and when Fleeming explained what he called the English theory (though indeed it was quite his own) of married relations, Joseph, admiring but unconvinced, avowed it was 'GAR SCHON.' [...] Joseph's cousin, Walpurga Moser, to an orchestra of clarionet and zither, taught the family the country dances, the Steierisch and the Landler, and gained their hearts during the lessons. Her sister Loys, too, who was up at the Alp with the cattle, came down to church on Sundays, made acquaintance with the Jenkins, and must have them up to see the sunrise from her house upon the Loser, where they had supper and all slept in the loft among the hay. The Mosers were not lost sight of; Walpurga still corresponds with Mrs. Jenkin, and it was a late pleasure of Fleeming's to choose and despatch a wedding present for his little mountain friend. This visit was brought to an end by a ball in the big inn parlour; the refreshments chosen, the list of guests drawn up, by Joseph; the best music of the place in attendance; and hosts and guests in their best clothes. The ball was opened by Mrs. Jenkin dancing Steierisch with a lordly Bauer, in gray and silver and with a plumed hat; and Fleeming followed with Walpurga Moser.|$|E
