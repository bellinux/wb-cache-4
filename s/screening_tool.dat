5|$|There are no {{specific}} blood tests that can diagnose cholangiocarcinoma by themselves. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19-9 are often elevated, {{but are not}} sensitive or specific enough {{to be used as}} a general <b>screening</b> <b>tool.</b> However, they may be useful in conjunction with imaging methods in supporting a suspected diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external validity of the AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the <b>screening</b> <b>tool.</b> The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E
40|$|Self-inflicted {{deaths in}} prisons in England and Wales, {{recently}} reported {{as the highest}} in over a decade, are a significant cause of mortality. A lack of guidelines surrounding the screening and identification of suicide risk of new prisoners along with a dearth of effective <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> indicate the need for review. Our aims are to examine findings {{on the effectiveness of}} prison specific suicide <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> used with adult prisoners. Papers were identified via systematic searches of databases, scanning grey literature, and reference checking. Included studies were published over the period between 2000 – 2016. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Studies were selected based on population – adult imprisoned offenders; intervention – suicide screening tool; comparators – participants screened vs. not screened outcome – suicide or attempted suicide. Data was extracted manually. A narrative synthesis presented the findings between different <b>screening</b> <b>tools.</b> Eight <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> were critically appraised. Evidence suggested that the VISCI and Dutch <b>screening</b> <b>tools</b> are most effective in identifying those at risk and reducing suicide and/or self-harm behavior. Variance in methodological quality and associated factors indicate the need for further development of prospective studies to develop robust <b>screening</b> <b>tools...</b>|$|R

25|$|Clinical {{observation}} – Clinical {{psychologists are}} also trained {{to gather data}} by observing behavior.

One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> for treatment or further testing.|$|E

25|$|The CAGE questionnaire, {{the name}} of which is an acronym of its four questions, is a widely used {{screening}} test for problem drinking and potential alcohol problems. The questionnaire takes less than one minute to administer, and is often used in primary care or other general settings as a quick <b>screening</b> <b>tool</b> {{rather than as an}} in-depth interview for those who have alcoholism. The CAGE questionnaire does not have a specific intended population, and is meant to find those who drink excessively and need treatment. The CAGE questionnaire is reliable and valid for assessment of alcohol abuse; however, it is not valid for diagnosis of other substance use disorders, although somewhat modified versions of the CAGE questionnaire have been frequently implemented for such a purpose.|$|E
25|$|DSC makes a {{reasonable}} initial safety <b>screening</b> <b>tool.</b> In this mode the sample will be {{housed in a}} non-reactive crucible (often gold or gold-plated steel), and which {{will be able to}} withstand pressure (typically up to 100 bar). The presence of an exothermic event can then be used to assess the stability of a substance to heat. However, due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity, slower than normal scan rates (typically 2–3 °C/min, due to much heavier crucible) and unknown activation energy, it is necessary to deduct about 75–100 °C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to suggest a maximal temperature for the material. A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an adiabatic calorimeter, but such a test may take 2–3 days from ambient at a rate of a 3 °C increment per half-hour.|$|E
