40|$|INTRODUCTION Continuous {{monitoring}} of the range stability is a pre-requisite for sea-level rise and other demanding applications in satellite altimetry. Range stability may be investigated by either absolute or relative calibration techniques. In this study relative calibration is undertaken through intercomparison against TOPEX/Poseidon and absolute calibration undertaken {{in the vicinity of}} 8 tide gauges around the UK. In the former, dual crossover residuals between ERS- 2 and TOPEX/Poseidon are analysed for the relative bias along with other spatial and geophysical parameters. The relative bias is subsequently corrected for the observed TOPEX drift as deduced by comparison against the global network of tide gauges. This procedure provides a better estimate of the relative bias than achieved by using the global tide gauge data set, as for TOPEX/Poseidon. In the absolute calibration approach, tide gauge measurements are extrapolated to the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>points</b> using local models for o...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{co-located}} {{observations from}} two different orbits lead to several advantages (i. e., cross calibration of sensors and {{a wider range of}} solar-zenith and sensor look angles). The question was asked how many times per year (on the average) do the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>points</b> of two satellites simultaneously come within D kilometers of each other? For the Space Station (altitude: 500 km, inclination: 28 deg) and a Sun synchronous satellite (altitude 705 km, inclination 98. 21 deg) the answers are 16, 41 and 82 times per year for encounter distances D of 20, 50, and 100 km respectively. The relationship between encounters per year and distance D is linear. The answers were obtained in two ways: (1) a closed form statistical approach which led to a simple algebraic expression, and (2) a Monte Carlo type computer solution. The largest difference between the two solutions was less than 12 percent...|$|R
30|$|In reality, it is {{rare that}} {{altimeter}} measurements are available precisely at the crossover times. The single-satellite crossover locations are found through the prediction of nominal crossovers followed by the interpolation of discrete <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>points</b> projected from satellite orbits (Shum, 1982; Schutz et al., 1982; Shum et al., 1990). Hence, the computed crossover height differences at different locations permit an internal accuracy assessment. It {{should be noted that}} due to the rough terrain, the acute angles at crossover points (due to difficulties in computing crossovers because of the polar orbital inclination), pointing error (i.e., the laser range measurements are not along the nadir position), and incomplete global coverage will increase the crossover residual root mean square (RMS), which may not be totally dominated by orbit and instrument errors. This may be largely because of the horizontal error—for example because the crossovers were computed using altimeter range measurements, which are not exactly in the nadir directions.|$|R

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of using Global Positioning System (GPS) data and {{a model of the}} ionosphere to supply a measure of the sub-satellite Total Electron Current (TEC) of the required accuracy (10 TECU rms) for the purpose of calibrating single frequency radar altimeter measurements. Since climatological (monthly mean) models are known to be in error by as much as 50 percent, this work focused on the Parameterized Real-Time Ionospheric Specification Model (PRISM) which has the capability to improve model accuracy by ingesting (adjusting to) in situ ionospheric measurements. A set of globally distributed TEC measurements were generated using GPS data and were used as input to improve the accuracy of the PRISM model. The adjusted PRISM TEC values were compared to TOPEX dual frequency TEC measurements (which are considered truth) for a number of TOPEX sub-satellite tracks. The adjusted PRISM values generally compared to the TOPEX measurements within the 10 TECU accuracy requirements when the sub-satellite track passed within 300 to 400 km of the GPS TEC data or when the track passed through a night time ionosphere. However, when the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>points</b> were greater than 300 to 400 km away from the GPS TEC data or when a local noon ionosphere was sampled, the adjusted PRISM values generally differed by greater than 10 TECU rms with data excursions from the TOPEX TEC measurements of as much as 40 TECU (an 8 cm path delay error at K band). Therefore, it can be concluded from this analysis that an unrealistically large number of GPS stations would be needed to predict sub-satellite TEC at the 10 TECU level in the day time ionosphere using a model such as PRISM. However, a technique currently being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) may provide a means of supplying adequate TEC data to meet the 10 TECU ionospheric correction accuracy when using a realistic number of ionospheric stations. This method involves using global GPS TEC data to estimate a global grid of vertical ionospheric TEC as a function of time (i. e. every one half hour) in a sun-fixed longitude frame. Working in a sun-fixed longitude frame, one is not limited by the spatial decorrelation distance of the ionosphere, but instead is limited more by the temporal correlations of the ionosphere in the sun-fixed frame which are a smaller effect. It is the opinion of the authors that using the global sun-fixed TEC grid data, in particular, ingesting it into PRISM, offers the best possibility of meeting the 10 TECU ionospheric correction accuracy requirement, and should be the subject of further study...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{trend for}} Earth Observation (EO) {{is to use}} constellations of small {{satellites}} for missions so far enabled only by large platforms, with relevant overall mission cost savings due to technology improvement and component miniaturization. The availability of a computationally light tool, capable of performing a parametric analysis of constellation performance {{as a function of}} number of satellites and orbital parameters and of estimating the link budget in a reliable way, is of fundamental importance in the preliminary phase of constellation design. Such a tool was recently developed in collaboration between SITAEL SpA and the University of Pisa and is presented and discussed in this paper. The code developed consists of three inter-related modules. The first module is dedicated to constellation design. Assumption the use of sun-synchronous repeating ground track orbits, this tool needs as input only the instrument field of view (FOV), the mean latitude and the characteristic size of the area of interest. For repeat cycles (RC) between 1 to 30 days, the altitudes are iteratively computed along with the number of satellites needed to cover the area of interest. For a constellation in a single plane, the module also provides the satellites phasing to cover the area adjacent to the area covered by the previous satellite; for a multi-plane constellation, the number of orbital planes and their relative phasing is provided. The propellant mass needed for drag compensation is estimated at each altitude using the NRLMSISE- 00 model. The constellation robustness, i. e. the of area covered in the case of failure of one or more satellites, is assessed considering a mean value of the ground track length in the area of interest. The second module performs post-processing of data from NASA’s General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) to analyze coverage and link performance among satellites and ground stations, as well as inter-satellite links. Variables imported from GMAT include position, velocity and temporal information. Coverage status of user-specified targets is evaluated based on the optical instrument parameters. Considering the user specified points as ground stations (GS), the link budget is then computed. For specified antenna types, the position of the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>points</b> are calculated relative to the electric field contour levels around a user-defined area. This approach therefore uses varying GS power output with fixed (maximum) gain, thus giving a range for uplink and downlink margins in terms of SNR and Eb/N 0. Losses due to rain, cloud and atmospheric gases are accounted for from ITU-R models, while transmission losses in cables are calculated based on look-up tables for both the ground and the space segment. For the SNR method, the user specifies the bandwidths of the receivers or transmitters and the required SNR. For the Eb/N 0 method, typical selectable modulation/demodulation schemes are incorporated in the tool. The third module computes visibility among all members of the satellite constellation, allowing for the computation of inter-satellite link budgets under the assumption that the satellites are pointing towards each other in the direction of maximum gain. In the paper, we present a number of selected EO mission test cases to show how the tool is used for the constellation design and the capabilities to performs link budgets in realistic mission scenarios, as well as the results of validation tests performed using the commercial STK software package. The advantages of using a simple, integrated tool for preliminary mission analysis, instead of a number of different software programs, are illustrated and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is the analysis, development and implementation of a precise autonomous orbit control system for a spacecraft in low Earth orbit. This thesis work represents a step forward in the theoretical formalization and implementation of an on-board orbit maintenance system. Two main approaches are identified for the realization of an on-board orbit control system. The first is the reconsideration and further development of state-of-the-art orbit control methods from the perspective of autonomy. A step forward is then taken {{in the direction of the}} definition of a general and rigorous formalization of the autonomous orbit control problem. The problem of the autonomous absolute orbit control is considered as a specific case of two spacecraft in formation in which one, the reference, is virtual and affected only by the Earth's gravitational field. A new parametrization, the relative Earth-Fixed elements, analogous to the relative orbital elements used for formation control, is introduced to describe the relative motion of the real and reference <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>points</b> on the Earth surface. An extensive discussion is dedicated to the reference orbit selection and generation process and the analysis of the free motion of a spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The reference orbit defines the spacecraft's nominal trajectory designed to satisfy the mission requirements. The actual orbit is kept within certain bounds defined with respect to the reference orbit. The generation process of the reference orbit is dealt in detail as it is the fundamental starting point of the orbit control chain. The free motion analysis is essential to understand the orbit perturbation environment which causes the deviation of the actual from the nominal trajectory. The use of the precise orbit determination data of the missions PRISMA and TerraSAR-X guarantee the reliability of the results of this analysis and the understanding of the orbit's perturbation environments at an altitude of 700 and 500 km. This study helps the definition of a proper control strategy. The control algorithms developed in the thesis can be divided into the two broad categories of analytical and numerical. An analytical algorithm for the maintenance of a repeat-track orbit is developed from the state-of-the-art methods and new analytical formulations for the reference orbit acquisition under different constraints and requirements are presented. The virtual formation method for the absolute orbit control is formalized by means of the relative Earth-fixed elements described previously. The state-space representation is used for the mathematical formulation of the problem. A linear and a quadratic optimal regulators, based on this model, are designed for the in-plane and out-of-plane absolute orbit control. Numerical simulations are performed for the validation of the control methods. The test platform includes a very accurate orbit propagator, the flight software and allows the simulation of actuators and navigation errors. The simulation results are evaluated from a performance and operational point of view in order to formulate a first conclusion about the advantages and disadvantages of the different control techniques. The main differences between the considered analytical and numerical control methods are outlined. The practical implementation of a precise autonomous orbit control system for a spacecraft in low Earth orbit is then described in detail. The on-board guidance, navigation and control software development, implementation and testing of the PRISMA mission, to which the author of this thesis contributed, is described. The attention is focused on the technological aspects implied by the realization of the autonomous orbit control system tested in-flight with the autonomous orbit keeping experiment on PRISMA. Among the several innovative aspects of the flight software development, some space is dedicated to the advanced software validation and testing realized on the formation flying test-bed at DLR, the German Aerospace Center, which played a fundamental role in the realization of the PRISMA mission and its experiments. Finally, the flight results of the autonomous orbit keeping experiment on the PRISMA mission, a fundamental milestone of this research work, are presented. This in-flight experiment took place in the summer of 2011 and demonstrated the capability of autonomous precise absolute orbit control using the analytical control method developed in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} observing a given set of Earth target sites within an {{assigned}} time frame is examined. Attention is given mainly to visiting these sites as <b>sub-satellite</b> nadir <b>points.</b> Solutions {{to this problem}} in the literature require thrusters to continuously maneuver the satellite from one site to another. A natural solution is proposed. A natural solution is a gravitational orbit that enables the spacecraft to satisfy the mission requirements without maneuvering. Optimization of a penalty function is performed to find natural solutions for satellite orbit configurations. This penalty function depends on the mission objectives. Two mission objectives are considered: maximum observation time and maximum resolution. The penalty function poses multi minima and a genetic algorithm technique is used to solve this problem. In the case {{that there is no}} one orbit satisfying the mission requirements, a multi-orbit solution is proposed. In a multi-orbit solution, the set of target sites is split into two groups. Then the developed algorithm is used to search for a natural solution for each group. The satellite has to be maneuvered between the two solution orbits. Genetic algorithms are used to find the optimal orbit transfer between the two orbits using impulsive thrusters. A new formulation for solving the orbit maneuver problem using genetic algorithms is developed. The developed formulation searches for a mini mum fuel consumption maneuver and guarantees that the satellite will be transferred exactly to the final orbit even if the solution is non-optimal. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of finding natural solutions for many case studies. The problem of the design of suitable satellite constellation for Earth observing applications is addressed. Two cases are considered. The first is the remote sensing missions for a particular region with high frequency and small swath width. The second is the interferometry radar Earth observation missions. In satellite constellations orbit's design, a new set of compatible orbits, called the "Two-way orbits",whose ground track path is a closed-loop trajectory that intersects itself, in some points, with tangent intersections is introduced. Conditions are derived on the orbital elements such that these Two-way Orbits exist and satellites flying in these orbits pass the tangent intersection points at the same time. Finally, the recently proposed concept of observing a space object from onboard a spacecraft using a star tracker is considered. The measurements of the star tracker provide directions to the target in space and do not provide range measurements. Estimation for the orbit of the target space object using the measurements of the star tracker is developed. An observability analysis is performed to derive conditions on the observability of the system states. The Gaussian Least Squares Differential Correction Technique is implemented. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of using the measurements of the star tracker to get a good estimate for the target orbit within a period of measurements ranging from about 20 percent to 50 percent of the orbital period depending on the two orbits...|$|R

40|$|The current {{generation}} of geosynchronous satellites exhibits considerably improved capabilities {{in the area of}} resolution, gridding accuracy, and sampling frequency as compared to their predecessors. These improvements have made it possible to accurately observe the life cycle of small scale, short-live phenomenon like rapidly developing thunderstorms, at a very high spatial and temporal resolutions. While the gain in the improved resolution is not significant for synoptic scale cloud systems, it plays a major role on the computation of precipitation values for mesoscale and stonn scale systems. Two of the important factor on the accurate precision of precipitation from satellite imagery are the position of the cloud tops as viewed by the satellite and the influence of orographic effects on the distribution of precipitation. The first problem {{has to do with the}} fact that the accurate estimation of precipitation from data collected by a satellite in geosynchronous orbit requires the knowledge of the exact position of the cloud tops with respect to the ground below. This is not a problem when a cloud is located directly below the satellite; at large viewing angles the geographic coordinates on satellite images are dependent on cloud heights and distance from the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point.</b> The latitude and longitude coordinates for high convective cloud tops are displaced away from the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point</b> and may be shifted by as much as 20 Km from the sea level coordinates. The second problem has to do with the variations in rainfall distribution with elevation. Ground observations have shown that precipitation amounts tend to increase with height and that the slope of the hill or mountain that is facing the prevailing wind normally receives greater rainfall then do the lee slopes. The purpose of the study is to show the recent developments at the Office of Research and Applications (ORA) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA/NESDIS) in Camp Springs, MD, USA, to adjust any satellite rainfall estimation technique and account for orographic and parallax corrections.

The longwave retrieval is based on a simple linear combination of brightness temperatures from the SEVIRI infrared channels. The shortwave retrieval is based on a neural network that requires as input the visible and near-infrared SEVIRI channels. Both LW and SW algorithms have been validated by comparing their results with CERES and GERB irradiance observations. While being less accurate than their dedicated counterparts, the SEVIRI-based methods have two major advantages compared to CERES and GERB: their higher spatial resolution and the better temporal resolution.

These channels correspond to bands: visible (VIS 0.6), near infrared (NIR 1.6), water vapor (WV 6.2, WV 7.3) and infrared (IR 3.9, IR 8.7, IR 10.8 and IR 12.0). The raw image (level 1.5) has a size of 3, 712  ×  3, 712 pixels in each channel (Eumetsat 2004). This corresponds to a spatial resolution at the image center of about 3  km.

The overall changes to the Imager will improve several satellite products, such as cloud properties and satellite-derived wind fields. In contrast, products that utilize the information provided by the 12 /-Lm band to characterize low-level moisture and to differentiate between cloud types and volcanic ash may be degraded.

While being less accurate than their dedicated counterparts, the SEVIRI-based methods have two major advantages compared to CERES and GERB: their higher spatial resolution and the better temporal resolution. With our retrievals it is possible to observe the radiative effect of small-scale features such as cumulus clouds, cirrus clouds, or aircraft contrails. The spatial resolution of SEVIRI is 3 km &times 3 km in the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point,</b> remarkably better than that of CERES (20 km) or GERB (45 km). The temporal resolution is 15 min (5 min in the rapid-scan mode), the same as GERB, but significantly better than that of CERES which, being on board of a polar orbiting satellite, has a temporal resolution as low as 2 overpasses per day...|$|E
40|$|Context. The ESA Rosetta {{mission has}} been {{investigating}} the environment of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67 P) since August 2014. Among the experiments on board the spacecraft, the ROSINA experiment (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) includes two mass spectrometers to analyse the composition of neutrals and ions and a COmet Pressure Sensor (COPS) to monitor the density and velocity of neutrals in the coma. Aims. We study heterogeneities in the coma during three periods starting in October 2014 (summer in the northern hemisphere) and ending in February 2016 (end of winter in the northern hemisphere). We provide {{a detailed description of}} the main volatiles dynamics (H 2 O, CO 2, CO) and their abundance ratios. Methods. We analysed and compared the data of the Reflectron-Type Time-Of-Flight (RTOF) mass spectrometer with data from both the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) and COPS during the comet escort phase. This comparison has demonstrated that the observations performed with each ROSINA sensor are indeed consistent. Furthermore, we used a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) model to compare modelled densitites with in situ detections. Results. Our analysis shows how the active regions of the main volatiles evolve with the seasons with a variability mostly driven by the illumination conditions; this is the case except for an unexpected dichotomy suggesting the presence of a dust layer containing water deposited in the northern hemisphere during previous perihelions hiding the presence of CO 2. The influence of various parameters is investigated in detail: distance to the comet, heliocentric distance, longitude and latitude of <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point,</b> local time, and phase angle...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical solution for a low-thrust maneuver {{to reduce the}} flyover time of a given terrestrial target. The work extends the general solution previously developed by the authors for a 3 -phase spiral transfer that results in {{a change in the}} relative right ascension of the ascending node and argument of latitude of satellites in a constellation, by varying the orbital period and the J 2 effect experienced by each satellite. This work improves the accuracy of the existing method by including the periodic effects of J 2 in the analytical solution. Using these improved equations, a calculation of the flyover time of a given latitude can be determined, and the passes for which the target longitude is in view identified. Validation against a numerical orbit propagator shows the analytical method to accurately predict the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point</b> of the satellite to within ± 1 ° of longitude after 15 days. A case study is performed showing that the method can successfully be used to reduce the time of flyover of Los Angeles from 14 days to just 1. 97 days, with a change of velocity (ΔV) of 63 m/s. The full exploration of the solution space shows the problem to be highly complex, such that an increase in the ΔV used for a maneuver will not necessarily reduce the time of flyover, potentially making optimization using a numerical solution challenging. It also shows that very similar flyover times can be achieved with very different ΔV usage. As such, an overview of the solution space is extremely valuable in allowing an informed trade-off between the time of flyover and maneuver ΔV...|$|E
40|$|There is {{currently}} {{a strong interest in}} obtaining highly accurate measurements of solar radiation reflected by Earth. For example, the Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial- and Helio- Studies (TRUTHS) satellite mission has been under consideration in Europe for several years, and planning is now under way for the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) spacecraft in the United States. Such spacecraft will provide measurements whose high accuracy is traceable to SI standards; these measurements will be useful as a reference for calibrating similar instruments on board other spacecraft. Hence, analysis of opportunities for intercalibration between two spacecraft {{plays an important role in}} the planning of future missions. In order for intercalibration to take place, the measurements obtained from two spacecraft must have similar viewing geometry and be taken within a few minutes of one another. Viewing geometry is characterized in terms of viewing zenith angle, solar zenith angle, and relative azimuth angle. Opportunities for intercalibration are greater in number and longer in duration if the sensor with high accuracy can be aimed at points on the surface of the Earth other than the nadir or <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point.</b> Analysis of intercalibration over long periods is rendered tractable by making several simplifying assumptions regarding orbital motions of the two spacecraft about Earth, as well as Earth s orbit about the Sun. The shape of the Earth is also considered. A geometric construction called a tent is introduced to facilitate analysis. It is helpful to think of an intercalibration opportunity as the passage of one spacecraft through a tent that has a fixed shape and moves with the spacecraft whose measurements are to be calibrated. Selection of points on Earth s surface as targets for measurement is discussed, as is aiming the boresight of a steerable instrument. Analysis results for a pair of spacecraft in typical low Earth orbits are provided...|$|E
40|$|The Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) aboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) {{launched}} in 2003 by EUMETSAT {{is dedicated to}} the Nowcasting applications and Numerical Weather Prediction and to provide information for climate monitoring and research. We use the data in visible and near infrared channels to derive the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) over land. The algorithm {{is based on the assumption}} that the Top Of the Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance increases with the aerosol load. This is a reasonable assumption except in case of absorbing aerosols above bright surfaces. We assume that the minimum in a 14 -day time series of the TOA reflectance is, once corrected from gaseous scattering and absorption, representative of the surface reflectance. The AOT and the aerosol model (a set of 5 models are used), are retrieved by matching the simulated TOA reflectance with the TOA reflectances measured by SEVIRI in its visible and Near Infra-Red (NIR) spectral bands. The high temporal resolution of the data acquisition by SEVIRI allows to retrieve the AOT every 15 min with a spatial resolution of 3 km at <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point,</b> over the whole SEVIRI disk which covers Europe, Africa and part of South America. The resulting AOT, a Level 2 product at the same temporal and spatial resolution than SEVIRI, is presented and evaluated in this paper. The AOT has been validated using ground based measurements from AERONET, a sun-photometer network, focusing over Europe for 3 months in 2006. The SEVIRI estimates correlate well with the AERONET measurements, r = 0. 64, with a slight underestimate, bias = − 0. 017. The sources of errors are mainly the cloud contamination and the bad estimation of the surface reflectance. The temporal evolutions exhibited by both dataset show very good agreement which allows to conclude that the AOT Level 2 product from SEVIRI can be used to quantify the aerosol content and to monitor its daily evolution with a high temporal frequency. The comparison with daily maps of MODIS AOT level 3 product shows qualitative good agreements in the retrieved geographic patterns of AOT. Given the high spatial and temporal resolutions obtained with this approach, our results have clear potential for applications ranging from air quality monitoring to climate studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of cirrus clouds on the radiation {{budget of the}} Earth depends on their optical properties and their global coverage. The monitoring of cirrus coverage with instruments aboard geostationary satellites enables the investigation of cirrus clouds at the global scale {{as well as the}} identification of their diurnal variation. For instance, the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) aboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites provides data with high temporal resolution of 15 min and a spatial resolution of 3 km × 3 km at the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point.</b> In addition, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the sun-synchronous platforms Terra and Aqua delivers at least one observation per day with a high spatial resolutions ranging from 250 m × 250 m to 1 km × 1 km. Since the infrared channels of the SEVIRI instrument are suitable for an observation which is independent from day-light, Krebs et al. (2007) developed a cirrus detection algorithm for SEVIRI (called MeCiDA), based solely on its thermal channels. Since MeCiDA was optimised for the area of Europe only, we present an improved version of the algorithm which allows application to the full Meteosat disc. Required changes include the consideration of the viewing angle dependency and of the sensitivity of the 9. 7 &mu;m channel to the ozone column. To this end, a correction is implemented that minimises the {{influence of}} the variability of the stratospheric ozone. The validation of the proposed improvements is carried out by using MeCiDA applied to MODIS data to address viewing angle-dependent cirrus detection and by additionally comparing it to the Cloud Optical Properties MOD 06 cirrus product. The new MeCiDA version detects less cirrus than the original one for latitudes larger than 40 &deg; but almost the same amount elsewhere. MeCiDA's version for MODIS is more sensitive than that for SEVIRI with cirrus occurrences higher by 10 %, and the new MeCiDA provides almost the same cirrus coverage (± 0. 1) as given by the Cloud Phase Optical Properties from MODIS for latitudes smaller than 50 &deg;. Finally, the influence of sub-pixel clouds on the SEVIRI cirrus detection has been examined: more than 60 % of the undetected SEVIRI cirrus pixels have a cirrus coverage smaller than 0. 5...|$|E
40|$|Clouds {{play a very}} {{important}} role in the water cycle of the Earth. At the same time, they control the radiation budget of the Earth-atmosphere system, by reflection, absorption, and emission of solar and thermal radiation. Clouds are highly variable in time; their life cycle is poorly understood yet. The new Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary satellite with its main instrument SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager), provides comprehensive spectral information over the Earth disk observed from its nominal position of 3. 4 °W 0 °N with a fast repeat cycle of 15 minutes which is excellently suited for the remote sensing of the life cycle of clouds. SEVIRI comprises 11 calibrated spectral channels in the visible and infrared spectral ranges, with a spatial resolution of 3 km x 3 km at the subsatellite point. In addition, it is equipped with a broadband high resolution visible (HRV) channel with a ground sampling distance of about 1 km at the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point.</b> Using these data, we are able to quantitatively derive detailed macro- and microphysical properties of clouds at an unprecendented time resolution of 15 minutes, allowing {{for the first time to}} study the formation, evolution, and dissipation of clouds from space. The investigation of the temporal evolution of the droplet and particle radius of clouds has the potential to shed new light e. g. on the process of rain formation. The modification of the cloud micro- and macrophysical structure with time has a strong impact on radiative forcing and consequently on climate. We will show examples of the temporal evolution of the main cloud properties, optical thickness, phase, and effective radius. A particular attention will be given to cirrus clouds because - due to their high altitude close to the coldest point of the radiatively relevant atmosphere - their trapping of thermal radiation often over-compensates the reflection of solar radiation, thus leading to a considerable warming of the Earth-atmosphere system in particular during night time. The time step of 15 minutes allows conclusions about the origin of clouds, and helps to better quantify their effect on the radiation budget. While polar-orbiting systems only provide singular snapshots, the geostationary perspective allows to follow clouds from their formation to their dissipation, thus allowing to quantify the total effect on the radiation budget...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing {{changes in}} {{landscape}} fire activity at better than hourly temporal resolution is achievable using thermal observations of actively burning fires made from geostationary Earth Observation (EO) satellites. Over {{the last decade}} or more, a series of research and/or operational "active fire" products have been developed from geostationary EO data, often with the aim of supporting biomass burning fuel consumption and trace gas and aerosol emission calculations. Such Fire Radiative Power (FRP) products are generated operationally from Meteosat by the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (LSA SAF) and are available freely every 15 min in both near-real-time and archived form. These products map the location of actively burning fires and characterize their rates of thermal radiative energy release (FRP), which is believed proportional to rates of biomass consumption and smoke emission. The FRP-PIXEL product contains the full spatio-temporal resolution FRP data set derivable from the SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) imager onboard Meteosat at a 3 km spatial sampling distance (decreasing away from the west African <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point),</b> whilst the FRP-GRID product is an hourly summary at 5 ° grid resolution that includes simple bias adjustments for meteorological cloud cover and regional underestimation of FRP caused primarily by underdetection of low FRP fires. Here we describe the enhanced geostationary Fire Thermal Anomaly (FTA) detection algorithm used to deliver these products and detail the methods used to generate the atmospherically corrected FRP and per-pixel uncertainty metrics. Using SEVIRI scene simulations and real SEVIRI data, including from a period of Meteosat- 8 "special operations", we describe certain sensor and data pre-processing characteristics that influence SEVIRI's active fire detection and FRP measurement capability, and use these to specify parameters in the FTA algorithm and to make recommendations for the forthcoming Meteosat Third Generation operations in relation to active fire measures. We show that the current SEVIRI FTA algorithm is able to discriminate actively burning fires covering down to 10 − 4 of a pixel and that it appears more sensitive to fire than other algorithms used to generate many widely exploited active fire products. Finally, we briefly illustrate the information contained within the current Meteosat FRP-PIXEL and FRP-GRID products, providing example analyses for both individual fires and multi-year regional-scale fire activity; the companion paper (Roberts et al., 2015) provides a full product performance evaluation and a demonstration of product use within components of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) ...|$|E
40|$|A frozen orbit is {{an orbit}} chosen {{such that the}} effect of {{perturbations}} on (a combination of) the mean orbital elements is minimized. The concept first appeared in literature in 1978, and was applied that same year to the Seasat mission. This altimetry mission featured strict requirements on the accuracy of the altitude of the satellite above the sea surface. By designing an orbit for which the mean eccentricity and mean argument of periapsis remain static, the satellite’s altitude will theoretically be constant, depending only on location of the <b>sub-satellite</b> <b>point.</b> Classically, the theory behind frozen orbits is only based on the J 2 - and J 3 -term of the spherical har- monics gravity field model and clever manipulation of the Lagrange planetary equations. Through considerable analytical effort, it is possible to include all other zonal gravity field terms into the equation, but this approach is limited to perturbations that can be cast into the form of a disturbing potential. The aim of this thesis is to find a numerical method that overcomes this limit and to use that method to investigate the effects of including third-body gravity, atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure on the mean orbital elements. To do this, the frozen orbit problem is formulated as an optimization problem. Use is made of Differential Evolution (DE) and grid searching to simulate many trajectories and to find a set of injection parameters that results in a minimal variation in the mean eccentricity and mean argument of periapsis. The mean elements are reconstructed from the osculating elements by making use of the Eckstein-Ustinov theory and subsequent numerical averaging. In combination with Precise Orbit Determination (POD) data, this reconstruction is used to investigate the variations in the mean orbital elements of ERS- 2 and TOPEX/Poseidon. Subsequently, the numerical method is applied to various orbital dynamics models. When applied to zonal gravity fields, the new method is found to be in good agreement with analytical solutions. The influence of other perturbations on solutions found in zonal models is examined, and it is found that taking these perturbations into account during the optimization process does not lead to significant improvements with respect to the simple zonal case, nor does it lead to significant changes in the found injection conditions. For the assumed satellite characteristics, radiation pressure is found to be the most influential perturbation, causing fluctuations in the mean eccentricity of ± 3 %.
