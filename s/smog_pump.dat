2500|$|Regular Chevelle engines {{started with}} a [...] Turbo-Thrift six or the new [...] Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a [...] version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual {{transmission}} cars got GM's [...] "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" [...] <b>smog</b> <b>pump.</b> New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights, as well as shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.|$|E
2500|$|The XRS trim {{included}} an engine upgrade to Toyota's higher-performance 2ZZ-GE [...] engine. Displacing , or 109.6 cubic inches, it produced [...] and [...] – a then-rare 100horsepower-per-liter. While its 11.5:1 compression ratio {{was a large}} factor in its performance, the engine could change to a second cam profile at higher RPMs through Toyota's VVTL-i and was designed for operation up to 8500RPM. The engine's high compression necessitates [...] "premium" [...] gasoline (91 octane or above in the (R+M)/2 scale). With the exception of an available automatic in 2003, a six-speed manual transmission was the only gearbox offered in the XRS. A Transitional Low Emission Vehicle (TLEV) its first year of production, the 2ZZ was retrofitted in 2004 with a <b>smog</b> <b>pump</b> and reclassified as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV).|$|E
5000|$|Accessories — The {{crankshaft}} pulley diameter decreased by 14% (as {{compared to the}} GT) in order to under-drive the alternator, A/C, and <b>smog</b> <b>pump,</b> all to increase power. The water pump pulley also decreased in diameter by the same amount {{in order to preserve}} the ratio of pump speed, and thus coolant flow. These smaller accessory pulleys necessitated a shorter serpentine belt. Part Numbers: F3ZZ-6A312-A (crank pulley), F3ZZ-8509-A (water pump pulley), and F3ZZ-8620-A (belt).|$|E
50|$|The 2004 and newer Matrix and Corolla XRS {{models were}} {{equipped}} with <b>smog</b> <b>pumps</b> {{and have an}} extra hole above each exhaust port in the engine head and manifold where air is injected to achieve complete fuel burning before the exhaust stream reaches the catalyst. All 2ZZ-GE heads from 03/03 onwards carry this modification even if the vehicle {{does not have the}} air injection system.|$|R
5000|$|The next upgrade was {{presented}} at the London Motor Show in October 1966. Besides receiving the larger 1275 cc engine (which disappointed enthusiasts by being in a lower state of tune than that of the Mini-Cooper 'S'), the Mark IV and its cousin the Mark III MG Midget had several changes which were more than cosmetic. Most notable is the change from a removable convertible top, which had to be stowed in the boot, to a permanently affixed, folding top of greatly improved design, which was much easier to use. Separate brake and clutch master cylinders were fitted, as car manufacturers' thoughts began to turn to making their products safer. On US market versions the larger engine sacrificed some of its performance from 1968 on, through the use of <b>smog</b> <b>pumps</b> and other modifications to comply with federal emission control requirements. 1969 was the final year the Sprite was exported to the US. At the same time reversing lamps were made a standard fitment and the cars' electrical system was switched to negative earth and powered by an alternator rather than a dynamo. This was also the first year that reclining seats were fitted.|$|R
5000|$|All MGBs (except the V8 version) {{utilized}} the BMC B-Series engine. This engine was essentially an enlarged {{version of that}} used in the MGA with displacement being increased from 1,622 to 1,798 cc. The earlier cars used a three-main-bearing crankshaft, 18G-series. In February 1964 positive crank-case breathing was introduced and the engine prefix changed to 18GA, until October 1964, when a five-bearing crankshaft design was introduced, the engine prefix became 18GB. Horsepower was rated at 95net bhp on both five-main-bearing and earlier three-bearing cars with peak power coming at 5,400 rpm with a 6,000 rpm redline. Torque output on the MGB had a peak of 110 lbft Nm and fuel consumption was around 25 mpg. US specification cars saw power fall in 1968 {{with the introduction of}} emission standards and the use of air or <b>smog</b> <b>pumps.</b> In 1971 UK spec cars still had [...] at 5,500 rpm, with 105 lbft Nm torque at 2,500 rpm. Engine prefixes became 18V and the SU carburettor needles were changed for reasons of the latest emission regulations, under ECE15. By 1973 it was by 1974 it was 87, with 103 lbft Nm torque; by 1975 it was 85 with 100 lbft Nm. Some California specification cars produced only around [...] by the late 1970s. The compression ratio was also reduced from 9 to 1 to 8 to 1 on US spec cars in 1972.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968 For 1968, Chevelle got a {{new body}} style (though still under the 817 and 817 {{internal}} designations) emphasized the [...] "Coke bottle" [...] look even more. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights on each fender, as well as shoulder belts for outboard front-seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967. This explains why some '68s had shoulder belts, and some early-production cars did not. However, all '68s had anchors for the belts. Manual transmission cars got GM's [...] "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" [...] <b>smog</b> <b>pump,</b> which added complexity under the hood.|$|E

5000|$|The 1968 Chevelle {{received}} an all-new distinctly sculpted body with tapered front fenders and a rounded beltline. The car adopted a long-hood/short-deck profile {{with a high}} rear-quarter [...] "kick-up". While all 1967 Chevelle models rode a 115 in wheelbase, the 1968 coupes and convertibles now rode a 112 in wheelbase. The sedans and wagons turned to a 116 in span. Tread width grew an inch front and rear. Hardtop coupes featured a semi-fastback, flowing roofline. Top-trim models (including the SS 396 and new luxury Concours) featured GM's new Hide-A-Way wiper system. Lesser Chevelles would get that change later. The Super Sport (SS396 sport coupe, convertible, and El Camino pickup) became series on its own. Chevrolet produced 60,499 SS 396 sport coupes, 2,286 convertibles, and 5,190 El Caminos; 1968 was the only year the El Camino body style would get its own SS396 series designation (13880). Black-accented Super Sports had F70x14 red-stripe tires and a standard 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch Turbo-Jet V8 engine with the special twin-domed hood; 350 and 375-horsepower 396 engines were optional. The SS 396 sport coupe started at $2,899 - or $236 more than a comparable Malibu with its 307-cubic-inch V8. All-vinyl bucket seats and a console were optional. Three luxury Concours options became available in March 1968 for the 4-door sedan, the 4-door sport sedan and consisted of special sound insulation, and a deep-padded instrument panel with simulated woodgrain accents and all-vinyl color-keyed interiors. These Concours options (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) {{should not be confused}} with the two Concours station wagons. Also new for 1968 was the elimination of the term [...] "sedan" [...] for the 2-door pillar body style. This was now called a coupe (or pillar coupe) while the 2-door hardtop remained a sport coupe. These coupe/sport coupe designations would continue into 1969 as well.The Concours Estate Wagon was one of four distinct Chevelle wagon models. A one-year Nomad, Nomad Custom was offered.Regular Chevelle engines started with a [...] Turbo-Thrift six or the new [...] Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a [...] version of the 327-cubic-inch V8.

50|$|With skyrocketing oil and {{gas prices}} (the price {{of oil in the}} US had more than quadrupled) due to the OPEC oil embargo in late 1973, the much smaller, far more {{efficient}} Japanese and European cars (which utilized four-cylinder engines, unibody construction, and, most, front-wheel drive) dramatically increased in popularity. American automakers' attempts at compensating were relatively poorly received, as the offered vehicles (including its homegrown compacts e.g. Chevrolet Nova, Ford Maverick and subcompacts (Pinto, Vega)) were still much heavier and less efficient. This included detuning the powertrain to meet emission standards (from the use of EGR valves, <b>smog</b> air <b>pumps,</b> and the early catalytic converter designs with a restrictive catalyst brick (unlike the modern day variant using a monolithic brick). Detuned engines later gained electronic carburetors (used with an early variant of a powertrain control module which pre-dated OBDII) until the advent of electronic fuel injection by the mid-1980s (first with the musclecar survivors and later extended to full and mid-size automobiles). Additionally, import automakers introduced North America only models that were somewhat larger (though not as large as most American brand models) to appeal to existing preferences - the larger sized imports (usually Asian marques especially the Japanese makes where the larger sized car was subjected to higher vehicle taxation in its own home market - usually a car model which is designed for the North American (USA/Canada) market e.g. a USDM Honda Accord or Nissan Altima) were considered acceptable by North American consumers when mass-market Asian automakers established their transplant assembly plants in the United States, Canada, and Mexico once the 1981 Voluntary Export Restraints was passed by the U.S. Congress.|$|R
