50|$|The <b>SDIP</b> was set {{up because}} it's members believe the world of {{development}} finance is often crowded and uncoordinated. According to the <b>SDIP</b> {{the aim is to}} adopt a practical approach and deliver scale, speed, transaction efficiency and risk mitigation. Their own goals is to achieve $100 billions of dollars per year of additional finance over five years). <b>SDIP</b> supports inclusive growth and poverty alleviation through investments in areas such as water and sanitation systems, transportation, clean energy, agriculture, health, telecommunications and climate adaptation.|$|E
50|$|The Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (<b>SDIP)</b> is a {{partnership}} whose {{purpose is to}} contribute to financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations. <b>SDIP</b> brings together public and private entities—from both developed and developing countries—that share an ambition to scale up sustainable infrastructure investments in developing countries. <b>SDIP</b> was launched at the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July 2015 with 20 founding members, which has now expanded to 30. The World Economic Forum and OECD are currently providing institutional support to the partnership.|$|E

50|$|The <b>SDIP</b> {{was founded}} to help bridge the huge funding gap towards the SDGs; thus {{a large share}} of the {{projects}} are located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the $30 billion projects <b>SDIP</b> is facilitating worldwide, over $20 billion are located in Africa. Consequently, the partnership has dedicated an African hub within which the partnership is looking to build local capacity and ease the exchange of best practices across its network of institutions.|$|E

50|$|In Massachusetts {{point system}} {{is known as}} Safe Driver Insurance Plan (<b>SDIP).</b> This {{encourages}} safe driving with lower premiums for drivers who do not cause accidents or commit traffic violations, and by ensuring that high-risk drivers pay {{a greater share of}} insurance costs. The points are accumulated over a six-year period, and reduced for sustained periods of safe driving.|$|E
50|$|<b>SDIP</b> usesBlended Finance by {{creating}} a platform where public and private entities can interact by co-investing and coordinating on a pipeline of specific projects. In order to mobilize private sector investment, members of the partnership collaborate to review practical experience in individual investment projects with a view toward scaling up existing initiatives, sharing existing knowledge, tools and new approaches to financing.|$|E

40|$|A spleen-derived {{immunosuppressive}} peptide (<b>SDIP)</b> {{has been}} purified to homogeneity. Its physicochemical properties (electrophoretic mobility, u. v. spectra, absence of dansyl derivative) and its enzymatic susceptibilities (proteolytic enzymes, RNase, and DNase) {{were similar to}} those of the thymic hormone 'FTS'. <b>SDIP</b> and FTS were eluted with identical retention times in high performance liquid chromatography analysis in three different systems. When tested in sheep cell rosettes, and in the FTS radioimmunoassay in J. F. Bach's laboratory, <b>SDIP</b> presented an activity similar to FTS. In order to compare the thymic hormone to <b>SDIP</b> the biological activity of FTS was determined in in vivo and in in vitro humoral immunity reactions to a T-dependent antigen. As <b>SDIP,</b> FTS inhibited in vivo and in vitro the 19 S-bearing cell formation during the last step of the differentiation of the lymphocytes, in the same range of concentration. The two factors appeared to stimulate the incorporation of [3 H]-thymidine into the DNA of short-term cultures of thymocytes. The similarity of biological properties of <b>SDIP</b> and FTS together with the similarity observed in the physico-chemical and biochemical properties led to the conclusion that bovine spleen contains a factor similar to FTS...|$|E
40|$|Some {{biological}} {{properties of}} a highly-purified non-cytotoxic spleen-derived immunosuppressive peptide (<b>SDIP)</b> have been investigated. <b>SDIP</b> {{was shown to}} inhibit the primary anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) response at the last step of differentiation of the lymphocyte. In the present study we demonstrated that this response seemed to be T- and adherent spleen-cell dependent as no inhibition was noticed either in the response to TNP-LPS, a T-independent antigen, or in the response to SRBC in adherent spleen cell-depleted cultures. <b>SDIP</b> activity did not occur through an inhibition of splenocytes DNA synthesis since [3 H]-thymidine ([3 H]-TdR) incorporation was not modified in mitogen or allogenic stimulated cultures. Conversely, <b>SDIP</b> could act through a stimulation of a T-cell subset as a low specific increase of [3 H]-TdR was noticed in cultured thymocytes...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Nepal's Safe Delivery Incentive Programme (<b>SDIP)</b> was {{introduced}} nationwide in 2005 {{with the aim}} of encouraging greater use of professional care at childbirth. It provided cash to women giving birth in a public health facility and an incentive to the health provider for each delivery attended, either at home or in the facility. We aimed {{to assess the impact of}} the programme on neonatal mortality and health care seeking behaviour at childbirth in one district of Nepal. METHODS: Impacts were identified using an interrupted time series approach, applied to houSehold data. We estimated a model linking the level of each outcome at a point in time to the start of the programme, demographic controls, a vector of time variables and community-level fixed effects. FINDINGS: The recipients of the cash transfer in the programme's first two years were disproportionately wealthier households, reflecting existing inequality in the use of government maternity services. In places with women's groups [...] where information about the policy was widely disseminated [...] the <b>SDIP</b> substantially increased skilled birth attendance, but failed to impact on either neonatal mortality or the caesarean section rate. In places with no women's groups, the <b>SDIP</b> had no impact on utilisation outcomes or neonatal mortality. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY: The lack of any impact on neonatal mortality suggests that greater increases in utilisation or better quality of care are needed to improve health outcomes. The <b>SDIP</b> changed health care seeking behaviour only in those areas with women's groups highlighting the importance of effective communication of the policy to the wider public...|$|E
40|$|Immunophenotypic {{changes in}} {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes (T, B, and NK cells) in patients during shigellosis {{was characterized by}} using triple-color flow cytometry. Eleven Shigella dysenteriae 1 -infected adult patients (<b>SDIP),</b> 11 Shigella flexneri-infected adult patients (SFIP), 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from Bangladesh (C-B), and 15 healthy volunteers from Sweden (V-S) were studied. In <b>SDIP</b> and SFIP, {{a significant increase in}} the CD 45 RO+ cells in both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells were seen. We found evidence for sequential T-cell activation, as shown by increased proportions of CD 25 and CD 4 + cells; HLA-DR and CD 38 on CD 8 + cells, and CD 54 on CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells. We found differences in the lymphocyte activation and subset patterns related to the infecting Shigella species. Thus, a decrease in CD 45 expression was seen in SFIP; this decrease progressed further during the disease. The proportions of NK cells (CD 56 + cells) and CD 3 - CD 8 + cells out of the total CD 8 + cells were increased in SFIP but not in <b>SDIP.</b> The CD 3 + CD 8 + CD 57 + T-cell subset was significantly lower in <b>SDIP</b> than in C-B. The proportion of B-lymphocyte-expressing activation markers CD 80 and CD 23 was higher in patients than in C-B. There was {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of CD 4 + T cells and a significant decrease in the percentages of total B cells, the CD 3 + CD 8 + CD 57 + T-cell subset, and the CD 56 + CD 16 + NK-cell subset for V-S compared with C-B. Our results indicate that distinct subset changes and activation patterns are elicited in <b>SDIP</b> compared with SFIP and also that the degree of activation is related to disease severity. In addition, a common sequence of cell activation was seen during the disease course. The difference in the subset patterns seen in C-B and V-S may be related to differences in the levels or spectra of infectious agents in the environment...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} humoral {{immunological}} responses at the subclass level in shigellosis, specific antibody responses against Shigella dysenteriae 1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), S. flexneri Y LPS, invasion plasmid-coded protein antigens (Ipa), and Shiga toxin were analyzed. Antibody responses of 41 patients with S. dysenteriae 1 infection (<b>SDIP)</b> and 15 patients with S. flexneri infection (SFIP) {{were compared with}} those of controls (n = 40). The levels of total immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgM, and albumin in serum and stool samples were analyzed. In addition, total IgA (t-IgA), secretory IgA (s-IgA), and antigen-specific s-IgA in fecal samples were analyzed to evaluate the specificities and magnitudes of the mucosal immune responses. By comparing the relative increases in optical density for each IgG subclass separately, it was determined that the anti-LPS (homologous) response initially increased in the order IgG 2 > IgG 1 > IgG 3 > IgG 4 and that this order changed to IgG 2 > IgG 3 > IgG 1 > IgG 4 later in the disease. The IgG subclass response against protein antigens initially showed the order IgG 1 > IgG 3 > IgG 2 > IgG 4, which changed to IgG 3 > IgG 1 > IgG 2 > IgG 4 later in the disease. A significant increase in the proportion of IgA 2 among t-IgA compared with that in controls was seen in both <b>SDIP</b> and SFIP, while significant changes in the proportions of IgG 1 and IgG 2 among t-IgG compared with controls was seen only in <b>SDIP.</b> The anti-LPS IgA 2 response was more prominent in <b>SDIP</b> than in SFIP. We found an early peak of antigen-specific s-IgA in fecal samples, with a shorter duration than the corresponding response in serum samples. The simultaneous increase of serum IgA, fecal t-IgA, and s-IgA in <b>SDIP</b> compared with those in SFIP suggests that there is a massive increase in the local IgA production, giving an increase in systemic IgA concomitant with an extensive gut mucosal inflammation leading to an increased loss of albumin, IgG, and IgA with a high ratio of t-IgA to s-IgA...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{incentives}} {{are increasingly being}} advocated as an effective means to influence health-related behaviours. There is, however, limited evidence on whether they work in low-income countries, particularly when implemented at scale. This paper explores {{the impact of a}} national programme in Nepal that provides cash incentives to women conditional on them giving birth in a health facility. Using propensity score matching methods, we find that the programme had a positive, albeit modest, effect on the utilisation of maternity services. Women who had heard of the <b>SDIP</b> before childbirth were 4. 2 percentage points (17 percent) more likely to deliver with a skilled attendant. The treatment effect is positively associated with the size of the financial package offered by the programme and the quality of care in facilities. Despite the positive effect on those exposed to the <b>SDIP,</b> low coverage of the programme suggests that few women actually benefited in the first few years. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Background: Antenatal (ANC) and Safe Delivery Incentive Program (<b>SDIP)</b> of Nepal is {{implemented}} {{with the view}} to increase institutional delivery, thereby improving maternal health. The program has been a public issue regarding its information cum. incentive received by the clients and reimbursement to the health facilities. The study aimed to identify and assess the knowledge with financial benefits received by mothers from 4 ANC visits and institutional delivery. Methods : Descriptive study was conducted among six villages of Syangja district, Nepal in December 2013. Data was taken from mothers who had delivered during the last one year of study. Full concern was adapted to consent, anonymity, confidentiality and validity. Epi-data and SPSS were used for analysis and interpretation of data. Results: Among the total 414 mothers, 60. 6 % and 82. 9 % were aware on 4 ANC incentive and <b>SDIP</b> respectively. Total, consulted, mothers who had delivered in health-facility (n= 212) received delivery incentive. Comparing the delivery benefits with ANC (n= 212), 65. 4 % of mothers were deprived from ANC incentive though they practiced scheduled ANC visit. As an interesting fact, some other cases of non-ANC visit (n= 3) and less than four/non-scheduled visit (n= 8) were benefited from the ANC incentive {{as opposed to the}} rule of scheme. Analysis has shown that mothers who were aware on ANC incentive scheme were 5. 2 times more likely to receive incentive than those of unaware one. Conclusion: The utilization of ANC incentive is found {{to be the result of}} its level of awareness. Government and concerned authority should valuably focus on ANC incentive program to increase its utilization like <b>SDIP...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{turbulent}} mixing of a passive scalar {{in the presence}} of a mean scalar gradient was investigated using theory and simulation. The velocity-scalar cospectrum measures the distribution of the mean scalar flux across scales. An inequality is shown to bound the magnitude of the cospectrum in terms of the shell-summed energy and scalar spectra. At high Schmidt number this bound limits the possible contribution of the sub-Kolmogorov scales to the scalar flux. At low Schmidt number we use an argument of Batchelor, Howells, and Townsend (1959) to derive a new asymptotic result for the cospectrum in the inertial-diffusive range, with a - 11 / 3 power law wavenumber dependence. A comparison is made with results from large-eddy simulation at low Schmidt number. The sparse direct-interaction perturbation (<b>SDIP)</b> was used to calculate the cospectrum for a range of Schmidt numbers. The Kolmogorov type scaling result is recovered in the inertial-convective range, and the constant of proportionality was calculated. At high Schmidt numbers, the cospectrum is found to decay exponentially in the viscous-convective range, and at low Schmidt numbers the - 11 / 3 power law is observed in the inertial-diffusive range. The stretched-spiral vortex model was used to calculate the cospectrum, and asymptotic expressions were found for the contribution to the cospectrum from the axial velocity in the vortex structures. Results are reported for the cospectrum from a direct numerical simulation at a Taylor Reynolds number of 265, and a comparison is made of results for the cospectrum from the <b>SDIP,</b> the stretched-spiral vortex model, simulation, and experiment. The stretched-spiral vortex model was also used to derive expressions for the modal time correlation functions of the velocity and scalar fields. These expressions were evaluated numerically and asymptotically. Winding by the vortex core is shown to lead to an inertial timescale, and movement of the vortex structures by the large scale flow leads to a sweeping timescale. The velocity and scalar modal time correlation functions were calculated in the direct numerical simulation. They coincide for large enough wavenumber, and are found to collapse to universal forms when a sweeping timescale is used...|$|E
40|$|For the Salt Disposition Integration Project (<b>SDIP),</b> {{postulated}} {{events in}} the new Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) can result in spilling liquids that contain Cs- 137 and organics onto cell floors. The parameters of concern are the maximum temperature of the fluid following a spill and the time required for the maximum fluid temperature to be reached. Control volume models of the various process cells have been developed using standard conduction and natural convection relationships. The calculations are performed using the Mathcad modeling software. The results are being used in Consolidated Hazards Analysis Planning (CHAP) to determine the controls that {{may be needed to}} mitigate the potential impact of liquids containing Cs- 137 and flammable organics that spill onto cell floors. Model development techniques and the ease of making model changes within the Mathcad environment are discussed. The results indicate that certain fluid spills result in overheating of the fluid, but the times to reach steady-state are several hundred hours.

40|$|Abstract Background Nepal's Safe Delivery Incentive Programme (<b>SDIP)</b> was {{introduced}} nationwide in 2005 {{with the intention}} of increasing utilisation of professional care at childbirth. It provided cash to women giving birth in a health facility and an incentive to the health provider for each delivery attended, either at home or in the facility. We explored early implementation of the programme at the district-level to understand the factors that have contributed to its low uptake. Methods We conducted in ten study districts a series of key informant interviews and focus group discussions with staff from health facilities and the district health office and other stakeholders involved in implementation. Manual content analysis was used to categorise data under emerging themes. Results Problems at the central level imposed severe constraints on the ability of district-level actors to implement the programme. These included bureaucratic delays in the disbursement of funds, difficulties in communicating the policy, both to implementers and the wider public and the complexity of the programme's design. However, some district implementers were able to cope with these problems, providing reasons for why uptake of the programme varied considerably between districts. Actions appeared to be influenced by the pressure to meet local needs, as well individual perceptions and acceptance of the programme. The experience also sheds light on some of the adverse effects of the programme on the wider health system. Conclusion The success of conditional cash transfer programmes in Latin America has led to a wave of enthusiasm for their adoption {{in other parts of the}} world. However, context matters and proponents of similar programmes in south Asia should give due attention to the challenges to implementation when capacity is weak and health services inadequate. </p...|$|E
40|$|Tank 50 H is {{the feed}} tank for the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF). At present, Tank 50 H {{contains}} two standard slurry pumps and two Quad Volute slurry pumps. Current requirements and mixing operation {{is to run}} three pumps for one hour prior to initiating a feed transfer to SPF. Savannah River Site (SRS) Liquid Waste would like to move {{one or both of}} the Quad Volute pumps from Tank 50 H to Tank 51 H to replace pumps in Tank 51 H that are failing. In addition, one of the standard pumps in Tank 50 H exhibits high seal leakage and vibration. SRS Liquid Waste requested Savannah River National (SRNL) to conduct a study to evaluate the feasibility of mixing the contents of Tank 50 H with one to three standard slurry pumps. To determine the pump requirements to blend miscible and immiscible liquids in Tank 50 H, the author reviewed the pilot-scale blending work performed for the Salt Disposition Integration Project (<b>SDIP)</b> and the technical literature, and applied the results to Tank 50 H to determine the number, size, and operating parameters needed to blend the tank contents. The conclusions from this analysis are: (1) A single rotating standard slurry pump (with a 13. 6 ft{sup 2 }/s U{sub 0 }D) will be able to blend miscible liquids (i. e., salt solution) in Tank 50 H within 4. 4 hours. (2) Two rotating standard slurry pumps will be able to blend miscible liquids in Tank 50 H within 3. 1 hours. (3) Three rotating standard slurry pumps will be able to blend miscible liquids in Tank 50 H within 2. 5 hours. (4) A single rotating standard slurry pump (with a 13. 6 ft{sup 2 }/s U{sub 0 }D) will disperse Isopar L{reg_sign} droplets that are less than or equal to 15 micron in diameter. If the droplets are less than 15 micron, they will be dispersed within 4. 4 hours. Isopar L{reg_sign} provides a lower bound on the maximum size of droplets that will be dispersed by the slurry pumps in Tank 50 H. (5) Two rotating standard slurry pumps will disperse Isopar L{reg_sign} droplets less than 15 micron within 3. 1 hours, and three rotating standard slurry pumps will disperse Isopar L{reg_sign} droplets less than 15 micron within 2. 5 hours.

40|$|Background and Purpose: People {{living with}} SCI (PLWSCI) {{have to cope}} with various {{challenges}} when they return home after institutionalized rehabilitation, especially with integrating back into and participating in their communities. To date no study has been conducted in South Africa to empirically measure community integration or to evaluate factors affecting the community integration of PLWSCI. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate factors influencing the community participation of PLWSCI after rehabilitation. Methodology: A cross-sectional, analytical research design employing both qualitative and quantitative approaches was used. Data collection: Phase one: Participants were identified from the databases of two rehabilitation centers, and the snow balling technique. Data were collected by implementing: the socio-demographic and injury profile (<b>SDIP),</b> the Return to Normal Living Index (RNLI), the Spinal Cord Injury Measure – version II (SCIM II) and the Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors – short form (CHIEF-SF). Phase two: In-depth face to face interviews were conducted with a purposely selected sample group from participants of phase one of the study to determine how participants perceive their community participation. Data Analysis: Phase one: Data were analyzed using version 17 of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 17). Descriptive statistics, T- tests, Pearson productmoment correlation coefficients and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons, was done to examine demographic characteristics and participants’ community participation. Data from Phase 2 was subjected to data-reducing procedures using qualitative techniques. Results – Phase One One hundred and sixty PLWSCI (134 males and 26 females) from the Tshwane metropolitan area participated in this phase of the study. The participants were predominantly young, male, unemployed and single and their major cause of SCI was road traffic accidents, which accounted for 71 % of the injuries. The participants’ satisfaction with their community participation was generally low, only 20 % expressed satisfaction with their community participation. Satisfaction with community participation was significantly associated with the participants’ race, level of education, employment, educational qualifications, years of living with SCI, level of SCI, health complications, perceived health status, functional ability and perceived environmental factors such as physical (structural and geographic) barriers and lack of transport. Results – Phase 2 Fifteen PLWSCI participated in interviews. Two themes influencing participation were identified from the interview transcripts: Personal factors (coping skills, rehabilitation experience, future aspirations, personal needs, psycho-emotional issues and meaningful use of time) and Environmental factors (attitudes of others, social support and accessibility issues). Conclusion The results of the two phases revealed that community participation of PLWSCI was mainly related to three major categories of factors: personal factors, disability-related factors and environmental factors. Satisfaction with community participation was greater in participants who had been living with SCI for longer periods, had more years of basic education, were not black Africans, lived in suburbs, and were employed. A positive outlook on life and engagement in creative activities during free time enhanced community participation. Disability-related factors included level of SCI, functional ability and perceived general health influenced satisfaction with community participation. Community participation was greater in participants who experienced fewer environmental barriers. “Attitudes of members of society”, “accessibility of the environment” and “social support” influenced the participants’ satisfaction with community participation. A framework for facilitating community participation of PLWSCI was developed. Strategies to be implemented by various multi-sectoral stakeholders to enhance community participation are proposed. p>Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. PhysiotherapyUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Describing {{the effect of}} the Safe Delivery Incentive Programme on women of different socioeconomic and sociodemographic strata. To explore the reasons why women having their first baby {{were more likely to have}} heard of Safe Delivery Incentive Programme (<b>SDIP),</b> and to have received the incentive than women with more than one child. This data collection is the second out of four collections, representing Phase B. The other 3 collections are linked below in ‘Related resources’. Our qualitative data collection was done in two phases. In Phase A of the project, we sought to understand how socioeconomic and sociodemographic status of women affects women’s group attendance. Phase A of the project was conducted in all trial sites. The data are reported under ‘part 1 ’. In Phase B of the project, we primarily sought to explain our quantitative findings relating to the equity impact of the women’s groups intervention on neonatal mortality and health behaviours. This was done only in those sites where the trials had shown a substantial and statistically significant impact on neonatal mortality (rural India, Nepal-Makwanpur, Bangladesh, and Malawi). The data are reported under ‘part 3 ’. We conducted other, smaller, studies as part of Phase B of our project in the sites where the trial findings where either not yet published at the time of our study (Nepal-Dhanusha) or where the trial showed no impact on neonatal mortality (urban India). The data for these smaller, site-specific studies, are reported under ‘part 2 ’ (Nepal-Dhanusha) and ‘part 4 ’ (urban India). Project description: Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been uneven. Poor and otherwise disadvantaged groups lag behind their more fortunate compatriots for most MDGs. To make things worse, effective interventions are known, but rarely reach those who need them most. Unfortunately, little is known about how to effectively reach poor and otherwise disadvantaged groups, and how to address socio-economic inequalities in mortality. The project aims to fill these gaps by generating evidence on: (1) how socio-economic inequalities translate into inequalities in newborn and maternal mortality; (2) how to address the exclusion of poor and otherwise disadvantaged groups from efforts to achieve the MDGs; (3) how to reduce socio-economic inequalities in maternal and newborn mortality. Data from 6 surveillance sites in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Malawi are used (combined population > 2 million); Information on birth outcomes; socio-economic position, health care use and home care practices are used to describe and explain mortality inequalities. Data from randomized controlled trials of women’s group interventions are used to evaluate the equity impact of community mobilization. The project actively engages with and learns from stakeholders, drawing on their experiences regarding what works to ensure an equitable improvement in newborn and maternal health. We used existing quantitative data from randomised controlled trials of participatory women’s groups to reduce neonatal mortality. The intervention consisted of women’s groups, facilitated by a local woman. The facilitator led the groups through a participatory action cycle, in which they identified and prioritised maternal and newborn health problems in the community, collectively selected relevant strategies to address them, implemented the strategies, and evaluated the results. These trials were conducted in six large demographic surveillance sites, in India (Mumbai and Orissa & Jharkhand), rural Nepal (Dhanusha, and Makwanpur districts), rural Bangladesh and rural Malawi. The data were collected through interviews with women that have given birth in the study sites. In addition, our project collected new qualitative data in the trial sites, using focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews, to help understand our quantitative findings. The data deposited in this archive, pertain to this qualitative data collection...|$|E
