40|$|Background and purpose: Acute lateral ankle {{ligament}} injuries (ankle sprains) {{are common}} problems in acute medical care. The treatment variation observed for the acutely injured lateral ankle ligament complex suggests {{a lack of}} evidence-based management strategies for this problem. Subjects and methods: The study included fourty patients, age ranged from 18 to 25 year and divided into two groups. The first group with mean age 21. 4 ± 2. 65 years followed a physical therapy program of exercises {{in the form of}} strengthening exercises for dorsiflexors, planterflexors, evertors, and invertors muscles, stretching exercise of planterflexors, using of ankle <b>support</b> (elastic <b>bandage),</b> and partial weight bearing, three sessions per week for 3 weeks. The second group with mean age 22. 1 ± 3. 21 years, submitted to a physical therapy program of exercises in the form of strengthening exercises for dorsiflexors, planterflexors, evertors, and invertors muscles, stretching exercise of planterflexors, using of ankle <b>support</b> (elastic <b>bandage),</b> and complete weight bearing, three sessions per week for 3 weeks. Outcome measures were rating score system of the japanese orthopaedic association for measuring daily living activities (walking), universal goniometer to detect range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion and planterflexion, and visual analogue scale to measure the pain severity. Results: There was {{a significant difference in the}} first group (t of pain= 0. 0007, t of ROM of dorsiflexion= 0. 009, t of ROM of planterflexion= 0. 007, t of ADL (walking) = 0. 035) than in the second group, there was a significant difference (t of pain= 0. 0009, t of ROM of dorsiflexion= 0. 007, t of ROM of planterflexion= 0. 0008, t of ADL (walking) = 0. 025). In comparison, there was a significant difference in ADL (walking) only. Discussion and Conclusion: This study showed that patients rehabilitated according to the complete weight bearing is better than partial weight bearing in pain and ROM, and specially ADL (walking) in management of ankle sprain patient...|$|R

CASE REPORT In December 1980, a woman aged seventy one years, the wife of a farmer, first attended the orthopaedic clinic at Dundee Royal Infirmary. Seven months prior to her visit she had suffered pain and swelling in her left wrist. Although she could not recall any injury, she felt that shovelling coal might have initiated the discomfort. After a few days the pain and swelling subsided, but stiffness in the wrist and weakness of grip persisted. During this period her only treatment was <b>bandage</b> <b>support.</b> She was predominantly right handed. At her visit she complained of pain in the left wrist, marked restriction of movements and weakness of grip. Examination disclosed slight swelling over the middle of dorsum of the left wrist. Movements of the wrist joint were markedly restricted. Dorsi-flexion was 20 ~ palmar flexion 10 ~ radial and ulnar deviation 5 ~ each. There was tenderness on palpation of the lunate.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare in a prospective randomized study the outcome of painful, traumatic knee injuries when treated with either the modified Robert Jones (MRJB) or elastic <b>support</b> <b>bandage</b> (ESB). Patients with moderate or severe unilateral knee injury presenting to our department within 24 h were randomized into two treatment groups receiving either the MRJB or an ESB. The main outcome parameters of the study were the amount of pain relief required, the speed of recovery, mobility and patient preference. The results of our study of 40 patients indicate that the two treatments were equally effective in treating knee sprains, and patients preferred the ESB in the early post-injury period. Therefore, we see no reason to continue using the MRJB for the treatment of sprained knees in the accident and emergency (A&E) setting when a more patient acceptable, time and cost-effective treatment is available...|$|E
50|$|Each of the {{individual}} products in the catalogue has been developed {{over the course of}} time, beginning in 1997. That year saw the start of manufacturing and distributing the company’s own brands of Comfort, Santex, and Proster medical gloves. Then, in 2012, the available product line was expanded with the inclusion of surgical draping sets and specialised surgical sheets. This period of time saw the introduction of Comfort PF and DermaGel powder-free examination gloves with low latex content, and Vinylex vinyl medical examination gloves, constituting the first alternative to latex gloves in Poland. In 2005, the company began cooperation with Ansell Healthcare in the scope of distribution. In that same year, the product line was expanded with the inclusion of Orthopeg, Microtex, Gynoglove, and Syntec NEOPRENE specialist surgical gloves, as well as Texident gloves designed for dentists, gloves designed for procedures involving increased risk of infection, ProHand sterile examination gloves, and powder-free vinyl gloves. The decision to purchase the medical gloves production plant in Thailand resulted in the introduction of a new group of products, i.e. dressings that included the following: gauze compresses, non-woven fabric compresses, high-absorbency compresses, adhesive tapes on various types of carriers, dressings for the fastening of cannula, surgical dressings, plaster <b>bandages,</b> stabilising <b>supports,</b> and net <b>bandages.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose. To {{identify}} and quantify meaningful concepts in lymphedema from the patients' perspectives using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Methods. Six focus group interviews in five different centers were organized, audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed. Results. A total of 2681 relevant ICF linkings were {{performed with the}} focus group data, resulting in 130 different second-level categories. Of these 130 second-level categories, 41 (31. 5 %) categories were categorized as Body Functions, 20 (15. 5 %) as Body Structures, 41 (31. 5 %) as Activities and Participation, and 28 (21. 5 %) as Environmental Factors. Overall, {{the most important issues}} according to the patients were the use of hosiery and <b>bandages,</b> <b>support</b> and relationships, and the shape of structures related to movement. Conclusion. Based on their experiences with lymphedema, patients reported activity limitations and participation restrictions combined with impaired body functioning. Anatomical changes (Body Structures) were also often mentioned as a problem in daily life. Environmental factors may act as a barrier or facilitator for patient functioning. The ICF provides a valuable reference to identify concepts in statements from lymphedema patients. The results of this research will be used in the development of ICF Core Sets for lymphedema...|$|R

The rough work of the {{preceding}} day had caused {{the ends of the}} bone to grate, and had set up a great deal of inflammation. He had been suffering acutely since he started, in spite of the <b>support</b> of the <b>bandage,</b> and he had more than once thought that he would be obliged to ask Myra to take his place. He did not attempt to mount in the young Frenchman's saddle, for he thought that the motion of the horse would be worse for him than walking; he therefore took the reins in his hand, and walked at the horse's head behind the litter. The pain was less now that he was relieved of the load, but he still suffered a great deal, and he kept in the rear behind the others, while Myra chatted with Monsieur Laurent, learning from him what had happened in the town, and giving him a sketch of their adventures. As they passed the house of Madame Duchesne's sister, the invalid said that she would be taken in there, as she had heard from Monsieur Laurent that their own house was partially unroofed. Myra ran in to see her aunt, who came out with her at once.|$|R

Even though {{the use of an}} electrolarynx (EL) is the easiest way for a patient to produce speech, it does not produce a natural tone and appearance is far from normal. Because of that and the fact that none of them are hands-free, the feasibility of using a motion sensor to replace a conventional EL user interface has been explored. A mobile device motion sensor with multi-agent platform has been used to investigate on/off and pitch frequency control capability. A very small battery operated ARM-based control unit has also been developed to evaluate the motion sensor based user-interface. This control unit is placed on the wrist and the vibration device against the throat using <b>support</b> <b>bandage.</b> Two different conversion methods were used for the forearm tilt angle to pitch frequency conversion: linear mapping method and F 0 template-based method A perceptual evaluation has been performed with two well-trained normal speakers and ten subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute lateral ankle {{ligament}} ruptures {{are common}} problems in present health care. Early mobilisation and functional treatment are advocated as a preferable treatment strategy. However, functional treatment comprises {{a broad spectrum}} of treatment strategies and as of yet no optimal strategy has been identified. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess different functional treatment strategies for acute lateral ankle ligament ruptures in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (December 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2000), EMBASE (1980 to May 2000), CURRENT CONTENTS (1993 to 1999), BIOSIS (to 1999), reference lists of articles, and contacted organisations and researchers in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials describing skeletally mature individuals with an acute lateral ankle ligament rupture and comparing different functional treatment strategies were evaluated for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of included trials and extracted relevant data on treatment outcome. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. Individual and pooled statistics are reported as relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcome and (weighted) mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcome measures with 95 per cent confidence intervals (95 %CI). Heterogeneity between trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials involving 892 participants were included. Lace-up ankle support had significantly better results for persistent swelling at short-term follow up when compared with semi-rigid ankle support (RR 4. 19, 95 % CI 1. 26 to 13. 98); elastic bandage (RR 5. 48; 95 % CI 1. 69 to 17. 76); and to tape (RR 4. 07, 95 % CI 1. 21 to 13. 68). Use of a semi-rigid ankle support resulted in a significantly shorter time to return to work when compared with an elastic bandage (WMD (days) 4. 24; 95 % CI 2. 42 to 6. 06); one trial found the use of a semi-rigid ankle support saw a significantly quicker return to sport compared with elastic bandage (RR 9. 60; 95 % CI 6. 34 to 12. 86) and another trial found fewer patients reported instability at short-term follow-up when treated with a semi-rigid support than with an elastic bandage (RR 8. 00; 95 % CI 1. 03 to 62. 07). Tape treatment resulted in significantly more complications, the majority being skin irritations, when compared with treatment with an elastic bandage (RR 0. 11; 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 86). No other results showed statistically significant differences. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The use of an elastic bandage has fewer complications than taping but appears to be associated with a slower return to work and sport, and more reported instability than a semi-rigid ankle support. Lace-up ankle support appears to be effective in reducing swelling in the short-term compared with semi-rigid ankle <b>support,</b> elastic <b>bandage</b> and tape. However, definitive conclusions are hampered by the variety of treatments used, and the inconsistency of reported follow-up times. The most effective treatment, both clinically and in costs, is unclear from currently available randomised trial...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 180 {{patients}} {{participated in the}} study, with 30 withdrawn due to various reasons. At 12 weeks, 76 % patients treated with SSB, 78 % patients treated with 4 LB, and 31 % patients treated with usual care alone had completed ulcer healing. The hazard ratios for healing for 4 LB and SSB relative to the control group were 3. 14 (95 % CI = 1. 74 - 5. 67) and 2. 72 (95 % CI = 1. 53 - 4. 86), respectively. The key findings indicated the significant effects of compression bandaging resulted in {{a higher proportion of}} complete ulcer healing; reduction in ulcer size, pain severity, and pain interference; and improvement in quality of life and lifestyle activity. Across the 12 -week study period, the present study also highlighted the significant improvement of the psychosocial composite outcome among the three study groups. Furthermore, the reduction in pain severity and pain interference accounted for the major contribution to the total effect of the psychosocial composite outcome. Therefore, effective pain control and minimizing the effect of pain on daily life is essential in promoting ulcer healing. It is evident that the application of compression bandaging with either 4 LB or SSB is feasible and more effective than the current usual care with no compression. This study add new knowledge to the psychosocial benefit of compression bandaging for venous ulcer patients living in the community; and <b>support</b> incorporating compression <b>bandaging</b> in the routine venous ulcer care. Further studies are therefore suggested to focus on the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of and the satisfaction and experience of both patients and nurses with compression bandaging using different high compression bandage systems. The study was a randomized controlled trial. Those patients who participated in the experimental groups received compression bandaging with either the 4 LB or SSB along with a local usual care. In contrast, the control group participants received usual care. A 12 -week study intervention was given individually to the study participants. The research outcome of this study was the proportion of complete ulcer healing, ulcer size, pain severity, pain interference, disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life measures, and lifestyle activity. The instruments used include VeV MD stereophotogrammetry, Brief pain Inventory, The SF- 12 Health Survey, Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Questionnaire, and the Frenchay Activity Index. Data analysis involved the use of descriptive statistics and inferential statistics such as survival analysis, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate analysis variance (MANOVA), doubly multivariate analysis of variance (Doubly MANOVA), and Roy-Bargman stepdown analysis were used. Venous ulcer is the most serious clinical consequence of chronic venous insufficiency. It is a chronic health problem that afflicts older people as well as health care professions. Its chronicity, together with its high recurrent rate, creates not only a big challenge to nurses' workload and health cost, but it also has a direct impact on patients' physiological and psychosocial well-being. Compression bandaging has been identified as the mainstream form of treatment for venous ulcer in previous literature, although this is not very well known by the nurses in Hong Kong. Previous studies have confirmed that the proportion of complete ulcer healing is improved with high compression as compared to no compression. However, a definite conclusion on the effectiveness of different high compression systems, such as the four-layer compression system (4 LB) and short-stretch compression system (SSB), was not found. Most importantly the treatment impacts on proportion of complete ulcer healing, ulcer size, pain severity and pain interference, health-related quality of life, and lifestyle activities are essential influences on patients' participation in venous ulcer care and treatment choice. These limited data leave a gap in today's knowledge on venous ulcer management in relation to both patients and health care providers. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} examine the effect of two compression bandage systems, the 4 LB and SSB, in promoting ulcer healing in terms of the proportion of complete ulcer healing and ulcer size, as well as the psychosocial well-being including pain, heath-related quality of life, and lifestyle activity for older people in the community.
