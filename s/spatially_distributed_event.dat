40|$|A hazard {{and risk}} {{analysis}} is given for personnel from primary fragments of fast moving and variably oriented high-explosive sources with <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>event</b> probability of a single event, e. g. for conventional threat. The approach assumes scenarios with static person densities on earth's surface. The spatial initiation distribution is described with a probability density function along a curve. The density can be constructed using expert estimates, technical safety analysis of an existing fuzing system or minimal technical safety requirements for fuzing systems. Arena test data are used for dynamic point source launching conditions of representative fragments to compute the physical consequences. Hazard criteria visualize the fragment density. Vulnerability models determine the individual local risk. In addition using the person density collective risks are computed. The individual and collective risks can be compared with various risk criteria, in particular for F-N curves. In a case study the approach is applied to a fuzing system of an artillery shell. Thus the post launch safety and the overhead safety or post safe separation safety taking third party into account are assessed. In this case the hazards and risks of fragments dominate when compared to blast effects. Assessing multiple scenarios the initiation density can be assessed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT — Recent {{technological}} advances {{have led to}} the emergence of small battery-powered sensors with considerable, albeit limited, processing and communication capabilities. Wireless sensor networks have therefore gained considerable attention in applications where <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>events</b> are to be monitored with minimal delay. We present and analyze a hierarchical wireless sensor network with mobile overlays, along with a mobility-aware multi-hop routing scheme, in order to optimize the network lifetime, delay, and local storage size. Fixed event aggregation relays and mobile relays are used to collect events from the sensors and send them to a central base station. We analyze the effects of various system parameters on the network performance, and formulate a convex optimization problem for maximizing the network lifetime subject to constraints on local storage, delay, and maintenance cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} progressing urbanization {{increases the}} need to consider threats like terrorism or natural disasters when planning or redesigning urban areas. The paper shows how to assess and mitigate terrorism risks in a systematic way using historical event data on urban plan level. Based on multiple event data, within a risk approach, quantities are derived that measure averaged susceptibilities, vulnerabilities and risks for buildings and infrastructure {{in the context of}} urban planning. The empirical approach allows for local scaling factors for frequency of events, e. g., due to physical accessibility, and for consequences, e. g., due to physical counter-measures. The paper discusses the input data necessary for statistically sound analyses, in particular, the accuracies of the quantities as well as deep uncertainties. To this end, it determines distributions for the frequencies and consequences, in particular, introducing a modified Pareto distribution. The application to a sample urban area demonstrates how the analysis results lead to a more resilient scenario using the analysis and selecting resilience improvement options. It is shown that the empirical analysis motivates more detailed additional engineering-simulative approaches for resilience improvement through averaging susceptibility, vulnerability and risk assessments by assuming multiple <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R

40|$|Glickfeld {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{suggested}} that single hippocampal interneurones generate field potentials at monosynaptic latencies. We pursued this obervation in simultaneous intracellular and multiple extracellular {{records from the}} CA 3 region of rat hippocampal slices. We confirmed that interneurones evoked field potentials at monosynaptic latencies. Pyramidal cells initiated disynaptic inhibitory field potentials, but did not initiate detectable monosynaptic excitatory fields. We confirmed that inhibitory fields were GABAergic in nature and showed they were suppressed at low external Cl−, suggesting they originate at postsynaptic sites. Field potentials generated by a single interneurone were detected at multiple sites over distances of more than 800 μm along the stratum pyramidale of the CA 3 region. We used arrays of extracellular electrodes to examine amplitude distributions of spontaneous inhibitory fields recorded at sites orthogonal to or along the CA 3 stratum pyramidale. Cluster analysis of <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> inhibitory field <b>events</b> let us separate events generated by interneurones terminating on distinct zones of somato-dendritic axis. Events generated at dendritic sites had similar amplitudes but occurred less frequently and had somewhat slower kinetics than perisomatic events generated near the stratum pyramidale.

This study focused upon the extreme stream flow and precipitation amounts endured across the Midwest during the summer of 1993. Ten sample basins located in the Midwest were used to represent the entire region. Comparisons between flow magnitudes experienced during 1993 and similar flow magnitudes was conducted. Results indicated that stream flow recorded at the ten sample basins during the 1993 summer were, for the majority, one of the greatest five values ever experienced at these rivers. Across the Midwest region, no other seasonal floods were as <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> as flooding <b>events</b> that occurred during the 1993 summer. Furthermore, extreme meteorological events dominated throughout the region, beginning the previous winter season. Monthly precipitation totals received across this region demonstrated very little monthly variation during the 1993 summer season, unlike any other summer on record. This indicated that anomalous general circulation patterns continued throughout the season. By {{the end of the summer}} of 1993, billions of dollars in damage had occurred throughout the Midwest due to extensive flooding caused in part by continuous extreme rainfall events occurring over the region.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> {{hydrological}} models have rapidly advanced with the widespread availability of remotely sensed and geomatics information. Particularly, {{the areas of}} calibration and evaluation of <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> hydrological models have been attempted {{in order to reduce}} the differences between models and improve realism through various techniques. Despite steady efforts, the study of calibrations and evaluations for <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> hydrological models is still a largely unexplored field, in that there is no research in terms of the interactions of snow and water balance components with the traditional measurement methods as error functions. As one of the factors related to runoff, melting snow is important, especially in mountainous regions with heavy snowfall; however, no study considering both snow and water components simultaneously has investigated the procedures of calibration and evaluation for <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> models. Additionally, novel approaches of error functions would be needed to reflect the characteristics of <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> hydrological models in the comparison between simulated and observed values. Lastly, the shift from lumped model calibration to distributed model calibration has raised the model complexity. The number of unknown parameters can rapidly increase, depending on the degree of distribution. Therefore, a strategy is required to determine the optimal degree of model distributions for a study basin. In this study, we will attempt to address the issues raised above. This study utilizes the Research Distributed Hydrological Model (HL-RDHM) developed by Hydrologic Development Office of the National Weather Service (OHD-NWS). This model simultaneously simulates both snow and water balance components. It consists largely of two different modules, i. e., the Snow 17 as a snow component and the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) as a water component, and is applied over the Durango River basin in Colorado, which is an area driven primarily by snow. As its main contribution, this research develops and tests various methods to calibrate and evaluate <b>spatially</b> <b>distributed</b> hydrological models with different, non-commensurate, variables and measurements.
