In each round, a new scheduling step is allocated to one of n threads, according to a distribution p = (p 1, p 2, [...] ., pn), where thread i is scheduled with probability pi. When some thread first reaches a set threshold of executed steps, it registers a win, completing its current operation, and resets its step count to 1. At the same time, <b>threads</b> whose <b>step</b> count {{was close to the}} threshold also get reset because of the win, but to 0 steps, being penalized for almost winning. We are interested in two questions: how often does some thread complete an operation (system latency), and how often does a specific thread complete an operation (individual latency) ? We provide asymptotically tight bounds for the system and individual latency of this general concurrency pattern, for arbitrary scheduling distributions p. Surprisingly, a simple characterization exists: in expectation, the system will complete a new operation every Θ(1 / |p| 2) <b>steps,</b> while <b>thread</b> i will complete a new operation every Θ(|p| 2 / pi 2) steps.

40|$|Various {{alternatives}} to the PRAM model have been proposed in recent literature. This paper defines the notion of cost consistency, and shows that many previous PRAM-type models lack this important attribute. An alternative model of parallel computation, called the Parameterized PRAM, is then introduced.

The P-PRAM is then shown to be a useful tool in parallel algorithm design, due to its inherent cost consistency, and various P-PRAM algorithms are presented and analyzed. 1 Introduction The PRAM has become a widely accepted model of parallel computation.

Suppose there are n threads, each with a local store of size L, where the threads communicate via a shared global store of size G. If each thread is finite-state (without a stack), the naive model checking algorithm requires O(G. L n) space, whereas thread-modular model checking requires only O(n. G. (G + L)) space. If each thread has a stack, the general model checking problem is undecidable, but thread-modular model checking terminates in polynomial time. ...|$|R

The NO scavenging resulting from these approaches provoked the downregulation of plant genes involved in nodule development, such as MtCRE 1 and MtCCS 52 A. Furthermore, an Hmp-overexpressing S. meliloti mutant strain was found to be less competitive than the wild type in the nodulation process.

40|$|Ensuring the {{correctness}} of multithreaded {{programs is}} difficult, {{due to the}} potential for unexpected and nondeterministic interactions between threads. Previous work addressed this problem by devising tools for detecting race conditions, a situation where two threads simultaneously access the same data variable, {{and at least one}} of the accesses is a write. However, verifying the absence of such simultaneous-access race conditions is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure the absence of errors due to unexpected thread interactions. We propose that a stronger non-interference property is required, namely atomicity. Atomic methods can be assumed to execute serially, without interleaved <b>steps</b> of other <b>threads.</b> Thus, atomic methods are amenable to sequential reasoning techniques, which significantly simplifies both formal and informal reasoning about program correctness. This paper presents a type system for specifying and verifying the atomicity of methods in multithreaded Java programs.

These pseudo-polyrotaxanes (PPRs) can be obtained by quenching an alpha-CD/PEO mixture in water from 70 degrees C down to a lower temperature (typically in the range from 5 to 30 degrees C) thanks to favorable interactions between alpha-CD cavities and PEO chains. Moreover, starting from a liquid alpha-CD/PEO mixture at a total mass fraction of 15 % w/w at 70 degrees C, the formation of PPRs with time at a lower temperature induces a white physical gel with time, and phase separation is observed. We established that PPR molecules are exclusively found in the precipitated phase although unthreaded alpha-CD molecules and unthreaded PEO chains are in the liquid phase. At 30 degrees C, the physical gel formation is much slower than at 5 degrees C. At 30 degrees C, we established that, in a first <b>step,</b> alpha-CDs <b>thread</b> onto PEO chains, forming PPR molecules which are not in good solvent conditions in water. At a higher length scale, rapid aggregation of the PPR molecules occurs, and threaded alpha-CD-based nanocylinders form (cylinder length L 5. 7 nm and cylinder radius R = 4. 7 nm). At a higher length scale, alpha-CD-based nanocylinders associate in a Gaussian way, engendering the formation of precipitated domains which are responsible for the high turbidity of the studied system. At the end of this first step (i. e., after 20 min), the system still remains liquid and the PPRs are totally formed. Then, in a second step (i. e., after 150 min), the system undergoes its reorganization characterized by a compacity increase of the precipitated domains and forms a physical gel. We found that PPRs are totally formed after 20 min at 30 degrees C and that the system stays in a nongel state up to 150 min. This opens new perspectives regarding the PPR chemical modification: between these two characteristic times, we can easily envisage an efficient chemical modification of the PPR molecules in water, as for instance,in end-capping reaction leading to the synthesis of polyrotaxanes...|$|R

Nod factors induce several cellular responses in root hair cells within minutes, but also are essential {{for the formation of}} infection threads by which rhizobia enter the root. Based on studies using bacterial mutants, a two-receptor model was proposed, a signaling receptor that induces early responses with low requirements toward Nod factor structure and an entry receptor that controls infection with more stringent demands. Recently, putative Nod factor receptors were shown to be LysM domain receptor kinases. However, mutants in these receptors, in both Lotus japonicus (nfr 1 and nfr 5) and Medicago truncatula (Medicago; nfp), do not support the two-receptor model because they lack all Nod factor-induced responses. LYK 3, the putative Medicago ortholog of NFR 1, has only been studied by RNA interference, showing a role in infection thread formation. Medicago hair curling (hcl) mutants are unable to form curled root hairs, a <b>step</b> preceding infection <b>thread</b> formation. We identified the weak hcl- 4 allele that is blocked during infection thread growth. We show that HCL encodes LYK 3 and, thus, that this receptor, besides infection, also controls root hair curling. By using rhizobial mutants, we also show that HCL controls infection thread formation in a Nod factor structure-dependent manner. Therefore, LYK 3 functions as the proposed entry receptor, specifically controlling infection.

25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second <b>step,</b> hook wires, <b>thread</b> needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation.

The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|R
