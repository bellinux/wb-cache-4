40|$|The {{results of}} a survey {{conducted}} in several Promotional Forest Complexes (PFC) in the Śląskie and Podlaskie regions, {{as well as the}} urban forests in Łodź and Warsaw, indicate that visitor preferences vary among forest sites. Those forests where visitors prefer to rest should be located in forests designated for recreation, and include elements of recreational infrastructure. Depending on characteristics of the forest in question (seaside, lakeside, or mountains), respondents preferred forest located near to the water’s edge, whereas in mountainous areas they selected open places (roads and openings). Urban residents more commonly chose sites deep within the forest, while hikers selected forest edges. The desired recreational infrastructure, included garbage cans and hiking trails as the most important elements among city dwellers, while hikers pointed to rest areas and information boards. The respondents consistently agreed on the type of recreational activities conducted in forests as well as on type of elements which determine the attractiveness of forests for rest and recreation. Independently of site characteristics and the research location, the most common activities for respondents were hiking and riding bicycle; and attractive elements were silence and calm as well as cleanliness of the forests. The Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) was used to evaluate respondents’ Willingness to Pay (WTP) for intensification of selected public forest functions and forest management, including recreational functions. The number of respondents who declared a hypothetical monetary amount or WTP> 0 depended on the place where research was conducted (forest or respondent’s home); forest area covered by financing (forests in general or local forests where respondents reside); the type of question used to obtain the information on WTP; as well as the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> (all public forest functions or just a recreational function). The average WTP declared per household per year varied from 41 PLN (Gołos, Janeczko 2002) to 150 PLN (Gołos, Kaliszewski 2006) for selected forest areas. The average overall state statistics for WTP was 52 PLN (non-timber forest functions in municipality) and 41 PLN (recreational management of forests in municipality). The respondents also underlined that the goods and services provided should be co-financed from both state and local budgets, and that such financing should go directly to the organizations conducting forest management...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical analysis of Governments 5 decisions to sell privatised companies on both {{international and domestic}} markets {{in a sample of}} 392 privatisations in 42 countries in the 1977 - 1998 period. Political theories of privatisation find strong support in our analyses: market oriented Governments favour domestic investors in the allocation of shares. The need to expose the company to global competition, to penetrate foreign markets and to warrant better legal protection to shareholders also appears as relevant. Significant differences emerge in OECD and non-OECD countries. In wealthy economies stock market liquidity favours cross-listing, while in emerging countries Governments resort to cross-listing in order to "import" liquidity and to develop domestic stock markets. Legal institutions also play a different role. In OECD countries, weak shareholder protection induces Governments to cross-list, in order to borrow the reputation and best practices of established exchanges. On the other hand, creditors 5 protection is more relevant in non-OECD countries, where weak legal protection of creditors reduces the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>finance,</b> forcing Governments to look for funds abroad...|$|R

40|$|Who {{will meet}} the <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> {{education}} cost, or in other words sponsorship to education, has traditionally been a social concern as in other teaching steps. Actually, this discussion {{is closely related to}} inner and outer obstacles and financial matters as well as required qualifications and efficiency of education. As the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>finance</b> in education is the state, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>finance</b> in higher education is the state itself because higher education has been, so far, heavily considered as a public service whose expenses are extensively met through public sources in each country except the USA and several other countries. However, the <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> the cost of the increasing demand to higher education only with social sources is nowadays being interrogatedHigher education is a service <b>of</b> high cost. <b>Financing</b> ways <b>of</b> higher education in various countries range a large spectrum from institutions sponsored only by students’ contribution fees without any other supports else for institutions whose all higher educational expenses, including feeding and accommodation, are completely met through social sources. <b>Financing</b> <b>of</b> Turkish Higher Education service is mostly handled two different models: the state and foundation universities. The first one, state’s universities, have traditionally adopted “a financial system relying on national sources” while foundation ones have developed their own “exclusive financing”. Today, budget financing accounts for nearly % 80 of the budget allocated for state’s universities. In the year 1973, the classical budge system was replaced by “program budget system”, and then in 1998 was converted into a joint budget system. The current system, analytic budget system” has been in practice since 2004. However, in foundation universities, the main approach is treasure aids to make contributions to their expenses provided it remains limited with the payment in the budgetDespite {{the increase in the number}} of students in Turkish Higher Education system, the portion reserved from the state’s budget has declined. Therefore, decline in portion of higher education allocated in the budget has also caused our higher education institutions to make up new ways of searching for exclusive sources apart from public, one of which is to increase the fee paid by students. However, such an increase in students’ education fee has brought together some discussion concerning “unequal opportunities in higher education” particularly in terms of groups of middle and lower income. “The income of the higher education” in Turkish Higher Education system is socially 8. 5 % and individually 16. 2 %. As for the global average of the income of the higher education, it has socially been 10. 8 % for ages, and individually 19 %. Judging from there figures, we could conclude that the income of investments performed by higher education in Turkey falls back of the global average. Briefly, such a case has turned the efficiency of the allocated financial share for the Turkish Higher Education service into too controversial matter...|$|R

At the same time, the significance <b>of</b> the global <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>finance</b> industry has been challenged {{by those who have}} shown that there is a premium on the geographical distribution of information.

The paper proceeds by reviewing the evidence for and against localization and globalization, focusing upon the relevant literature from economic geography, finance, and trade theory.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper is to review the Terms of Reference (TOR) <b>of</b> the Twelfth <b>Finance</b> Commission with special {{reference}} to Kerala. It also critically examines the emphasis on fiscal deficit reduction without paying attention to its quality and finds that {{this has led to}} the Centre and the States resorting to a softer option of cutting productive capital and necessary maintenance and social sector expenditure. This is likely to have adverse consequences on equitable growth and to impede the process of relieving the economy of structural constraints on growth. There is an urgent need for analysing the quality of fiscal consolidation instead of focusing merely on quantity of reduction of deficits as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The study hence suggests incorporating the concept of Quality of Fiscal Discipline. It is found that there has been an enlargement <b>of</b> the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finance</b> Commissions [since the Eleventh Finance Commission (11 th FC) ] into mandates for recommending mechanisms for achieving macroeconomic balance, equitable growth, and suggestions for disinvestments and privatisation, while its role in the traditional area of grant devolution has been restricted to non-Plan grants only. In fact, the enlargement of the role in the traditional area of grant devolution would be more desirable. There is sufficient scope for augmenting resource mobilisation from direct and indirect taxes at the Central level. Emphasis is to be placed on integrating services and manufacturing into a single CENVAT (Central Value Added Tax) and on direct taxes reform. The second generation tax reform should concentrate on States’ tax administration and inter-State coordination prior to moving on to a State level VAT. There is need for a constitutional amendment to place service tataxation in the Concurrent List and enable States to tax more services. On the expenditure side, steep increases in items like wages and salaries and interest expenditure are unlikely in the near future. Hence maintenance and social sector expenditure should not be sacrificed. At the same time, efficiency in spending and cutting unproductive expenditure and leakages should be strictly monitored. A decentralised district level monitoring system for maintenance expenditure of capital assets is also suggested. The paper argues that bringing privatisation in the Terms of Reference <b>of</b> the <b>Finance</b> Commission seems avoidable. It is also felt that more effective time bound implementation <b>of</b> State <b>Finance</b> Commission Reports is needed. Along with devolution of funds, transfer of administrative functions is necessary for avoiding duplication of expenditure. As for Kerala-specific issues, it is found that achievements on the human development front are not rewarded. Certain changes in the existing criteria (<b>of</b> the Eleventh <b>Finance</b> Commission) are hence suggested. Kerala’s tax effort, though better than richer States like Punjab, is facing structural constraints. The fast expanding services sector is outside the tax net of the State. The tax-GDP ratio of Kerala showed a mild decline at 9. 84 percent in the 1990 s as compared to 10. 29 percent in the 1980 s despite a much higher growth rate of State Domestic Product, mainly because the State was not able to tax the dominant sector of the State Domestic Product, that is, the services sector.
