5|$|As the war progressed, the {{clientele}} of <b>Salon</b> Kitty decreased. In July 1942, {{the building was}} demolished during a British air attack and the brothel had to be relocated.

5|$|Created in {{the early}} 1930s, the <b>salon</b> {{was taken over by}} SS general Reinhard Heydrich and his {{subordinate}} Walter Schellenberg in 1939. The brothel was managed by original owner Kitty Schmidt throughout its entire existence. The plan was to seduce top German dignitaries, foreign visitors as well as diplomats with alcohol and women so they would disclose secrets or express their honest opinions on Nazi-related topics and individuals. Notable guests included Heydrich himself, Joseph Dietrich, Galeazzo Ciano and Joseph Goebbels. The building housing the <b>salon</b> was destroyed in an air raid in 1942 and the project quickly lost its importance. <b>Salon</b> Kitty has been the inspiration or subject to many brothels featured in films involving Nazi espionage.|$|E

50|$|The <b>salons</b> of Early Modern Revolutionary France {{played an}} {{integral}} {{role in the}} cultural and intellectual development of France. The <b>salons</b> were seen by contemporary writers as a cultural hub, responsible for the dissemination of good manners and sociability. It was not merely manners that the <b>salons</b> supposedly spread but also ideas, as the <b>salons</b> became a centre of intellectual {{as well as social}} exchange, playing host to many members of the Republic of Letters. In contrast to other Early Modern institutions, women played an important and visible role within the <b>salons.</b> The extent of this role is, however, heavily contested by some historians.|$|R
2500|$|Recent historiography of the <b>salons</b> {{has been}} {{dominated}} by Jürgen Habermas' work, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (triggered largely by its translation into French, in 1978, and then English, in 1989), which argued that the <b>salons</b> were of great historical importance. [...] Theatres of conversation and exchange – such as the <b>salons,</b> and the coffeehouses in England – {{played a critical role in}} the emergence of what Habermas termed the public sphere, which emerged in cultural-political contrast to court society. [...] Thus, while women retained a dominant role in the historiography of the <b>salons,</b> the <b>salons</b> received increasing amounts of study, much of it in direct response to, or heavily influenced by Habermas’ theory.|$|R

5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the <b>Salon</b> in Paris, but eventually accepted at the <b>Salon</b> des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. The White Girl shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory of innocence and its loss, and as a religious allusion to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
