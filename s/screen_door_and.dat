5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through the <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E

He had been dozing {{in a corner of the}} room. For a reason beyond understanding, he ran directly for the front <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> bashed his black head against it. The screen broke and he crawled through and ran snapping and barking up into the hills. There, Secret Service men could see him, standing alone, unmoving, on an eminence. This led to the quiet question: 'Do dogs really know?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|What a squalid little den it was! How cheap, bald, {{and petty}} {{the whole town}} seemed of a sudden. Lee Virginia halted and turned. There was {{only one thing to}} be done, and that was to make herself known. She retraced her steps, pulled open the broken <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> entered the café. It was a low, dingy dining-room filled with the odor of ham and bad coffee. At the tables ten or fifteen men, a motley throng, were busily feeding their {{voracious}} jaws, and on her left, behind a showcase filled with cigars, stood her mother, looking old, unkempt, and worried. The changes in her were so great that the girl stood in shocked alarm. At last she raised her veil. [...] "Mother," [...] she said, [...] "don't you know me?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Four Brigham City police {{officers}} {{responded to a}} complaint of a loud party. They arrived at the offending residence at about {{three o'clock in the}} morning. They traveled {{to the back of the}} house to investigate the noise. From a location in the driveway, the officers peered through a slat fence and observed two apparently underage males drinking alcohol. The officers then entered the backyard through a gate, thereby obtaining a clear view into the back of the house through a <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> two windows. The officers saw four adults restraining one juvenile. The juvenile broke free, swung a fist and struck one of the adults in the face. Two officers then opened the <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> [...] "hollered" [...] to identify themselves. When no one heard them, they entered the kitchen. After entering, one of the officers again shouted to identify and call attention to himself. As those present in the kitchen became aware of the officers, they became angry that the officers had entered the house without permission.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{the front}} entrance, offset {{slightly}} to the east, has a <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> a beveled-glass front door. The entrance leads into a first floor, which is divided into four large spaces: a front hall with a staircase, living room, dining room, and kitchen. A Tuscan order columned archway leads {{into the living room}} from the hall. Double French doors separate the living room from the dining room, which has a bay window on the western wall. The landing between the first floor and the half-story has a stained glass window.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{officers}} {{opened the}} <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> [...] "hollered" [...] to identify themselves, but the occupants didn't notice. After entering the house, one officer shouted again to identify himself, this time alerting the occupants. The occupants then became {{upset at the}} presence of the officers in the residence without permission. The officers arrested the adults and charged them with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, disorderly conduct, and intoxication. The defendants filed a motion to suppress with the trial court. The trial court sided with the defendants, and the city twice appealed to the Utah Court of Appeals and the Utah Supreme Court, which both affirmed the trial court's ruling.|$|E

50|$|The song uses {{an analogy}} {{of a common}} {{childhood}} fear of a windstorm to frame a young man's failing relationship with a woman. Here, the protagonist recalls being comforted by his mother as a gusting, howling wind smacks the <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> causes him to be frightened. The scene then shifts to the present, where he reveals his relationship difficulties and a fight that causes the woman to leave. Upon hearing the screen door slam shut, he remembers his childhood and wishes aloud that her leaving is just temporary ("It's only the wind, and nothing more/not {{the end of my}} world, walking out the door"), knowing that in this case, he has no one to comfort him.|$|E

50|$|As {{with most}} of the {{above-ground}} stations built in the past along the East West Line, it was built without platform screen doors that prevent commuters from falling onto the train tracks. Installation of the half-height screen doors started on 20 June 2011 as the last station of the East West Line. On 31 August 2011, all of the screen doors have been installed and began operating, marking the completion of the installation of all the Platform Screen Doors along the East West Line. However, on 1 February 2014, an elderly man was hit by a train and treated in hospital for multiple injuries - it is believed he gained access to the track by climbing over the platform <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> therefore the half-height Platform screen doors may need upgrading it to full-height platform screen doors.|$|E
50|$|The front porch, {{accessible}} via concrete steps, {{leads to}} the paneled oak front door with beveled glass. The screen door, of white aluminum, was installed in 2001. To {{the right of the}} front door is a bay window with decorative brickwork. A similar bay window with a hipped roof is located on the right (north) side of the home, next to a tall brick chimney. Towards the rear of the building, also on the right side, is a single-hung window. On the rear of the house, wooden steps (reconstructed in 1999) lead onto the enclosed back porch through a wooden <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> a wooden paneled door. A single double-hung window is the only one on the first-floor rear of the house. On the left (south) side of the structure is a pair of double-hung windows next to a door leading to the basement.|$|E

Also, Batty finds out that Cagney has rabbits, so she, Cagney, and Rosalind visit them in Cagney's apartment.. Yaz comes out from under the couch when Cagney has parsley, as usual, it's the first time Carla's ever come out when strangers are around, because she likes Batty so much. Rosalind and Batty start to visit the rabbits almost every morning. Sometimes Cagney was at his apartment, but usually he wasn't. Batty would always slip a carrot through the <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> then she must latch the door. If she doesn't, Cagney explains, Yaz will run away, get killed by an animal, and then Carla would die of loneliness, since she and Yaz are best friends.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>screening</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows on indoor density of Anopheles arabiensis in {{south-west}} Ethiopia: a randomized trial Fekadu Massebo 1, 2 * and Bernt Lindtjørn 2 Background: Screening of houses might have impact on density of indoor host-seeking Anopheles mosquitoes. A randomized trial of <b>screening</b> windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> with metal mesh, and closing openings on eves and walls by mud {{was conducted to}} assess if reduce indoor densities of biting mosquitoes. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected in forty houses using Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps biweekly in March and April 2011. A randomization of houses into control and intervention groups was done based on the baseline data. Windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> of 20 houses were screened by metal mesh, and openings {{on the walls and}} eves closed by mud and the rest 20 houses were used as control group. Mosquitoes were collected biweekly in October and November 2011 from both control and intervention houses. A Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with a negative binomial error distribution was used to account for over dispersion of Anopheles arabiensis and culicine counts and repeated catches made in the same house. Results: <b>Screening</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows, and closing openings on eves and wall by mud reduced the overall indoor densities of An. arabiensis by 40 %. The effect of screenings pronounced on unfed An. arabiensis by resulting 42 % reduction in houses with interventions. The total costs for <b>screening</b> windows <b>and</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> to close openings on the eves and walls by mud was 7. 34 USD per house. Conclusion: Screening houses reduced indoor density of An. arabiensis, and it was cheap and can easily incorporated into malaria vector strategies by local communities, but improving <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows fitness for screening should be considered during house construction to increase the efficacy of screenings...|$|R

50|$|The Penguin, Hawkeye and Sparrow swing {{across to}} Robbins' terrace on giant umbrellas; Penguin enters through the <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> he gasses Dawn to sleep. As Batman and Robin {{try to stop}} the Penguin, a {{powerful}} magnet the Penguin had positioned just outside is turned on and they are pulled to it because of the metal in their utility belts, immobilizing them. It is later revealed that Batman and Robin had escaped from the magnet by a room service waiter and return to police headquarters. Knowing Penguin is listening in through the umbrella's bug, they announce that the ransom will be paid at Wayne Manor and that Batman and Robin will be waiting inside the armor statues immediately inside in the entrance hall. The Penguin goes to Wayne Manor and returns the actress. He then uses his gas-umbrella to knock out anyone inside the statues. He returns to his hideout to find out that Batman and Robin were waiting there; there had been dummies inside the statues all along. The Penguin is apprehended.|$|E
5000|$|After {{a botched}} {{insertion}} in which giant bottom-feeders called [...] "Leviathans" [...] attack the squad and force them ashore, the team manages {{to make its}} way through the base's grounds, solving riddles that let them progress through the area as well as dealing with Umbrella's newest creation, called [...] "Trisquads," [...] which are essentially zombies who have retained enough intelligence and motor capabilities to use automatic weapons. When Karen Driver is accidentally infected with the T-virus after touching contaminated blood, the others rush through the many caves and underground tunnels searching for the bases' lab, fending off more of Umbrella's biological monstrosities. Steve takes Karen and manages to find the labs, but the two are then taken captive by Griffith. Karen turns into a zombie and kills one of Griffith's servant zombies while Griffith injects a stunned Steve with the T-virus. Under Griffith's orders, Steve lures Rebecca, David, and John into a trap in which John is severely wounded. Griffith then orders Steve to lock Rebecca and David in an airlock chamber and flood it. He then orders Steve to kill himself, which he does. As the chamber floods, Rebecca notices Karen's body and remembers that she carried a World War II [...] "pineapple" [...] fragmentation grenade with her as a good luck charm from her father. David pries the pin out of the ancient explosive and jams it in between the <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> inside door of the chamber. The resulting explosion forces the outside door to open, allowing Rebecca and David to swim to the surface and to safety. The explosion forces the inside door to blow off its hinges, killing Griffith instantly.|$|E
