5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread.</b> Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

25|$|Lyon was slight {{of figure}} with a shabby appearance; his boots were often unpolished, his uniform was often faded, and his {{insignia}} were often tarnished.

25|$|Although asado is eaten {{all over}} the country, its origin may {{be traced back to}} the Pampas. It entails {{manifold}} types of meat, which are generally eaten as follows: achuras (offal, or the cow's inner parts), morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes also a provoleta (a piece of provolone cheese cooked on the grill with oregano) are eaten first. Then comes the choripán (a kind of spiced sausage made with pork or lamb and placed between two <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread),</b> and lastly meat such as asado de tira, vacío (flank steak), lomo (tenderloin), colita de cuadril (rump), matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut into slices and served cold), entraña (innards); the list is never-ending. It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as cabrito al asador (roast kid or goat) in the province of Córdoba.|$|E
25|$|Campfires {{have been}} used for cooking since time immemorial. Possibly the {{simplest}} method of cooking over a campfire {{and one of the most}} common is to roast food on long skewers that can be held above the flames. This is a popular technique for cooking hot dogs or toasting marshmallows for making s'mores. This type of cooking over the fire typically consists of comfort foods that are easy to prepare. There is also no clean up involved unlike an actual kitchen. Another technique is to use pie irons—small iron molds with long handles. Campers put <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> with some kind of filling into the molds and put them over hot coals to cook. Campers sometimes use elaborate grills, cast iron pots, and fire irons to cook. Often, however, they use portable stoves for cooking instead of campfires. :For more information, see Campfire cooking.|$|E

Starving Soviet civilians began to eat their domestic animals, along with hair tonic and Vaseline.

Shortly after its creation, the hamburger was prepared with all of the now typically characteristic trimmings, including onions, lettuce, and sliced pickles.|$|E

The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, now known as [...] "Hamburger Charlie", with the invention. Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair, made so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.|$|E
2500|$|Fletcher Davis of Athens, Texas {{claimed to}} have invented the hamburger. According to oral histories, in the 1880s he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a 'burger' of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread,</b> with a pickle on the side. The story is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a {{sandwich}} stand at the St. Louis World's Fair. Historian Frank X. Tolbert, noted that Athens resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with 'Old Dave' a.k.a. Fletcher Davis.

Bouck was jammed into a single railroad cattle car with 71 other POWs and traveled for days without food or water. By Christmas Day, seven men in Bouck's car had died and the rest were barely hanging on. The prisoners were transported to hospitals in Frankfurt and Hanover. Their unmarked trains were prime targets for Allied aircraft, who attacked the train on December 21, killing and wounding several POWs. The POWs were allowed off only once, and were given only a few <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> and some water to drink during the entire trip.|$|E

2500|$|Walter Anderson {{contributed a}} number of novel ideas to White Castle during its early years, {{including}} {{the creation of a}} special spatula and a special bread for the burgers. In 1949, an employee named Earl Howell calculated {{the amount of time that}} it took to break hamburgers apart in a presentable fashion, eventually leading him to create the perforated burger. By 1951, White Castle had incorporated five perforations into its burgers. Before Anderson, hamburgers were cooked on a grill for an indefinite period of time and minced meat balls were [...] "crushed" [...] into conventional <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread,</b> like a sandwich. The meat was frozen and hamburgers came to be cooked from frozen, instead of using fresh meat. White Castle revolutionized the burger-making process by regularizing the finished products and using hygienic preparation techniques that were in clear view of the customers.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{possible}} fathers of the hamburger is Charlie Nagreen (1871–1951) of Seymour, Wisconsin, who {{at the age of}} 15 sold Hamburg steaks from a street stall at the annual Outagamie County Fair. Nagreen said he began by selling Hamburg steaks, but these did not have much success because people wanted to freely move around the festival without the need to eat them at his stand. In response to this, in 1885 Nagreen decided to flatten the hamburger steak and insert it between two <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread,</b> so that the public could move freely from booth to booth while eating his sandwich, an innovation that was well received by his customers. This became known as the [...] "Hamburger Charlie", and Nagreen's creation was sold at the festival until his death in 1951. To this day, his accomplishment is celebrated annually with a [...] "Burger Fest" [...] in his honor in his hometown of Seymour.|$|E
2500|$|According to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the {{hamburger}}, {{a ground}} meat patty between two <b>slices</b> <b>of</b> <b>bread,</b> was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. There have been rival claims by Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, and Fletcher Davis. White Castle traces {{the origin of}} the hamburger to Hamburg, Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase. However, it gained national recognition at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when the New York Tribune referred to the hamburger as [...] "the innovation of a food vendor on the pike". No conclusive argument has ever ended the dispute over invention. An article from ABC News sums up: [...] "One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the spread of the burger happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went in an instant. And it is entirely possible that more than one person {{came up with the idea}} at the same time in different parts of the country." ...|$|E
