Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone (which adds calcium). Skinless and boneless canned salmon is also available.|$|E

50|$|The company {{takes its}} name from Loch Fyne, a sea loch on the west coast of Scotland. The {{business}} started life as an oyster farm in that loch. It was originally a joint venture by Johnny Noble, the owner of the nearby Ardkinglas Estate, and Andy Lane, a fish farmer and biologist. Initially the business sold their oysters to UK restaurants. In the early 1980s the company diversified into the supply of other seafood, and opened a smokehouse to <b>smoke</b> <b>salmon</b> and other fish.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{strategy}} aimed at variable selection in models for ordinal data. The procedure core exploits the primary splitters, as they arise from a tree-based procedure. Indeed, the latter is based on a recursive partitioning approach that increasingly reduces the so called impurity of the response variable based on the covariate values. Since the reduction in impurity provides a natural importance ranking of the covariates, this allows to identify those relevant among the available ones. The proposed strategy is, then, used for detecting relevant covariates in a case study concerning the consumers’ preferences towards different types of <b>smoked</b> <b>salmons...</b>|$|R

Today, she writes little for the magazine save the monthly editor's letter. She reportedly has three full-time assistants but sometimes surprises callers by answering the phone herself.

500|$|The last of {{the books}} planned by David was Elizabeth David's Christmas (2003). She and Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as the}} 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out the author's papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. The Christmas recipes David had most often been asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page work. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks. The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first printed in Vogue in 1959, and included in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way—and I shan't—my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a <b>smoked</b> <b>salmon</b> sandwich with a glass of champagne on a tray in bed in the evening." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. <b>Smoked</b> <b>salmon</b> enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E

As a reference, diploid siblings kept and processed under equal conditions was used. Ploidy {{did not affect}} the raw material biometrics but increased holding temperature gave increased blood lactate and decreased muscle pH at point of death. Triploid Atlantic salmon was found to be suitable for cold smoke processing but the differences in quality between diploid and triploid was significant. Cold <b>smoked</b> triploid <b>salmon</b> have on average lower processing yield, higher weight loss throughout processing and storage, and was softer as compared to diploids. Ploidy did however not affect the NaCl content. A consumer test did also distinguish between cold smoked diploid and triploid salmon originally kept at 10 °C. In addition, increased holding temperature was found to give a step-wise lower weight loss during processing and significant darker fillets after cold smoking and storage...|$|R
