5|$|Ctenophores form {{an animal}} phylum {{that is more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals). Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have <b>sensory</b> <b>organs.</b> Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.|$|E
5|$|An ant's head {{contains}} many <b>sensory</b> <b>organs.</b> Like most insects, ants have compound eyes made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes {{are good for}} acute movement detection, but do not offer a high resolution image. They also have three small ocelli (simple eyes) {{on the top of}} the head that detect light levels and polarization. Compared to vertebrates, most ants have poor-to-mediocre eyesight and a few subterranean species are completely blind. However, some ants, such as Australia's bulldog ant, have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away.|$|E
40|$|Asymmetric cell {{division}} {{is a fundamental}} process for the gen-eration of daughter cells with different fates. Two types of IIb cell divides to produce two inner cells, the neuron and the sheath cell (Fig. 5 A). In Drosophila, an adult external <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> (bristle) localization of Numb {{is important for the}} cell fate deter-mechanisms may be used in generating asymmetric {{cell division}}s, an extrinsic mechanism and an intrinsic mechanism. The intrinsic mechanism involves the segregation of an inherited determinant preferentially into one of the daughter cells. The extrinsic mechanism may be executed through cell-cell communication (reviewed by Horvitz and Herskowitz, 1992). In Drosophila, both mechanisms are used to generate the distinct fates of the cells within an adult <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> which, like the external <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> in the embryonic periph-eral nervous system (PNS), is derived from a single <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> precursor (SOP) cell (Hartenstein and Posakony, 1989) ...|$|R

40|$|In 1975 Antonio García-Bellido {{proposed}} that selector genes {{such as the}} homeotic transcription factors do not themselves participate in the differentiation of the body segments they specify but instead activate (or select) a set of downstream 'realisator' genes that encode the proteins that carry out cell differentiation (Garcia- Bellido, 1975). Since then numerous genetic and molecular studies of development have borne out this view. The proneural transcription factors act as selector genes to specify neural cell types in the ectoderm. I have taken a systematic genomics approach to discover the set of realisator genes activated by the proneural transcription factors (proneural genetic program) in the developing peripheral nervous system. This approach {{has led to the}} discovery of 30 new genes expressed specifically in the <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> anlagen (proneural clusters and <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> precursors). These new genes encode a diverse array of implied protein functions many of which are novel and unexpected. By analyzing how these new genes are regulated I have discovered a new type of regulatory module directly regulated by the proneural factors that drives expression throughout the proneural cluster. I have also begun a genetic analysis of the proneural genetic program by studying the function of the <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> precursor gene insensitive. insensitive encodes a conserved nuclear protein that is required for asymmetric cell division during peripheral nervous system development. Further analysis has demonstrated that insensitive contributes to Notch signaling repression in the <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> lineage by regulating the expression of the lethal (2) giant larvae gene. This research has revealed that the proneural transcription factors activate a diverse program of gene expression that includes newly discovered genetic functions important for both the early specification of the <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> precursor and later cell fate decisions in the <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> lineag...|$|R
5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus. First described in 2007, it {{is closely related to}} Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the idiosoma, the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between two lyrifissures (<b>sensory</b> <b>organs)</b> on {{the lower part of the}} female body. The pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys. Females of A.gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield (covering part of the underparts) and shorter setae (bristles) on the upperparts.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary <b>sensory</b> <b>organs</b> are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum {{that are more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals.

5|$|Gastrotrichs have {{a simple}} body plan with a head region, with a brain and <b>sensory</b> <b>organs,</b> and a trunk with a simple gut and the {{reproductive}} organs. They have adhesive glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various <b>sensory</b> <b>organs</b> from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} <b>sensory</b> <b>organs.</b> Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E

5|$|The ants {{were also}} {{observed}} {{to use their}} jaws as a catapult to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat. Before striking, the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism. Energy is stored in a thick band of muscle and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of <b>sensory</b> <b>organs</b> resembling hairs {{on the inside of}} the mandibles. The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks. Trap-jaws also are seen in the following genera: Anochetus, Orectognathus, and Strumigenys, plus some members of the Dacetini tribe, which are viewed as examples of convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the perception of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by <b>sensory</b> <b>organs</b> such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the perception of a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} {{millipede}} {{is typically}} rounded above and flattened below and bears a pair of large mandibles {{in front of a}} plate-like structure called a gnathochilarium ("jaw lip"). The head contains a single pair of antennae with seven or eight segments and a group of sensory cones at the tip. Many orders also possess a pair of <b>sensory</b> <b>organs</b> known as the Tömösváry organs, shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral {{to the base of the}} antennae. Their function is unknown, but they also occur in some centipedes, and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in the surrounding environment.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded <b>sensory</b> <b>organ</b> would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|R
5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary <b>sensory</b> <b>organs</b> similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. <b>Sensory</b> <b>organs</b> include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the <b>sensory</b> <b>organs,</b> while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
