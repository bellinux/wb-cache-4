40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{inorganic}} aerosol concentrations and wood <b>smoke</b> <b>tracer</b> potassium and levoglucosan concentrations in Birmingham, UK. Also a multi-wavelength aethalometer was utilized as a carbonaceous aerosol detector to directly measure the local wood smoke PM mass and traffic PM mass. To achieve this, daily PM 2. 5 inorganic ions sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, nitrate, sulphate, and organic compound levoglucosan were measured {{over a period}} of more than one and half years at four sampling locations. There were: (1) Elms road, University of Birmingham; (2) North Kilworth Mill Observatory Site; (3) Churchill Pumping Station Site; and (4) Budbrooke, Warwick Sampling Site. Correlation analysis, regression analysis, and seasonal variation were examined for those inorganic and organic elements and compounds. The results were used to provide comprehensive spatial and temporal distributions, intra-site and inter-site comparison differentiations. Wood smoke potassium and levoglucosan were used as wood <b>smoke</b> <b>tracer</b> to determine the local resident wood smoke PM mass concentrations in this thesis. Budbrooke, Warwick Sampling Site for example, a mean value of 62 ng m- 3 wood smoke potassium was measured at winter periods but the mean value of only 17 ng m- 3 was measured during summer periods. This significant difference demonstrated a frequent wood smoke activity in this area during winter periods. Also a multi-wavelength aethalometer was used as wood smoke mass detector to measure the local resident wood smoke PM mass and local traffic PM mass concentrations. These three methods have their unique processes of acquiring the wood smoke mass concentrations, thus the results from these method have considerable variations. Therefore these three methods have inter-compared with each other to achieve better wood smoke concentrations results in order to obtain the best method of measuring local wood smoke mass.

40|$|In {{the first}} phase of this project three {{enhanced}} large diameter (> 60 cm) residential wells were constructed at a study site in Lindsay, Ontario. Two wells were constructed using concrete tile casing while the other well was constructed using galvanized steel casing. Javor (2010) evaluated various aspects of drinking water well construction and design to determine the susceptibility of residential large diameter drinking water wells to surface water and airborne contamination. One of the purposes of these new installations was to remove the uncertainty with respect to construction methods, age and maintenance that is characteristic of residential drinking water well performance studies. Javor (2010) conducted a field and laboratory study to assess the performance of several design changes that were thought to improve the integrity of large diameter drinking water wells. These experiments were also used to determine whether one design was more prone to atmospheric and/or surface water contamination than another. During the second phase of this project routine monitoring was continued and data pertinent to assess the performance of the test wells were collected using the same instrumentation. This routine monitoring involved the visual inspection of the wells, collection of well water elevation, collection of soil temperature profile data, collection and analysis of water samples, and collection of cumulative water volumes extracted from the test wells. In addition to the routine monitoring, a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey was performed in October 2010 to complement the previous data collected during February 2010. <b>Smoke</b> <b>tracer</b> tests were performed under non-frozen and frozen conditions to re-assess the potential pathways of contaminants between the atmosphere and the interior of the test wells. Bacteriological indicators and high concentrations of two dissolved ions were detected in all test and monitoring wells. The <b>smoke</b> <b>tracer</b> tests demonstrated that pathways for airborne contaminants to enter the test wells exist with similar pathways observed in the winter and the summer. GPR surveys indicated that the bentonite slurry annular sealant was the most homogeneous media. A baseline characterization of the microbial nature of the biofilm performed in three of the test wells (CTH 1, ETH 1 and ETH 3) indicated that the sessile bacteria are more metabolically diverse than suspended bacteria, and that this diversity is even higher in the concrete cased wells. Biofilm characterization performed on concrete, fibreglass and galvanized steel coupons incubated in two of the test wells (concrete and galvanized steel) showed that bacteria in the concrete cased wells barely colonized on fiberglass and galvanized steel, while bacteria in the galvanized steel cased well did not have difficulty colonizing on any of the casing materials. The results of the biofilm cleaning study indicated that the use of pressure washing combined with chlorination effectively removed biofilm grown on galvanized steel and fibreglass casing materials. This study investigated various factors that could affect the performance of large diameter drinking water wells. Since the test wells used in this study were under the direct influence of surface water a comparison between the various annular sealants was problematic. However, the three enhanced test wells outperformed the conventional test well. The observations from the <b>smoke</b> <b>tracer</b> tests performed under non-frozen and frozen conditions indicate that the Poly-Lok lid seam is the most prevalent pathway for airborne contaminants to enter a well. Fibreglass may be the preferred choice for large diameter well casing material since fibreglass is corrosion resistant, lightweight, easy to install, has a high strength to weight ratio, and a greater degree of biofilm was able to be removed from fibreglass casing material than from galvanized steel casing material...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a new method the air tracer test to investigate the persistence of open cracks and loosening of rock mass slope. In this method, we use smoke, hot air, and/or specific gas as tracers injecting them into open cracks directly or using a specific double packer settled in a borehole. Observation and confirmation of the outflow of the tracer is performed by naked eye for the rock surface, and by a borehole TV, gas sensors, or thermosensors settled in another borehole for rock interior. We applied the method to several rock slopes in which various type of open cracks exist, and demonstrated that the air tracer could move through open cracks from under 1 mm to over 1 m in width. The <b>smoke</b> <b>tracer</b> was particularly detectable even after having moved about 100 m. The method can clarify not only persistent open cracks and loosened zones but also the loosening mechanism such as toppling, sliding, etc. The air tracer test should become a useful method for selecting appropriate countermeasures for unstable rock slopes...|$|E

40|$|Research {{data on the}} {{aerodynamic}} {{behavior of}} baseballs and cricket and golf balls are summarized. Cricket balls and baseballs are roughly {{the same size and}} mass but have different stitch patterns. Both are thrown to follow paths that avoid a batter's swing, paths that can curve if aerodynamic forces on the balls' surfaces are asymmetric. <b>Smoke</b> <b>tracer</b> wind tunnel tests and pressure taps have revealed that the unbalanced side forces are induced by tripping the boundary layer on the seam side and producing turbulence. More particularly, the greater pressures are perpendicular to the seam plane and only appear when the balls travel at velocities high enough so that the roughness length matches the seam heigh. The side forces, once tripped, will increase with spin velocity up to a cut-off point. The enhanced lift coefficient is produced by the Magnus effect. The more complex stitching on a baseball permits greater variations in the flight path curve and, {{in the case of a}} knuckleball, the unsteady flow effects. For golf balls, the dimples trip the boundary layer and the high spin rate produces a lift coefficient maximum of 0. 5, compared to a baseball's maximum of 0. 3.

40|$|Observations of {{flow and}} {{dispersion}} {{in urban areas}} with tall buildings have revealed a phenomenon whereby contaminants can be transported vertically up the lee sides of tall buildings due to the vertical flow {{in the wake of}} the building. This phenomenon, which contributes to what is sometimes called “rapid vertical dispersion”, has important consequences for the dispersion of pollutants in urban areas and its understanding may be crucial to improving urban dispersion models. This venting effect was observed in a wind-tunnel study of dispersion from the site of the destroyed W orld Trade Center (W TC) in New York City, using a scale model of lower Manhattan, including a scaled representation of the rubble pile. Enhanced vertical d ispersion was seen on the downwind side of several tall buildings in the highly urban area surrounding the WTC site using a <b>smoke</b> <b>tracer.</b> The flow responsible for this vertical dispersion was measured with laser Doppler velocimetry, and its effects on the plume were demonstrated with concentration measurements of an ethane tracer released from the rubble pile. Notably, the W orld Financial Center buildings, which stood upwind of the WTC site for westerly winds, caused an initial vertical dispersion of the plume before it began to move downwind. This vertical dispersion was caused by a vertical flow {{in the wake of the}}se buildings and resulted in rapid transport of contam inants to heights above the building tops. The enhancem ent of the dispersion of the W TC plume due to tall building wake effects is analyzed and compared with Gaussian plume m odel predictions. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} of residential wood burning becoming an increasingly popular space heating method due to rising energy costs {{and interest in}} renewable energy resources raises both air quality and public health concerns. This work demonstrates a novel method that incorporates mobile and fixed-site monitoring to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of residential wood smoke and identify persistent wood smoke hot spots within five communities situated in north-western British Columbia. High density measurements were collected throughout the communities with an integrated nephelometer during evenings (November 2007 and April 2008) when wood smoke {{was expected to be}} prevalent. Gravimetric PM[subscript 2. 5] samples were collected at the central monitoring station in each community (October 2007 - April 2009) and analyzed for PM[subscript 2. 5], levoglucosan (wood <b>smoke</b> <b>tracer),</b> and light absorbance (black carbon indicator). Slash burning activity was also assessed as a potential confounder of residential wood smoke. Measurements at the central monitoring stations confirmed that wood smoke is a prevalent (levoglucosan/PM[subscript 2. 5] = 0. 06 ± 0. 03) and consistent (levoglucosan-PM[subscript 2. 5] r[subscript]spear = 0. 78 - 0. 92) source of PM[subscript 2. 5] in the communities. Comparisons between the 2007 - 08 and 2008 - 09 heating seasons suggest residential wood smoke concentrations may be declining. Persistent wood smoke hotspots were identified via mobile monitoring with mean estimated PM[subscript 2. 5] ranging 13 - 59 μg m⁻³ and maximum values > 200 μg m⁻³. The majority of these areas were associated with single family dwellings followed by housing types typically associated with lower socioeconomic statuses. Central monitoring stations were representative of seasonal average community-wide concentrations for heating season evenings.

40|$|Published {{scientific}} work indicates that residential large diameter drinking water wells {{are at a}} higher risk of contamination from surface water impacts than drilled wells. The possibility of a higher incidence of contamination of large diameter wells is attributed to site selection and construction problems such as leaking joints in the well casing, ineffective annular sealant placed between the well casing and the formation, a poorly fitted cover with an access lid that promotes contaminant entry and air entry without adequate air filtration, well location down gradient of septic effluent sources, and depth limitations due to improper equipment used to advance the well which results in shallow wells often situated in topographical lows. In some situations, flaws in the well design were actually deliberate measures intended to capture surface water at sites with low groundwater yield. Historically, residential drinking water well performance studies have focussed on existing wells; however, uncertainty in the actual well construction methods and materials, well age and maintenance efforts have been problematic. A field and laboratory study was completed to assess the performance of several design changes that were thought to improve the integrity of large diameter drinking water wells, and to determine whether one design is more prone to atmospheric and/or surface water contamination than the other. Four large diameter residential wells were installed at a study site in Lindsay, Ontario. Three of these wells are constructed with enhanced construction methods (two using a cement tile casing and one using a galvanized steel casing) and annular sealants, while the fourth was constructed using conventional methods for cement cased wells. The enhanced test wells utilized a sealant between the casing sections, various annular sealants between the formation and the well casing, sanitary waterline connections, and ventilation with air filtration. The well constructed using outdated methods did not have any of these advanced features. An automated water extraction system removed about 875 L/day from each well to mimic residential usage. Routine monitoring, and laboratory and field testing were used to collect pertinent data required for this performance assessment. Routine monitoring involved the visual inspection of the wells, collection of well water elevation, collection of soil temperature profile data, collection and analysis of water samples, and collection of cumulative water volumes purged from the test wells. A biofilm cleaning study and analysis of cement-bentonite grout was conducted in the laboratory while smoke and aqueous tracer tests were conducted in the field. The biofilm cleaning study entailed growing a biofilm on different large diameter well casing materials and applying cleaning methods thought to be practical for cleaning the interior walls of large diameter wells. Different mixtures of cement-bentonite grout were subjected to volume measurements, vertical load bearing capacity analysis, and hydraulic conductivity analysis to determine their suitability as a potential annular sealant. The tracer tests were developed to determine whether pathways for either airborne contaminants or surface water to enter the test wells exist. The test wells were filled with smoke and monitored for potential atmospheric pathways. A tracer solution was infiltrated around the test wells and the interior of the tests wells were monitored for potential pathways for surface water to enter. Bacteriological indicators were detected in all test wells. The <b>smoke</b> <b>tracer</b> tests demonstrated that pathways for airborne contaminants to enter the test wells exist with more pathways observed in the winter than the summer. The aqueous tracer tests highlighted several areas where surface water could enter the test wells if ponding occurred around the well casing. As expected the enhanced test wells performed much better than the conventional test well for both of these tracer tests. The results of the biofilm cleaning study indicated that galvanized steel or fibreglass casing materials were the only materials able to be cleaned effectively. The best method in this study to remove biofilm from casing materials was pressure washing. The results from the cement-bentonite grout investigation indicated that cement-bentonite grout with 5 % bentonite would make the most suitable annular sealant as its volume changed the least during curing, it was strong enough to support the load from maintenance efforts, and was the most impervious. The results {{of this study indicate that}} large diameter wells constructed with a proper annular sealant, sealant between casing sections and a sanitary waterline connection are less prone to contamination. Monitoring of the test wells should continue as they mature to determine whether this plays a significant role in their ability to prevent contamination of large diameter wells. <b>Smoke</b> <b>tracer</b> tests should be conducted again during the winter to determine if temperature was the cause of increased atmospheric pathways. A field-scale method to remove biofilm from the interior casing wall of large diameter wells should be developed and tested. A field-scale investigation of cement-bentonite grout for use as an annular sealant should be completed. Fibreglass casings can be fabricated as a continuous piece with no seams or joints and hence another well should be constructed and studied using corrugated fibreglass (NSF ANSI 61) casing...|$|E

It is concluded that there may be two distinct source types, one from wood stoves and fireplaces with a high organic carbon content, best represented by levoglucosan, the other from larger, modern appliances with a very high burn-out efficiency, best represented by potassium.

They determined that the concentrations at SNB maximized during summer, whereas an absence of seasonal variation was observed at the oceanic site. At ARO, the O 3 concentrations were found to depend significantly on the residence times of air masses over the polluted region of Europe during spring and summer (Pochanart et al. 2001). An increase in O 3 concentrations has been observed in the aged air masses, {{which is the result}} of direct photochemical accumulation of O 3 when the air masses pass over large-scale anthropogenically influenced regions in Europe. South foehn is a typical Alpine meteorological phenomenon characterized by south to north advection and is caused by a strong pressure gradient across the Alps that leads to a descending air stream northward (Seibert 1990). Campana et al. (2005) observed enhanced O 3 concentrations during south foehn events during spring and summer at ARO. In the case of the south foehn, the continental-scale influence of pollutant emissions on O 3 appeared to be far less important than the direct influence of the Po Basin emissions.

Vortex velocities were {{measured by a}} laser-Doppler velocimeter, an array of monostatic acoustic sounders, {{and an array of}} propeller anemometers. Flow visualization of the wake was achieved using <b>smoke</b> and balloon <b>tracers.</b> Preliminary results were obtained on the initial downwash field, the time for merging of the multiple vortices, the velocity fields, vortex decay, and the effects of spoilers and differential flap settings on the dissipation and structure of vortices...|$|R
40|$|As an augmentative {{means of}} forced {{convective}} heat transfer, {{relationships between the}} heat transfer and the flow behavior were experimentally investigated when the longitudinal vortex was artificially generated by single vortex generator in a pipe. The formation of vortices and then flow spiraling downstream were visualized by means of fluorescein and <b>smoke</b> as <b>tracer</b> of water and air flow, respectively. The velocity components were also measured using an inclined hot wire probe in three flow directions. The vortices rings being accompanied with longitudinal vortex {{as a kind of}} shear vortex gradually closed to the wall surface. It was found that the local heat transfer coefficients was mainly increased depending on the circumferential velocity component. Furthermore, a law of non-analogy between heat and flow was discussed about some locations taking accounts of both heat transfer coefficients and skin friction factors...|$|R
40|$|Wildfires raged {{throughout}} western Russia {{and parts}} of Eastern Europe during a persistent heat wave {{in the summer of}} 2010. Anomalously high surface temperatures (35 – 41 °C) and low relative humidity (9 – 25 %) from mid-June to mid-August 2010 shown by analysis of radiosonde data from multiple sites in western Russia were ideal conditions for the wildfires to thrive. Measurements of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) over western Russian indicate persistent subsidence during the heat wave. Daily three-day back-trajectories initiated over Moscow reveal a persistent anti-cyclonic circulation for 18 days in August, coincident with the most intense period of fire activity observed by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This unfortunate meteorological coincidence allowed transport of polluted air from the region of intense fires to Moscow and the surrounding area. We demonstrate that the 2010 Russian wildfires are unique in the record of observations obtained by remote-sensing instruments on-board NASA satellites: Aura and Aqua (part of the A-Train Constellation) and Terra. Analysis of the distribution of MODIS fire products and aerosol optical thickness (AOT), UV aerosol index (AI) and single-scattering albedo (SSA) from Aura's Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and total column carbon monoxide (CO) from Aqua's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) show that the region in the center of western Russia surrounding Moscow (52 °– 58 ° N, 33 °– 43 ° E) is most severely impacted by wildfire emissions. Over this area, AIRS CO, OMI AI, and MODIS AOT are significantly enhanced relative to the historical satellite record during the first 18 days in August when the anti-cyclonic circulation persisted. By mid-August, the anti-cyclonic circulation was replaced with westerly transport over Moscow and vicinity. The heat wave ended as anomalies of surface temperature and relative humidity, and OLR disappeared. After 18 August the fire activity greatly diminished over western Russia and levels of the satellite <b>smoke</b> <b>tracers</b> returned to values typical of previous years...|$|R
40|$|Fine {{particulate}} matter {{samples were collected}} in an urban ambient fixed site and, outside and inside residencies in Athens greater area, Greece. n-Alkanes, iso/anteiso-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The values of concentration diagnostic ratios indicated a mixture of vehicular emissions, fuel evaporation, oil residues and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in outdoor and indoor samples. Particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes, specific tracers of ETS, were detected in both non-smoking and smoking households. The indoor-to-outdoor ratios of particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes and unresolved complex mixture (a tracer of outdoor air pollution) in non-smoking households were comparable to the measured air exchange rate. This suggested that penetration of outdoor air was solely responsible {{for the detection of}} tobacco <b>smoke</b> particulate <b>tracers</b> in indoor non-smoking environments. Overall, residential outdoor concentrations accounted for a large fraction (from 25 up to 79 %) of indoor aliphatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Open windows/doors and the operation of an air condition unit yielded also in higher indoor concentrations than those measured outdoors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis work {{illustrates}} {{the first of}} its kind solution to this problem of lack of seeding at vortex core in air flows, by the use of Helium Filled Soap Bubble (HFSB) which is a neutrally buoyant tracer particle in air flows. To analyse the lack of seeding in the vortex core, a 2 D numerical simulation of particle motion in vortex flow is studied. This enables to understand the dependence of trajectory of the particle on its density and diameter, in vortex flows. Thus, the numerical simulation helps to explain the reason behind the empty core with the use of micro-size smoke particles and, the completely filled core by the homogeneous distribution of HFSB in the vortex core region. Flow visualisation experiment is performed on Leading Edge Vortex of a delta-wing at a chord based Reynolds number of 2 * 10 ^ 5 and 4 * 10 ^ 5 The flow visualization experiment revealed an empty core at the center of the vortex with the use of micro-sized <b>smoke</b> particle as <b>tracer.</b> On the other hand, the use of neutrally buoyant HFSB resulted in a homogeneous distribution of particles, especially in the core region of the vortex. The vector fields obtained from stereoscopic PIV measurements with the use of micro-sized <b>smoke</b> as <b>tracer</b> particle, displays the loss of information in vortex ow particularly in axial velocity and axial vorticity fields. In contrast, the use of HFSB as tracer particle, resulted in particle filled vortex core and displays vector fields that are consistent with literature. The use of HFSB as tracer particle enabled to perform tomographic Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) (3 C- 3 D) on the Leading Edge Vortex. Tomo PTV performed on the vortex ow field enabled to obtain the velocity and vorticity fields in all three directions. Aerospace EngineeringAerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsio...|$|R

To assess this risk, a human lung model (respiration rate, 12 breaths/min) was designed to test the potential for a simple oxygen mask at a common setting (4 L/min) to disperse potentially infectious exhaled air into the surrounding area. A laser sheet was used to illuminate the exhaled air from the mask, which contained fine <b>tracer</b> <b>smoke</b> particles.
