5|$|After {{hearing the}} news that the United States had {{informed}} Britain it would be ending its obligations under the Treaty of 1818 and looking for a division of the Oregon Country, the legislature scaled back its agenda. One piece of legislation passed was a pilotage law that set standards and licensed boat pilots {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. The 1846 legislature met in the home of Henry Montgomery Knighton in Oregon City from December 1 through 19, with Asa Lovejoy serving as the <b>speaker</b> <b>and</b> leader. Noah Huber served as a clerk and Knighton as sergeant at arms.|$|E

After 38 continuous years of service to his country, he retired from the Army on October 19, 1899, as a brigadier general. After his retirement, he became a <b>speaker</b> <b>and</b> a writer.|$|E
5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the <b>Speaker</b> <b>and</b> the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E

5|$|Baseball {{historian}} Bill James {{does not}} dispute this claim in apparently referring to <b>Speaker</b> <b>and</b> possibly Cobb, but {{says that the}} Klan had toned down its racist overtures during the 1920s and pulled in {{hundreds of thousands of}} non-racist men, including Hugo Black. James adds that Speaker was a staunch supporter of Doby when he broke the American League color barrier, working long hours with the former second baseman on how to play the outfield.|$|E
5|$|Calls by the {{legislature}} for Magoffin's resignation had begun as early as September 30, 1861. On August 16, 1862, Magoffin declared his willingness to resign {{on the condition that}} he be allowed to choose his successor. Because Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office in 1859, Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk was next in line for the governorship. Magoffin refused to accept Fisk as his successor, so Fisk resigned as <b>speaker</b> <b>and</b> the senate elevated Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, to speaker. Magoffin resigned as governor on August 18, 1862, and Robinson assumed the office of governor for the remainder of Magoffin's term.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{friction}} {{within the}} Republican Party caucus, Boehner decided {{to step down}} as <b>speaker</b> <b>and</b> resign his seat in Congress.

Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader and second-in-command to the Speaker, was initially viewed as the favorite to win the Speakership. However, due to the opposition of the Freedom Caucus, McCarthy {{dropped out of the}} race on October 8, and the caucus vote was postponed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first investigation regarding lexicon grounding and evolution under an iterated learning regime without an explicit transfer of reference.

In this paper I investigate {{the effects of}} allowing both adults and learners {{to take up the}} role of <b>speakers</b> <b>and</b> hearers with varying probabilities. The results indicate that when adults and learners can be selected as <b>speakers</b> <b>and</b> hearers, their lexicons become more similar but at the cost of reduced success in communication...|$|R

5|$|Governor John P. Richardson {{had been}} elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought re-nomination, to be met with {{opposition}} from Tillman's farmers. As {{had been done to}} Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman was a highly talented stump <b>speaker,</b> <b>and</b> when given the opportunity to debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, a gambler and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, which turned down Tillman's demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson's nomination be made unanimous.|$|E
