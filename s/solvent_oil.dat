40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} organic co-solvent (n-heptane, toluene and anisole, up to 10 wt. %) in the hydrothermal liquefaction of macroalgal biomass {{as a means of}} achieving in situ fractionation of the biocrude product according to polarity. The filamentous freshwater macroalga Oedogonium was grown under nutrient-depleted conditions to achieve a low nitrogen content, 1. 1 wt. % N. Its hydrothermal liquefaction in a continuous pilot plant reactor (300 - 350 °C, 3 - 5 min and 2 - 5 wt. % loadings) yielded up to 25 wt. % (dry ash-free basis, daf) extractable biocrude. More severe conditions led to biocrudes in higher yields, with reduced oxygen and slightly increased nitrogen contents, and with lower viscosity. The presence of co-solvents had little effect on the total biocrude yield but gave rise to in situ separation of the biocrude into distinct fractions associated with the organic phase (designated <b>solvent</b> <b>oil)</b> and the aqueous phase (designated DCM oil). The amount of <b>solvent</b> <b>oil</b> produced exceeded the amount that could be extracted at room temperature, by that solvent, from the product mixture obtained in the absence of co-solvent. The relative proportions and properties of the solvent and DCM fractions varied with the polarity of the co-solvent. Anisole co-solvent dissolved nearly all the biocrude and the resulting viscous oil was similar to that obtained without co-solvent. On the other hand, <b>solvent</b> <b>oil</b> produced with n-heptane (~. 7. 4 wt. % daf yield, or ~. 37 % of the total biocrude) had significantly reduced levels of nitrogen (1. 1 wt. %) and oxygen (12. 5 wt. %) and possessed relatively low viscosity. Toluene co-solvent HTL produced a <b>solvent</b> <b>oil</b> with intermediate yield and properties. Co-solvent HTL offers a simple and effective means of fractionating HTL biocrude on the basis of polarity.

40|$|When a {{potential}} difference {{is applied to}} two immiscible liquids in contact with each other, the interfacial tension changes with it. Such an electrocapillary phenomenon takes place over a reasonable potential range, i. e. from ca. - 20 to + 20 V, only when the system has a sufficiently high electric conductance and contains surface active agents. For a system of an organic <b>solvent</b> (<b>oil</b> phase) in contact with an aqueous solution (aqueous phase), the electrocapillary curve has a characteristic shape depending on the ionic type of the surface active agents; the interfacial tension is suppressed over the cathodic or anodic polarization range according as the surface active agent is cationic or anionic. Here, the sign of polarization is taken {{as that of the}} aqueous phase with respect to the oil phase. In the case of amphoteric surface active agents the shape of curves depends on the pH value of the aqueous phase, being the anionic or cationic type according as the pI-I value is higher or lower than a certain value, the interfacial isoelectric point.

40|$|International audiencea We {{show that}} ternary {{mixtures}} of water (polar phase), myristic acid (MA, apolar phase) and cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB, cationic surfactant) studied above the melting point of myristic acid allow {{the preparation of}} microemulsions without adding a salt or a co-surfactant. The combination of SANS, SAXS/ WAXS, DSC, and phase diagram determination allows a complete characterization of the structures and interactions between components in the molten fatty acid based microemulsions. For the different structures characterized (microemulsion, lamellar or hexagonal phases), a similar thermal behaviour is observed for all ternary MA/CTAB/water monophasic samples and for binary MA/CTAB mixtures without water: crystalline myristic acid melts at 52 1 C, and a thermal transition at 70 1 C is assigned to the breaking of hydrogen bounds inside the mixed myristic acid/CTAB complex (being the surfactant film in the ternary system). Water determines the film curvature, hence the structures observed at high temperature, but does not influence the thermal behaviour of the ternary system. Myristic acid is partitioned in two ''species'' that behave independently: pure myristic acid and myristic acid associated with CTAB to form an equimolar complex that {{plays the role of}} the surfactant film.

40|$|Aqueous {{extraction}} process {{is an alternative}} to the <b>solvent</b> <b>oil</b> {{extraction process}} from oilseeds. It enables simultaneous recovery of oil and protein. Water extraction of sunflower oil is carried out with a mixer (model Waring Blendor, USA) as batch reactor (seeds/water: 15 / 85). This only apparatus carries out two essential unit operations: conditioning and grinding of sunflower seeds and liquid/solid extraction. However, lixiviation of kernels is incomplete. After five minutes of extraction, the mixture reorganizes by centrifugation in three formulated fractions: the insoluble phase (31. 1 % of the mixture), the hydrophilic phase (61. 4 % of the mixture) and the hydrophobic phase (7. 5 % of the mixture). Oil extraction yield obtained is 46. 6 %. Residual oil content of raffinate is 39. 2 % instead of 49. 7 % in sunflower seeds. Aqueous extraction process also results in an impoverishment of oil cake into water-soluble substances contained initially in kernels: proteins and minerals. Raffinate is on the contrary richer in insoluble proteins and fibers (26. 1 % for cellulose and lignins instead of 17. 1 % in sunflower seeds). An additional stage of extraction would allow a better oil impoverishment of the insoluble phase before its possible use for animal feeding. It would be also possible to upgrade it by thermopressing. Panels obtained have mechanical characteristics comparable with those of other experimental materials. Hydrophilic phase is the dominating fraction. It contains proteins (31. 8 % of dry residue), minerals (8. 2 % of dry residue) and hemicelluloses. Its oil content means that centrifugation does not allow an expedient separation between hydrophilic phase and hydrophobic phase. After concentration of organic substances by ultrafiltration, it is possible to collect proteins by isoelectric precipitation. These water-soluble proteins can be used for their surface-active properties. Hydrophobic phase is an oil-in-water emulsion. It is lighter than hydrophilic phase (0. 94 for its density). Lipids represent 83. 8 % of its dry residue. Its stability is ensured by the presence at interface of natural surface-active agents also extracted during the process, phospholipids and proteins. Demulsification is possible by alcoholic extraction. It enables the edible oil isolation. Oil consumption is possible for human feeding but also for non food uses like biolubricants market. Hydrophobic phase can also be used without any modification for the manufacture of paintings and cosmetics or for the treatment of surfaces with hydrophilic matter...|$|E

Samples were MW-treated at a frequency of 2450 MHz using a microwave oven. Six MW pretreatments were established, combining two potencies (400 W and 600 W) and three times of pretreatment (120, 180 and 240 s). Extraction oil yield increased with MW pretreatments of hazelnut seed with respect to untreated seeds, as a control. Conditions of 400 Wand 240 s were selected (45. 3 % of extraction oil yield). Observations under light microscopy showed that the microstructure of treated samples to 400 W and 240 s, was modified comparing with that of untreated samples, thereby improving the extraction efficiency. The quality characteristics (e. g. acid value, peroxide value), oil composition (e. g. fatty acids, α-tocotrienol content) and oil oxidative stability (e. g. induction time) were measured. These results were compared to those of an untreated oil sample. MWpretreatment had {{a positive effect on}} oxidative oil stability (induction time of 23. 9 h) with respect to untreated oil (8. 8 h). Industrial relevance: Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana Mol) is the southernmost Macadamieae species of the family Proteaceae that grows mainly {{in the southern part of}} Chile and Argentina. The oil is composed mainly of unsaturated fatty acids, which represent 93 % of the total. Its main components are oleic and palmitoleic acids, which represent 70 % fatty acids. Conventional vegetable oil extraction is carried out by pressing or solvent extraction. <b>Solvent</b> <b>oil</b> extraction is the most efficient method; however, its application presents some industrial disadvantages such as plant security problems, emissions of volatile organic compounds into atmosphere, high operation costs and poor quality products caused by high processing temperatures. Mechanical pressing oil extraction is technically less extensive and less labor-intensive than the extraction solvent method. The safety and simplicity of the whole process is advantageous over the more efficient solvent extraction equipment. Furthermore, materials pressed out generally have better preserved native properties, end products are free of chemicals and it is a safer process. However, extraction by just pressing the seeds is relatively inefficient. It is advisable to research new methodologies for pretreating substrates that also allow for better retention and availability of desirable plant metabolites. Within these pretreatments, the radiation microwave is included. There is not much information in the literature about the application of microwave radiation as a pretreatment for Chilean hazelnut and its effect on the microstructure of the substrate, extraction yield and quality of oil.
