25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E

25|$|The January 22, 1973 {{broadcast}} of the CBS Evening News saw Cronkite break {{the news of the}} death of another notable American political figure: former president Lyndon B. Johnson. At approximately 6:38pm Eastern Time, while a pre-recorded report that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris had been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while off camera. The call was from Tom Johnson, former spokesman to Lyndon Johnson (no relation), who at the time was also in charge of KTBC, CBS' Austin, Texas affiliate, which the former president owned. During the conversation the production staff cut away from the report back to the live camera in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone. After he was made aware that he was back on camera, Cronkite held up a finger to let everyone watching know he required a moment to let Johnson finish talking. Once Cronkite got what he needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
