MULTI-PAVE was developed as a teaching tool that performs pavement thickness design for multiple design procedures using a common input file and a common output format. The AASHTO components were developed {{in accordance with the}} 1993 AASHTO Pavement Design Guide, and verified against the original design method. The thicknesses of the Asphalt Concrete, Base Course and <b>Sub-base</b> <b>Course</b> are the design outputs for flexible pavement.

This paper reports and discusses some of the results from a study on the evaluation of the resilient modulus for eight Victorian fine-grained soils at different moisture contents and stress levels.

40|$|Abstract. Iron ore {{tailings}} {{as a kind}} {{of waste}} products after ore dressing {{is one of the major}} industrial solid wastes. Iron ore tailings not only cover huge land and pollute environment, but also give rise to security risks. The comprehensive utilization of iron ore tailings need to be studied systematically. According to the method in Test Methods of Materials Stabilized with Inorganic Binders for Highway Engineering, the technical performances of cement stabilized iron ore tailing gravel in highway application were studied by systemic experiments in this paper. These include the strength, modulus, and frost resistance property, water stability. And the influencing factors of the mixture strength were analyzed, too. The results show that the mixture of cement stabilized iron ore tailing gravel has higher strength and modulus, good frost resistance property and water stability. The technical performances of cement stabilized iron tailing gravel conform to the current specification, so it can be used as <b>sub-base</b> <b>course</b> or base course material...|$|E

Soil classification tests conducted on the shale samples which serve both as subgrade and aggregates showed that the shale classifies as A- 7 - 6 and CH soils, according to the AASHTO and USCS classification systems respectively. A comparison {{of some of the}} tests results with the Nigerian Specifications and literature reveals that the Abakaliki Shale neither satisfies most requirements as fill and embankment, nor the requirements as <b>sub-base</b> <b>course</b> and base course material. The unsatisfactory behaviour of the shale as road material (as predictable of an A- 7 - 6 or CH soil) is mainly due to its high plasticity, which simply indicates susceptibility to expansion on moisture influx, and high percentage of particles passing No. 200 British Standard sieve, which is significantly above the recommended limit. The shale, however, satisfies few specifications such as maximum dry density, optimum moisture content and soaked California Bearing Ratio, implying that it’s appropriateness for use as road material could be improved by stabilization and prevention from excessive moisture influx.

40|$|Two {{different}} {{porous asphalt}} pavement systems (PAPS) {{were designed to}} enhance the removal of VOCs (dichloromethane and toluene) and heavy metals (cadmium, copper and lead) from roadway runoff. These two PAPS utilized granular activated carbon (GAC) additions to the conventional PAPS. One PAPS, the CPP system (carbon in porous pavement), had GAC added directly to the top porous asphalt mix, and the other PAPS, the CCA system (carbon in coarse aggregates), had GAC added to the <b>sub-base</b> filter <b>course</b> below the porous asphalt layer. The removal of selected VOCs and heavy metals through the CPP and the CCA systems was measured and compared to a conventional PAPS. ^ The {{results show that the}} addition of GAC into the top porous asphalt layer and the <b>sub-base</b> filter <b>course</b> layer enhanced the overall porous asphalt pavement contaminants removal capability. The addition of GAC to the <b>sub-base</b> filter <b>course</b> layer resulted in higher removal efficiencies for all of the constituents tested in this study. The CPP system is capable of removing on average 83 % of dichloromethane, 95 % of toluene, 71 % of cadmium, 66 % of copper, and 73 % of lead. The CCA system resulted in the average removal of 99 % of dichloromethane, 100 % of toluene, 95 % of cadmium, 76 % of copper, and 75 % of lead from a synthetic roadway runoff. ^ The CCA system was able to control the effluent concentrations of all of the contaminants (dichloromethane, toluene, cadmium, copper and lead) to meet the US EPA MCLs. Even though the same amount of GAC was added into the two systems some of the GAC in the CPP system could have been coated by the asphalt binder during the construction process which would reduce the effective GAC surface area available for adsorption and thus reduce the effectiveness of contaminant removal. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{flexible}} pavement {{is a very}} important infrastructure asset which normally consists of asphalt or a sprayed seal surface layer and the underlying base and <b>sub-base</b> <b>courses.</b> The subgrade soil is the existing soils and is the foundation of the pavement. It can be said that the performance of the pavement significantly depends on the bearing capacity of the subgrade. Therefore, an understanding of the behaviour of the subgrade soils would increase the confidence of pavement engineers in the design. Under the moving traffic load the behaviour of the subgrade soils contains two parts: resilient and permanent deformation. In order to investigate this behaviour in the laboratory repeated load triaxial equipment is used. Due to the complicated, time-consuming and expensive procedure, it is a challenge to perform the repeated load triaxial test as a routine basic test. Previous studies have reported the significant influence of the subgrade soil properties and loading conditions on the resilient and permanent deformation. In the current paper, the resilient and permanent deformation behaviour of several fine-grained soils collected from various locations in Victoria, Australia were studied. The effect of subgrade soil physical properties and stress conditions on the resilient modulus and permanent deformation for the experimental soils are examined and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Four {{bottom ash}} {{samples from the}} Power Units of the Agios Dimitrios Power Plant were studied by the method of PXRD to {{determine}} their semi-quantitative mineralogical composition. Their or-ganic matter content was calculated by a wet chemical process. Also, the loss on ignition was measured. The samples are constituted mainly of calcite, quartz and feldspars, while micas, clays, gehlenite and portlandite were determined in a few samples in smaller quantities. The amorphous material varied between 10 - 43 wt. %, while organic matter varied between 5 - 42 wt. %. Measure-ments of the loss on ignition overestimate the unburned lignite contents in the bottom ash samples. The management of bottom ashes with high contents of unburned lignite should differ {{to that of the}} fly ashes. The oxidation of the inorganic compounds of the unburned lignite may lead to environ-mental degradation of the landfill areas. Samples showing lower values of organic matter are suitable for a series of uses, such as: snow and ice control, as an aggregate in lightweight concrete masonry units,as a raw feed material for portland cement, as an aggregate in cold mix emulsified asphalt mixes, base or <b>sub-base</b> <b>courses,</b> or in shoulder construction. Systematic study of the un-burned lignite of bottom ashes is needed for possible re-combustion. ...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{pavement}} is {{a complex}} structure built with {{the main purpose of}} carrying the traffic loading. A typical flexible pavement structure consists of several layers &ndash; surface course, base course, <b>sub-base</b> <b>course</b> and subgrade soil. The behaviour of the flexible pavement is complicated and is commonly characterised by the resilient modulus (Mr) of subgrade soils and granular materials in the pavement structure. Technically speaking, Mr is defined as the ratio of the deviator stress and the consequent recoverable strain, and can be determined from the repeated load triaxial test in the laboratory. Inherently, it is a challenge to perform repeated load triaxial tests as a routine basic test due to the complicated, time-consuming and expensive procedure; hence, several empirical approaches to estimate Mr from other soil mechanical properties &ndash; California Bearing Ratio, unconfined compressive strength or physical properties &ndash; moisture content, plasticity index or dry density have been proposed and recommended by several pavement design guides. With the same philosophy, the current research evaluated the resilient response of some different fine-grained subgrade soils, granular, base and sub-base materials and developed several simple, less time-consuming, and inexpensive methods and models to evaluate and determine Mr for the design of flexible pavements. Based on the experimental results and the findings from numerical investigation, several important developments were achieved, as follows: 1. Development of dynamic lightweight cone penetrometer for the evaluation of Mr of soils in the field {{as well as in the}} laboratory. 2. Development of a prediction model for Mr based on the dynamic lightweight cone penetration index and stress levels for fine-grained soils. 3. Development of the simplified testing method for the repeated load triaxial test to determine Mr for fine-grained soils. 4. Development of a simplified testing method for the repeated load triaxial test to determine Mr for granular materials. 5. Development of a three-dimensional numerical model for the study and prediction of the resilient behaviour of granular materials using discrete element method. 6. Development of a prediction model for the resilient behaviour of fine-grained soils based on the California Bearing Ratio values and stress levels from laboratory tests results. From the results and prediction models developed in this study, fifteen papers have been prepared and published or submitted in international journals. In addition, some of the results have been presented in five international conferences...|$|E
40|$|A {{pavement}} construction {{designed to}} cope with the different type of traffic loads; it is exposed to {{and at the same time}} it can resist the effect of the climate. A road structure consists of sub- and superstructure which is divided by a boundary known as terrace. During the construction of unbound layers (base course and <b>sub-base</b> <b>course)</b> in the superstructure, it is always ensured that the material meet the requirements for bearing capacity and the degree of compaction. These parameters are controlled by various laboratory tests and control methods. To obtain increased knowledge of the material and improve the quality of the compaction in the field, it is necessary to perform laboratory tests in order to determine material properties. A base course material 0 / 32 mm limestone from Gotland (Hejdeby) was investigated in this study. To determine properties of the material various laboratory tests such as proctor compaction test, Micro-Deval, Los Angeles, and grain distribution curve are conducted. To investigate how grain size distribution affects technical properties of the material, the 0 / 32 mm material was modified with two different samples; grain size distribution of 2 / 32 mm excluding superior material content, and 0 +/ 32 mm with enhanced superior material content. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in material behavior during proctor compaction. Two aspects of changes in material behavior were emphasized in this study; the optimal water content and maximum dry density, as well as changes of both. As a reference for the limestone features, a traditional 0 / 32 mm tonalite material (granite) from Vällstaverket was used relating to proctor investigation. Material's resistance to abrasion and fragmentation was investigated by two methods: Micro-Deval and Los Angeles. The results were compared with other rock materials. Furthermore the bearing capacity of the material was verified by examination of the Young's modulus and degree of compaction, as well as properties of water content and dry density, at three trial areas on Gotland. This is performed with various methods such as static plate loading test, light weight deflectometer, density gauge/SDG 200, and water/sand volume meter measurement test. By comparing results from different methods of measurement, it may indicate a relationship between these. Test area 3 consists of two smaller test areas which have different water content. The bearing capacity (Young's modulus) and the degree of compaction were measured after each roller passage. Different relationships were obtained between the amount of roller overpass, with Young's modulus of material; as well as degree of compaction. It was found in this study that limestone from Gotland (Hejdeby) maintain its position as construction material for the unbound layers of the road. The result from static plate load which indicated high E V 2 values (Young's modulus) was obtained from the field, and it suggests that a fine bearing capacity can be achieved in the use of limestone...|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} the grain size {{distribution}} of the studied SQD are presented in Table  2. From the ten samples analyzed, the average of gravel fraction (>  4.75  mm) is 30 %, sand fraction (0.075 – 4.75  mm) is 56 % and the fines fraction (<  0.075  mm) is 14 % while the linear shrinkage (LS) is 12.4 %. The {{results indicate that the}} shale samples are characterized by high proportions of gravel sand-sized particles. According to Bandara et al. [6], most economically stabilized soil can be produced by using untreated material which contains 5 – 35 % of particles finer than 0.075  mm in size as noted in the studied shale. The specific gravity (SG) as presented in Table  2 has an average value of is 2.62. The SG might be a reflection of the heavy oxides (Fe + Mg content) with an average value of 5.58 % present in the rock. Aghamelu and Okogbue [3] reported that the SGs are reflections of the densities of the materials in each sample, in exclusive of the permeable voids they may contain which thus imply that high SG results in high density. This is likely the case with the studied shale rock. American Society for Testing and Materials [4] indicates that soil with liquid limit (LL) >  10, plasticity index (PI) >  10 and greater than 35 % finer than 75  µm may be rated as very poor material when considered for potential use as <b>sub-base,</b> base <b>course</b> and sub-grade materials. The SQD has an average LL as 38 %, PI as 24 % and fines fraction of 14 % which according ASTM [4] recommendation, can be regarded as poor material hence that need for improvement of its geotechnical properties to serve well as <b>sub-base,</b> base <b>course</b> and sub-grade materials.|$|R
40|$|Clay content {{significantly}} {{influences the}} mechanical behavior of soils, thereby playing {{an important role}} in many fields of applications such as civil engineering, geology and agriculture. In the area of pavement engineering, clay content in structural bearing courses of pavement frequently causes damages and defects, such as transversal and longitudinal cracks, or other faults. The main consequence is a lowering of both the road safety and operability, with the number of expected accidents increasing. In this study, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) laboratory tests were carried out to predict the clay amount in pavement structural layers under different clay and moisture conditions. GPR data processing is performed using two different methods. The first method is based on the Fresnel theory and focuses on the Rayleigh scattering of the radar waves. The approach is based on a different scattering of the various components of the frequency spectrum, mostly depending on both the soil texture and variation in soil moisture content. For the application of this method, we used a pulse radar with ground-coupled, 500 MHz centre-frequency antennas in a common offset, bistatic configuration. The transmitter and receiver were linked by optic fiber electronic modules. The second method is based on full-waveform inversion of the ultra wideband radar data. In particular, a specific radar-antenna electromagnetic model is used to filter out antenna effects and antenna-medium interactions from the raw radar data and retrieve the response of the soil only, expressed in terms of a layered medium Green’s function. To estimate the medium geometrical and electrical values, an optimization inverse problem is formulated. For the application of that second method, we used a vector network analyzer (VNA) as continuous-wave stepped frequency radar system to acquire data in the 500 - 3000 MHz frequency range. A doubled-ridged broadband horn antenna operating in far-field conditions was used as transmitter and receiver, and was connected to the radar using a high-quality coaxial cable. Typical road materials for subgrade and <b>sub-base</b> <b>courses</b> were used. In particular, three types of soils classified, respectively, as A 1,A 2,A 3 by AASHTO were used and adequately compacted in electrically and hydraulically isolated boxes.

Utilization of saw dust as ash in geotechnical applications is likely provides a better solution. Keeping this in view, an extensive experimental study was carried out to demonstrate the soil improvement prospective of saw dust ash (SDA) by performing California bearing ratio (CBR) and unconfined compression strength tests. The experimental study has revealed that the addition of SDA results {{a significant increase in}} CBR and unconfined compressive strength. Furthermore the values of CBR obtained are within the limits recommended by the Asphalt Institute for Highway sub-base and sub-grade. Thus from the present study it is concluded that SDA, an industrial waste, is a cheap satisfactory stabilizing agent for <b>sub-base</b> and base <b>course</b> in clayey fills; although its performance can be improved by combining it with other bonding materials such as lime, and becomes an alternatives use of industrial waste to reduce the construction cost of road particularly in the rural areas of the country.|$|R

The samples were collected from five different areas, at surface and sub-surface levels. The areas are New Demsa, Farei, Dowaya, Numan Town and Imbru. The soil samples were subjected to laboratory investigations in conformity with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation (AASHTO) and the Bristish Standard Institution (BSI) Standard specifications. Results of the geotechnical tests indicate that the proportion passing the BS sieve NO. 200 ranges from 20. 92 % to 39. 02 % whereas plasticity index and consistency index ranges from 14. 05 to 22. 01 and 1. 42 % to 2. 16 % respectively.

The laboratory tests have been selected with respect to construction needs and possible post construction conditions. Utilization of the various types of ash in the stabilization problematic soils from Jordan as brown soils and the clayey marl has revealed optimum results.

Using recycled materials in pavements is a sustainable practice that is gaining adoption, particularly for flexible (bituminous) pavements. One approach is to incorporate large quantities of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) into base and sub-base applications for pavement construction. Numerous studies have reported that RAP can be reused as an aggregate in Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) {{as well as in}} cold mix asphalt, granular base, <b>sub-base,</b> and subgrade <b>courses.</b> Cold recycling technology, like hot mix technology, has also become popular in various countries for rehabilitation of damaged bituminous pavements. RAP stabilized with bitumen emulsion and foamed bitumen {{has been used as a}} base layer. The present study focuses on Foamed Bitumen treated Mixes (FBMs). Most of the agencies which use FBMs have their own mix design procedures which are the result of numerous efforts over decades. In spite of all these efforts, Foamed Bitumen application in cold recycling in the United Kingdom suffers from the lack of a standardised mix design procedure. To overcome this, the present research objective was to develop a mix design procedure by identifying critical mix design parameters. The mix design parameters that were optimised were Foamed Bitumen content, mixing water content (MWC), and compaction effort. Special attention was given to the simplest yet crucial mix design consideration of FBMs; curing. The thesis also attempted to simulate what should be expected in terms of the performance of flexible pavements containing FBMs as road base. The mix design parametric study was initially carried out on FBMs with virgin limestone aggregate (VA) without RAP material and a mix design procedure was proposed.
