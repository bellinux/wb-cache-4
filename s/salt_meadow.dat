50|$|St. Peter-Ording is {{situated}} on the North Sea coast, on the western tip of the Eiderstedt peninsula, approx. 45 km southwest of Husum. Part of the municipality lies in the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park. Its characteristics include a beach that is approximately 12 kilometers long and up to one kilometre wide, the dunes, the <b>salt</b> <b>meadows</b> and the cultivated forested areas, atypical for this region. The <b>salt</b> <b>meadows</b> are of special ecological importance, since they belong to the few <b>salt</b> <b>meadows</b> that remain in their natural state. In contrast to other <b>salt</b> <b>meadows</b> along the North Sea they contain numerous ponds and puddles. The landward side is flooded with sea water only occasionally and not every year, so that amphibians such as grass frogs, moor frogs and toads (Bufo bufo) live uncharacteristically close to the seashore. Even the Natterjack Toad (Bufo calamita) is able to reproduce successfully in this environment.|$|R
60|$|On the northerly {{shore of}} San Francisco Bay {{a line of}} bluffs terminates in a promontory, at whose base, formed by the {{crumbling}} debris of the cliff above, there is a narrow stretch of beach, <b>salt</b> <b>meadow,</b> and scrub oak. The abrupt wall of rock behind it seems to isolate it as completely from the mainland as the sea before it separates it from the opposite shore. In spite of its contiguity to San Francisco,--opposite also, but hidden by the sharp re-entering curve of coast,--the locality was wild, uncultivated, and unfrequented. A solitary fisherman's cabin half hidden in the rocks was the only trace of habitation. White drifts of sea-gulls and pelican {{across the face of}} the cliff, gray clouds of sandpipers rising from the beach, the dripping flight of ducks over the salt meadows, and the occasional splash of a seal from the rocks, were the only signs of life that could be seen from the decks of passing ships. And yet the fisherman's cabin was occupied by Zephas Bunker and his young wife, and he had succeeded in wresting from the hard soil pasturage for a cow and goats, while his lateen-sailed fishing-boat occasionally rode quietly in the sheltered cove below.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>Meadow</b> Unit: Oldest {{unit of the}} refuge, the <b>Salt</b> <b>Meadow</b> unit is the {{location}} of the refuge headquarters in Westbrook, Connecticut. <b>Salt</b> <b>Meadow</b> is used by over 280 species of migrating neotropical birds during the spring and fall migrations.

The 2.5 mi of trails at <b>Salt</b> <b>Meadow</b> wind through grassland, forest, and marsh habitats.

Birdwatchers can expect to see great egrets, glossy ibis, snowy egrets, belted kingfishers, osprey, red tailed hawk, and many other species. Mammal species include red fox, white-tailed deer, skunk, and coyote.
