5|$|No {{effort to}} depict vampires in popular fiction was as {{influential}} or as definitive as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Its portrayal of vampirism {{as a disease}} of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.|$|E
5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.|$|E
5|$|By 1876, Macdonald and the Conservatives {{had adopted}} {{protection}} as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches {{at a number}} of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald's proposals <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with the public, and the Conservatives began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14seats as a result of by-elections, reducing Mackenzie's Liberal majority from 70 to 42. Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters' verdict of 1874—he considered Charles Tupper his heir apparent.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E

Nonetheless, only few National Day songs which <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> among Singaporeans {{continue to be}} sung annually in the parade. They are collectively known as the Sing Singapore Medley which comes after the fireworks display during the Grand Finale segment, or since 2008, forming the final part of the display.|$|E

25|$|Many {{of these}} films showed the disillusionment with the oppressive rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party. The Spring River Flows East, a three-hour-long two-parter {{directed}} by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, was a particularly strong success. Its depiction of the struggles of ordinary Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese war, replete with biting social and political commentary, <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with audiences of the time.|$|E

25|$|The modernist 'revolution of the word' was {{not universally}} welcomed, either by readers or writers. Certainly by the 1930s, a new {{generation}} of poets had emerged who looked to more formally conservative poets like Thomas Hardy and W.B. Yeats as models and these writers <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with a readership who were uncomfortable with the experimentation and uncertainty preferred by the modernists. Notwithstanding, modernist poetry cannot be positively characterised, there being no mainstream or dominant mode.|$|E

50|$|Mao Zedong {{called for}} a {{national}} united front with the Kuomintang to resist the Japanese. This appeal <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> responsive <b>chord</b> among Chinese.

25|$|In 1898, {{the social}} {{reformer}} Ebenezer Howard {{wrote a book}} entitled To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform (later republished as Garden Cities of To-morrow), in which he advocated {{the construction of a}} new kind of town, summed up in his Three Magnets diagram as combining the advantages of cities and the countryside while eliminating their disadvantages. Industry would be kept separate from residential areas—such zoning was a new idea at the time—and trees and open spaces would prevail everywhere. His ideas were mocked in the press but <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with many, especially members of the Arts and Crafts movement and the Quakers.|$|E
25|$|Hydro-Québec {{has been}} criticized for not having taken {{advantage}} of some of its innovations. An electric wheel motor concept that <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with Quebecers, first prototyped in 1994 by Pierre Couture, an engineer and physicist working at IREQ, is one of these. The heir to the Couture wheel motor is now marketed by TM4 Electrodynamic Systems, a spin-off established in 1998 that has made deals with France's Dassault and Heuliez to develop an electric car, the Cleanova, of which prototypes were built in 2006. Hydro-Québec announced in early 2009 at the Montreal International Auto Show that its engine had been chosen by Tata Motors to equip a demonstration version of its Indica model, which will be road tested in Norway.|$|E
25|$|A chance {{meeting with}} Australian film producer, Colin Bromley while in New Delhi, {{resulted}} in Bobby Cash {{being invited to}} the Tamworth Country Music Festival in New South Wales, Australia. Having heard him sing, and being impressed by his musicianship, Bromley, producer/director of Sydney-based television production house, Gobsmacked and Gerry O'Leary, Gobsmacked's head of production, {{decided to make a}} film on Bobby Cash performing in the Festival and see what happened there. Thus, in January 2003, Bobby Cash went to perform in the Tamworth Country Music Festival.An unknown, Bobby Cash <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with the country music lovers there and grabbed the attention of the media. A local wealthy farmer, Roy Eykamp, came forward and offered to finance Bobby Cash's debut country music albumWhat happened at the Festival, and Bobby Cash rising from being an unknown to celebrity status became the subject of Bromley's documentary film, The Indian Cowboy...One in a Billion.|$|E

25|$|Signing Off is {{the debut}} album by British reggae band UB40, {{released}} in the UK on 29 August 1980 by Dudley-based independent label Graduate Records. It was an immediate success in their home country, reaching number 2 on the UK albums chart, and made UB40 {{one of the many}} popular reggae band in Britain, several years before the band found international fame. The politically-concerned lyrics <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> in a country with widespread public concerns about high unemployment, the policies of the recently elected Conservative party under Margaret Thatcher, {{and the rise of the}} racist National Front party, while the record's dub-influenced rhythms reflected the late 1970s influence in British pop music of West Indian music introduced by immigrants from the Caribbean after the Second World War, particularly reggae and ska – this was typified by the 2 Tone movement, at that point at the height of its success and led by fellow West Midlands act The Specials, with whom UB40 drew comparisons due to their multiracial band line-up and socialist views.|$|E
25|$|A seminal {{moment in}} Iorga's {{political}} career {{took place during}} the 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt, erupting under a Conservative cabinet and repressed with much violence by a National Liberal one. The bloody outcome prompted the historian to author and make public a piece of social critique, the Neamul Românesc pamphlet Dumnezeu să-i ierte ("God Forgive Them"). The text, together with his program of agrarian conferences and his subscription lists for the benefit of victims' relatives again made him an adversary of the National Liberals, who referred to Iorga as an instigator. The historian did however <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with Stere, who had been made prefect of Iași County, and who, going against his party's wishes, inaugurated an informal collaboration between Iorga and the Poporanists. The political class as a whole was particularly apprehensive of Iorga's contacts with the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians and their common irredentist agenda, which risked undermining relations with the Austrians over Transylvania and Bukovina. However, Iorga's popularity was still increasing, and, carried by this sentiment, he was first elected to Chamber during the elections of that same year.|$|E
25|$|As much as {{involving}} {{itself in}} designs for industry, the Constructivists worked on public festivals and street {{designs for the}} post-October revolution Bolshevik government. Perhaps {{the most famous of}} these was in Vitebsk, where Malevich's UNOVIS Group painted propaganda plaques and buildings (the best known being El Lissitzky's poster Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge (1919)). Inspired by Vladimir Mayakovsky's declaration 'the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes', artists and designers participated in public life during the Civil War. A striking instance was the proposed festival for the Comintern congress in 1921 by Alexander Vesnin and Liubov Popova, which resembled the constructions of the OBMOKhU exhibition as well as their work for the theatre. There {{was a great deal of}} overlap during this period between Constructivism and Proletkult, the ideas of which concerning the need to create an entirely new culture <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with the Constructivists. In addition some Constructivists were heavily involved in the 'ROSTA Windows', a Bolshevik public information campaign of around 1920. Some of the most famous of these were by the poet-painter Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vladimir Lebedev.|$|E

The {{saga of the}} Plantagenets was much better known, but not many people were familiar with medieval Wales or its princes.

25|$|The British artist potter Bernard Leach {{brought to}} England many ideas he had {{developed}} in Japan with the social critic Yanagi Soetsu about the moral and social value of simple crafts; both were enthusiastic readers of Ruskin. Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in his book The Art of the Potter, published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after {{the demise of the}} Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British Utility furniture of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles. One of its main promoters, Gordon Russell, chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas. He manufactured furniture in the Cotswold Hills, a region of Arts and Crafts furniture-making since Ashbee, and {{he was a member of}} the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. William Morris's biographer, Fiona MacCarthy, detected the Arts and Crafts philosophy even behind the Festival of Britain (1951), the work of the designer Terence Conran (b. 1931) and the founding of the British Crafts Council in the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, Simon & Garfunkel's music {{gradually}} moved from a very basic folk rock sound to incorporate more experimental elements for the time, including Latin and gospel music. [...] Many adolescents of the 1960s found their music relevant, while adults regarded them as intelligent. Their music, according to Rolling Stone, <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> among lonely, alienated young adults {{near the end of the}} decade.|$|E
500|$|From {{the opening}} novel in the series, {{the theme of}} treachery was strong. Bond's target in Casino Royale, Le Chiffre, was the {{paymaster}} of a French communist trade union, and the overtones of a fifth column <b>struck</b> <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> with the largely British readership, as Communist influence in the trade unions had been {{an issue in the}} press and parliament, especially after the defections of Burgess and Maclean in 1951. The [...] "traitor within" [...] theme continued in Live and Let Die and Moonraker.|$|E
