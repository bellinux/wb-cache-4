50|$|A metal {{rectifier}} {{is an early}} type of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifier</b> in which the semiconductor is copper oxide or selenium. They were used in power applications to convert alternating current to direct current in devices such as radios and battery chargers.

25|$|Since {{utilities}} supply high-voltage AC, DC railways use converter {{stations to}} produce relatively low-voltage DC (usually 3000 volts or less). Originally they used rotary converters, {{a few of}} which are even still in operation, but most were supplanted first by mercury arc rectifiers and then by <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A typical use for an AC/DC {{converter}} was for railway electrification, where {{utility power}} was supplied as alternating current but the trains {{were designed to}} work on direct current.

5000|$|Practical {{electronic}} converters use switching techniques. Switched-mode DC-to-DC converters convert one DC {{voltage level}} to another, {{which may be}} higher or lower, by storing the input energy temporarily and then releasing that energy to the output at a different voltage. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components (inductors, transformers) or electric field storage components (capacitors). This conversion method can increase or decrease voltage. Switching conversion is more power efficient (often 75% to 98%) than linear voltage regulation, which dissipates unwanted power as heat. Fast semiconductor device rise and fall times are required for efficiency; however, these fast transitions combine with layout parasitic effects to make circuit design challenging. The higher efficiency of a switched-mode converter reduces the heatsinking needed, and increases battery endurance of portable equipment. Efficiency has improved since the late 1980s due {{to the use of}} power FETs, which are able to switch more efficiently with lower switching losses at higher frequencies than power bipolar transistors, and use less complex drive circuitry.Another important improvement in DC-DC converters is replacing the flywheel diode by synchronous rectification using a power FET, whose [...] "on resistance" [...] is much lower, reducing switching losses. Before the wide availability of power semiconductors, low-power DC-to-DC synchronous converters consisted of an electro-mechanical vibrator followed by a voltage step-up transformer feeding a vacuum tube or <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifier,</b> or synchronous rectifier contacts on the vibrator.|$|E

A contact to tantalum wire is used as anode terminal and to the manganese layer as a cathode terminal of the device. This process results in formation of an asymmetric Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 [...] MnO 2 capacitor that has different characteristics at forward (positive bias applied to tantalum) and reverse (positive bias applied to manganese cathode) voltages. Reverse bias currents might be several orders of magnitude larger than forward leakage currents so I-V characteristics of tantalum capacitors resemble characteristics of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> Asymmetric I-V characteristics of Ta [...] anodic Ta 2 O 5 systems have been observed at different top electrode materials including metals, electrolytes, conductive polymers, and manganese oxide thus indicating that this phenomenon is likely related to {{the specifics of the}} Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 interface. There have been multiple attempts to explain rectifying characteristics of capacitors employing anodic tantalum pentoxide dielectrics. A brief review of works related to reverse bias (RB) behavior of tantalum capacitors shows that the mechanism of conduction in Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 systems is still not clear and more testing and analysis is necessary to understand the processes involved. If tantalum capacitors behave just as rectifiers, then the assessment of the safe reverse bias operating conditions would be a relatively simple task. Unfortunately, these parts can degrade with time under reverse bias significantly, and this further complicates analysis of the I-V characteristics and establishing safe operating areas of the parts. On other hand, time dependence of reverse currents might provide additional information for investigation of the processes under reverse bias conditions. In practice, there were instances when, due to unforeseen events, the system operated at conditions when capacitors experience periodically a relatively small reverse bias for some time followed by normal, forward bias conditions. In such a case an assessment should be made on the degree to which these capacitors are degraded by application of low-voltage reverse bias, and whether this degradation can be reversed by normal operating conditions. In this study, reverse currents in different types of tantalum capacitors were monitored at different reverse voltages below 15 %VR and temperatures in the range from room to 145 C for up to 150 hours to get better understanding of the degradation process and determine conditions favorable to the unstable mode of operation. The reversibility of RB degradation has been evaluated after operation of the capacitors at forward bias conditions. The effect of reverse bias stress (RBS) on reliability at normal operating conditions was evaluated using highly accelerated life testing at voltages of 1. 5 VR and 2 VR and by analysis of changes in distributions of breakdown voltages.

5000|$|Vacuum diode {{rectifiers}} {{were widely}} used in power supplies in vacuum tube consumer electronic products, such as phonographs, radios, and televisions, for example the All American Five radio receiver, to provide the high DC plate voltage needed by other vacuum tubes. [...] "Full-wave" [...] versions with two separate plates were popular because they could be used with a center-tapped transformer to make a full-wave rectifier. Vacuum rectifiers were made for very high voltages, such as the {{high voltage power supply}} for the cathode ray tube of television receivers, and the kenotron used for power supply in X-ray equipment. However, compared to modern <b>semiconductor</b> diodes, vacuum <b>rectifiers</b> have high internal resistance due to space charge and therefore high voltage drops, causing high power dissipation and low efficiency. They are rarely able to handle currents exceeding 250 mA owing to the limits of plate power dissipation, and cannot be used for low voltage applications, such as battery chargers. Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles exhibit many unique {{properties}} {{as compared}} to the bulk materials owning to their high surface to volume ratio. Elemental selenium nanoparticles also exhibit novel properties that are exploited in formation of solar cells, <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and removal of mercury and copper. However, the chemical synthesis of elemental selenium nanoparticles is costly, requires specialized equipments and uses toxic chemicals. On the other hand, biological production of elemental selenium nanoparticles (BioSeNPs) can be a green replacement for the chemically produced ones. BioSeNPs are produced by microbial reduction of selenite and selenate. The source of the selenium oxyanions can be the wastewaters, where microbial reduction is employed as a remediation technology for the removal of selenium. The formed BioSeNPs are colloidal poly-disperse particles with negative surface charge and are present in the effluent of the microbial reactor. However, the properties of these BioSeNPs are not very well understood. This knowledge would help us to produce better quality selenium nanomaterials, exploit produced BioSeNPs in the wastewater treatment and control the fate of these BioSeNPs in the microbial reactors. The characterization of BioSeNPs revealed the presence of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the surface of BioSeNPs. The EPS was identified to control the surface charge and to some extent the shape of the BioSeNPs. It was also found that the microbial reduction at 55 and 65 °C can lead to the formation of selenium nanowires {{as compared to}} nanospheres when the reduction takes place at 30 °C. These selenium nanowires are present in trigonal crystalline structure and are colloidal suspension, unlike the chemically formed trigonal selenium nanorods. This colloidal nature is due to negative ζ-potential values owning to the presence of EPS on the surface of biogenic selenium nanowires. Since proteins are a major component present in the EPS, the presence of various proteins on the surface of BioSeNPs was determined. The interaction of the various amino acids with the BioSeNPs was also evaluated. The interaction of heavy metals and BioSeNPs was studied with a view of developing a technology where BioSeNPs present in the effluent of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor are mixed with heavy metals containing wastewater leading to removal of both BioSeNPs and heavy metals. It was found that Cu, Cd and Zn can be effectively adsorbed onto BioSeNPs. Cu was 4. 7 times preferentially adsorbed onto BioSeNPs. The interaction of BioSeNPs with the heavy metals led to less negative ζ-potential of BioSeNPs loaded with heavy metals and thus better settling of BioSeNPs was achieved. The presence of BioSeNPs in the effluent of the microbial reactor treating selenium oxyanions containing wastewaters is undesirable due to higher total selenium concentrations. Thus, the attempts to capture of these BioSeNPs in the biomass/bioreactors were made. The activated sludge reactor system was investigated to aerobically reduce selenite to BioSeNPs and trap them in the activated sludge flocs. Around 80 % of the fed selenium was trapped in the biomass. Sequential extraction revealed that the trapped selenium is BioSeNPs. The trapping of BioSeNPs in the sludge improved the settleability and hydrophilicity of the activated sludge flocs. When the UASB reactor were operated under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, the total selenium concentration in the effluent under thermophilic conditions were lower than that of observed in mesophilic conditions suggesting better trapping of BioSeNPs.
