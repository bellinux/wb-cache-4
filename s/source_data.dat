Most of {{structured}} {{deep web}} <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> are non-cooperation, therefore establish an accurate <b>data</b> <b>source</b> content summary by sampling {{is the core}} technology of <b>data</b> <b>source</b> selection. The content of deep web <b>data</b> <b>source</b> is updated from time to time, however existing efficient methods of non-cooperation structured <b>data</b> <b>source</b> selection does not consider summary update problem. Unrenewed summary of <b>data</b> <b>source</b> can not accurately characterize {{the content of the}} <b>data</b> <b>source</b> that produce a greater impact on <b>data</b> <b>source</b> selection. Base on this, we propose a dynamic <b>data</b> <b>source</b> selection method for non-cooperative structured deep web by combining subject headings sampling technology and subject headings extension technology. The experiment results show that our dynamic structured <b>data</b> <b>source</b> selection method has good recall ratio and precision besides being efficient...|$|R

25|$|Scholarly {{handling}} of the Celtic languages has been rather argumentative owing to scarceness of primary <b>source</b> <b>data.</b> Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) distinguish Continental Celtic and Insular Celtic, arguing that {{the differences between the}} Goidelic and Brittonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages. Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) distinguish between P-Celtic and Q-Celtic, putting most of the Gaulish and Brittonic languages in the former group and the Goidelic and Celtiberian languages in the latter. The P-Celtic languages (also called Gallo-Brittonic) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages.|$|E
25|$|Melton's major {{emphasis}} {{has been}} on collating primary <b>source</b> <b>data</b> on religious groups and movements. His approach to research is shaped by his training both in church and religious history and in the phenomenology of religion. His methodology has followed that of a historian seeking primary source literature, and so he has generally made direct, personal contact with the leaders or official representatives of a church or religious group. The purpose of such contact has been to obtain the group's main religious literature to ascertain their principal teachings and practices. His inquiries also comprise, gathering membership statistics, details of the group's history and so forth. He then incorporates these details profiles that {{form the basis for}} reference texts like the Encyclopedia of American Religions.|$|E
