The results of this research provide software developers and instructional designers guidelines to use when designing computer <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> for use in instructional computing settings involving older adults...|$|R
2500|$|It was {{not long}} until Apple {{released}} their first portable computer, the Macintosh Portable in 1989. Although due to considerable design issues, it was soon replaced in 1991 with {{the first of the}} PowerBook line: the PowerBook 100, a miniaturized portable; the [...] 68030 PowerBook 140; and the [...] 68030 PowerBook 170. They were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest and a built-in pointing device (a trackball) in front of the keyboard. The 1993 PowerBook 165c was Apple's first portable computer to feature a <b>color</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>displaying</b> 256 <b>colors</b> with -pixel resolution. The second generation of PowerBooks, the 68040-equipped 500 series, introduced trackpads, integrated stereo speakers, and built-in Ethernet to the laptop form factor in 1994.|$|R

40|$|Range {{scheduling}} for {{satellite control}} presents a classical problem: supervisory {{control of a}} large-scale dynamic system, with unwieldy amounts of interrelated data used as inputs to the decision process. Increased automation of the task, with the appropriate human-computer interface, is highly desirable. The development and user evaluation of a semi-automated network range scheduling system is described. The system incorporates a synergistic human-computer interface consisting of a large <b>screen</b> <b>color</b> <b>display,</b> voice input/output, a 'sonic pen' pointing device, a touchscreen color CRT, and a standard keyboard. From a human factors standpoint, this development represents the first major improvement in almost 30 years to the satellite control network scheduling task...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{low yield}} rate in display panel {{production}} {{that results from}} imperfect Indium Tin Oxide layer deposition is well known. In this experiment a 6 th Generation TFT-LCD is used to investigate an ultra-precise method {{for the removal of}} Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) thin film microstructure from defective display panels. The complete removal of the ITO layer makes it possible to put these panels back into the production line for reuse with a considerable reduction of both waste and production cost. This process, which involves the removal of ITO layer substructure by means of an electro-chemical etching process, is of major interest to the optoelectronics semiconductor industry. The ITO film can be removed completely by a proper combination of feed rate and electric power. In this electro machining process a high current flow and high feed rate of the <b>display</b> (<b>color</b> filter) achieves complete and efficient removal of the ITO layer. A large diameter cathode virtual rotation circle also corresponds to a higher removal rate. A small cathode end radius effectively improves dregs discharge and is an advantage when associated with a high workpiece feed rate. This precision reuse process for the recycling of defective <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> <b>color</b> filters is presented as an effective tool for use in the screen manufacturing process. The defective Indium Tin Oxide thin-film can be removed easily and cleanly in a short time...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{information}} boards have a {{vital role}} in promoting safety and efficient road traffic, by providing the drivers with relevant traffic information on a real-time basis. To achieve good visibility and eye-catching quality, we must know the optimum number of <b>display</b> <b>colors</b> and ranges of chromaticity so that the road users can correctly recognize displayed information in a short time. We attempted to determine the optimum number of <b>display</b> <b>colors</b> based on the categorical color (basic perceived color) technique, as well as to define the chromaticity regions for <b>display</b> <b>colors</b> so that a given color is most effectively discriminated from the others. The results showed that the optimum number of <b>display</b> <b>colors</b> is ten, and categorization of the so-defined ten <b>display</b> <b>colors</b> on the chromaticity diagram is extremely useful in designing a traffic information board. (author abst.) 今日，LED素子を用いた道路情報板の設置台数は急速に増加してきているが，その道路情報板に関してはまだまだ改善・研究すべき点も存在している。その中の一つに，表示色及び表示色数の問題がある。現在の道路情報板に使用されている色は赤色，黄緑色とその混合色であるオレンジ色の 3 色である。近年では青色LEDの実用化に伴い，従来の赤色，黄緑色LEDと合わせることで，広範囲の色表示が可能となっが，道路情報板等の文字・図案表示においては，フルカラー表示よりも色の違いを認識できることが重要となる。すなわち，道路情報板に関してはドライバーの観測時間はわずか数秒間である。そのため，直感的に理解できる数種類の色によって文字・図案表示を行うことが望ましいと考えられる。そこで，本研究では，LED表示装置において適切且つ効果的な色表示を決定すべく，カテゴリカルカラー（人間にとっての基本的な知覚色）の観点に立って，道路情報板のマルチカラー表示における最適表示色数を決定するとともに，他の表示色との誤認を防ぐ，最も効果的な各色表示領域を求めることをその目的とした...|$|R
