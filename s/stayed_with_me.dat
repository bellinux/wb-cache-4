500|$|Following {{the release}} of Boys in August 2003, Shankar began work on his next directorial venture {{entitled}} Anniyan. It was initially thought to be Shankar's pet project Robot revived with a new title, but this was later proven not to be correct. Shankar said the film was his [...] "dream project" [...] and disclosed {{that it would be}} a racy, fantasy-thriller. When questioned on how the idea behind the film had come to him, the director revealed, [...] "The seeds of all my movies were sown when I was young, long before I started making movies. So many things disturbed me, and these <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Those were the seeds. I make films based on them." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the 1988 season, the Orioles again named Ripken their third-base coach. Speaking at the Annual Ripken Fan Club Banquet, {{general manager}} Roland Hemond said, [...] " [...] {{was a tough}} year for the Orioles, a tough year for me, and a tough year for the Ripken family. There {{was a lot of}} trauma, and I {{respected}} them for the way they handled it. I will never forget it." [...] Brady Anderson, who would play for the Orioles from 1988 through 2001 and hit 50 home runs in 1996, credited Ripken for helping him make it with the Orioles: [...] "I'll never forget earlier in my career how Cal Sr. <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> trying to help me become a better player when it might not have been the fashionable thing to do within the organization." [...] Ripken remained with the team until after the 1992 season, when he was removed from third-base coach duties as the Orioles wished to give younger coaches opportunities. The Orioles offered him the brand new position of coordinator of minor league field operations, but he declined, disappointed at being removed from third base. Ripken maintained that he was not retired, but he would never coach professionally again.|$|E
2500|$|On that {{occasion}} {{the prospect of}} inviting Baba Hari Dass to the US was raised. [...] "They <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{and asked me to}} go to the United States. I said I could go anywhere. I was ready to move to the higher mountains".|$|E

2500|$|Orbison {{attributed}} his own passion {{during his}} performances {{to the period}} when {{he grew up in}} Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant and his father would bring a guitar in the evenings and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military would gather, and drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, [...] "I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> all this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kasey Kahne {{took the}} lead on the second Green-White-Checker attempt and held off Matt Kenseth to score his first win of the season. [...] "Yeah, man, it took a lot," [...] said Kahne. [...] "We {{were all over the}} place during the race but the guys <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and worked hard. On those restarts– I didn't know what would happen because I had great restarts all night and I {{struggle}} with restarts a lot. That's big, because {{that is one of the}} things you have to be good at and it worked really well tonight. Yeah, we are locked in and I hate it comes down to this Atlanta or Richmond just about every year for me," [...] said Kahne. [...] "Sometimes we are in, sometimes we are out. But thankful that now at HMS I have been in all three years now." [...] "Those last two laps were really intense," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Things are looking up. I'm looking forward to the next 11." [...] "I couldn't capitalize, couldn't get the restarts and couldn't accelerate," [...] Denny Hamlin said. [...] "We just came up short. Third is about the place car we had tonight." ...|$|E
2500|$|In self-analysis, Jackson {{uncovered}} vital details regarding her past, saying, [...] "Certain {{things may}} happen, {{and you just}} dismiss them instead of stopping and saying, [...] "Why am I feeling this way? Why am I acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. [...] "Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But being a kid you're just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still the way I feel about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain".|$|E

60|$|Then Jim Freeman and {{his friends}} {{followed}} Darius' example, by going into the cabin, and but for what had passed between {{the old man and}} me I would have gone with them.
