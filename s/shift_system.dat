40|$|We {{study the}} use of Krylov {{subspace}} recycling for the solution of a sequence of slowly-changing families of linear systems, where each family consists of <b>shifted</b> linear <b>systems</b> that differ in the coefficient matrix only by multiples of the identity. Our aim is to explore the simultaneous solution of each family of <b>shifted</b> <b>systems</b> {{within the framework of}} subspace recycling, using one augmented subspace to extract candidate solutions for all the <b>shifted</b> <b>systems.</b> The ideal method would use the same augmented subspace for all systems and have fixed storage requirements, independent of the number of <b>shifted</b> <b>systems</b> per family. We show that a method satisfying both requirements cannot exist in this framework. As an alternative, we introduce two schemes. One constructs a separate deflation space for each <b>shifted</b> <b>system</b> but solves each family of <b>shifted</b> <b>systems</b> simultaneously. The other builds only one recycled subspace and constructs approximate corrections to the solutions of the <b>shifted</b> <b>systems</b> at each cycle of the iterative linear solver while only minimizing the base system residual. At convergence of the base system solution, we apply the method recursively to the remaining unconverged systems.

It has been previously shown that using augmented methods to solve multiple <b>shifted</b> <b>systems</b> simultaneously can been problematic for non-symmetric problems. Here, this difficulty is overcome by using the Sylvester equation formulation {{of a family of}} <b>shifted</b> <b>systems</b> and applying a block Krylov subspace method to solve this Sylvester equation (a strategy proposed by Simoncini in 1996).

40|$|Many {{problems}} {{in science and}} engineering fields require the solution of <b>shifted</b> linear <b>systems.</b> To solve such systems efficiently, the recycling BiCG (RBiCG) algorithm in [SIAM J. SCI. COMPUT, 34 (2012) 1925 - 1949] is extended in this paper. However, the shift-invariant property could no longer hold over the augmented Krylov subspace due to adding the recycling spaces. To remedy this situation, a strategy to enforce the collinearity condition on the <b>shifted</b> <b>system</b> is adopted and then a short term recurrence for the solution update of the <b>shifted</b> <b>system</b> is derived when the seed system is solving. The new method not only improves the convergence but also has a potential to simultaneously compute approximate solutions for <b>shifted</b> linear <b>systems</b> using only as many matrix-vector multiplications as the solution of a single system requires. In addition, some numerical experiments also confirm the efficiency of our method. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign error in articl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Subspace {{recycling}} methods, a {{class of}} Krylov subspace deflation techniques, {{have been shown to}} have the potential to accelerate convergence of Krylov subspace methods. In particu-lar, they can be useful when solving sequences of slowly-changing linear systems. We wish to extend such methods to solve sequences of linear systems, where for each system, we also solve a family of <b>shifted</b> <b>systems</b> in which the coefficient matrices only differ by multiples of the identity from a base system matrix. In this work, we demonstrate the difficulty of extending recycling techniques to solve multiple <b>shifted</b> <b>systems</b> while maintaining the fixed storage property. As an alternative, we introduce a scheme which constructs approximate corrections to the solutions of the <b>shifted</b> <b>systems</b> at each cycle while only minimizing the base system residual. At convergence of the base system solution, we apply the method recursively to the remaining unconverged systems. The method is robust enough to be applied to sequences of systems where the base system changes slowly and the shifts differ for each base system. We present numerical examples involving systems arising in lattice quantum chromodynamics. Key words. Krylov subspace methods, subspace recycling, <b>shifted</b> linear <b>systems,</b> QCD 1.
