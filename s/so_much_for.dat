5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried his hand at farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> buying things, but {{to interact with the}} people. In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of parliamentary supremacy in the British Isles did not constitutionally affect the Thirteen Colonies, which retained an adherence to English common law, but it directly affected {{the relationship between}} Britain and the colonies. When American colonists fought against Britain, they were fighting not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> new freedom, but to preserve liberties and rights that they believed to be enshrined in Magna Carta.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the University of Göttingen offered Max Born its {{chair of}} {{theoretical}} physics, which {{had recently been}} vacated by Peter Debye. Göttingen was an important centre for mathematics, thanks to David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Hermann Minkowski and Carl Runge, but not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> physics. This would change. As part of his price for coming to Göttingen, Born wanted Franck to head experimental physics there. On 15 November 1920, Franck became Professor of Experimental Physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics, a fully tenured professor ordinarius. He was allowed two assistants, so he brought Hertha Sponer with him from Berlin to fill one of the positions. Pohl, a gifted teacher, headed the First Institute, and handled the lectures. Franck refurbished the laboratory with the latest equipment using funds from his own pocket.|$|E

5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was twice}} shortlisted for the Eredivisie's annual Maatschappelijk Speler (Community Player) award, which {{brings with it}} a €50,000 prize to be donated to a social project of the winner's choice. He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, a football team for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the club in the community.|$|E
5|$|The episode's script {{went through}} several {{different}} versions before a final plot was decided upon, as Morgan and Wong believed the series {{would not be}} renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The decision to kill off the character of Catherine Black {{was based on a}} suggestion by Chris Carter, the series' creator. Morgan and Wong discussed the idea with actress Megan Gallagher, who felt that it was an interesting decision to have Catherine give her life after seeing Frank Black sacrifice <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> their family throughout the previous episodes. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being the result of a virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{negotiations}} with Spain's Atlético Madrid, Mendes arranged Costa's transfer for €1.5million and 50% of the player's rights in December 2006, but he remained on loan at Braga {{until the end}} of the season. Atlético defeated interest from Porto and Recreativo de Huelva for Costa's signature, with director Jesús García Pitarch admitting that it was a risk to pay <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> an inexperienced player. After 5 goals in 13 games for Penafiel, he was recalled to Braga in January 2007. On 23 February, he came on in the 71st minute for Zé Carlos and scored his first goal for the team, a last-minute goal for a 1–0 win at Parma to advance 2–0 on aggregate to the Last 16 of the UEFA Cup. His season ended after seven games due to a metatarsal injury which ruled him out for six months.|$|E

5|$|What is most {{important}} for us, out of the heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E
25|$|A novel {{effective}} method for egg analysis is the Kato-Katz technique. It {{is a highly}} accurate and rapid method for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura; however not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> hookworm, which {{could be due to}} fast degeneration of the rather delicate hookworm eggs.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year saw {{the release of}} the <b>So</b> <b>Much</b> <b>For</b> The Ten Year Plan-A Retrospective 1990-2000 album which (in title at least) was a self-deprecating poke at the bands' difficulties with corporate rock in recent years. It also allowed the band to fulfill some outstanding obligations to Universal Music.|$|E
25|$|As {{the gold}} rush wound down, serious {{professional}} mining was taking its place; not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> gold as for other metals such as copper, silver and lead. The closest port was Skagway, and the only route there was via the White Pass & Yukon Route's river boats and railroad.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of African Americans drowned {{trying to}} cross in Ebenezer Creek north of Savannah while trying to follow Sherman's Army in its March to the Sea.

25|$|The Genale Dam {{should be}} remembered not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the {{intrinsic}} importance (though fairly innovative by the 1920s, being built with reinforced concrete) but especially for the difficulties in the realization and for the great improvements for {{the social and economic}} life of the area. The dam also improved the image of colonial Italy in the world.|$|E
25|$|Caroline Birley (16 November 1851– 15 February 1907) was an English geologist, fossil {{collector}} and children's author. As a geologist, she was noteworthy, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the scientific value of her collection, {{but for the}} regard with which she was held in a predominately male profession. Her interest in geology started with stones she collected {{as a child and}} her enthusiasm continued until her death.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{behavior}} {{similar to}} that observed in humans is discovered when the hungry pigeons stop working/work less when the reward is reduced. Researchers argue that {{this is similar to}} labor supply behavior in humans. That is, like humans (who, even in need, will only work <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> a given wage), the pigeons demonstrate decreases in pecking (work) when the reward (value) is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{served as}} the NFLPA's lawyer until 1968, when he {{resigned}} to focus on representing individual players as an agent negotiating contracts. The NFL officially recognized the union {{later in the year}} when the two sides negotiated their first collective bargaining agreement. Cleveland coach Paul Brown disliked Miller <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> his work with the NFLPA that he had him scrubbed from the Browns' 1946 team picture.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} for forwards, however, where no daily true-up {{takes place in}} turn creates credit risk for forwards, but not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> futures. Simply put, {{the risk of a}} forward contract is that the supplier will be unable to deliver the referenced asset, or that the buyer will be unable to pay for it on the delivery date or the date at which the opening party closes the contract.|$|E
