25|$|Quiescent {{current in}} a {{regulator}} circuit {{is the current}} drawn internally, not available to the load, normally measured as the input current while no load is connected and hence a source of inefficiency (some linear regulators are, surprisingly, more efficient at very low current loads than <b>switch-mode</b> designs because of this).|$|E
25|$|High current power-frequency devices, such as {{electric}} motors, {{generators and}} transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel {{to break up}} the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors. The same principle is applied to transformers used at higher than power frequency, for example, those used in <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies and the intermediate frequency coupling transformers of radio receivers.|$|E
25|$|For low {{to medium}} frequencies, {{conductors}} {{can be divided}} into stranded wires, each insulated from one another, and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle. Wire constructed using this technique is called Litz wire. This measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors. Litz wire is used for making high-Q inductors, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher radio frequency current (up to hundreds of kilohertz), such as <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies and radio frequency transformers.|$|E
2500|$|Output noise (thermal white noise) {{and output}} dynamic {{impedance}} may be specified as graphs versus frequency, while output ripple noise (mains [...] "hum" [...] or <b>switch-mode</b> [...] "hash" [...] noise) {{may be given}} as peak-to-peak or RMS voltages, or {{in terms of their}} spectra.|$|E
2500|$|Three-phase {{electrical}} {{generation is}} very common. The simplest {{way is to}} use three separate coils in the generator stator, physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° out of phase to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher [...] "pole orders" [...] are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds {{can be used to}} generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.|$|E

50|$|A modern {{computer}} {{power supply}} is a <b>switch-mode</b> power supply that converts AC {{power from the}} mains supply, to several DC voltages. <b>Switch-mode</b> supplies replaced linear supplies due to cost, weight, and size improvement.

50|$|The <b>switch-mode</b> power {{supplies}} used in computers have historically had low power factors and {{have also been}} significant sources of line interference (due to induced power line harmonics and transients). In simple <b>switch-mode</b> {{power supplies}}, the input stage may distort the line voltage waveform, which can adversely affect other loads (and result in poor power quality for other utility customers), and cause unnecessary heating in wires and distribution equipment. Furthermore, customers incur higher electric bills when operating lower power factor loads. To circumvent these problems, some computer <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies perform power factor correction, and may employ input filters or additional switching stages to reduce line interference.|$|E
50|$|Switched-mode power {{supplies}} have applications in various areas. A switched-mode supply is chosen for an application when its weight, efficiency, size, or wide input range tolerance make it preferable to linear {{power supplies}}. Initially {{the cost of}} semiconductors made <b>switch-mode</b> supplies a premium cost alternative, but current production <b>switch-mode</b> supplies are nearly always lower in cost than the equivalent linear power supply.|$|E

50|$|A power {{semiconductor}} device is a semiconductor device used as a switch or rectifier in power electronics; a <b>switch-mode</b> power supply is an example. Such a device is also called a power device or, when used in an integrated circuit, a power IC.|$|E

50|$|Switched-mode {{power supply}} units (PSUs) in {{domestic}} products such as personal computers often have universal inputs, meaning that they can accept power from mains supplies throughout the world, although a manual voltage range switch may be required. <b>Switch-mode</b> power supplies can tolerate {{a wide range of}} power frequencies and voltages.|$|E

50|$|Numerous {{items of}} {{electric}} equipment will operate quite well on modified sine wave power inverter devices, especially loads that are resistive in nature such as traditional incandescent light bulbs. Items with a <b>switch-mode</b> power supply operate almost entirely without problems, {{but if the}} item has a mains transformer, this can overheat depending on how marginally it is rated.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies, the {{regulation}} circuits are powered from the output. To start the power supply, a leakage resistance {{can be used}} to trickle-charge the supply rail for the control circuit to start it oscillating. This approach is less costly and more efficient than providing a separate linear power supply just to start the regulator circuit.|$|E
50|$|High current power-frequency devices, such as {{electric}} motors, {{generators and}} transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel {{to break up}} the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors.

50|$|Some {{television}} receivers use a <b>switch-mode</b> power supply. For example, in some TV-models made by Philips, {{the power}} supply starts when the voltage reaches around 90 V. From there, one {{can change the}} voltage with the variac, and go as low as 40 V and as high as 260 V (a peak voltage of 260× ≈ 360 Vp-p), and the image will show absolutely no alterations.|$|E
5000|$|Adapters with AC outputs may consist only of {{a passive}} {{transformer}} (plus a few diodes in DC-output adapters), {{or they may}} employ <b>switch-mode</b> circuitry. AC adapters consume power (and produce electric and magnetic fields) even when not connected to a load; for this reason they are sometimes known as [...] "electricity vampires", and may be plugged into power strips {{to allow them to}} be conveniently turned on and off.|$|E
50|$|With linear loads, {{the neutral}} only carries the current due to {{imbalance}} between the phases. Devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front ends (such as <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies for computers, office {{equipment and the}} like) introduce third order harmonics. Third harmonic currents are in-phase {{on each of the}} supply phases and therefore will add together in the neutral which can cause the neutral current in a wye system to exceed the phase currents.|$|E
5000|$|Some [...] "universal" [...] {{replacement}} {{power supplies}} allow output voltage and polarity to be switched to match {{a range of}} equipment. With the advent of <b>switch-mode</b> supplies, adapters which can work with any voltage from 110 VAC to 240 VAC became widely available; previously either 100-120 VAC or 200-240 VAC versions were used. Adapters which {{can also be used}} with motor vehicle and aircraft power (see EmPower) are available.|$|E
50|$|At {{much higher}} {{frequencies}} the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small and cheap transformer can handle power levels {{that would require}} a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices and complex integrated circuits made <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies viable, to generate a high frequency from a much lower one (or DC), change the voltage level with a small transformer, and, if necessary, rectify the changed voltage.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{switched-mode}} {{power supplies}} (SMPSs) are smaller, lighter, and more efficient. They put out a much more constant voltage than unregulated supplies as the input voltage and the load current vary. When introduced, their prices were high, but by the early 21st century the prices of <b>switch-mode</b> components had dropped to a degree which allowed even cheap supplies to use this technology, saving {{the cost of a}} larger and heavier mains-frequency transformer.|$|E
50|$|With linear loads, {{the neutral}} only carries the current due to {{imbalance}} between the phases. Devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front-end such as <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies, computers, office equipment and such produce third-order harmonics that are in-phase {{on all the}} supply phases. Consequently, such harmonic currents add in the neutral in a wye system (or in the grounded (zigzag) transformer in a delta system), which can cause the neutral current to exceed the phase current.|$|E
50|$|Instead {{of having}} a power supply unit {{generate}} some fixed voltage, the CPU uses a small set of digital signals, the VID lines, to instruct an on-board power converter of the desired voltage level. The <b>switch-mode</b> buck converter then adjusts its output accordingly. The flexibility so obtained {{makes it possible to}} use the same power supply unit for CPUs with somewhat different nominal supply voltages and to reduce power consumption during idle periods by lowering the supply voltage.|$|E
50|$|Powdered iron cores {{are used}} in {{circuits}} such as <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies that operate above mains frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical resistivity. For frequencies extending beyond the VHF band, cores made from non-conductive magnetic ceramic materials called ferrites are common. Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the coupling coefficient (and bandwidth) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.|$|E
50|$|There {{has never}} been a de facto {{standard}} for external 5V connections, but using the same 7-pin DIN connectors as the Atari 800XL allowed an Atari 5V linear power supply to drive an Atom, so long as the current was less than the Atari PSU rating (1 or 1.5 amps, depending on the model). These are now uncommon, but 5V wall-wart <b>switch-mode</b> power supplies capable of supplying several amps are a readily and cheaply available alternative.|$|E
