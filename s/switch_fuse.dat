40|$|O presente trabalho propÃe a implantaÃÃo de um novo modelo de chave fusÃvel para ser utilizado em locais com alto Ãndice de poluiÃÃo salina, para com isso reduzir significativamente as ocorrÃncias de falta indevida de chaves fusÃveis e assim melhorar os Ãndices de DEC e FEC. Foram utilizadas como experimento de campo as redes de distribuiÃÃo existentes nas cidades de Aracati, Fortim e IcapuÃ, nos quais se observou um {{excelente}} desempenho da chave fusÃvel com duplo isolamento para as situaÃÃes, nos quais existem um alto Ãndice de poluiÃÃo salina. A chave do tipo fusÃvel Ã um equipamento composto de elementos destinados Ã proteÃÃo do circuito contra danos e efeitos dinÃmicos resultantes de faltas no sistema de distribuiÃÃo de energia. A utilizaÃÃo da chave fusÃvel de duplo isolamento foi responsÃvel pela reduÃÃo das ocorrÃncias provenientes da poluiÃÃo salina no perÃodo seco. Para se chegar a esse modelo de chave fusÃvel foram desenvolvidos vÃrios protÃtipos, os quais tentam eliminar a corrente de fuga ocasionada pela poluiÃÃo salina. Com a utilizaÃÃo dessa nova chave fusÃvel pÃde-se constatar a preservaÃÃo dos elos fusÃveis e a diminuiÃÃo dos registros de operaÃÃes indevidas, que provocavam acrÃscimo no tempo de trabalho das equipes, perda de {{material e}} principalmente insatisfaÃÃo do cliente. Este trabalho enfatiza as principais caracterÃsticas deste novo modelo de chave fusÃvel no que concerne a confiabilidade e a seguranÃa no fornecimento de energia. This paper proposes {{the implementation of}} a new type of <b>switch</b> <b>fuse</b> to be used in areas with high saline pollution, to reduce significantly the occurrences of lack of improper switch fuses and thereby improve the rates of DEC and FEC. Distribution networks were used as field experiment in the towns of Aracati, Fortim and IcapuÃ, in which there was an excellent performance of the <b>switch</b> <b>fuse</b> with double insulation for situations where there is a high rate of saline pollution. The switch, which {{is in the form of}} fuse, is a device composed of elements designed to protect the circuit from damage and dynamic effects resulting from faults in power distribution system. The use of double isolated <b>switch</b> <b>fuse</b> was responsible for the reduction of saline pollution occurrences in the dry season. To achieve this type of <b>switch</b> <b>fuse,</b> several prototypes were developed to try the elimination the leakage current caused by pollution saline. By using this new equipment, we could see the preservation of fuse links and the reduction of improper operations records, which caused an increase in working time of staff, loss of material and especially customer dissatisfaction. This paper emphasizes the main features of this new model of <b>switch</b> <b>fuse</b> when it comes to reliability and security of energy supply...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} relate {{investment}} {{costs to the}} resulting levels of supply reliability, it is required to quantify supply reliability in a monetary basis which {{can be achieved by}} calculating the expected interruption costs (EIC). Customer interruption costs (CIC) are used as substitute in the assessment of reliability worth in electric power systems. In order to determine an optimal and reliable level of customer service, reliability cost/worth is to be assessed by calculating the costs associated with different system configurations and assessing the corresponding reliability worth at the respective system load points. This paper presents the utilization of a practical radial distribution system of APCPDCL /APTRANSCO database in the development of individual sector and customer damage functions. Customer interruption costs due to failure in electrical energy supply depend on many factors. A composite customer damage function is created for combinations of all customer classes. The main objective of the paper is to assess reliability cost /worth indices of expected energy not supplied (EENS), expected cost of interruptions (ECOST) and interrupted energy assessment rate (IEAR) of a typical radial practical distribution system using a generalized analytical technique. The effects on customer interruption cost indices associated with alternate supply, protection devices, different <b>switch</b> <b>fuse,</b> and breaker are included in the analysis and also compared with the results of reinforcement of system by disconnect switch additions. The results presented in this paper will be useful for the electric power utilities, designers and planners in the decision-making stage...|$|E
