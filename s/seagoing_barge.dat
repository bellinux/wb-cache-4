25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s Townshend has {{predominantly}} used Synclavier Digital Audio systems for keyboard composition, particularly solo albums and projects. He currently owns three systems, one large Synclavier 9600 Tapeless Studio system, originally installed in his riverside Oceanic Studio, later {{transferred to a}} <b>seagoing</b> <b>barge</b> moored alongside the studio on the River Thames, and currently based in his home studio. He also uses a special adapted smaller Synclavier 3200 system which can be transported, enabling him to carry on working away from his main studio. This 3200 system was modified to be of similar specification to the 9600, including the addition internally of FM voices, stereo Poly voices and with the large VPK keyboard. This is the only Synclavier 3200 system of this specification in existence, custom designed and built for Townshend by Steve Hills. The third system Townshend owns {{is one of the}} first Synclavier II systems ever built. The ORK (original smaller) keyboard of which is on display in his company's head office alongside a pink Vespa scooter.|$|E
50|$|USS Nahunta, a <b>seagoing</b> <b>barge,</b> {{was built}} as West Point by Aitken Mansel, Glasgow, Scotland, in 1872. It was {{acquired}} by the United States Navy as Nahunta from Luckenbach Steamship Co., Inc. of New York City and commissioned 8 August 1917.|$|E
50|$|J.B. Walker, a 2,136 gross ton <b>seagoing</b> <b>barge,</b> {{was built}} at Thomaston, Maine, in 1879 as a schooner. After {{operating}} commercially {{for nearly four}} decades, she {{was taken over by}} the U.S. Navy in October 1917 and placed in commission as USS J.B. Walker (ID # 1272) in August 1918.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Terceras Landing" [...] in the Azores Islands on 25 May 1583, was a {{military}} feat as its planners {{decided to make a}} fake landing to distract the defending forces (5,000 Portuguese, English and French soldiers); also special <b>seagoing</b> <b>barges</b> were arranged in order to unload cavalry horses and 700 artillery pieces on the beach; special rowing boats were armed with small cannons to support the landing boats; special supplies were readied to be unloaded and support the 11,000-man landing force strength. The total strength of the amphibious force was 15,000 men, including an armada of 90 ships.|$|R
50|$|In 1840 the Lowca {{engineering}} {{works of}} Tulk and Ley {{made the first}} locomotive for the new Maryport and Carlisle Railway, but ironically, {{it had to be}} transported from Parton by <b>seagoing</b> <b>barge.</b> Not until several years later was the technically challenging railway extension to Whitehaven via Parton developed. The railway soon supplanted the old tramway, and brought new opportunities for Parton's industries. The colliery, the engineering works and the brewery all thrived, an iron-foundry opened next to the new railway station, and in the 1870s an ironworks was established on the shore near the Lowca works. Unfortunately, the end of the 19th century was a period of industrial consolidation, and Parton's relatively small businesses began to struggle.|$|E

50|$|The Navy {{employed}} Washington as a <b>seagoing</b> coal <b>barge.</b> On 1 December 1917, {{while in}} tow from Hampton Roads, Virginia, with 2300 LT of coal on board, Washington {{was caught in}} a heavy snow storm and went aground attempting to enter the Ambrose Channel at New York. Determined to be unsalvageable, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in February 1918.|$|R
5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, <b>seagoing</b> ice <b>barges</b> in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|R
50|$|The Dubki horse-iron {{road was}} built to serve the armory at Sestroretsk, Russia. The {{production}} of the Sestroretsk armory was originally transported to Saint Petersburg along the coast, by road. But {{the road to the}} capital existing at that time was inconvenient, since it lay along the coast on quicksands and lowlands, which were periodically submerged by the waters of the Gulf of Finland. Therefore, <b>seagoing</b> scows (<b>barges)</b> later began to be used. In 1847, a horse-drawn tramroad was built from the plant to the Dubkovsky pier on the Gulf of Finland. In the diagram this tramroad is not shown, but it passed along the axis of the street to the centre of the map. The opening and the location of the pier are designated on the map.|$|R
50|$|Oil and gas {{continue}} to play a dominant role in the Plaquemines economy; however, there is a growing policy and resource trend in favor of renewable resources. The Parish government is working with public and private partners to invest in renewable energy, including hydrokinetic energy and wind energy. Plaquemines has a huge potential for hydrokinetic energy sites along deep bends in the Mississippi River. The flow of the river is 470,000 cubic feet per second at the Head of Passes during normal river stages and 1,250,000 during peak times. Tidal turbines would be placed in deep bends of the river below <b>seagoing</b> and <b>barge</b> traffic. The turbines would also be located below the usual migrating routes of fish. Four companies intending to install turbines are in the regulatory and permitting stages.|$|R
50|$|Shinn's platoon went {{north and}} east towards {{reaching}} {{the northeast corner of}} the island at 0700. A camouflaged <b>seagoing</b> Japanese landing <b>barge,</b> diesel-powered and fully fueled was discovered moored in the channel between JOE and JOHN. Immediately after, Shinn's Marines spotted two Gilbertese natives crossing the channel from JOHN. Concealed and observing, they noticed two natives coming down a trail. Not knowing whether they were friendly, the recon Marines crouched and waited until they were practically on top of them.|$|R
