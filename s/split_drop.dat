40|$|We {{determined}} {{the effect of}} sera enriched with the soluble complex of complement (SC 5 b- 9), on hydraulic conductivity (Lp) of single pulmonary venules (diameter 20 - 30 microns). Sera free of anticoagulants and blood cells were prepared from rat and human blood. Lp were determined by our <b>split</b> <b>drop</b> technique in isolated, blood-perfused lungs prepared from anesthetized rats (2 % halothane; Sprague Dawley, 500 g; n = 73). Zymosan-activated (ZAS) and control sera were used for Lp determinations. In ZAS prepared from human serum, SC 5 b- 9 concentration was > 300 micrograms/ml (control: < 1 microgram/ml) as determined by ELISA. At baseline, Lp averaged 3. 4 +/-. 4 x 10 (- 7) ml/(cm 2. s. cm H 2 O), but it increased by 217 +/- 32 % with undiluted ZAS (P < 0. 05). The Lp increase correlated significantly with different ZAS dilutions for rat serum and with SC 5 b- 9 concentration for human serum. Lp did not increase significantly with ZAS prepared from heat-treated sera, C 6 - and C 8 -deficient sera; or with ZAS in which SC 5 b- 9 had been depleted by immunoprecipitation. The ZAS-induced increase of Lp was blocked completely by venular preinfusion with the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide (1 mg/ml, 10 min). We report {{for the first time}} that: (a) SC 5 b- 9 increases lung endothelial Lp; and (b) the increase of Lp is attributable to an integrin-dependent mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Open droplet {{microfluidic}} platforms offer attractive {{alternatives to}} closed microchannel devices, including lower fabrication cost and complexity, significantly smaller sample and reagent volumes, reduced surface contact and adsorption, {{as well as}} drop scalability, reconfigurability, and individual addressability. For these platforms to be effective, however, they require efficient schemes for planar drop transport and manipulation. While there are many methods that have been reported for drop transport, {{it is far more}} difficult to carry out other drop operations such as dispensing, merging and splitting. In this work, we introduce a novel alternative to merge and, more crucially, <b>split</b> <b>drops</b> using laterally-offset modulated surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The energy delivery into the drop is divided into two components: a small modulation amplitude excitation to initiate weak rotational flow within the drop followed by a short burst in energy to induce it to stretch. Upon removal of the SAW energy, capillary forces {{at the center of the}} elongated drop cause the liquid in this capillary bridge region to drain towards both ends of the drop, resulting in its collapse and therefore the <b>splitting</b> of the <b>drop.</b> This however occurs only below a critical Ohnesorge number, which is a balance between the viscous forces that retard the drainage and the sufficiently large capillary forces that cause the liquid bridge to pinch. We show the possibility of reliably <b>splitting</b> <b>drops</b> into two equal sized droplets with an average deviation in their volumes of only around 4 % and no greater than 10 %, which is comparable to the 7 % and below splitting deviation obtained with electrowetting <b>drop</b> <b>splitting</b> techniques. In addition, we also show that it is possible to <b>split</b> the <b>drop</b> asymmetrically to controllably and reliably produce droplets of different volumes...|$|R

50|$|The Drop Physics Module (DPM) {{permitted}} {{the study of}} liquids without the interference of a container. Liquids on Earth take {{the shape of the}} container that holds them. Furthermore, the materials that make up the container may chemically contaminate the liquids under study. The DPM uses acoustical (sound) waves to position a drop {{in the center of a}} chamber. By studying drops in this manner, scientists have the opportunity to test basic fluid physics theories in the areas of nonlinear dynamics, capillary waves, and surface rheology (changes in the form and flow of matter). Crew members, through manipulation of the sound waves, were able to rotate, oscillate, merge, and even <b>split</b> <b>drops.</b> In another test, the crew members were able to create the first compound drop, a drop within a drop, to investigate a process that could eventually be employed to encapsulate living cells within a semi-permeable membrane for use in medical transplantation treatments.|$|R

50|$|Another {{passive system}} {{makes use of}} {{the amount of time that}} a water drop needs to be in touch with frozen {{material}} before the drop freezes and sticks. Rough surfaces, with ridges shorten the time that water stays in contact. When a drop hits any surface, it flattens into a pancake, then regains a round shape and bounces up. Ridges <b>split</b> large <b>drops</b> into smaller ones. The smaller drops re-formed and bounced away up to 40 percent quicker than the larger drops. Nature employs this concept, as shown in the difference between lotus and nasturtiums. The latter's leaves are rougher and ice less than the smoother lotus.|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} a {{particle}} along a one-dimensional closed curve {{in a plane}} is considered. The only restriction on {{the shape of the}} loop is that it must be invariant under a twofold rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane of motion. Along the curve a symmetric double-well potential is present leading to a twofold degeneracy of the classical ground state. In quantum mechanics, this degeneracy is lifted: the energies of the ground state and the first excited state are separated from each other by a slight difference ¿E, the tunnel splitting. Although a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the loop does not influence the classical motion of the charged particle, the quantum-mechanical separation of levels {{turns out to be a}} function of its strength B. The dependence of ¿E on the field B is oscillatory: for specific discrete values Bn the <b>splitting</b> <b>drops</b> to zero, indicating a twofold degeneracy of the ground state. This result is obtained within the path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics; in particular, the semiclassical instanton method is used. The origin of the quenched splitting is intuitively obvious: it is due to the fact that the configuration space of the system is not simply connected, thus allowing for destructive interference of quantum-mechanical amplitudes. From an abstract point of view this phenomenon can be traced back to the existence of a topological term in the Lagrangian and a nonsimply connected configuration space. In principle, it should be possible to observe the splitting in appropriately fabricated mesoscopic rings consisting of normally conducting metal...|$|R

5000|$|Split leather is leather {{created from}} the fibrous {{part of the}} hide left once the top-grain of the rawhide has been {{separated}} from the hide. During the splitting operation, the top-grain and <b>drop</b> <b>split</b> are separated. The <b>drop</b> <b>split</b> can be further split (thickness allowing) into a middle split and a flesh split. In very thick hides, the middle split can be separated into multiple layers until the thickness prevents further splitting. Split leather then has an artificial layer applied {{to the surface of}} the split and is embossed with a leather grain (bycast leather). Splits are also used to create suede.
