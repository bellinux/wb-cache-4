2500|$|Richard <b>Strier</b> {{additionally}} {{notes the}} complexity of the word [...] "flatter" [...] not only within Sonnet 87 but within other Shakespeare sonnets as well. While the word has been used [...] "in contexts of purely negative self-deception" [...] as well as [...] "in the context of providing genuine beauty," [...] it is utilized within this poem as an [...] "evocation of joy that is brief and delusive, but potent while it lasts". The phrase [...] "as a dream doth flatter" [...] correlates strongly with the Petrarchan view that earthly joys are briefly.|$|E

The bulk of his work has been with David Scott Kastan in the 29-volume Bantam series, which was originally published in 1988 and was reissued in 2005, and his own complete Shakespeare, which is continually reissued. However, Bevington has worked {{on a handful of}} plays for other publishers, though nearly all are within the scope of the English Renaissance. Bevington has notably maintained a single, conflated text in all of his editions of King Lear, a revisionist choice criticized by some scholars (including the abovementioned Richard <b>Strier,</b> who insists his own students read the Quarto and Folio texts separately).|$|E

50|$|When Ebba Grön {{broke up}} in 1983, <b>Stry</b> joined the band’s lead singer Thåström in forming the new rock band Rymdimperiet, later renamed Imperiet. Imperiet, {{inspired}} by synth {{and the new}} sounds of the 1980s and still inheriting {{a lot of the}} punk sound from Ebba Grön, became one of Sweden’s must popular and successful bands at that time. But after only one year with Imperiet, <b>Stry</b> decided to leave the band and moved back to Malmö.|$|R
50|$|Soon after this, <b>Stry</b> {{was invited}} to move to Stockholm and joined the punk rock band Ebba Grön, which was the most famous and {{successful}} Swedish rock band at the time. <b>Stry</b> took his notebook with 100 songs and joined Ebba Grön. He would have a great influence on the band’s third and last album, simply named Ebba Grön. He had already written a song called Stockholms pärlor (Stockholm’s Pearls) for Ebba Gröns second album Kärlek och uppror.|$|R
5000|$|Bevington {{has also}} taught courses {{entitled}} [...] "Shakespeare: Histories and Comedies," [...] surveying such plays as Richard II, Richard III, Henry IV, Part 1, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Twelfth Night, and Measure for Measure; [...] "Shakespeare: Tragedies and Romances"; and [...] "Shakespeare's History Plays"; among others. When Bevington is not instructing these courses, {{they are often}} led by his fellow professors Richard <b>Strier,</b> John Muse, or Tim Harrison. Bevington usually spends Spring Quarter with B.A. theses he is advising, and the corresponding students, or else traveling. However, he {{has been known to}} sign up for introductory-level courses in subjects vastly different from his own (such as Greek, or the Natural Sciences).|$|E
5000|$|He also edits the Norton Anthology of Renaissance Drama and an {{important}} anthology of Medieval English Drama, the latter of which was just re-released by Hackett {{for the first time}} in nearly four decades. Bevington's editorial scholarship is so extensive that Richard <b>Strier,</b> an early modern colleague at the University of Chicago, was moved to comment: [...] "Every time I turn around, he has edited a new Renaissance text. Bevington has endless energy for editorial projects." [...] In addition to his work as an editor, he has published studies of Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and the Stuart Court Masque, among others, though it is for his work as an editor that he is primarily known.|$|E
50|$|Feliciano Miguel Abdalla, {{the son of}} a Lebanese immigrant, {{obtained}} the Fazenda Montes Claros in Minas Gerais in 1944 on condition that he preserve the forest on the property. At this time the settlers in Minas Gerais were clearing the land for agriculture, and conservation was an alien concept. For many years he had to struggle against hunters and people looking to harvest timber and hearts of palm, sometimes at risk to his life. Towards the end of the 1960s Abdalla began to meet researchers. The professors Álvaro Aguirre and then Celio Valle introduced the woods to the scientific community. In 1977 professor Akira Nishimura began the first systemic study of the northern muriquis, to be followed by Russell Mittermeier and Karen <b>Strier.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Though Vendler and Booth {{understand}} the legal imagery {{in a similar}} fashion, they differ in {{their understanding of the}} couplet. Vendler proposes that the couplet has a defective key word. Vendler identifies [...] "gift" [...] as the key word of the sonnet as [...] "gift" [...] and its variants [...] "gives" [...] and [...] "gav'st" [...] appear in all three quatrains in lines 3, 7, 9, 10, and 11. However, this key word is defective because it is absent in the couplet. Its absence in the couplet reflects the desertion of the [...] "gift", the young man. Booth understands the couplet to have sexual overtones. In the phrase, [...] "I had thee as a dream" [...] Booth suggests that [...] "had" [...] means [...] "possessed sexually" [...] or [...] "embraced". Sexual dreams were a common Renaissance topic and Booth suggests that Shakespeare is playing on this usage. He cites Spenser's The Faerie Queene 1.1.47-49, Jonson's The Dream, Herrick's The Vine, Othello 3.3.416-432, and Gascoigne's Supposes, 1.2.133 as contemporary works that contain sexual dreams. Booth also proposes that [...] "matter" [...] in the closing line has a sexual meaning in addition to meaning [...] "real substance". Here he cites examples of matter being used in its sexual sense in Hamlet 3.2.111: [...] "country matter" [...] and Julius Caesar 1.1.23: [...] "women matters". Richard <b>Strier</b> additionally notes the complexity of the word [...] "flatter" [...] not only within Sonnet 87 but within other Shakespeare sonnets as well. While the word has been used [...] "in contexts of purely negative self-deception" [...] as well as [...] "in the context of providing genuine beauty," [...] it is utilized within this poem as an [...] "evocation of joy that is brief and delusive, but potent while it lasts". The phrase [...] "as a dream doth flatter" [...] correlates strongly with the Petrarchan view that earthly joys are briefly.|$|E
