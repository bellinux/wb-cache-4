40|$|Measurements of spin {{dependent}} observables at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory provide unique {{insight into}} the contribution of a proton 2 ̆ 7 s constituents to its spin. The Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) {{can be used to}} measure effects of the quark and gluon spins in the proton by observations of neutral pions that result from longitudinally and transversely polarized proton-proton collisions in STAR. The neutral pions (π 0 ’s) decay into two photons that, for pseudorapidity (η) 1 to 2, can be observed in the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter in STAR. These are used to reconstruct the kinematic properties of the π 0 ’s and we can then look for spin asymmetries in π 0 production. Measurements of both the longitudinal and transverse spin asymmetries in the production of π 0 ’s from data taken in 2006 have made some contributions {{to our understanding of the}} structure of the proton. New data taken in 2009, in a longitudinal spin run with greater luminosity, will provide greater precision in the final results.

In this work, we demonstrate that the burst frequency can be significantly raised by making just a small adjustment of the liquid height in the vent chamber.
