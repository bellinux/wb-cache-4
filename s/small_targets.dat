Early studies started in late 1941 {{under the direction of}} Luis Alvarez at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, but full-scale development did not begin until April 1943. By this time US-built, higher frequency systems promising better performance over the existing British H2S radar were entering production. Eagle's even higher resolution was considered important to Air Force planners who preferred precision bombing but were failing to deliver it, and high hopes were put on the system's abilities to directly attack <b>small</b> <b>targets</b> like docks and bridges.|$|E

An additional modification afforded greater resistance to infrared countermeasures by replacing the missile tracking flare with a pulsed IR beacon. Other improvements included an increased missile range from 8 to 10km, improved optical tracking and accuracy, improved fire control co-ordination between components of a battery and the command post. Overall, the Tunguska-M1 has a combat efficiency 1.3–1.5 times greater than the Tunguska-M.|$|E

2500|$|Bombers and Zeppelins in World War I proved {{vulnerable}} to pursuit aircraft, so {{each of the}} belligerents quickly moved to a strategy of bombing at night when the attackers were much safer. However, night bombing suffered from imprecision in targeting. As early as 1926, American airmen noted that <b>small</b> <b>targets</b> which were difficult to see at night {{would have to be}} attacked in daylight hours. Still, night bombing was emphasized. In 1932, the staff at ACTS moved to embrace daylight bombing as the primary method to get the greatest bomb tonnage on target. To survive this kind of risky offensive action, the bombers would have to be flying higher than their pursuers, and higher than the effective range of anti-aircraft artillery. ACTS bombing proponents began calling for higher service ceilings for their bombers: [...] for light bombers and [...] for the heavy bombers.|$|E
2500|$|After Endymion had {{repeated}} this maneuver for {{the third}} time, causing considerable loss aboard President, Decatur abruptly turned to starboard to cross Endymions bow. He had mustered boarding parties in case the British were taken by surprise, but Endymion also turned to starboard and the two ships headed south, exchanging broadsides. Decatur {{had no time to}} batter the British vessel into surrender, if he could, as the other three British ships would almost certainly be in range before long; so his gunners fired high into Endymions rigging, seeking to disable her, using chain shot and [...] "dismantling shot" [...] (bars of iron linked by a ring), while the British gunners fired low into the hull of President. However, it was claimed that the shooting was poor on both sides while [...] Presidents powder was defective. Despite this claim, gunfire from the Endymion significantly damaged the Presidents hull. Shot had pierced President below the waterline and 6 feet of water was found in the hold(although some could have been from the grounding). [...] Endymion successfully disabled 6 guns on the President 's starboard broadside by damaging the barrels or shooting them off their carriages. 10 out of the 15 [...] starboard gun ports were hit and the gun crews reduced. Shot [...] from the Endymion was even found inside the President 's magazine. Given the situation, President might have been on its way to sinking. This suggest's that Philip Broke's method of naval gunnery was effectively used in the engagement as was it in the engagement between Shannon and Chesapeake 18 months earlier as in both cases the British were able to target the enemy's gun ports. These were remarkably <b>small</b> <b>targets</b> given the accuracy of naval guns of the era and it is likely that Broke's method of using gunsights and degree markings on the deck were the key method in which that such <b>small</b> <b>targets</b> were able to be hit. Meanwhile, President had significantly cut the rigging of Endymion effectively slowing it down.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the battle}} was one-sided almost from the beginning. The reasons for this {{are the subject of}} {{continuing}} study by military strategists and academics. There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran, where they were interned {{for the duration of the}} conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of the US, such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights, quickly turned the air war into a [...] "turkey shoot". The heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft. Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly <b>small</b> <b>targets,</b> were a staple of US news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war, compared by some to a video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 February, many Iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces.|$|E
2500|$|Stereotactic {{radiosurgery}} {{was first}} developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat <b>small</b> <b>targets</b> {{in the brain}} that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes. The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation {{was made in the}} early fifties, with x-rays. The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson. [...] At this time, stereotactic proton beams had replaced the x-rays. The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the synchrocyclotron was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the Karolinska Institute and consisted of several cobalt-60 radioactive sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays. This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England. The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh in 1987.|$|E

At first, NWTH filter based on white top-hat (WTH) transformation is performed for three scales (structure elements) with wide scale interval. For the discrimination of candidate target and background region, Threshold is calculated by using maximum value of the summation image by NWTH filter. By using this threshold, a structure element is selected by candidate target clutter ratio (CTCR), modification of signal to clutter ratio gain (SCRG). Based on the selected structure element, the other two structure elements are updated with middle scale interval. Through recursive process of procedure mentioned above, optimum three structure elements are obtained.
