25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> is {{a vessel}} with {{sufficient}} buffer volume {{to store the}} largest slugs expected from the upstream system.

50|$|Slug {{catchers}} {{can be used}} continuously or on-demand. A <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> permanently {{connected to}} the pipeline will buffer all production, including the slugs, before it {{is sent to the}} gas and liquid handling facilities. This is used for difficult to predict slugging behaviour found in terrain slugging, hydrodynamic slugging or riser-based slugging. Alternatively, the <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> can be bypassed in normal operation and be brought online when a slug is expected, usually during pigging operations. An advantage of this set-up is that inspection and maintenance on the <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> can be done without interrupting the normal operation.|$|E

50|$|The Lincoln Giants {{can trace}} their origins {{back to the}} Nebraska Indians, of Lincoln, Nebraska, from the 1890s. According to Sol White's History of Colored Base Ball, in 1890, the Lincoln Giants were founded as the first colored {{professional}} team in the west. In the early 1910s, Jess McMahon, a white promoter, hired Sol White, former manager of the Philadelphia Giants, {{to put together a}} club. White signed eventual Hall of Famers John Henry Lloyd, the greatest shortstop in Negro league history, Cyclone Joe Williams, perhaps the greatest pitcher, and <b>slugging</b> <b>catcher</b> Louis Santop, together with pitcher Cannonball Dick Redding, center fielder Spotswood Poles, and catcher/first baseman Bill Pettus. Lloyd took over from White as manager midway through the 1911 season. With their powerful lineup, the Lincolns were the dominant team in African-American baseball in 1911, 1912 and 1913, winning the unofficial eastern championship each of those years. In 1913, with second baseman Grant Johnson joining the club, the Lincolns defeated Rube Foster's Chicago American Giants for the national black championship.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} slug flow {{behavior}} inside a finger type <b>slug</b> <b>catcher.</b> Slug exists when two phase are flowing together. Slug can cause damage and unnecessary shut down of process equipment. To handle slug,finger type <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> {{is used as}} it is a liquid receiving facility designed to handle large volume of liquid and to stabilize it. Finger type <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> used the gravity settling separation method to separate the gas and liquid phase of the flow. Finger type <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> can be massive in size,and the gas recovery percentage is difficult to maximize. Unbalance mass distribution of the natural gas inside the <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> contribute to the low gas recovery inside the <b>slug</b> <b>catcher.</b> The objective of this research is to increase the mass distribution of the flow on the original <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> design hence increasing the efficiency of the separation. A base model is design for the original finger type <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> using Gambit and several modifications can be added from there named modify design. The proposed modification for the original <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> design is the addition of one equalizer header and the T-junction separation at inlet manifold. Original and modified <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> designs are tested for its efficiency by using Fluent. Both the velocity magnitude and phase volume fraction will be taken as result to compare the effectiveness of the modification. Result from the original <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> design show an unbalance mass distribution by analyzing its velocity magnitude. Poor separation cause by both the unbalance mass distribution and unsuitable pressure inside the original <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> lead to low separation of gas. Modify design of the <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> show a positive response of the velocity magnitude and suitable pressure on the inlet manifold. T-junction separation at inlet manifold cause the velocity magnitude to be even on both of the pipe and mass distribution balance are greatly increased. The modifications of the original design thus increase the effectives of finger type <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> by 6 %...|$|E
40|$|In Oil & Gas applications, {{the use of}} {{pipelines}} {{that carry}} both liquid and gas phases of fuels extracted from on-shore and off-shore subsea wells is constantly growing. In these conditions, flow regimes such as slug flow and plug flow can appear. If these flow regimes are established, damage at the downstream devices, such as the treatment systems located {{at the end of}} the pipeline, can occur. It is therefore necessary to separate the phases before they are treated. The purpose of a <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> is to separate the phases at the exit of the pipeline and to send them separately to the respective treatment systems. In this paper, a series of fluid dynamic simulations using a CFD methodology to predict the separation performances of a typical finger-type <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> geometry are carried out. A typical geometry which resembles real installations is considered. Different computational models were tested to find the solution that would give more accurate results with the minimum computational effort. For this purpose, comparisons between static models (computationally less expensive) and transient models (more accurate) were carried out. The influence of different models of turbulence and the influence of the computational grid on the final results were also evaluated. Guidelines for the correct implementations of these kinds of simulations are reported and the impacts of modeling assumptions on the expected results are discussed. The main technical contributions of the paper are: • evaluating the operation of a <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> in different flow conditions; • testing the validation of the slug catchers by means of numerical simulations; • verifying the design choices in order to optimize the geometry of the <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> in relation to the conditions of us...|$|E

40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industry, the {{traditional}} procedure for <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> design is based on the Stokes' law. Design equations are obtained from a 1 -D analysis and validated with experimental data. Therefore, this method basically relies on simplified models and empirical correlations. For this reason, an over margin factor from 20 to 40 % is usually applied. In this paper, a simplified CFD procedure for the modelling of the gas-liquid separation is presented. Steady state and transient models have been considered for single phase and multiphase fluids, using OpenFOAM. The influence of flow model and mesh grid on results have been evaluated as a trade-off between solution accuracy and computational efforts, in order to assess the applicability of these models to industry. A comparison of the industrial validation procedure with the CFD analysis has been realized, focusing on {{the pros and cons of}} the two different approaches. A new application solver has been constructed and programmed in order to get the most accurate results with the minimum computational efforts. This solver is based on a completely new and innovative approach to the Navier-Stokes equations for multiphase flow. New model proposed has been used for the evaluation of design for the two slug catchers studied, in order to get a better separation and fluids management...|$|E
40|$|Terrain induced {{slugging}} {{have become}} more common as the petroleum industry matures. Late-life fields, deepwater fields and marginal subsea tiebacks to existing facilities are prone to terrain induced slugging. Extended reach wellbore, including snake wells, fish-hook wells and undulated wells are relative new technologies used to drain otherwise not economically feasible hydrocarbon zones. These well trajectories are, however, prone to terrain induced slugging since they can resemble a pipeline-riser system containing low spots over large distances to accumulate large liquid slugs. Conventional methods of handling slug flow includes choking, gas injection at the riser base or installation of a <b>slug</b> <b>catcher.</b> These methods have drawbacks of reducing production rates, requiring large amounts of gas or high cost. Lately, automatic slug control based on feedback control systems can suppress the slugs, but becomes unstable when operating conditions change. This study attempts to assess the potential of a rotating device to mechanically break down liquid slugs in the gas-liquid interface and/or influence multiphase flow in any significant and beneficial way. Experiments were performed by placing the device in vertical, inclined and horizontal sections. It was seen that the device in some cases influenced the slug flow behaviour, especially in horizontal flow direction. The frequency increased while the average slug length decreased significantly over a short distance. It was further seen that the impact in vertical direction and bend sections were insignificant for the test conditions in this study...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a fuzzy–based framework for the prioritization of health, safety and environment related risks posed against employees, working conditions, and process equipment in large gas refineries. The First Refinery at Pars Special Economic Energy Zone in South of Iran was taken as a case study. For this purpose, health, safety and environment related risks were determined based on the three criteria of impact severity, occurrence probability, and detect-ability using a questionnaire of 33 identified failures. The values obtained were processed by a so-called ‘contribution coefficient’. The results were then subjected to fuzzification and fuzzy rules were defined to calculate the risk level indices as the model outputs, which was then employed to facilitate the management decision-making process by prioritizing the management options. The prioritization values were then classified in six categories in the order of risk severity. Results revealed that failure in a combustion furnace had the highest rank while failure in the <b>slug</b> <b>catcher</b> ranked the lowest among the risk sources. It was also found that about 0. 4 % of the identified risks prioritized as “intolerable”, 79 % as “major”, 20 % as “tolerable”, and 0. 7 % as “minor”. Thus, most of the risks (more than 79 %) associated with the refinery has the potential of significant risks. The results indicated that the risk of the pollutant emissions from the combustion furnaces is the highest. Exposures to harmful physical, chemical, psychological, and ergonomic substances are the other risks, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Pipelines with {{multiphase}} flow will exhibit large and highly nonlinear liquid rates during transients caused {{by changes in}} production rate. This requires either a large separator (<b>slug</b> <b>catcher)</b> downstream, capable of handling all disturbances, or, some sort of control of the rate change {{in order to ensure}} that the downstream processing equipment can cope with the disturbances. In this report, it is proposed to use smart liquid control to optimally control the production during rate changes. The term smart liquid control was coined to describe the use of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and a nonlinear pipeline model to control liquid levels. The pipeline from the Snøhvit field to the Hammerfest LNG plant was used as a test case on which to implement smart liquid control. The technique was proved using a simplified OLGA pipeline model for both predictions and as process, i. e. perfect model. Good results were shown, especially when compared to manual control. Smart liquid control therefore presents a possibility to reduce separator size for new projects. Another highly interesting use of smart liquid control is to optimize the use of separator buffer capacity in order to maximize production. The NMPC method used in this report, a single shooting multistep quasi-Newton method, was elaborated on in a literature review chapter. Also an implementation of the method was made and described in the context of NMPC. The implementation of the algorithm was made in the in-house STATOIL MPC-tool, SEPTIC. In order to assess the performance of the algorithm, it was tested on a small continuously stirred tank reactor system and the results reported and discussed. </p...|$|E
