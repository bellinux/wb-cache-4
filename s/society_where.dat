5|$|Cotillo was {{a strong}} proponent of social and pro-labor legislation. He defended ethnic Italians against the {{stereotyping}} by Americans not of Italian descent, but also urged the need for Americanization of the Italian community. As such, he stood between the mores of the Italian ethnic ghetto in East Harlem where he grew up, and the judgment and norms of American <b>society</b> <b>where</b> he made his career.|$|E

5|$|India is also {{a patriarchal}} society, which, by definition, {{describes}} cultures in which males as fathers or husbands {{are assumed to be}} in charge and the official heads of households. A patrilineal system governs the <b>society,</b> <b>where</b> descent and inheritance are traced through the male line and men are generally in control of the distribution of family resources.|$|E
5|$|Writer Rhianna Pratchett {{has said}} that the game's story {{examined}} why citizens would accept a life in a <b>society</b> <b>where</b> their personal choices were very limited. It also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to live outside the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what George Orwell described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.|$|E
50|$|Dowry {{exists in}} <b>societies</b> <b>where</b> capital is more {{important}} than manual work. For instance, in Middle Age Europe, a wife had to bring a dowry - land, cattle and money.

In South-Saharan Africa, land was abundant, there were few or no domesticated animals, manual work was therefore important, and therefore bridewealth dominated.|$|R

5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, his account of an earthquake at Downing was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal <b>Society,</b> <b>where</b> there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he had collected at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Barringer, Berg {{enrolled}} in New York University. He spent two semesters there and played baseball and basketball. In 1919 {{he transferred to}} Princeton University and never again mentioned that he had attended NYU for a year, presenting himself exclusively as a Princeton man. Berg received a B.A., magna cum laude in modern languages. He had studied seven languages: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Sanskrit, studying with the philologist Harold H. Bender. His Jewish heritage and modest finances combined to keep him {{on the fringes of}} Princeton <b>society,</b> <b>where</b> he never quite fit in.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} gap year to finance Painted Faces, Hooper read English at University College, Oxford.

Hooper also {{had his first}} paid directing work, earning £200 for a corporate Christmas video, and he directed his first television advertisements, including one for Sega featuring Right Said Fred. He continues to direct advertisements alongside television and film projects. In 1996 he joined the commercial production company John S.

5|$|Besides his {{governmental}} career, Gale was {{a member}} of the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal <b>Society,</b> <b>where</b> he served as treasurer. Gale was known as a collector of manuscripts and other antiquarian items, writing a few published works on those subjects. He donated his manuscript collection to his alma mater in 1738, and died in 1744. Although contemporaries felt he was one of the foremost scholars of his age, later historians have been less convinced, contrasting his learning unfavourably with his father's.|$|E

The museum's collection was later transferred to Manchester University, when it was decided, {{with the permission of}} the Bishop of Manchester, that Beswick should finally be buried. The ceremony took place at Harpurhey Cemetery on 22July 1868, more than 110years after her death; the grave is unmarked.|$|E
5|$|First Nations peoples have lived, hunted, and {{traveled}} across {{the area for}} at least 10,000 years, as shown by archaeological evidence on Walpole Island. These peoples were drawn from an amalgamation of Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potowatami clans, which formed the Three Fires Confederacy, also called the Council of Three Fires, in A.D. 796. These clans came together through common links in both language and culture, developing a self-sufficient <b>society</b> <b>where</b> tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among all members.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the concept of}} artificial societies and identify a number of separate classes of such societies.

This publication launched him into the intellectual and cultural circles of Antananarivo high <b>society,</b> <b>where</b> he established himself as Madagascar's leader not only in poetry and prose, but as an esteemed journalist, art critic, translator, and writer of essays and plays.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Nasser married Tahia Kazem, the 22-year-old {{daughter}} of a wealthy Iranian father and an Egyptian mother, both of whom {{died when she was}} young. She was introduced to Nasser through her brother, Abdel Hamid Kazim, a merchant friend of Nasser's, in 1943. After their wedding, the couple moved into a house in Manshiyat al-Bakri, a suburb of Cairo, where they would live {{for the rest of their}} lives. Nasser's entry into the officer corps in 1937 secured him relatively well-paid employment in a <b>society</b> <b>where</b> most people lived in poverty.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, McKellen, {{at the age}} of 18, won a {{scholarship}} to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature. He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the College. While at Cambridge, McKellen {{was a member of the}} Marlowe <b>Society,</b> <b>where</b> he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in Henry IV alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), Cymbeline (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and Doctor Faustus. During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands all of whom would have a huge impact on McKellen's future career.|$|E

5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796. He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, Anthony Shepherd, Richard Farmer and William Wales. However, {{due to an}} enmity of the President Joseph Banks, friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne, such as Lax, Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge, frequently saw their submissions for publications overlooked. If any of them submitted papers to the Society: they had the honour of having them carefully lodged in {{the archives of the}} <b>Society,</b> <b>where</b> the world in general, or even the members of the Society, would derive no more benefit from them than if they were deposited at the centre of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Phrynion learnt that Neaira {{was back}} in Athens, and {{attempted}} to take her back from Stephanus. Stephanus resisted, claiming that as Neaira was a free woman he had no right; a claim which Phrynion proceeded to challenge in court, though he was persuaded to settle the case by arbitration instead. The arbitrators decided that Neaira was indeed free, and {{that in addition to}} this she was her own kyria (mistress); this was an extremely unusual decision in a <b>society</b> <b>where</b> all citizen women, at least, had a kyrios (master). Despite this unusual level of freedom, however, Neaira was compelled to split her time between the two men as they agreed, without any input herself.|$|E
