40|$|This {{consumer}} {{study was}} conducted to assess how effective <b>shelf</b> <b>talker</b> advertisements with nutrition related health claims are at selling fresh produce. Background research was conducted to determine the appropriate displays and FDA defined label claims. The study posted visually appealing <b>shelf</b> <b>talker</b> advertisements next to their respective produce item and compared the recorded sales a week prior to the advertising campaign to the following week with advertisements. Two separate observation periods were conducted at Spencer’s San Luis Obispo and Arroyo Grande locations after the first period in June 2011 produced a surprisingly small amount of statistically significant data. The study ended with eleven produce items’ unit sales results with and without <b>shelf</b> <b>talker</b> advertisements from both Spencer’s locations after two strong, but unsuccessful attempts to positively influence produce sales from a statistically significant standpoint. The data for each location was entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to run paired t-tests for means. The results for each store communicated similar analysis to the basic sales data comparisons, which lead to rejecting the study’s proposed hypothesis that sales would increase during the second week of the study with advertising. Despite unfavorable results, this study {{can be used as a}} guide for future studies assessing consumer responses to different types of FDA nutritional claims as well as a reference to how custom produce displays and product placement in grocery stores can influence consumer purchasing behaviors...|$|E

This research demonstrates how the information search and risk reduction strategies of Millennials differ from older consumers. Findings from a survey sample of 409 US consumers suggest that if unsure about making a wine selection, Millennials {{are more apt to}} seek information from friend/family and <b>shelf</b> <b>talkers</b> than elders. Elders were more willing to ask questions of store personnel and wine stewards. While brand is very important to both groups, Millennials rely less on geographical cues such as region of origin to determine wine quality and pay more attention to medals won, label imagery, and alcohol content. The differences in the importance of and usage of these various information sources are helpful for wineries to prioritize their marketing appeals to the Millennial segment...|$|R
