25|$|In {{the case}} of the {{simultaneous}} surrender of a partnership estate and the private estate of a partner, a separate <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> for each estate must be prepared (see 20.1). The costs of preparing the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> are part of the costs of sequestration and are, therefore, payable out of the estate.|$|E
25|$|In Ex parte Viviers et uxor (Sattar intervening) 2001 (3) SA 240 (T), {{the court}} {{accepted}} that a debtor {{who has already}} made an unsuccessful attempt to surrender his estate may lodge the same <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> that he used in the earlier abortive application, provided the relevant facts and reasons for the surrender remained unchanged. In the court’s view, {{in the absence of}} any provision in the Act or other authority providing a legal impediment to the same material facts being used more than once, there was no reason why the debtor could not reuse his previous <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} the debtor’s assets and {{liabilities}} is generally determined by reference to the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> which he is required to prepare and file, but the court is not bound by the valuations in the statement; it may make a finding of insolvency even where the statement indicates that his assets exceed his liabilities.|$|E

25|$|The <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs,</b> with {{supporting}} documents, must be {{lodged in}} duplicate at the Master’s Office (s 4(3)). If the debtor resides or carries on {{business in a}} magisterial district {{in which there is}} no Master’s Office, he must lodge an additional copy of the statement at the office of the magistrate of that district (s 4(5)). This latter requirement does not apply to a debtor residing in the district of Wynberg, Simonstown or Bellville in the Western Cape. The <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> must lie for inspection by creditors at all times during office hours for a period of 14 days stated in the notice of surrender (s 4(6)). On expiry of the inspection period, the Master and the magistrate (where the statement has lain with him) each issues a certificate to the effect that the statement has duly lain for inspection as advertised in the notice of surrender, and whether any objections have been lodged with him by creditors. This certificate must be filed with the Registrar before the application is heard.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the fourteen-day time limit {{is to ensure that}} {{creditors}} have sufficient opportunity to peruse the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> and {{to decide whether or not}} to oppose the application. The legislature’s objective in imposing the thirty-day limit was to ensure that debtors would not be able to give long notice, months beforehand, and in that way to keep creditors from levying execution and in the meantime dissipate all their assets. Failure to adhere strictly to the third-day time period has mostly been taken to be fatal to the application. In Ex parte Harmse, the court held that the failure is a formal defect or irregularity, as envisaged by section 157(1), and therefore does not invalidate the application unless it has caused a substantial injustice which cannot be remedied by a court order.|$|E
25|$|The Master may, on {{receiving}} the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs,</b> specially direct the applicant {{to have any}} property mentioned in it valued by a sworn appraiser or a person designated by the Master for this purpose (s 4(4)). The court may, when considering the application for surrender, call for an independent valuation (Ex parte Prins & another 1921 CPD 616). In {{the absence of any}} direction by the Master or the court, the debtor is not legally obliged to obtain an independent valuation in support of the values given in his statement (if he does so unnecessarily, the cost of the appraisement will not be allowed as part of the costs of the sequestration: Ex parte Kruger 1947 (2) SA 130 (SWA)), but he may effectively be compelled to do this if he relies on the anticipated proceeds of a single asset to show that sequestration will be to the advantage of creditors. In Ex parte Anthony en ‘n ander en ses soortgelyke aansoeke 2000 (4) SA 116 (C), it was held that an applicant who relies on {{the fact that he has}} immovable property which can be sold for the benefit of his creditors must include evidence from an expert proving the likely proceeds of the property in a forced sale (see also Ex parte Mattysen et uxor (First Rand Bank Ltd intervening) 2003 (2) SA 308 (T) 312; Ex parte Bouwer and similar applications (supra) 388—9; Investec Bank Ltd & another v Mutemeri & another 2010 (1) SA 265 (GSJ) 271; Naidoo & another v Matlala NO & others 2012 (1) SA 143 (GNP) 155).|$|E

60|$|The next stroke {{was young}} Madison's sudden disappearance, and the {{declaration}} by Robson {{that he had}} carried off {{a great deal of}} property--a disappointment to her even greater than the loss. Robson was profuse in compliments and attentions, but continually deferred the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> that he had promised; and Mary could not bear to accept the help of Mr. Ward, the only person at hand able and willing to assist her. She had at last grown desperate, and, resolved to have something positive to write to Mr. Dynevor, as well as not to go on living without knowing her means, she had insisted on Robson bringing his accounts. She knew just enough to be dissatisfied with his vague statements; and the more he praised her sagacity, the more she saw that he was taking advantage of her ignorance, which he presumed to be far greater than it really was. At the very moment when she was most persuaded of his treachery, and felt the most lonely and desolate--when he was talking fluently, and she was seeking to rally her spirits, and discover the path of right judgment, where the welfare of so many was concerned--it was then that Fitzjocelyn's voice was in her ear.|$|E
