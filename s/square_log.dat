2500|$|But {{beyond these}} public {{buildings}} {{designed in the}} Nordic Classicism style, this same style was also used in timber constructed workers' housing, most famously in the Puu-Käpylä ("Wooden Käpylä") district of Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas. The around 165 houses of Puu-Käpylä, modelled on farmhouses, were built from traditional <b>square</b> <b>log</b> construction clad in vertical boarding, but the construction technique was rationalised with an on-site [...] "factory" [...] with a partly building element technique. The principle of standardization for housing generally would take off during this time. In 1922 the National Board of Social Welfare (Sosiaalihalitus) commissioned architect Elias Paalanen to design different options of farmhouses, which were then published as a brochure, Pienasuntojen tyyppipiirustuksia (Standard drawings for small houses) republished several times. In 1934 Paalanen was commissioned to design an equivalent urban type-house, and {{he came up with}} twelve different options. Alvar Aalto, too, became involved, from 1936, in standard small houses, designing for the Ahlström timber and wood product company, with three types of the so-called AA system: 40 m² (Type A), 50 m² (Type B) and 60 m² (Type C). Though based on traditional farmhouses, there are also clear stylistic elements from Nordic Classicism but also modernism. However, it was with the repercussions of the Second World War that the standard system for house design took on even greater potency, {{with the advent of the}} so-called Rintamamiestalo house (literally: War-front soldier's house). These were built throughout the country; a particularly well-preserved example is the district of Karjasilta in Oulu. But this same house type also took on a different role in the aftermath of World War Two as part of the Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union; among the [...] "goods" [...] delivered from Finland to the Soviet Union were over 500 wooden houses based on the standard Rintamamiestalo house, deliveries taking place between 1944 and 1948. A number of these houses ended up being exported from the Soviet Union to various places in Poland, where small [...] "Finnish villages" [...] were established; for example, the district of Szombierki in Bytom, as well as in Katowice and Sosnowiec.|$|E
60|$|The service {{began with}} a short prayer and was {{followed}} by the singing of a hymn. Nowhere had Shefford heard better music or sweeter voices. How deeply they affected him! Had any man ever fallen into a stranger adventure than this? He had only to shut his eyes to believe it all a creation of his fancy--the <b>square</b> <b>log</b> cabin with its red mud between the chinks and a roof like an Indian hogan--the old bishop in his black coat, standing solemnly, his hand beating time to the tune--the few old women, dignified and stately--the many young women, fresh and handsome, lifting their voices.|$|E
60|$|When {{he lifted}} a tie and felt the hard, {{splintering}} wood, he wondered where it had come from, {{what kind of a}} tree it was, who had played in its shade, how surely birds had nested in it and animals had grazed beneath it. Between him and that <b>square</b> <b>log</b> of wood there was an affinity. Somehow his hold upon it linked him strangely to a long past, intangible spirit of himself. He must cling to it, lest he might lose that illusive feeling. Then when he laid it down he felt regret fade into a realization that the yellow-gravel road-bed also inspirited him. He wanted to feel it, work in it, level it, make it somehow his own.|$|E

50|$|Adams County {{was created}} by the Legislature in early 1825, and by year's end, the county commissioners had {{produced}} specifications for the first courthouse; this structure was a <b>square</b> <b>log</b> building completed in early 1826.

After ten years of use, it was destroyed by a fire in 1836, and a new brick courthouse was begun, but it too fell prey to fire in 1875. A peaceful county seat war ensued, but Quincy defeated the challenge from Coatsburg by a wide margin, and the county's third courthouse was completed and occupied in 1877.|$|E
