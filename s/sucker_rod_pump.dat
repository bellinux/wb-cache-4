A pumping system efficiency {{model has been}} built by considering the influence of centralizers on polished rod load. The influence of centralizers, stroke length, pumping speed and flooding period on <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> system efficiency and production has been studied. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> system efficiency and production rate decrease while the number of centralizer increases, but the influence of number of centralizer on <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> system efficiency and production rate is not big while the influence of stroke length and pumping speed is significant.

30|$|<b>Sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> is a {{traditional}} and widely used method of artificial lifting in the world’s oil industry. In recent years, on the one hand, as the natural energy has been depleted and working fluid level is going down, most of old oilfields in the late development stage need deep pumping techniques to increase oil production; on the other hand, deep reservoirs are gradually being developed. For example, the average reservoir depth in Tahe oilfield of Northwest China is more than 6000  m. With the complex geological conditions and bad fluid properties, the working fluid level is very low and rapidly dropping to the limit depth of conventional <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> system. The limit depth mainly depends on the polished rod load which increases with the pump depth. However, high polished rod load is disadvantageous to the whole system and even tends to exceed the operating range of the pumping unit. At present, aiming at the problem about how to reduce the polished rod load in the deep <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> wells, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed. They are side-flow <b>pump,</b> <b>rod</b> load reducer, fiberglass–steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> and deep <b>pumping</b> with small-diameter pump.|$|R
30|$|Development of {{fiberglass}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> {{for use in}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> {{oil wells}} was started in 1973, based {{on the need for}} a <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> that could <b>pump</b> under highly corrosive and heavily loaded condition (Saul III and Detterick 1980). In contrast to standard steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> with relatively heavy weight, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> bodies are much lighter. That is because fiberglass has a low density. Thus, using fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> can significantly reduce the gravity load acting on the polished rod.|$|R

40|$|Sucker rod {{pumps are}} {{installed}} in approximately 90 % of all oil wells in the U. S. Although {{they have been}} widely used for decades, there are many issues regarding the fluid dynamics of the pump that have not been fully investigated. A project was conducted at Sandia National Laboratories to develop unimproved understanding of the fluid dynamics inside a <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pump.</b> A mathematical flow model was developed to predict pressures in any pump component or an entire pump under single-phase fluid and pumping conditions. Laboratory flow tests were conducted on instrumented individual pump components and on a complete pump to verify and refine the model.

Examples of issues affecting pump performance investigated with the model include the effects of viscosity, surface roughness, valve design details, plunger and valve pressure differentials, and pumping rate...|$|E
30|$|Wax {{deposition}} {{can reduce}} flow channel, increase the resistance and decrease fluid producing intensity in oil pipelines, which bring a critical operational {{challenge for the}} oil development. The prediction of temperature field and wax deposition location is the basis in thermal washing and wax removal. In this paper, the wells of <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pump</b> in Da Qing oil field is selected as the research object, a new method is proposed to predict temperature field and wax deposition location based on heat–fluid coupling method. The regularities of temperature distribution and wax deposition location are simulated with different fluid producing intensities and moisture contents. With the migration of produced liquid, the temperature decreases from bottom to upward, while the decline rate becomes less and less. With the increase of fluid producing intensity and moisture content, the temperature is increasing and the wax deposit location becomes shallower. In contrast to the calculated and measured results, the coincidences rate distribution is {{in the range of}} 95.61 – 97.86 %. The results have a significance to the thermal washing plan formulation.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{its special}} structure, the force {{condition}} of the side-flow pump {{is different from that}} of the conventional <b>pump.</b> When the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> system works, the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> connected to the polished rod performs vertical reciprocating motion. Thus, we choose the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> and plungers as the object of the force analysis. The result is shown in Fig.  2.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> {{systems are}} the {{dominant}} technology used currently in oil pumping systems for stripper (marginal) wells. The system {{consists of a}} high-speed rotating prime mover, a linear reciprocating pump, a gear reducer and a crank and beam mechanism to translate the high-speed rotating motion into a low-speed linear motion. A <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> system requires a relatively large surface area which limits its use in offshore applications. Moreover, the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> system cannot be used in deviated wells because of the long steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod.</b> In this research, {{the replacement of the}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> system with a permanent magnet linear motor which drives the reciprocating pump directly is presented. In this system, the motor drive is placed on the surface and connected to the motor through a long cable. The motor is placed downhole to drive the reciprocating pump. The main challenges of this system result from the high temperature downhole and the long transmission cable and will be discussed in detail. Another system which replaces the AC cable with a DC cable is proposed. In this system, the inverter is integrated with the motor downhole while the rectifier remains on the surface. A modified integrated motor drive with a speed control algorithm is proposed. Moreover, two sensorless algorithms are developed; one for the AC system and one for the DC system. The DC system algorithm estimates the motor position based on the motor model using the current and voltage measurements. The AC system sensorless algorithm utilizes both the motor and cable models to estimate the motor position and motor current. Finally, a pump monitoring system is developed to detect the common pump faults. An observer is developed to estimate the load force from the motor current and speed. The load force could be used along the motor position to identify various fault signatures...|$|R

30|$|After this {{sensitivity}} analysis {{we found that}} massive hydraulic fracturing treatment is required for Fig  16 {{in order to achieve}} long half-length and high fracture conductivity. This massive frac will increase the history production rate by 4 – 5 times. The fracture half-length that could be achieved using the proposed design length ranging between, 600 and 800 ft. The fracture conductivity achieved by using the proposed model, ranging between 10, 000 and 20, 000 ft (md) depends on the proppant type used. Coarse proppant type is preferred (12 – 18); medium strength will give high conductivity. The amount of proppant required to achieve this design is ~ 360, 000 Lb. In most of the cases the frac height will propagate downward toward the carbonate layer. In order to avoid propagating the frac toward the carbonate layer, very small frac design should be used (~ 40, 000 Lb of proppant). This small frac size will not increase the productivity from well as required and the production rate is expected to drop rapidly after the fracture. Proppant flow pack additive should be used to avoid proppant flow back after the treatment and avoid damaging the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pump</b> is an {{artificial}} lift method frequently applied in onshore petroleum wells. This {{system can be}} described using a numerical simulation based {{on the behavior of}} a rod string. In the past, the elastic behavior of the rod string made it difficult to model the system. However, since the 1960 s and with the advent of digital computers, it has been modeled numerically. The rod string be-haves like a slender bar, and thus, the propagation of elastic waves along the bar can be represented by a one-dimensional equation. Gibbs (1963) presented a mathematical model based on the wave equation, which is described {{on the basis of the}} analysis of forces on the rod string and is incorporated into a boundary value problem involving partial differential equations. The use of the finite differ-ence method allows for a numerical solution by the discretization of the wave equation developed in the mathematical formulation with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. This work presents a methodology for implementing an academic computer code that allows simulation of the upstroke and downstroke motion of the rod string described by the wave equation under ideal operating conditions, assuming a harmonic motion of the rod at one end and downhole pump at the other end. The goal of this study is to generate the downhole dynamometer card, an important and consolidated tool that controls the pump system by diagnosing oper-ational conditions of the downhole pump...|$|E
40|$|The {{high cost}} of {{starting}} a non-flowing well is the background for this project. This is a concern, mainly for offshore and subsea completed wells. Typically, coiled tubing (CT) is run into the production tubing to a depth approximately 1000 m below the wellhead. Nitrogen gas is then injected through the CT to dilute the wellfluid and reduce the hydrostatic pressure {{in order to bring}} the well on stream. This is a high cost operation due to the large intervention unit needed and the time required. In addition, HMS is a concern with gas lift operations due to the high pressure nitrogen gas used. This thesis has proposed a design based on using a wireline (WL) powered pump as an alternative to CT. The pump was designed using computer-aided design (CAD). Finite element method (FEM) analyzes of critical parts was performed to verify the structural integrity. The design is based on a using slightly modified conventional surface WL winch system In addition, known principle of downhole completion and pump components were used. The pump concept created may also be deployed using a riserless light well intervention (RLWI) vessel. The design proposed can be used for 7 inch and 5 &# 189; inch tubing. The length of the pump is 16 meters and fits with standard lubricator lengths of 20 meters. The design is based on the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pump</b> principle. To further study the potential of the pump, dynamic simulations were performed. The intention was to simulate the pump cycle to analyze the performance of the system. Results from the simulations verified that the WL operated pump has an economical potential compared to CT. The time consumption to bring the well back on stream was 158 minutes for a 7 inch tubing and 92 minutes for a 5 &# 189; inch tubing. Compared with CT, the potential savings for a subsea completed well could be in the order of 2, 5 MUSD. The overall conclusion is that a WL powered pump system can be used for startup of non-flowing wells. Further work will be needed for automation of the WL winch system. This is important for optimizing and better control of the pump system. </p...|$|E

30|$|An {{automatic}} clustering algorithm {{based on}} the FBH–SC algorithm is proposed in this paper. It is used {{to solve the problem}} that in current studies fault diagnosis for down-hole conditions of <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> systems relies too much on training samples. This algorithm is not limited by any data distribution shapes and is insensitive to the initial cluster centers. Besides, any parameters need not be set in an optimal process. The CritC index function is used as the target function to find the best k and σ. According to the analysis of the relationships among CritC, σ, k and the clustering accuracy of the five data sets, the proposed algorithm is useful in an unsupervised learning mode. However, although the proposed FBH algorithm has nearly halved the operation time of the BH algorithm, it still takes about 330  min for the set data 3 as the initial solution throughout the whole search space and the mechanisms of “suck” and “generation” used in the solving process. So, in the further work, we will focus on how to reduce the operation time of the algorithm as much as possible. We emphasize it is still a difficult problem to use an unsupervised learning method to diagnose multiple faults for down-hole conditions of <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> systems.|$|R
30|$|Downhole working {{conditions}} of <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> wells are automatically identified {{on a computer}} from the analysis of dynamometer cards. In this process, extraction of feature parameters and pattern classification are two key steps. The dynamometer card is firstly divided into four parts which include different production information according to the “four point method” used in actual oilfield production, and then the moment invariants for pattern recognition are extracted. An improved support vector machine (SVM) method is used for pattern classification whose error penalty parameter C and kernel function parameter g are optimally chosen by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The simulation results show the method proposed in this paper has good classification results.|$|R
30|$|<b>Sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> {{systems are}} the main {{artificial}} lift methods in oil production. In practical oil production, monitoring of the down-hole working conditions of the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> systems mainly relies on manual methods. This precludes real-time monitoring and the operating costs are high. In order to monitor down-hole working operations continuously in normal running, {{it is necessary to}} use computers to replace the manual work. In oilfields, dynamometer cards are commonly used to analyze down-hole working conditions. Nowadays, many computer diagnosis methods have been used to achieve intelligent identification of the dynamometer cards. These include expert systems (Derek et al. 1988; Martinez et al. 1993), artificial neural networks (Rogers et al. 1990; Xu et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2007 a, b; de Souza et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2011), rough set theory (Wang and Bao 2008), support vector machine (Tian et al. 2007 a, b; Li et al. 2013 a; Yu et al. 2013), fuzzy theory (Li et al. 2013 b, c), and designed component analysis (Li et al. 2013 b). The current research mainly focuses on supervised learning methods, which rely on manual work to select training samples. Although the supervised learning maybe has higher classification accuracy, it is mainly dependent on high quality training samples. In oil production, this has two shortcomings: firstly, it is easily affected by the subjective experience of the technical staff; secondly, there are larger workloads in manual classification of the training samples. So, in order to reach a higher efficiency of monitoring the down-hole working conditions, the unsupervised learning method is useful to decrease the dependence on the training samples. In this paper, an unsupervised classification method based on the FBH–SC clustering algorithm is discussed.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, the {{unsupervised}} classification method {{is used to}} diagnose down-hole working conditions of <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> systems. This does not rely on training samples for artificial classification. The classification error will be reduced as the automatic classification of the data set can be realized according to its global distribution modes and data attributes. One key problem {{is to find a}} feature vector set (data attributes) to distinguish different types of down-hole dynamometer cards (distribution modes). All of them with the same fault type can be divided into a class by the automatic clustering algorithm. The above two feature extraction methods are used to extract the curve eigenvectors of the experimental data (down-hole dynamometer cards) to structure the data set (different fault types of down-hole dynamometer cards with different data distribution). Then the data set can be used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.|$|R
30|$|Over-, and under-design of {{artificial}} lift installations {{happens in the}} industry very often and professionals {{know how to deal}} with them. Some lifting methods such as gas lifting or <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> are relatively easy to handle since their lifting capacity can be adjusted in quite broad ranges after installation. ESP installations, however, do not tolerate design inaccuracies because any given ESP pump can only be used in a specific, quite restricted range of pumping rates. If used outside its recommended liquid rate range, the hydraulic efficiency of the pump rapidly deteriorates; efficiencies can go down to almost zero. In addition to the loss of energy and the consequent decrease in profitability the ESP system, when operated under such conditions, soon develops mechanical problems that can lead to a complete system failure. The usual outcome is a workover job and the necessity of running a newly designed ESP system with the proper lifting capacity.|$|R

The oil rich stream is brought to the surface while the water rich stream is pumped into an injection formation without ever coming to the surface. A DOWS system includes many components but the two primary components are an oil/water separation system and a pumping/injection system used to lift oil to the surface and inject the water into a deeper formation. Two basic types of DOWS systems have been developed, one type uses hydrocyclones to mechanically separate oil and water and the other relies on gravity separation that takes place in the wellbore. Three basic types of pumping/injection systems are used with the DOWS technology. These include electrical submersible pumps, progressive cavity <b>pumps</b> and <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumps.</b> Hydrocyclone separators are usually used with the electrical submersible pumps because of higher drawdown created with effective injection of water into the lower zone.|$|R

40|$|This {{technology}} {{provides a}} simple yet clever idea for preventing oil and saltwater polluting spills by <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping</b> oil wells, {{as well as}} prolonging {{the life of the}} stuffing box seals and pressure lubricating the polished rod. This objective is accomplished by introducing a non-polluting, food grade, high viscosity lubricant into the void space between two sets of seals in a typical stuffing box. This safe-fluid acts as a sacrificial fluid that will be the fluid that is exposed to the atmosphere when the primary seal in the stuffing box leaks for any reason. In addition, the pressure on this sacrificial safe-fluid is maintained at the same pressure as the pressure on the produced fluid in the flow line at the pumping tee, thereby equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal in the stuffing box that separates the safe-fluid from the produced fluid. The unique feature, of equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal, is accomplished by using a pressure transmitter which is monitoring the pressure in the flow line (which is the fluid under the secondary seal) and transmitting that pressure to the safe-fluid (which is the fluid above the secondary seal) thereby equalizing the pressure across this secondary seal. The primary seal will be sealing the safe-fluid and will be operating under optimum conditions, extending the life of this primary seal. The principle of the invention was proven by equipping eight oil wells with Field Retro-Fit Packages of Independent component parts to hydro-balance the existing stuffing boxes...|$|R

The hard boride based coatings on steels and alloys obtained through the thermal diffusion process have a high potential for these severe application conditions over many other types of coatings as they can be obtained on the entire working surfaces of large size and complex shape products. Intensive tribological studies of the iron boride based coatings on carbon steel obtained at Endurance Technologies Inc. have been conducted using the Cameron-Plint testing unit (reciprocating sliding of the metallic rod under the load over a flat surface of the coated samples). The friction wear loss, friction coefficient and structural changes of the coatings have been studied in dry and lubricating (water-oil) friction conditions, which simulate actual application conditions. It was demonstrated that the obtained boride coatings have the friction loss significantly smaller than untreated steel (e. g. 2 ̆ 23 c 10 - 30 times in the dry conditions and at least 5 times in the lubricating conditions) with no peeling and flaking-off. The friction coefficients of the boride coatings are steady over the test duration. The influence of the thickness on the boride coatings performance is demonstrated. The encouraging results are explained by the specific coating structure of the hard coating obtained through the thermal diffusion process and the thin 'tribofilm' formed during a friction mode.

30|$|In deep-rod <b>pumping</b> wells, {{polished}} <b>rod</b> load {{tends to}} be very high and even exceeds the operating range of the pumping unit. To tackle the problem, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed till now. They are side-flow <b>pump,</b> <b>rod</b> load reducer, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> and deep <b>pumping</b> with small-diameter pump. However, some of them still cause certain problems when put into use. That indicates the fundamental mechanisms of these techniques {{have not yet been}} fully studied. In this paper, on the basis of conventional polished rod load calculation models, the new calculation models for these techniques are respectively established. The rod load reduction effects are comparatively analyzed by calculation. The results indicate that the differences in mechanisms lead to different reduction effects. Side-flow pump and deep pumping with small-diameter pump can largely reduce the liquid pressure load, but its reduction effect for the polished rod load is very limited. On the contrary, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> can greatly reduce the polished rod load by decreasing the weight of the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod.</b> Rod load reducer does not change the previous load; instead, it can create an additional reduction force. The potential disadvantages are also discussed. When using a side-flow pump, the resistance on the plunger caused by the liquid pressure would increase. This resistance may cause the <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> to bend when it is moving downwards. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump needs to use very small pump {{in order to get a}} relatively good reduction effect, so its application is limited. These disadvantages should be considered in practical application.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Liquid loading in low production gas wells is a common problem faced in many producing regions around the world. Once gas rates fall below the minimum lift velocity, it is essential that some action be taken to maintain continuous operation of the well. Commonly applied solutions include: 1) reduction in wellhead pressure (compression); 2) reduction of tubing diameter (velocity strings); and 3) installation of artificial lift (plunger lift or <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> <b>pumping).</b> This thesis examines the use of a patented vortex flow modifier to lift liquids from low rate (stripper) gas wells. Vortex Flow LLC has developed a flow modifying tool using the patented EcoVeyor technology developed by EcoTech. This technology has been used successfully for almost a decade to transport solids in the coal and potash industries and is now being adapted to the oil and gas industries. Recent field tests in horizontal production pipelines have shown the ability to alter basic flow characteristics, significantly decreasing backpressure on wells and increasing production. This thesis evaluates this technology for use in the wellbore, where a tool is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} tubing string. Laboratory experiments were conducted using a 125 -ft vertical flow loop of 2 -in diameter clear PVC. In these experiments, the effects of the vortex device on gas and water flow was examined and compared with the behavior in normal pipe flow. An optimized tool was developed that alters the flow patterns in the pipe resulting in improved liquid unloading accompanied by a decrease in the tubing pressure loss by more than 15 percent. The optimized tool also lowered the minimum lift velocity required for liquid unloading. Visual observations at four locations along the test loop confirmed that the liquid phase is transported in an upward helical manner along the pipe wall, providing an improved flow path for the gas phase. Apart from assisting liquid unloading, the flow modifying tool enhances the operational envelope at low gas rates as well as forming smaller slugs during liquid unloading. Therefore the flow modifier can also reduce gas requirements during artificial gas lift and can also serve as a flow stabilizing device...|$|R

30|$|However, {{relatively}} heavy, stiff steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> must be run on {{the bottom}} of the fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> interval, because fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> is weak when loaded in compression. If the fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> is subjected to compression, the rod string body could be crushed beneath the wedges and a pullout failure could occur (Gibbs 1991).|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} {{shows that}} the most complicated failures of pumping unit are the failures of its underground part, especially column of <b>sucker</b> <b>rods.</b> The column of <b>sucker</b> <b>rods</b> pres-ents by itself a long bar, which consists of <b>sucker</b> <b>rods,</b> connected by the couplings and is intended for the transmission of motion from the pumping unit balancing beam to th...|$|R
30|$|Side-flow {{pump can}} largely reduce the liquid {{pressure}} load, but its reduction {{effect for the}} polished rod load is very limited. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump also reduces the liquid pressure load. On the contrary, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> can greatly reduce the polished rod load by decreasing {{the weight of the}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod.</b> Rod load reducer does not change the previous load; instead, it can create an additional reduction force. Among them, fiberglass <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> is the most effective rod load reduction technique.|$|R
30|$|Because using {{fiberglass}} <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> {{does not}} change the structure of the pumping system, we do not need to conduct force analysis as we have done on the former two technologies. We can use the conventional model to calculate the polished rod load; however, {{it should be noted that}} the formulas for calculating the natural frequency and the elastic modulus of the composite <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> are more complex compared with the all steel <b>sucker</b> <b>rod</b> (Li 1991).|$|R
