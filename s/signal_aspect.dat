25|$|The NTSB report {{concluded}} that the MARC crew apparently forgot the approach <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> of the Kensington color-position signal after making a flag stop at Kensington Station. The MARC train was operating in push mode with the cab control car out front. The Amtrak locomotives were in the crossover {{at the time of}} the collision; the MARC cab control car collided with the lead Amtrak unit, F40PH #255, rupturing its fuel tank and igniting the fire that caused most of the casualties. The second unit was a GE Genesis P40DC #811, a newer unit that has a fuel tank that is shielded in the center of the frame. The official investigation also suggests that the accident might have been prevented if a human-factors analysis had been conducted when modifications to the track signaling system were made in 1992 with the closing of nearby QN tower.|$|E

2500|$|Modern-day {{permissive}} signals {{consist of}} two white lights at 45°, normally unlit. When lit, {{with the main}} aspect showing red, they instruct the driver to proceed but be prepared to stop short of any obstruction. When unlit, the driver obeys the main <b>signal</b> <b>aspect.</b> They can therefore function either as calling-on or shunt-ahead signals, depending on their location (the Warning Arrangement [...] in colour-light areas, uses the main aspect {{in a similar fashion}} to approach release junction signalling, in this case it is called a Delayed Yellow [...] ).|$|E

5000|$|But the Automatic block {{signalling}} system tends {{to maintain a}} minimum distance between trains (moving under the green <b>signal</b> <b>aspect).</b> [...] Trains may follow each other more closely if they move into the amber (or yellow) <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> but then they must move at a slower speed. On single track lines between passing sidings, trains can't travel in opposite directions at the same time. If they tried to do this, they would collide head on with each other (if they were headed toward each other). This poses a further restriction in train spacing.|$|E
50|$|Where a <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> {{incorporates}} a flashing lamp, the flashing lamp is always applied to less restrictive signals. This {{is to prevent}} a stuck flashing relay from accidentally upgrading the signal.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>aspects,</b> or meanings, were {{displayed}} as rows of three lit lights. The aspects corresponded with upper-quadrant semaphore signal positions: vertical for [...] "proceed", a 45° angle {{rising to the}} right for [...] "approach", horizontal for [...] "stop", a 45° angle rising to the left for [...] "restriction", a [...] "X" [...] shape for [...] "take siding", and a full circle (used in electrified territory) for [...] "lower pantograph". Additional aspects were conveyed with a second target head below the first, either a single light, a partial target, or a full target. Separate Manual Block <b>signal</b> <b>aspects</b> existed as well.|$|R
25|$|The red {{aspect of}} SN109 was {{particularly}} badly {{obscured by the}} overhead electrification equipment; it was last of all the gantry 8 <b>signal</b> <b>aspects</b> to become clearly visible to the driver of a Class 165 approaching from Paddington.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>{{signaling}}</b> <b>aspect</b> systems found in North America, Speed Signaling and Weak Route Signaling. Speed signaling transmits information regarding how fast the train is permitted to be going in the upcoming segment of track; weak route signaling transmits information related to the route a train will be taking through a junction, and {{it is incumbent upon}} the engineer to govern the train's speed accordingly. Weak Route Signaling is applied with the term [...] "Weak" [...] because some speed <b>signal</b> <b>aspects</b> may be used in the system and also because exact route information is not typically conveyed, only the fact of a diverging or straight route, each having a predictable range of known speeds.|$|R
50|$|The system {{consists}} of coded track circuits and on-board equipment. The coded track circuits transmit {{information about the}} <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> to the on-board equipment via two pick-up coils mounted {{on the front of}} the train, one over each rail.|$|E
50|$|The first railway signals were {{manually}} operated by signal tenders or station agents. When {{to change the}} <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> was often left to the judgement of the operator. Human error or inattentiveness occasionally resulted in improper signalling and train collisions.|$|E
50|$|The TTC subway uses {{conventional}} wayside signals without cab signalling. Thus {{drivers are}} expected to remember each <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> and act accordingly until they receive new information from the following signal. The following description is limited to aspects relevant to the accident.|$|E
50|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of the signal system with emphasis in the following areas: Lunar Whites, removal of signal identification markers, consistent placement of <b>signal</b> <b>aspects,</b> progressive speed control, expansion of IPHC to identify headway and train separation, all trip valves activated and relocation of reset.|$|R
50|$|With {{mechanical}} signalling, the AWS {{system was}} installed only at distant signals but, with multi-aspect signalling, it is fitted at all main line <b>signals.</b> All <b>signal</b> <b>aspects,</b> except green, cause the horn to {{sound and the}} indicator disc to change to yellow on black.|$|R
50|$|At around 400 high-risk locations, TPWS+ is {{installed}} {{with a third}} transmitter further in rear of the signal increasing the effectiveness to 100 mph (160 km/h). When installed in conjunction with signal controls such as 'double blocking' (i.e. two red <b>signal</b> <b>aspects</b> in succession), TPWS can be fully effective at any realistic speed.|$|R
5000|$|The 50 Hz {{carrier signal}} is {{modulated}} with pulsed square wave codes {{according to the}} <b>signal</b> <b>aspect.</b> No code is generated for a red aspect. The system is therefore fail-safe, since loss of code {{will result in a}} red indication on the ADU.|$|E
50|$|Under speed signalling, the <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> {{informs the}} driver at what speed he may proceed, but not {{necessarily}} the route the train will take. Speed signalling requires a far greater range of signal aspects than route signalling, but less dependence is placed on drivers' route knowledge.|$|E
50|$|Individual signal heads may be set {{to flash}} a color to create a {{different}} <b>signal</b> <b>aspect.</b> Signals in the United States typically flash only one head at a time, while signals in Canada may flash two heads at a time; flashing lights are generally less restrictive than steady lights.|$|E

His early research {{focused on the}} function of integrins, cellular receptors for the extracellular matrix, in cell migration and survival. His current work is on <b>signaling</b> <b>aspects</b> of cell invasion by vascular cells and tumor cells, {{with a focus on}} preventing tumor metastasis.|$|R
2500|$|Speech {{processing}} [...] {{study of}} speech signals and the processing methods of these signals. The signals are usually processed {{in a digital}} representation, so speech processing {{can be regarded as}} a special case of digital signal processing, applied to speech <b>signal.</b> <b>Aspects</b> of speech processing includes the acquisition, manipulation, storage, transfer and output of digital speech signals.|$|R
5000|$|Distant-only signal (Pol. tarcza ostrzegawcza {{literally}} meaning warning shield) {{is used on}} lines {{not equipped}} with ABS. Placed in the braking distance, allows the driver to stop before the signal ahead. Its colour language {{is the same as}} <b>signal</b> <b>aspects</b> S2-S5, making them technically a signal which is just incapable of displaying a S1 (stop) aspect.|$|R
50|$|Note: Although {{the green}} light of the old system distant signal used in Helsinki area is named Expect Proceed aspect, the next main signal {{may in fact be}} showing the Proceed 35 aspect. Therefore, the driver has to act as if the <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> is indeed Expect 35.|$|E
50|$|Under speed {{signalling}}, {{the driver}} is not told which route the train will take, but the <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> informs him at what speed he may proceed. Speed signalling requires a far greater range of signal aspects than route signalling, but less dependence is placed on drivers' route knowledge.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{a railway}} {{signalling}} system, a train stop, trip stop or tripcock (sometimes called a tripper) is a train protection device that automatically stops a train if {{it attempts to}} pass a signal when the <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> and operating rules prohibit such movement, or (in some applications) if it attempts to pass at an excessive speed.|$|E
50|$|For example, in Denmark and Sweden the {{meanings}} of single green and double green are contradictory. Drivers {{have to know the}} difference (already with traditional systems) to drive beyond the national borders safely. In Sweden, the ETCS Level 1 list of <b>signal</b> <b>aspects</b> are not fully included in the traditional list, so there is a special marking saying that such signals have slightly different meanings.|$|R
5000|$|Cab Signaling Signals - Where cab {{signaling}} {{is employed}} without fixed trackside automatic <b>signals,</b> special <b>signal</b> <b>aspects</b> are required at absolute signals. These include {{some sort of}} absolute block [...] "Super Clear" [...] signal that allows passage to the next interlocking with a fixed signal and also the [...] "Cab Speed" [...] signal that informs the engineer to proceed under direction of cab signals.|$|R
30|$|Studies {{dealing with}} <b>signaling</b> <b>aspects</b> of {{networks}} are mostly based on bond-based explanations since network ties {{are considered to}} provide clues to audiences in order to signal quality of an actor. However, these studies may neglect the flow perspective that characterizes relationships by asymmetric ties since actors differ in terms of network position and centrality. Hence, better-embedded actors may use network relationships {{in order to get}} access to re-sources and capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Sistema di Controllo della Marcia del Treno (SCMT) is a {{discontinuous}} train Cab {{signalling system}} used in Italy. It shares many features with the Ripetizione Segnali (RS) system, {{the two systems}} co-existing and working together. The main purpose of SCMT is to control {{the respect of the}} speed limit imposed by the <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> and the line condition.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 {{the second}} signal {{did not provide}} any {{confirmation}} that {{it was about to}} change and the operator was expected to remember the previous <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> correctly. With the tolerant attitudes of management, it had become common practice for operators to travel at the fastest speed that the system allowed, passing the signals at the same instant they were clearing.|$|E
50|$|An {{advantage}} of this design over the standard distant signal of the Reichsbahn was that it displayed a clearly visible <b>signal</b> <b>aspect</b> in each position. As a result, it did not need a distant signal board (Vorsignaltafel). This was hesitantly retrofitted by the Reichsbahn from 1936. After the Second World War, however, distant signals without signal boards could still be found in Bavaria.|$|E
50|$|Speech {{processing}} is {{the study}} of speech signals and the processing methods of these signals. The signals are usually processed in a digital representation, so speech processing can be regarded as a special case of digital signal processing, applied to speech <b>signal.</b> <b>Aspects</b> of speech processing includes the acquisition, manipulation, storage, transfer and output of speech signals. The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.|$|R
50|$|GEO devices, Unipolar I/O, and SEAR2s collect {{information}} about the crossing and surrounding region, either by monitoring voltages on wires or by passing messages among themselves. Logic software massages the real-world information and decides what <b>signal</b> <b>aspects</b> to show locomotives and decides what information to indicate to crossing predictors which assist the predictors in determining whether crossing gate arms should be lowered or raised, lights flashed, and bells rung.|$|R
