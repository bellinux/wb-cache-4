One of the {{effective}} {{forms of energy}} saving and rational using of heat during the burning of organic fuels, as well as {{protection of the environment}} against thermal pollution, is the recovery of living heat of industrial furnaces, steam and <b>heat</b> <b>water</b> <b>boilers.</b> To directly increase the thermal efficiency of equipment it is possible to use the living heat to heat the air going into burning. For this purpose {{the effective}} heat exchangers "gas- gas " type can be used. Such heat exchangers are the air heaters on the basis of fining thermo-siphons (TS). We propose to use the bimetallic tubes to approach to the high thermal parameters of thermo-siphons. The internal tube working under high pressure is made of steel. The external aluminum tube of thermo-siphons has the spiral fins of aluminum. This aluminum tube has dense mechanical contact to steel internal tube. Working medium in thermo-siphon is distilled and decontaminated water. Long-live test (10 thousand hours) of the steel thermo-siphons with water as a working medium were executed.

40|$|Fossil {{fuel fired}} utility boilers fire {{a range of}} fuels under {{variable}} operation conditions. This variability in fuel diet and load conditions is linked to various problems in boiler performances, particularly the flame quality which is closely associated with furnace safety, combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions. Reliable flame monitoring is thus critical as the flame can fluctuate significantly in terms of size, shape, location, colour and temperature distribution. For instance, <b>heat</b> recovery <b>water</b> tube <b>boilers</b> are commonly used in industry to recover the energy in the exhaust gas from gas turbines. The boiler is fitted with multiple burners which allow flexibility with tuning of the boiler firing rates depending on process steam demand. It was reported that flame properties in such boilers had {{a direct impact on}} the flame stability and pollutant emissions (i. e., NOx and CO). There is, however, no technique available for online monitoring and quantifying the flame properties of individual burners. This has resulted in a lack of understanding in how each burner operates with regard to the overall performance of the boiler, particularly the emissions. Under the support of the BF 2 RA and EPSRC, an imaging and spectrometry based instrumentation system is being developed for flame monitoring and emission. Fig 1 shows the block diagram of the system. An optical probe, protected by the air-cooled jacket, transmits the light of flame to the camera house. The light of flame is then split into two beams. The first beam is captured by a camera to provide images for determining the physical parameters of the flame. The second beam is received by a miniature spectrometer for flame spectral analysis. Intelligent computing algorithms are developed for flame monitoring and emission prediction.
