25|$|Huddersfield is a {{manufacturing}} town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced woollen textiles. This area of business, {{along with the}} chemical and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was {{the basis of the}} town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of woollen products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making alternating current electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just £300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of £4,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley. Other local manufacturers are Cummins Turbo Technologies, founded in 1952 as Holset by Messrs. Holmes and Croset. (turbochargers), David Brown Gear systems (industrial gearing), Huddersfield Fine Worsteds (textiles), Taylor & Lodge (textiles), C & J Antich (textiles), Syngenta AG (agro-chemicals), Pennine Radio Limited (electronics transformers and <b>sheet</b> <b>metalworking)</b> and a large number of niche manufacturers, such as Dual Seal Glass (maker of spandrel glass panels) and Ellis Furniture (producer of kitchen and bathroom furniture). Huddersfield is home to Andrew Jones Pies, a regional award-winning pie-maker, where a worker was killed in a gas explosion on 10 April 2009. and Mamas and Papas – a manufacturer and retailer of prams, pushchairs and related items.|$|E
40|$|Machine {{vibrations}} in {{sheet metal}} blanking represent a critical problem for geometrical accuracy of products {{as well as}} for service life of machines. Conventional mechanical and hydraulic dampers require additional machine power and higher loads, which make critical their use in many applications. This paper presents an innovative system, based on magneto-rheological fluids, for the vibrations damping in <b>sheet</b> <b>metalworking</b> operations. The developed prototypes prove to decrease the vibrations generated in sheet metal blanking with significant reduction of the energy dissipated during the process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceManufacturing {{is using}} Virtual Reality tools {{to enhance the}} product life cycle. Their {{definitions}} are still in flux and {{it is necessary to}} define their connections. Thus, firstly, we will introduce more closely some definitions where we will find that, if the Virtual manufacturing concepts originate from machining operations and evolve in this manufacturing area, there exist a lot of applications in different fields such as casting, forging, <b>sheet</b> <b>metalworking</b> and robotics (mechanisms). From the recent projects in Europe or in USA, we notice that the human perception or the simulation of mannequin is more and more needed in both fields. In this context, we have isolated some applications as ergonomic studies, assembly and maintenance simulation, design or training where the virtual reality tools can be applied. Thus, we find out a family of applications where the virtual reality tools give the engineers the main role in the optimization process. We will illustrate our paper by several examples where virtual reality interfaces are used and combined with optimization tools as multi-agent systems...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. For Industrial Design {{undergraduate}} students {{an awareness of}} manufacturing capabilities and costs is important in designing for and selecting production processes. It {{is often difficult to}} include accurate cost information and set problems in a realistic context. To overcome this the Boothroyd and Dewhurst Design for Manufacture Toolkit has been used to support teaching in a Level 2 Design for Manufacture module. This is a suite of cost estimating software that incorporates an extensive database of materials, machines and processing information. The paper outlines two tasks, using the <b>sheet</b> <b>metalworking</b> and the injection moulding modules of the software, that enable students to gain an understanding of the various factors involved in manufacturing costs. After analysing a part, a full breakdown of costs for material, tooling and processing of the part can be obtained. Students can then change particular parameters and note the effects on the cost. The introduction of the software has helped students to gain a better appreciation of how their design decisions on the form influence the making of a part and the manufacturing costs. Use of the software is to be extended to Level 3 and postgraduate teaching...|$|E
