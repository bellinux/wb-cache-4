Peers were worried that the focus on adoption could break up families unnecessarily.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} for the caller to be aware of their location when phoning for the emergency services; the caller's location will not be passed onto the emergency services immediately, and finding the location requires a combination of efforts from both parties.

The latter can be immediately traced to a grid reference according to the transmitter being used, however this is only accurate to a certain wide area — for more specific traces <b>senior</b> <b>authority</b> must be acquired and an expensive operation can be conducted to trace the mobile phone to within a few metres. A number of smartphone apps can now be downloaded that assist with caller location by using the smartphone's satellite navigation features.|$|E

50|$|Mr Starling {{appeared}} {{only once}} during Series One, and his initial, E., was shown underneath {{the name of}} the school in the first episode: the authority figure most regularly seen during this time was the Head of First Year, Mrs Monroe (Dorothea Philips). Mr Llewellyn did not appear on screen during the 1980 series: the day-to-day running of the school was left to the highly competent but much put-upon deputy head Mr Keating (Robert Hartley), who was also deputy head under Mrs McClusky until 1984. Similarly, Mr McNab was never seen at all during the mid-1990s; the most <b>senior</b> <b>authority</b> figure being Mr Robson who at this point was deputy head. Mr Robson himself did not appear on screen during Series 27, even though he was still headmaster for {{the early part of the}} series. Mrs McClusky, perhaps Grange Hill's best known head teacher, was demoted to deputy head temporarily in 1985 having had to reapply, unsuccessfully, for her post following the merger of Grange Hill with Brookdale and Rodney Bennett. When the new head, Mr Humphries, was killed in a road accident the following year, Mrs McClusky was again acting head and her permanent headship was later confirmed.|$|E
5000|$|Complementarians hold to a {{hierarchical}} structure between husband and wife. They believe {{men and women}} have different gender-specific roles that allow each to complement the other, hence the designation [...] "Complementarians". The Complementarian view of marriage holds that while the husband and wife are of equal worth before God, husbands and wives are given different functions and responsibilities by God that are based on gender, and that male leadership is biblically ordained so that the husband is always the <b>senior</b> <b>authority</b> figure. They state they [...] "observe with deep concern" [...] "accompanying distortions or neglect of the glad harmony portrayed in Scripture between the intelligent, humble leadership of redeemed husbands and the loving, willing support of that leadership by redeemed wives". They believe [...] "the Bible presents a clear chain of authority—above all authority and power is God; God is the head of Christ. Then in descending order, Christ is the head of man, man is the head of woman, and parents are the head of their children." [...] Complementarians teach that God intended men to lead their wives as [...] "heads" [...] of the family. Wayne Grudem, in an article that interprets the [...] "mutual submission" [...] of [...] as being hierarchical, writes that it means [...] "being considerate of one another, and caring for one another’s needs, and being thoughtful of one another, and sacrificing for one another." ...|$|E

All he needed was medical and scientific testing and approval from any source.
