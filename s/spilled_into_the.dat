Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Arkansas River.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{began with}} a {{flagrant}} foul by Knicks guard Mardy Collins on Nuggets guard J. R. Smith in the closing seconds of the game.

All ten players on the floor at the time were ejected after the altercation was finished. When suspensions were announced, seven players were suspended without pay for a combined total of 47 games.|$|E

5|$|On March 17, Campbell {{appeared}} at the Montreal Forum for the Canadiens' first game after Richard's suspension. His presence provoked a riot at the Forum that <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> streets. The riot caused an estimated $100,000 in property damage, thirty-seven injuries, and 100 arrests. Tensions eased after Richard made a personal plea accepting his punishment and promising to return the following year to help the team win the Stanley Cup. The incident likely cost Richard the 1954–55 scoring title (an honour Richard never achieved in his NHL career) and {{played a role in}} the off-season departure of longtime Canadiens head coach Dick Irvin.|$|E
5|$|As Saomai {{approached}} South Korea, the typhoon {{forced the}} cancellation of flights beginning on September12. Four airports had their air service suspended. Other suspensions of transportation included the refuge of 362fishing boats in ports and the closure of 10national parks and 43mountain paths. As a result, about 16,600campers and hikers were evacuated to safer areas. As {{a result of the}} inclement weather, the operation of 149passenger ships were cancelled. On September13, the Korea Meteorological Administration(KMA) issued a typhoon warning for waters south of South Korea and Jeju Province. The administration anticipated heavy rainfall, though not as much as what had taken place in Japan. Offshore, an Indonesian freighter with 39crewmen became stranded by the typhoon in waters south of Pusan. The crew were rescued by maritime police, but 270tons of oil <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean from a broken oil container.|$|E
5|$|Periods of rain {{impacted}} the British Isles {{early in}} the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day, with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain. Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland. Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours. Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing temperature readings. Wind and waves associated with this storm were too much for the tanker MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500tons of light crude oil <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean surrounding the islands. The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks.|$|E

Much of the marshy country was waterlogged {{during and after the}} storm. Widespread rains of – affected the Glades region of Palm Beach County. Vegetable beds were flooded in up to several feet of water, while rural canals overflowed their banks and <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Everglades. After the storm, heavy rains caused one 150-ft-long (45.7-m) section of the Herbert Hoover Dike to collapse near Canal Point, leaving 700 cattle stranded and 1,800 planted acres submerged. Floodwaters submerged Conners Highway in 30 locations and swept across a 3,000-ft (914.6-m) section, combining with debris to obstruct motorists.|$|E
25|$|While Hall {{was very}} {{conservative}} even by Texas Democratic standards, his conservatism {{can be attributed}} to the demographics of the 4th District. It had once been reliably Democratic, but became increasingly friendly to Republicans as Dallas' suburban growth <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> western portion of the district. The 4th has not supported the Democratic nominee for president since 1964. Despite this district's increasingly Republican tilt, Hall won 10 more terms as a member of the Democratic Party with an average of 60% of the vote. In 1994, for instance, he was re-elected by a 19-point margin, even as other conservative Democratic congressmen lost their seats. By the 1990s, he was the only elected Democratic official above the county level in much of the district. It was taken for granted that he would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired.|$|E

They capitalised on these hard fought wins to take five victories from their six-round robin matches. They then defeated Pakistan by 18 runs after inducing a late collapse in the semifinal, and then claimed the title by seven runs with a similar late surge over England in the final. The success <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Test arena, with the 1987–88 home season yielding saw Australia's first Test series victory for four years, with a 1–0 series victory over New Zealand.

25|$|A 183m (600ft) {{cargo ship}} called the MV Pacific Adventurer was {{carrying}} 60 containers of ammonium nitrate when it encountered rough seas produced by Hamish, while located about 13km (8mi) east of Cape Moreton. The incident occurred near to a marine animal park, which {{is home to}} endangered species. Around 3:15a.m. EST on 11 March, 31 of the containers <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea along with {{a large amount of}} heavy fuel, causing {{the surface of the water}} to become slick. Officials attempted to contain the oil spill, but the rough seas prevented easy containment. Environmentalist warned that the oil could have a significant impact on the local wildlife. One of the containers damaged the hull as it fell off the ship. After divers inspected the ship for the source of the spill, two holes were found. One, located just above the waterline, was 10mm (0.4in) long 15mm (0.6in) wide. The second and larger hole was located underneath the ship. The length of it was about 1m (1.3ft) and the width was 300mm (11.8in).|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} {{established}} downtowns, Ossining had been {{adversely affected by}} {{the growth of the}} automobile in the later 20th century. Local shoppers began taking advantage of improved roads to patronize stores in both enclosed shopping malls and strip malls along major highways like Route 9 outside the village's traditional center. The village used its urban renewal grants to demolish the old buildings along the south side of Main Street that year in an attempt to revitalize downtown. Its comprehensive plan drafted but never adopted two years earlier called for mixed-use development, projects to replace them. But they were never funded or undertaken, and the spaces were largely used as parking. It was the first of many plans that remained largely unrealized, as Ossining went through 15 different mayoral administrations in the remaining years of the 20th century. During the 1968–74 period downtown was also the site of several race riots that began at the high school and <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> streets. The community responded by redistricting its schools to ensure earlier racial integration.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspected}} {{source for}} the epidemic was the Artibonite River, from {{which most of the}} affected people had drunk water. Suspicion among Haitians centered on a UN military base on a tributary of that river home to peacekeepers from Nepal. MINUSTAH officials issued a press statement denying the possibility that the base could have caused the epidemic, citing stringent sanitation standards. The next day, 27 October, reporter Jonathan M. Katz of the Associated Press visited the base and found gross inconsistencies between the statement and the base's actual conditions. Katz also happened upon UN military police taking samples of ground water to test for cholera, despite UN assertions that it was not concerned about a possible link between its soldiers and the disease. Neighbors told the reporter that waste from the base often <b>spilled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river. Later that day, a crew from Al Jazeera English including reporter Sebastian Walker filmed the soldiers trying to excavate a leaking pipe; the video was posted online the next day and, citing AP's report, drew increased awareness to the base. MINUSTAH spokesmen later contended that the samples taken from the base proved negative for cholera. However, an AP investigation showed that the tests were improperly done at a laboratory in the Dominican Republic with no experience of testing for cholera.|$|E
