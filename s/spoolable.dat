40|$|<b>Spoolable</b> {{reinforced}} plastic line pipe will be {{widely used in}} the exploitation of acid gas and oil wells. End-fitting is a mechanical device that forms {{the transition from the}} <b>spoolable</b> {{reinforced plastic}} line pipe to the connector. It was well known that nickel was an important element in the end-fitting. In this paper, a novel spectrophotometric method was described for determination of nickel in the end-fitting of <b>spoolable</b> reinforced plastic line pipe. The method was based on the color reaction between nickel and dimethylglyoxime, which was favored in an alkaline medium, producing a red compound in the presence of ammonium persulfate as an oxidant. Under the optimum reaction conditions the absorption value was proportional to the concentration of nickel in the range of 0. 080 ~ 0. 50 % (R 2 = 0. 9999), and the relative standard deviation was less than 3. 0 % (n= 5). The proposed method was applied successfully to determine nickel in end-fitting of <b>spoolable</b> reinforced plastic line pipe...|$|E
40|$|In {{oilfield}} <b>spoolable</b> tubing applications, polymer {{composite materials}} offer advantages over traditional tubing materials {{in terms of}} reduced weight and improved fatigue life. The many different loading scenarios that <b>spoolable</b> tubing is designed to withstand include bending strain, axial force, internal and external pressure, elevated temperature, and combinations of these loads. For the most part, these loads can be treated as axisymmetric {{with the exception of}} the bending strains. The bending strains are induced when wrapping the tubing around a large diameter spool, hence the terminology <b>spoolable</b> tubing. Design trade-offs occur because of the multitude of load cases and resulting multi-axial stress states promoting the need for efficient and accurate design tools. Solutions based on classical laminated shell theory are accurate for thin-wall cylinders but solutions for the three-dimensional stresses in thick-wall cylinders are needed for the typical tube diameters and wall thicknesses being considered for <b>spoolable</b> tubing. A closed-form solution is presented for determining the layer-by-layer stresses, strains, displacements, and first-ply failure in thick laminated composite cylinders subjected to axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric loads. The formulation is based on the theory of anisotropic elasticity and a state of generalized plane deformation along the axis of the cylinder. Parametric design trade studies can be easily and quickly computed using this closed-form solution, and a computer program that was developed for performing the numerical calculations is described...|$|E
40|$|The {{offshore}} oil industry is constantly seeking {{new and more}} cost efficient solutions to every aspect of their operations. In the later years, use of polymeric composite materials has proven to reduce cost and enhance reliability in several areas of oil operations. Several independent efforts, notably in Europe and in the US have targeted development of both <b>spoolable</b> and segmented fibre reinforced polymer pipe systems. These composite pipe systems have been designed for high internal pressure applications, with additional loads being both static and dynamic. In this research, the short-term, high strain, cyclic bending fatigue of <b>spoolable</b> glass-fibre reinforced epoxy pipes designed for high-pressure static chemical injection line service (SSI) was investigated. Bending and torsion fatigue loading may occur during pipe laying operations. Bending (static and fatigue) of composite pipe was simulated experimentally using a self-designed four-point bending jig on a 25 metric ton MTS hydraulic testing machine. Comparisons between experimental results, simple analytical and numerical static solutions were executed. Numerical solutions for static analysis were found using I-DEAS Master Series 5. 0 finite element analysis software. The research effort also attempted to utilise a finite element software developed at McGill University to predict fatigue behaviour of the composite pipe. Findings in this research effort assist understanding of short-term, high strain, fatigue behaviour of <b>spoolable</b> composite pipes designed for static high pressure operations, as well as indicate {{the validity of the}} finite-element analysis efforts executed in this research...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{thick-walled}} composite cylinders in structural applications {{has seen}} tremendous {{growth over the}} last decade. Applications include pressure vessels, flywheels, drive shafts, <b>spoolable</b> tubing, and production risers. In these applications, the geometry of a composite cylinder is axisymmetric {{but in many cases}} the applied loads are non-axisymmetric and more rigorous analytical tools are required for an accurate stress analysis. A closed-form solution is presented for determining the layer-by-layer stresses, strains, and displacements and first-ply failure in laminated composite cylinders subjected to non-axisymmetric loads. The applied loads include internal and external pressure, axial force, torque, axial bending moment, uniform temperature change, rotational velocity, and interference fits. The formulation is based on the theory of anisotropic elasticity and a state of generalized plane deformation along the axis of the composite cylinder. Parametric design trade studies can be easily and quickly computed using this closed-form solution. A computer program that was developed for performing the numerical calculations is described and results from specific case studies are presented...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the overall}} project is to {{successfully}} adapt <b>spoolable</b> FRP currently used {{in the oil industry}} for use in hydrogen pipelines. The use of FRP materials for hydrogen service will rely on the demonstrated compatibility of these materials for pipeline service environments and operating conditions. The ability of the polymer piping to withstand degradation while in service, and development of the tools and data required for life management are imperative for successful implementation of these materials for hydrogen pipeline. The information and data provided in this report provides the technical basis for the codification for fiber reinforced piping (FRP) for hydrogen service. The DOE has invested in the evaluation of FRP for the delivery for gaseous hydrogen to support the development of a hydrogen infrastructure. The codification plan calls for detailed investigation of the following areas: System design and applicable codes and standards; Service degradation of FRP; Flaw tolerance and flaw detection; Integrity management plan; Leak detection and operational controls evaluation; Repair evaluation. The FRP codification process started with commercially available products that had extensive use in the oil and gas industry. These products have been evaluated to assure that sufficient structural integrity is available for a gaseous hydrogen environment...|$|E
40|$|Coiled tubing in {{combination}} with a downhole electric drilling motor has many advantages. The rotation speed of the drill bit can be precisely controlled. The electric conductors trans-mit downhole data with high speed and allow logging while drilling. One task within the PDT-COIL project was the integration of electric conductors into {{the wall of a}} <b>spoolable</b> fatigue resistant thermoplastic composite tube for electric drilling appli-cations. Up to now no fatigue resistant electric conductor solution has been available to withstand the excessive axial elongation and compression induced by spooling operations. Based on theoretical models and experimental verifications, a new type of highly elastic elec-trical conductor has been developed. A prototype has been industrially produced having 2 kV rated voltage and 20 A continuous current. This cable with a cross section of < 30 mm 2 is able to transfer over 40 kW of electric power and withstands high axial deformations. The main concept is based on synchronous radial contraction of all conductor elements when subjected to axial elongation and bending. Comparative experiments on conventional solid conductors revealed a very high degree of radial flexibility and high tensile capability of the new concept. Survival with up to 40 % elastic tensile strain has been achieved compared to 0. 1 % of conventional annealed copper. The hyperelastic conductor may function as component for energy transmission and also for powering sensors as well as actuators in intelligent composite material systems. Due to its unique axial elasticity, the complete structure can be exposed to high mechanical stress without damaging the embedded electric system...|$|E
