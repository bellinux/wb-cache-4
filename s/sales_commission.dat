500|$|A second {{consequence}} of collapsing wheat prices was the threat they posed to the Alberta Wheat Pool (AWP). [...] Falling {{prices and the}} attendant tightened credit conditions led the Pool, along with its counterparts in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, to seek help from its provincial government in 1930. [...] Brownlee guaranteed loans to the Pool, but told the legislature {{that he did not}} expect this guarantee to prove necessary, since the large portions of the 1929 crop already sold at higher prices would provide sufficient cushioning unless wheat prices fell [...] "to a level never reached on Canadian markets". [...] In October 1930, with the Pool receiving a price for its wheat well below the $1.00 per bushel that it guaranteed its farmers, the banks refused to loan more money unless the Pool appointed to its Central Selling Agency (CSA) a general manager acceptable to the banks. [...] Brownlee and Premiers John Bracken of Manitoba and James Thomas Milton Anderson of Saskatchewan met in Ottawa with acting Prime Minister Sir George Perley, seeking direct federal aid to the Pools. [...] The premiers' pleas rejected, CSA President Alexander James McPhail offered the banks the names of two possible general managers. [...] The first was John McFarland, former president of the Alberta Pacific Grain Company. [...] The second was Brownlee. [...] The banks chose McFarland. [...] Brownlee too imposed conditions on the AWP as a condition of provincial assistance: he wanted the provincial government to be consulted on all AWP managerial decisions and given the right to veto capital expenditures, and he required it to increase its <b>sales</b> <b>commission</b> from three quarters of a cent per bushel to one cent. [...] While these conditions met with resistance from farmer leaders who believed that they would transform the AWP from a farmers' organization to a grain company like any other, Brownlee was supported by UFA President Henry Wise Wood, the AWP was reliant on provincial support, and the conditions were accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Cooke's own {{firm was}} so {{successful}} in distributing Treasury notes that Chase engaged him as special agent to sell the $500 million in [...] "five-twenty" [...] bonds — callable in five years and matured in 20 years — authorized by Congress on February 25, 1862. The Treasury had previously {{tried and failed to}} sell these bonds. Promised a <b>sales</b> <b>commission</b> of 0.5 percent of the revenue from the first $10 million, and 0.375 percent of subsequent bonds, Cooke financed a nationwide sales campaign, appointing about 2,500 sub-agents who traveled through every northern and western state and territory, as well as the Southern states as they came under control of the Union Army. Meanwhile, Cooke secured the support of most Northern newspapers, purchasing ads through advertising agencies, and often working directly with editors on lengthy articles about the virtues of buying government bonds. These efforts heralded a particular type of patriotism based on classical liberalist notions of self-interest. His editorials, articles, handbills, circulars, and signs most often appealed to Americans' desire to turn a profit, while simultaneously aiding the war effort. Cooke quickly sold the $500 million in bonds, and $11 million more. Congress immediately sanctioned the excess.|$|E
2500|$|Candidate Reviews: Claire {{was accused}} of being too talkative but {{otherwise}} got the best reports from the interviewers, with Karren even offering to employ her if Sir Alan did not. Lee {{was considered to be}} a good all-round candidate, but got caught off-guard when asked to do a humorous impression by Paul, which backfired when he was told this demonstrated he did not seem to take the interview seriously, while he was also reprimanded for exaggerating on his CV, lying about his length of time at university. Helene was also considered to have a good set of skills, but faced criticism for not having demonstrated any progression in work outside of her current company, and {{was accused of}} having a poor attitude after she repeatedly made insulting remarks about the other candidates. Alex continuously came under fire, with his CV being highlighted as boring; while he argued that this was because he was only 24 years old, both Karen and Paul insisted that this was not an excuse, stating that they had achieved more than him by his age. However, he did earn some praise for his accomplishments as a salesman, particularly {{the fact that he had}} managed to earn a living purely from <b>sales</b> <b>commission.</b> Lucinda got the worst reports, as she was praised for being intelligent and an excellent team leader, but heavily criticised for being a [...] "handful", with the interviewers questioning her motives for wanting the job, and feeling that her teamwork skills were weak.|$|E

40|$|In certain industries, {{sales agent}} {{contracts}} include provisions for <b>sales</b> <b>commissions</b> and clawbacks of commissions if clients are not retained. We show that contracts with these features arise in environments having up-front selling costs recouped from ongoing sales; heterogeneous customers; limited agent {{access to capital}} markets; and imperfect commitment to long-term contracts. We test the model using information on insurance sales agent contracts from New Zealand prior to and after bank entry into insurance sales. The evidence indicates that banks cream-skimmed customers. We predict that this should reduce the values of <b>sales</b> <b>commissions</b> and clawbacks. The data support this prediction. ...|$|R

50|$|Timeshares are {{generally}} treated as real property {{and can be}} resold to another party. However, timeshares do not appreciate in value, and therefore {{should not be considered}} a money-making investment. Additionally, as much as 50% or more (modest estimate) of the original purchase price of a timeshare from a developer or resort went towards marketing costs, <b>sales</b> <b>commission,</b> and other fees, which realistically can never be recouped by the owner. Most timeshares resell for a nominal price as low as $1, so the new owner only takes responsibility of maintenance and other recurring fees. Resale price can be considered a market price of the timeshare.|$|E

[...] Many thought that the RT was part of IBM's Personal Computer line of computers. This confusion started with its initial name, [...] "IBM RT PC". Initially, it seemed that even IBM {{thought that it was}} a high end Personal Computer given the initially stunning lack of support that it received from IBM. This could be explained by the <b>sales</b> <b>commission</b> structure the IBM gave the system: salesmen received commissions similar to those for the sale of a PC: not much. With typically configured models priced at $20,000, it was a hard sell, and so the lack of any reasonable commission resulted in a loss of interest by the IBM sales force.|$|E
