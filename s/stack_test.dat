The report highlights and documents technical progress and milestone status in tasks related to advanced cell and stack component materials development and computational design and simulation. Technical highlights related to cell and stack materials development and characterization include: • Surface modified, Ce-modified MC spinel-coated AISI 441 exhibited improved spallation resistance (compared to coated mill reference 441) after 30, 000 hours of oxidation at 800 ºC in air. Similar beneficial results from surface modification were observed after 26, 000 hours of oxidation at 850 ºC. • MnCo spinel coatings prepared from metallic powder precursors exhibited low area-specific resistance after 12, 000 hours of testing at 800 °C. • Long-term validation tests (6, 000 hours of operation followed by 10 deep thermal cycles) of surface-blasted, spinel-coated AISI 441 interconnects were completed using PNNL’s SECA CTP <b>stack</b> <b>test</b> fixture. Results of post-test results will be reported in the next quarterly progress report. • Long-term evaluation of compliant glass seals (SCN- 1 glass with YSZ fibers) was in progress using PNNL’s SECA CTP <b>stack</b> <b>test</b> fixture. • Baseline testing of LSCF-based cells from Fuel Cell Materials was performed in PNNL’s SECA CTP <b>stack</b> <b>test</b> fixture. Overall performance {{was similar to that}} previously obtained with similar cells from H. C.

Technical highlights in the computational modeling area include: • A method to interface the 3 D SOFC-MP modeling tool with commercial FEA codes ABAQUS and ANSYS was developed to facilitate model construction and output of the predicted temperature field for structural stress analyses of stacks. • The error estimation and verification tools of the reduced order modeling (ROM) framework was improved to facilitate error handling for a large number of cases and perform user-specified test cases for error analysis of the generated ROM. • Mechanical behavior and damage characteristics of the compliant glass seal was investigated for a large planar cell design under different realistic electrochemical operating conditions (as predicted using SOFC-MP 3 D) and thermal cycling events. • The methodology for lifetime prediction of the interconnect was improved to include the mechanical influence of the spinel protection coating on the prediction of critical scale thickness. 3 • Experimental characterization of the crack healing rate was performed for compliant glass SCN- 1 with various amounts of fiber reinforcement.

40|$|Abstract—Finite state {{machines}} and pushdown systems are frequently used in model based testing. In such testing, the system under test is abstractly modeled as a {{finite state machine}} having a finite set of states and a labeled transition relation between the states. A pushdown system, additionally, has an unbounded <b>stack.</b> <b>Test</b> inputs are then generated by enumerating a set of sequences of transitions labels from the model. There {{has been a lot}} of research that focussed on generation of test input sequences satisfying various coverage criteria. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating a set of test input sequences that satisfy certain coverage criteria— cover all transition labels or cover all length-n transition label sequences at least once—while minimizing the sum of the length of the sequences in the set. We show that these optimal test input generation problems can be reduced to integer linear programming (ILP) problems. We also prove that our optimal test input generation problems are NP-Complete.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{operation of}} solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) imposes high {{demands on the}} similarity of the thermal expansion coefficients of the materials used. This is not only due to thermo-mechanical factors {{but also because of}} the risk of contact loss via the formation of a micro-gap between the electrodes and adjacent contact layers caused by temperature changes. The origin of the formation of such a gap between the different layers in an SOFC stack is investigated on the basis of various material combinations. A comparison with successful and failed <b>stack</b> <b>test</b> results reveals that there is a high probability of contact problems if the calculated gap on the cathode side exceeds 200 nm. This limit relates to the maximum possible elastic deformation of the combination of the cathode and cathode contact layer (CCL).

By carefully selecting the raw materials for all three layers, {{it is possible to}} manufacture near-net-shape half-cells.

40|$|Advanced {{characterization}} {{methods have been}} used to analyze the thermo-mechanical behaviour of solid oxide fuel cells in a model stack. The primarily experimental work included contacting studies, sealing of a model stack, thermal and re-oxidation cycling. Also an attempt was made to correlate cell fracture in the stack with pore sizes determined from computer tomography. The contacting studies were carried out using pressure sensitive foils. The load to achieve full contact on anode and cathode side of the cell was assessed and applied in the subsequent model <b>stack</b> <b>test.</b> The stack experiment permitted a detailed analysis of stack compaction during sealing. During steady state operation thermal and re-oxidation cycling the changes in open cell voltage and acoustic emissions were monitored. Significant softening of the sealant material was observed at low temperatures. Heating in the thermal cycling loop of the stack appeared to be less critical than the cooling. Re-oxidation cycling led to significant damage if a critical re-oxidation time was exceeded. Microstructural studies permitted further insight into the re-oxidation mechanism. Finally, the maximum defect size in the cell was determined by computer tomography. A limit of maximum anode stress was estimated and the result correlated this with the failure strength observed during the model stack testing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The study focused on five possible defects: bent neck, pushed up base, creased side wall, pushed in bumper, and creased label panel.
