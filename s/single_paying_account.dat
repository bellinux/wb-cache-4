The existence of a firm’s negative working capital is confirmed to influence strongly the reduction of the trade credit obtained from suppliers in Western Europe countries in parallel with a joint contribution of short and long term bank financing as a substitute from trade debt. Firm characteristics related to negative working capital and fixed assets level, jointly or alone, give more importance to the role of short term bank financing on substituting or reducing the volume of trade credit obtained from suppliers. Negative working capital reinforces the role of long term bank financing. It seems to induce the presence of a corporate cost reduction strategy to preserve or increment the firm’s market reputation and competition. The firm’s return on assets implies an enlargement of the days to <b>pay</b> <b>accounts</b> payable in line with a rising creditworthiness.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Army could not readily identify the population of Army military payroll accounts given its existing procedures and systems. The Army and DFAS-IN {{did not have an}} effective, repeatable process for identifying the population of active duty payroll records. For example, it took 3 months and repeated attempts before DFAS-IN could provide a population of service members who received active duty Army military pay in fiscal year 2010. Further, because the Army does not have an integrated military personnel and payroll system, it was necessary to compare the payroll file to active Army personnel records. However, the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), DODs central repository for information on DOD-affiliated personnel, did not have an effective process for comparing military <b>pay</b> <b>account</b> files with military personnel files to identify a valid population of military payroll transactions. It took DMDC over 2 months and labor-intensive research to compare and reconcile the total number of fiscal year 2010 active duty payroll accounts to its database of personnel files. DODs Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance states that identifying the population of transactions is a key task essential to achieving audit readiness. Without effective processes for identifying the population of Army military pay records and comparing military <b>pay</b> <b>accounts</b> to personnel records, the Army will have difficulty meeting DODs 2014 audit readiness goal for the Statement of Budgetary Resources. ...|$|R
