40|$|Abstract: Miniaturization and {{integration}} of chemical devices into modules that are dimensionally comparable with electronic chips (Lab on Chip) is nowadays developing worldwide. The aim of our work was to suggest and optimize the best conditions for fabrication of TFT sensor due to its sensitivity and low experimental deviations. New electrochemical analytical device was developed to ensure certain known mass transport to electrodes, {{which is the most}} limiting process that influencing the response quality of the sensor. The device consists from rotating conic vessel for measured sample and <b>stick-in</b> thick-film sensor. The sensors responses were tested under trace analysis of cadmium. Measurements were done also with the others electrochemical arrangements to compare with the new one. The sensor output current response dependence on the liquid velocity and geometrical arrangement within using standard electrochemical couple of potassium ferrocyanide-ferricyanide is presented. We found out that the new device with controlled flow of electrolyte to sensor worked properly and gave satisfactory results...|$|E
