40|$|We {{develop a}} GMM {{estimator}} for stationary heavy tailed data by trimming an asymptotically vanishing <b>sample</b> <b>portion</b> of the estimating equations. Trimming ensures the estimator is asymptotically normal, and self-normalization implies {{we do not}} need to know the rate of convergence. Tail-trimming, however, ensures asymmetric models are covered under rudimentary assumptions about the thresholds, and it implies possibly heterogeneous convergence rates below, at or above √ T. Further, it implies super- √ T-consistency is achievable depending on regressor and error tail thickness and feedback, with a rate equivalent to the largest possible rate amongst untrimmed minimum distance estimators for linear models with iid errors, and a faster rate than QML for heavy tailed GARCH. In the latter cases the optimal rate is achieved with the efficient GMM weight, and by using simple rules of thumb for choosing the number of trimmed equations. Simulation evidence shows the new estimator dominates GMM and QML when these estimators are not or have not been shown to be asymptotically normal. 1. INTRODUCTION W...|$|E

40|$|A new error {{concealment}} scheme {{and a new}} unequal error protection scheme for enhancing {{the quality of the}} wireless transmitted MPEG audio is introduced. The {{error concealment}} scheme uses the frame data before and after the error frame on each subband to generate a new frame to substitute the error frame by the method of interpolation and fading.

40|$|In an {{age where}} {{particular}} {{attention is focused on}} the best use of railway systems, the maintenance and the technological adaptation of available resources, an important emphasis is played on the calculation of capacity in rail traffic.

40|$|One of {{the major}} impacts of the Internet has been the vast {{increase}} {{in the amount of}} information that became available "for free". The provision of free information, or more specifically how much information to give away for free as a viable business model, has puzzled many observers as well as managers. To study this problem, we address two related questions: First, what portion of the information good should be offered as a free sample? Second, how much should a firm charge for the full version? To address these questions, we develop an analytical model, in which a firm offers both a full version and a free sample, on which it earns advertising revenues. Taking into account customers' initial valuation (willingness-to-pay) and their experienced quality with the free version, we characterize the optimal <b>sample</b> <b>portion</b> that should be offered for free and the price of the paid version. For both cases where either free sampling aims to persuade all consumers to buy or only those with high willingness-to-pay, we find that is optimal for the firm to offer a larger free sample when customers underestimate product quality. Our model assumptions and results are generally consistent with an empirical analysis of actual firm data on the market for news. Next, we compare the models’ implications with managerial decisions and show that managers have a tendency to underestimate the impact of free samples when consumers will use them extensively in updating their expectations about product quality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract There {{are many}} {{reports of the}} {{positive}} effect of yerba mate on the human body. Elemental composition anal-ysis of yerba mate revealed the presence of many microele-ments and macroelements, but there is no literature data referencing the content and the effect of the method of prepar-ing the yerba mate infusion on the amount of released fluoride and thus the amount of this element supplied to the human body. Therefore, in the traditional way (cold and hot), we prepared infusions of yerba mate from different countries and determined in samples content of fluoride using potenti-ometric method. Hot infusions resulted in statistically signifi-cant (p= 0. 03) increases in the amount of fluoride released from the dried material to the water, compared to brewing with water at room temperature. The successive refills of hot water also resulted in a release of the same amount of fluoride, although smaller than the infusion with water at room temper-ature (at the third refill, it was statistically significantly smaller at p= 0. 003). With {{an increase in the number}} of hot water refills, the amount of fluoride released from the <b>sample</b> <b>portion</b> significantly decreased. Similar results were recorded when analyzing samples depending on the country of origin. The amount of fluoride released into the water differed statistically significantly depending on the country of origin.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the influence of metallurgy on the corrosion behaviour of separate weld zone (WZ) and parent plate (PP) regions of X 65 pipeline steel in a solution of deionised water saturated with CO 2, at two different temperatures (55 °C and 80 °C) and at initial pH~ 4. 0. In addition, a non-electrochemical immersion experiment was also performed at 80 °C in CO 2, on a <b>sample</b> <b>portion</b> of X 65 pipeline containing part of a weld section, together with adjacent heat affected zones (HAZ) and parent material. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the corrosion behaviour of the separate weld and parent plate samples. This study seeks to understand the significance of the different microstructures within the different zones of the welded X 65 pipe in CO 2 environments on corrosion performance; with particular attention given to the formation of surface scales; and their composition/significance. The results obtained from grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements suggest that, post immersion, the parent plate substrate is scale free, with only features arising from ferrite (α-Fe) and cementite (Fe 3 C) apparent. In contrast, at 80 °C, GIXRD from the weld zone substrate, and weld zone/heat affected zone of the non-electrochemical sample indicates the presence of siderite (FeCO 3) and chukanovite (Fe 2 CO 3 (OH) 2) phases. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on this surface confirmed the presence of characteristic discrete cube-shaped crystallites of siderite together with plate-like clusters of chukanovite...|$|E
40|$|Background: Portion size {{of foods}} is {{reported}} {{to contribute to the}} rise in obesity prevalence. However, evidence of changes in portion size for commonly consumed foods in Australia is lacking. The aim was to evaluate whether Australian child and adolescent portion sizes of selected foods changed from 1995 to 2007. Methods: Time-series study, comparing dietary data from two national cross-sectional surveys in nationally representative population survey of Australian households. The dietary data was from children aged 2 – 16 years who participated in the 1995 National Nutrition Survey (n[*]=[*] 2198) and 2007 Australian National Children’s Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (n[*]=[*] 4799). Results: Differences were found across survey years in median portion size of common foods and beverages assessed by 24 -hour recalls for age and sex categories. Of the 61 foods items evaluated across the whole population <b>sample,</b> <b>portion</b> size increased in 18 items, decreased in 22, with no change in 20, although the magnitude of change varied by age and sex. Decreases in portion size were detected for most dairy products, breakfast cereal, some packaged snack foods and vegetables, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001. Increases were detected for cooked chicken, mixed chicken dishes, bacon and ham (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), cooked meat (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), fish (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and pizza (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). No significant changes were detected for many items including white and wholemeal bread, mincemeat, chocolate and soft drink. Conclusions: Small changes in portion sizes were detected over 12 years in Australian children and adolescents with the degree of change varying by sex, age and food group. Knowledge of usual portion sizes could inform programs targeting appropriate serving sizes selection in children and adolescents...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} investigations {{on a new}} measuring technique are described; a technique similar to the well knownKohlrausch measuring technique, which is characterized by direct electrical sample heating. Subject of the investigations is acylindrical metallic sample, 5 mm thick and 200 mm in length, which is positioned vertically between water-cooled clamps in a vacuum container. The sample can be heated using two simultaneously operating current sources, a 50 Hz-source for axial flow (main heating) {{as well as a}} 200 kHz-induction source for generating eddy currents in two short regions above and below the sample centre (additional heating). By using two heating sources different symmetrical temperature profiles in a central eddy-current-free area of about ± 10 mm can be produced for any given central sample temperature. Using a one-dimensional theory and some simplified assumptions (constant conductivities and temperature-linear radiation heat loss over a small temperature span of typically 10 degrees) it can be shown that the different profiles are of the cosh-type. By cutting the infinite series of the cosh-function an explicitexpression for the thermal conductivity can be determined. The formula combines measuring data characteristic of different profiles, namely 50 Hz currents and voltages as well as temperatures in three central sample points. Thermal conductivity values measured by using this simplified theory must be erroneous. Therefore in a further chapter a more extensive mathematical treatment is given to make the calculation of theoretical systematic errors possible. The results calculated for numerous pure metals by the use of an IBM-computer indicate that certain parameters like the sample thickness, the length of central <b>sample</b> <b>portion</b> as well as the curvature of the coshprofiles normally can be chosen in such a manner that the total error of a measured conductivity value is dominated byuncertainties of measuring quantities but not by the use of the simplified theory.
