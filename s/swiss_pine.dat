5|$|Suillus sibiricus {{has been}} {{recorded}} in parts of Europe, North America and Siberia. The fungus forms strict ectomycorrhizal associations with pines of the subgenus Strobus. These include <b>Swiss</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra) in the Alps and Tatras of central Europe, Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in the Balkans, western white pine (P.monticola) and limber pine (P.flexilis) in the Pacific Northwest of North America, P.banksiana in Quebec, Canada, and Siberian pine (P.sibirica) and Siberian dwarf pine (P.pumila) in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The range of the fungus is hence limited by {{the distribution of the}} host tree. S.sibiricus has also been shown to be able to form ectomycorrhizae with the Himalayan species P.wallichiana in pure culture conditions in the laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{two thirds}} of the park are covered with forests, mainly with spruce and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The most {{widespread}} tree is the Norway spruce, followed by the Scots pine, <b>Swiss</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra), European larch (Larix decidua), and mountain pine. Leafy trees, especially maples, mainly grow in the Belianske Tatras.|$|E
25|$|The {{species with}} highest {{conservation}} importance is Suillus sibiricus which in Europe grows {{only in the}} forests of Macedonian pine in Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia, and in the forests of <b>Swiss</b> <b>pine</b> in the Alps. The number of edible mushrooms is 38, including Agaricus augustus, mosaic puffball (Handkea utriformis), peppery milk-cap (Lactifluus piperatus), weeping milk cap (Lactifluus volemus), charcoal burner (Russula cyanoxantha), Russula grisea and Russula olivacea.|$|E

A scientific study of Joanneum Research in 2003 has shown that exposure to a <b>Swiss</b> Stone <b>Pine</b> may improve sleep by saving you up to 3,500 heart beats per night making nights more restful and restorative.

40|$|Abstract We {{studied the}} {{composition}} of several small mammal communities living in different mountain and forest habitats of the central eastern Italian Alps.

From the 22 stations investigated, five groups emerged, each one having also distinct environmental characteristics. We observed that spruce forest communities are grouped separately from those of mixed forests (larch and <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine).</b> We must stress the considerable difference existing between the small mammal communities living in different kinds of coniferous forests.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of seed {{dispersal}} through the European nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes) on the genetic structure of <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra). The corvid bird deposits several thousands of stone pine seeds annually in the soil as a future food resource. Since not all caches are recovered, this bird behaviour often leads {{to the establishment of}} <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine</b> seedlings. The combination of wind pollination with this bird-mediated seed dispersal can be expected to greatly shape the spatial distribution of genotypes and the genetic diversity within and among <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine</b> populations. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate gene flow patterns, together with their effects on spatial genetic structure (SGS) and, thus, inbreeding probabilities in an exemplary P. cembra population. Furthermore, potential effects of inbreeding on offspring fitness were analysed, hypothesizing that rates of inbreeding and subsequent cumulative inbreeding depression are higher in small and patchily distributed than in large and continuous P. cembra populations. Molecular genetic results from the study population Rautialp show that both pollen and seed dispersal occur across the entire stand, supporting the assumption of extensive gene flow through far-ranging vectors like wind and birds. Nevertheless, we also found strong spatial autocorrelation of individuals within the population. This suggests that seed dispersal through nutcrackers occurs in a kin-structured manner, which leads to the establishment of SGS – especially in areas where tree density is low and seed shadows overlap less than in dense areas of the stand. The second part of the study shows that inbreeding rates were higher in small and peripheral than in large and continuous P. cembra populations, causing a reduction in offspring fitness. Taken together, this study suggests that small and isolated <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine</b> populations might be especially vulnerable to ongoing and future environmental changes...|$|R

50|$|In the conifer {{forests of}} the Alps the {{prevailing}} species are the Norway spruce and the silver fir; on siliceous soil the European larch flourishes. The Scots pine is chiefly found at a lower level and rarely forms forests. The <b>Swiss</b> <b>pine</b> is found scattered at intervals throughout the Alps but is not common. The mountain pine is common at higher altitudes, often forming a distinct zone of Krummholz above the level of its congeners on the higher mountains. In the Northern Alps the pine forests rarely surpass 1800 m (6000 ft) elevation, but {{on the south side}} they commonly attain 2100 m (6900 ft), while European larch, <b>Swiss</b> <b>pine</b> and mountain pine often extend above that elevation.|$|E
50|$|It {{is rarely}} seen in Europe, {{where it is}} known to form ectomycorrhizal {{associations}} with <b>Swiss</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra) and introduced eastern white pine (P. strobus). In north-eastern North America, its range coincides {{with that of the}} native eastern white pine (P. strobus).|$|E
50|$|Pine nuts {{produced}} in Europe mostly {{come from the}} stone pine (Pinus pinea), which has been cultivated for its nuts for over 5,000 years, and harvested from wild trees for far longer. The <b>Swiss</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra) {{is also used to}} a very small extent.|$|E
50|$|The Southern Maine Community College campus {{also has}} an {{established}} arboretum which was created and is maintained by the college, named the Shoreway Arboretum. The arboretum runs along the shoreline of Willard Beach. The arboretum contains many kinds of native salt-tolerant trees and shrubs, including a good specimen of <b>Swiss</b> Stone <b>Pine</b> (Pinus cembra).|$|R
40|$|The north-west facing {{study area}} in the Upper Engadine (Central Alps, Switzerland) {{encompasses}} the whole timberline ecotone between 2200 m and 2400 m a. s. l [...] By dendroecological methods, clear differences concerning quantity and age structure of the natural regeneration of the main tree species <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra L.) and larch (Larix decidua Mill.) at different sites could be detected. The differing site conditions, {{closely linked to the}} microtopography, determine distribution and age structure of natural tree regeneration, as well as humus forms. On exposed sites characterised by Tenuic Humimors, an intensive natural regeneration of, in particular, <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine</b> occurs. In depressions with a Rhizic Leptomoder, the density of tree regeneration is low and a high tree mortality could be observed. The results indicate that the site conditions most important for the natural regeneration of trees in the timberline ecotone are reflected in the site-specific humus form...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, most of {{the alpine}} timberline ecotone has been altered by human {{activities}} and climate change. Hence, mountain forests are of the highest conservation interest. Here, we screened 25 populations of <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra L.) from the Carpathians and the Alps, using a set of ten microsatellite primers to assess the relative conservation value of populations sampled in Polish and Slovak Tatra National Parks, where potential extinction risk is the highest within the Carpathian range. Although endangered, with small and fragmented populations, P. cembra in the Tatra Mts. shows high levels of allelic richness (AR = 5. 0) and observed heterozygosity (H (o) = 0. 554). Our results suggest that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has had little impact on DNA variation of <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine</b> in the Tatra Mts. However, the effects of changing conditions on the genetic structure may occur with a substantial time delay due to the long life span of P. cembra. Moreover, inbreeding depression may occur in the next generations, since we found inbreeding (F (IS) = 0. 063) and elevated coancestry coefficient (theta = 0. 062) in all populations. Also a shallow pattern of genetic differentiation between populations was found, indicating recent fragmentation of a common gene pool that formerly occupied a larger range. Therefore, the Tatra Mts. {{can be considered as}} a single conservation unit. Based on our results, we suggest possible conservation activities for <b>Swiss</b> stone <b>pine</b> both in Poland and Slovakia...|$|R
