50|$|Many {{different}} species of reptiles occur on the refuge. Common species include the gopher snake, western diamondback snake, coachwhip, common kingsnake, whiptail lizard, desert spiny lizard and side-blotched lizard. The spiny <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> and the desert tortoise are also found on the refuge. Spiny <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtles</b> are found in freshwater drains and ponds, while the desert tortoise, although rarely seen, {{can be found in}} the upland desert areas.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> of {{the family}} Trionychidae, pig-nosed turtles retain a domed bony {{carapace}} beneath their leathery skin, rather than a flat plate. They also retain a solid plastron, connected to the carapace by a strong bony bridge, rather than the soft margin of the trionychids.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the climatic {{conditions}} of the Paleocene, reptiles were more widely distributed over the globe than at present. Among the sub-tropical reptiles found in North America during this epoch are champsosaurs (fully aquatic reptiles), crocodilia, <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles,</b> palaeophid snakes, varanid lizards, and Protochelydra zangerli [...] (similar to modern snapping turtles).|$|E
50|$|Tortoises, being land-based, have rather heavy shells. In contrast, aquatic and <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> have lighter shells {{that help}} them avoid sinking in water and swim faster with more agility. These lighter shells have large spaces called fontanelles between the shell bones. The shells of {{leatherback}} sea turtles are extremely light because they lack scutes and contain many fontanelles.|$|E
40|$|Male {{tortoises}} are occasionally {{presented with}} a prolapsed phallus (penis). The penis is retracted except during mating, trauma, or death; it lies in the ventral floor of the cloaca.

The river terrapin (Batagur baska), Indian flap-shelled turtles (Lissemys punctata), peacock <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> (Trionyx hurum), yellow monitors (Varanus flavescens), Asian water monitors (Varanus salvator), and Indian pythons (Python molurus) are some resident species.|$|E
50|$|Most turtles that {{spend most}} of their lives on land have their eyes looking down at objects in front of them. Some aquatic turtles, such as {{snapping}} turtles and <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles,</b> have eyes closer {{to the top of the}} head. These species of turtle can hide from predators in shallow water, where they lie entirely submerged except for their eyes and nostrils. Near their eyes, sea turtles possess glands that produce salty tears that rid their body of excess salt taken in from the water they drink.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 3528 {{specimens}} of freshwater turtles belonging to two families viz., Geoemydidae (brown river turtle, Kachuga smithi; Indian saw-backed turtle, K. tecta; Brahminy river turtle, Hardella thurgi; spotted pond turtle, Geoclemys hamiltonii) and Trionychidae (Indian <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle,</b> Aspederates gangeticus; peacock <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle,</b> A. hurum; narrow-headed <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle,</b> Chitra indica; Indian flap-shell turtle, Lissemys punciata) were identified. Kachuga smithi (43. 62 %) and K. tecta (42. 06 %) had abundant population status, whereas, Hardella thurgi (0. 88 %) and Chitra indica (0. 54 %) were rare. Capturing of turtles for supply to foreigners and export {{is a major}} threat to these animals. Fishermen also kill them during fishing. Canal closure and de-silting is also harmful to turtles. It is concluded {{that it is necessary to}} provide immediate legal protection/coverage to all turtle species under the Punjab Wildlife Act, 1974, Pakistan; otherwise turtle species will become extinct...|$|R

50|$|Turtle soup is soup or stews {{made from}} {{the flesh of the}} turtle. The dish exists in some {{cultures}} and is viewed as a luxury or delicacy. The soft-shelled turtle was commonly used for turtle soup in Singapore while the snapping turtle, found mainly in the United States, was typically used there; and is still found in certain regional cuisines, particularly in Philadelphia cuisine and some Southern United States cuisines. Chinese and other East Asian cuisines use primarily <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> for turtle soup. An alternative form of this dish without actual turtle meat is the Mock turtle soup.|$|E
50|$|Reptiles are the {{dominant}} animal type preserved at Wannagan. The largest animal (~4 meters ft in length) {{found at the}} site is the eusuchian crocodilian Borealosuchus formidabilis (formerly known as Leidyosuchus formidabilis). B. formidabilis is also {{thought to be the}} apex predator of the fauna. The second largest reptile is the champsosaur Champsosaurus gigas. C. gigas is unusual among Paleocene reptiles in that it is larger than its known Mesozoic ancestors: 3 meters (10 ft) in length versus 1.5 meters (4.5 ft) for the largest Cretaceous champsosaurs. Reptiles as a whole decreased in size after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. Other reptiles include <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles,</b> varanid lizards, a small alligatorid called Wannaganosuchus, palaeophid snakes, and the snapping turtle-like Protochelydra zangerli.|$|E
50|$|In {{front of}} the tomb, {{there is a large}} pond that houses a large number of black <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> known as Bostami Turtle or Bostami Kachim (locally called Mazari) which are a very rare and {{critically}} endangered species. Legends claim that these turtles are the descendents of evil spirits that incurred the wrath of the renowned saint, Bayazid Bostami, while he was visiting the area. It is believed that the evil spirits were then transformed into turtles as a punishment and are doomed to spend eternity in this pool. At present, the shrine's caretakers - the Mazar Committee - protect the turtle population but will not allow specimens to be taken anymore, regardless of whether they would be killed or reintroduced into the wild.|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} of Chlorella vulgaris to remove nitrogen {{in the form}} of ammonium ions from the <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> processing wastewater in a local agricultural products limited company (in Hangzhou, China) was studied. The <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> processing wastewater was found to include high concentrations of nitrogen (107. 63 ± 4. 84 mg/L) {{in the form of}} ammonium (NH 4 +) with the small amounts of nitrite (0. 32 ± 0. 04 mg/L on annual average) at pH 6. 7 and to be suitable for growing Chlorella vulgaris. When Chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in a batch mode, a majority of the nitrogen concentration was dramatically removed after a lag-phase period. The total biomass weight gained during the entire cultivation period balanced out well with the nitrogen removed from the culture medium. These results indicate that Chlorella vulgaris has potential to remove nitrogen (i. e., ammonium ion) and nitrite at a reasonable uptake rate from wastewater while being cultivated using the <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> processing wastewater...|$|R
5000|$|The head of Amyda cartilaginea can {{be black}} or brown. Its head {{typically}} displays yellow dots that sometimes appear to fuse together, creating elongated streaks. As the turtle ages, its nape region becomes white or gray. [...] A trait that helps differentiate the Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> from other similar species is its noticeably elongated snout. This is an adaptation that, coupled with its great flexibility, aids the turtle in breathing {{when it has}} buried itself. [...] Increased gas exchange, {{a result of an}} adaptation known as [...] "pharyngel breathing", allows the Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> to remain submerged in water for extended periods of time. [...] Amyda cartilaginea has several permanent tubercles on its neck; [...] these tubercles can appear yellow or black. The Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle's</b> limbs also have yellow spots, but these are usually less in quantity and difficult to distinguish. Its feet are wide and flat, resembling paddles. As a final descriptive note, the males have longer and thicker tails than females.|$|R

50|$|The {{upper shell}} of the turtle is called the {{carapace}}. The lower shell that encases the belly is called the plastron. The carapace and plastron are joined together on the turtle's sides by bony structures called bridges. The inner layer of a turtle's shell {{is made up of}} about 60 bones that include portions of the backbone and the ribs, meaning the turtle cannot crawl out of its shell. In most turtles, the outer layer of the shell is covered by horny scales called scutes that are part of its outer skin, or epidermis. Scutes are made up of the fibrous protein keratin that also makes up the scales of other reptiles. These scutes overlap the seams between the shell bones and add strength to the shell. Some turtles do not have horny scutes; for example, the leatherback sea turtle and the <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> have shells covered with leathery skin instead.|$|E
50|$|The slender-snouted {{crocodile}} lays {{an average}} of 16 (minimum 13, maximum 27) very large eggs (relative to body size) {{about a week after}} completion of the mound nest. The incubation period is long compared with most other crocodilian species, sometimes lasting over 110 days. The female remains close to the nest, but does not defend it with the same vigor as some other species of crocodilians. Once the eggs begin to hatch, and the juveniles emit their characteristic chirping, she will break open the nest and assist in the hatching process. Hatchlings then disperse across the flooded forest floor. Although losses from predators do occur (e.g. by <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles),</b> they apparently are minimal, possibly accounting for the small number of relatively large eggs laid, and the long incubation period. They also have very sharp teeth for protection. It is one of four species of crocodile in Africa, the other three being the Nile, West African and dwarf crocodiles.|$|E
5000|$|Woodson is {{situated}} in semi-arid rolling hills covered in mesquite with [...] "jumping" [...] and prickly pear cactus, [...] "blue brush" [...] and occasional live or post oaks. It has often hot dry summers and cold dry winters. The creek bottoms have huge pecan trees, hackberry, willow, [...] "china berry", [...] "chitelm", elm, cottonwood, and wild plums of several kinds {{as well as many}} other trees of various types occurring at times (bois d'arc, and mulberry are seen). The ground along creeks may be covered in green briars, poison ivy or oak and Virginia creeper grows high into the trees in places. The land, as a whole, is a patchwork of mesquite, and farm fields dotted with old oil wells. It is home to white-tailed deer, wild turkey, cotton-tailed and jack rabbits, feral hogs, bobcats, raccoons, opossum, rattlesnake, bobwhite quail, mourning doves, armadillo, coyotes, an occasional badger, beaver, fox, mountain lion, and even javalina is seen. Song birds and others thrive. There are many small animals like fox squirrels, hispid cotton rats, <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> and others too numerous to mention. Large yellow catfish live in the slow moving rivers or in the local lake and stock tanks (ponds) along with many other fish like channel catfish, large-mouthed bass (black bass), crappie, gar, carp, buffalo fish, drum, bream and goggle-eyed sun perch. Red-horse minnows, top-water minnows and a species locally known as bull-head minnows live in the ponds and thrive in the rippling shallows of the river and creeks.|$|E
