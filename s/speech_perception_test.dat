40|$|Background and Objectives：An open-set monosyllabic <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test</b> is necessary, {{not only}} to devise {{habilitation}} pro-grams but to select candidates and estimate performance in pediatric cochlear implant program. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a validated open-set monosyllabic <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test</b> for preschool children. Subjects and Method：Qualitative test development was based on vocabulary familiarity, syllabic and phonemic frequency, and phonetic balancing between the lists. The devised test lists were applied to 138 normal hearing children and 46 children with cochlear implant to examine the validity and reliability. Results：The final two test lists were made up of 100 items with 260 phonemics. The consequential validity of this devised test was proven by the applied results that the speech perception score of children with implanted devices was significantly lower than that of normal children, when controlling for the length of auditory experience. Conclusion：The developed monosyllabic <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test</b> is the validated instrument for preschool children. It is sensitive to perceptual characteristics of articulatory function in cochlear implanted children. The validity of this test needs to be enhanced by clinical application and further item analysis. (Korean J Otorhinolaryngol-Head Neck Surg 2009; 52 : 312 - 21...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Open-plan {{classroom}} {{styles are}} increasingly being adopted in Australia despite evidence that their high intrusive noise levels adversely affect learning. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a new Australian speech perception task (the Mealings, Demuth, Dillon, and Buchholz Classroom <b>Speech</b> <b>Perception</b> <b>Test)</b> and use it in an open-plan classroom to assess how intrusive noise affects speech perception. METHOD: The first part of this article describes how the online 4 -picture choice speech perception task materials were created. The second part focuses on the study involving twenty-two 5 - to 6 -year-old children in an open-plan classroom who completed the task while other classes engaged in quiet and noisy activities. RESULTS: Children's performance accuracy, number of responses, and speed were lower in the noisy condition compared with the quiet condition. In addition, children's speech perception scores decreased the farther away they were seated from the loudspeaker. Overall, the children understood and were engaged in the task, demonstrating that it is an appropriate tool for assessing speech perception live in the classroom with 5 - to 6 -year-old children. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the Mealings, Demuth, Dillon, and Buchholz Classroom <b>Speech</b> <b>Perception</b> <b>Test</b> is a helpful tool for assessing speech perception in classrooms and that it would be beneficial to use in future research investigating how classroom design and noise affect speech perception. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Good speech {{perception}} and communication skills {{in everyday life}} are crucial for participation and well-being, and are therefore an overarching aim of auditory rehabilitation. Both behavioral and self-report measures {{can be used to}} assess these skills. However, correlations between behavioral and self-report speech perception measures are often low. One possible explanation {{is that there is a}} mismatch between the specific situations used in the assessment of these skills in each method, and a more careful matching across situations might improve consistency of results. The role that cognition plays in specific speech situations may also be important for understanding communication, as speech perception tests vary in their cognitive demands. In this study, the role of executive function, working memory (WM) and attention in behavioral and self-report measures of speech perception was investigated. Thirty existing hearing aid users with mild-to-moderate hearing loss aged between 50 and 74 years completed a behavioral test battery with speech perception tests ranging from phoneme discrimination in modulated noise (easy) to words in multi-talker babble (medium) and keyword perception in a carrier sentence against a distractor voice (difficult). In addition, a self-report measure of aided communication, residual disability from the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile, was obtained. Correlations between speech perception tests and self-report measures were higher when specific speech situations across both were matched. Cognition correlated with behavioral <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test</b> results but not with self-report. Only the most difficult <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test,</b> keyword perception in a carrier sentence with a competing distractor voice, engaged executive functions in addition to WM.

40|$|Speech {{perception}} {{tests are}} an important part of procedures for diagnosing pre-verbal hearing loss. Merely establishing a child's hearing threshold with and without a hearing aid is not sufficient to ensure an adequate evaluation with a view to selecting cases suitable for cochlear implants because it fails to indicate the real benefit obtained from using a conventional hearing aid reliably. Speech perception tests have proved useful not only for patient selection, but also for subsequent evaluation of the efficacy of new hearing aids, such as tactile devices and cochlear implants. In clinical practice, the tests most commonly adopted with small children are: The Auditory Comprehension Test (ACT), Discrimination after Training (DAT), Monosyllable, Trochee, Spondee tests (MTS), Glendonald Auditory Screening Priocedure (GASP), Early <b>Speech</b> <b>Perception</b> <b>Test</b> (ESP), Rather than considering specific results achieved in individual cases, reference is generally made to the four speech perception classes proposed by Moog and Geers of the CID of St. Louis. The purpose of this classification, made on the results obtained with suitably differentiated tests according to the child's age and language ability, is to detect differences in perception of a spoken message in ideal listening conditions. To date, no italian language <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test</b> has been designed to establish the assessment of speech perception level in children with profound hearing impairment. We attempted, therefore, to adapt the existing English tests to the Italian language taking into consideration the differences between the two languages. Our attention focused on the ESP test since it can be applied to even very small children (2 years old). The ESP is proposed in a standard version for hearing-impaired children over the age of 6 years and in a simplified version for younger children. The rationale we used for selecting Italian words reflect the rationale established for the original version, but the choice of single words follows different criteria from the original version. In fact, the two languages differ in important linguistic features so that the test can not be not adapted to the Italian language by simply translating the words involved. As currently there is no children's language dictionary in Italian arranged according to age bracket, we chose words used in children and in pre-school reading material...|$|E

Therefore, based on the example of the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Audiologie (NVA) -lists (Bosman, 1989; Wouters et al., 1994) an Estonian words in noise (EWIN) test has been developed. Design: Two experimental steps were carried out: 1) selection and perceptual optimization of the monosyllables, 2) construction of 14 lists and an evaluation in normal hearing (NH) subjects both in noise and in quiet. Study sample: Thirty-six NH native speakers of Estonian (age range from 17 to 46 years). Results: The reference psychometric curve for NH subjects was determined, with the slope and speech reception threshold being well in accordance with the respective values of the NVA lists.

Therefore, auditory processing abilities were investigated in five CMT 1 A patients with normal hearing. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have failed to separate peripheral from central auditory processing disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five genetically confirmed CMT 1 A cases in patients with normal hearing underwent behavioral and objective testing. Pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and OAE assessment were followed-up by an auditory processing test battery comprising sentences-in-noise test, pattern recognition tests, words-in-noise test, dichotic digit test, filtered speech test, binaural fusion test, and categorical <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test.</b> Subsequently, ABR and ERP measurements were conducted. RESULTS: Either the behavioral or objective test scores of 4 out of the 5 CMT 1 A patients {{did not differ significantly}} from those of subjects with normal hearing. Significantly lower scores of one patient on auditory processing tests and ABR measurements could be ascribed to subnormal hearing. CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that CMT 1 A patients with normal peripheral hearing have auditory processing abilities that were not indicative for an auditory processing disorder. Furthermore, the presence of a peripheral hearing loss complicates the interpretation of auditory processing abilities...|$|E

The randomized tests were performed acutely (interval 1) and again after 3 months of FSP experience (interval 3). The subjective evaluation included questionnaire 1 at intervals 1 and 3, and questionnaire 2 at interval 2, 1 month after interval 1. Results: Comparison between FSP and CIS+ showed that FSP performed at least as well as CIS+ in all <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests,</b> and outperformed CIS+ in vowel and monosyllabic word discrimination. Comparison between FSP and HDCIS showed that both performed equally well in all <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests.</b> Pitch scaling showed that FSP performed at least as well as HDCIS. With FSP, sound quality was at least as good and often better than with HDCIS. Conclusions: Results indicate that FSP performs better than CIS+ in vowel and monosyllabic word understanding.

40|$|Open plan classrooms, {{where several}} classes {{are in the}} same room, have {{recently}} re-emerged in Australian primary schools. This paper explores how the acoustics of four Kindergarten classrooms [an enclosed classroom (25 children), double classroom (44 children), fully open plan triple classroom (91 children), and a semi-open plan K- 6 " 21 st century learning space" (205 children) ] affect speech perception. Twenty-two to 23 5 - 6 -year-old children in each classroom participated in an online four-picture choice <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test</b> while adjacent classes engaged in quiet versus noisy activities. The noise levels recorded during the test were higher the larger the classroom, except in the noisy condition for the K- 6 classroom, possibly due to acoustic treatments. Linear mixed effects models revealed children's performance accuracy and speed decreased as noise level increased. Additionally, children's speech perception abilities decreased the further away they were seated from the loudspeaker in noise levels above 50 dBA. These results suggest that fully open plan classrooms are not appropriate learning environments for critical listening activities with young children due to their high intrusive noise levels which negatively affect speech perception. If open plan classrooms are desired, they need to be acoustically designed to be appropriate for critical listening activities. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo report {{outcomes}} of cochlear implantation (CI) {{in a child}} with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) and to provide preliminary clinical evidence of the efficacy of CI in ANSD patients. MethodsA 4 –year–old boy with diagnosed auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) received implantation of a Nucleus CI 24 R after an unsatisfactory trial of amplification. Post–implantation performance in both hearing sensitivity and speech recognition was assessed in different sessions. Aided hearing thresholds were tested by behavioral audiometry. Mandarin Early <b>Speech</b> <b>Perception</b> <b>Test</b> (MESP), Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS), category of auditory performance (CAP) and Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) {{were used to assess}} the benefits in auditory skills or speech recognition the boy obtained from CI.

The test is tailored for measurements with chil-dren, {{who have not yet}} learnt to read, by using easy speech stimuli, words {{selected on the basis of}} familiarity, and pictures that represent the test items unambiguously. The test is intended to be used with small children, from 4 years of age, with difficulties to perceive and produce spoken language. Especially prelingually hearing-impaired children show very different abilities to learn spoken language. The potential to develop in-telligible speech is unrelated to their pure tone audiograms. The development of this test is an effort to find a screening tool that can predict the ability to develop intelligible speech. The information gained from this test will provide supplementary information about speech per-ception skills, auditory awareness, and the po-tential for intelligible speech and specify im-portant recommendations for individualized speech-training programs.

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} impact of visual cues, speech {{materials}} and age on the frequency bandwidth necessary for optimizing speech recognition performance in listeners with normal hearing. Method: Speech recognition abilities of adults and children with normal hearing were assessed using three <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> that were low-pass (LP) filtered and presented in quiet and noise. The speech materials included the Multimodal Lexical Sentence Test (MLST) that was presented in auditory-only and auditory-visual modalities {{for the purpose of}} determining the listener 2 ̆ 7 s visual benefit. In addition, The University of Western Ontario Plurals Test (UWO) assessed listeners 2 ̆ 7 ability to detect high frequency acoustic information (e. g., /s/ and /z/) in isolated words and The Maryland CNC test that assessed speech recognition performance using isolated single words. Speech recognition performance was calculated as percent correct and was compared across groups (children and adults), tests (MLST, UWO, and CNC) and conditions (quiet and noise). Results: Statistical analyses revealed a number of significant findings. The effect of visual cues was significant in adults and children. The type of speech material had significant impact on the frequency bandwidth required for adults and children to optimize speech recognition performance. The children required significantly more bandwidth to optimize performance than adults across <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> and conditions of quiet and noise. Adults and children required significantly more bandwidth in noise than in quiet across <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests.</b> Conclusion: The results suggest that children and adults require significantly less bandwidth for optimizing speech recognition performance when assessed using sentence materials which provide visual cues. Children, however, showed less benefit from visual cues in the noise condition than adults. The amount of bandwidth required by both groups decreased {{as a function of the}} speech material. In other words, the more ecologically valid the speech material (e. g., sentences with visual cues versus single isolated words), the less bandwidth was required for optimizing performance. In all, the optimal bandwidth (except for the noise condition of the UWO test) is achievable with current amplification schemes...|$|R

Methods: In total 326 monosyllabic words where chosen from an acknowledged first and second primary school Estonian language textbook, being known to children above 6 years of age. The words were recorded by a native Estonian speaker (female voice). Based on the spectrum of the recorded words the stationary speech-shaped noise was generated. The RMS of all the words {{as well as of the}} generated noise was equalized. The optimization measurements were conducted in 10 normal hearing (NH) Estonian children (aged 6 - 7 years) and 10 NH young adults (aged 18 - 27 years) at 5 different signal to noise ratios (SNR; + 1, - 2, - 5, - 8, - 11). The final selection of words (with normal slope, within 8 dB range around the median signal reception threshold -SRT) were divided into 14 lists. Each list consists of 1 training and 9 testing items, 33 phonemes in total.

This version is reproduced with permission from the Otolaryngological Society of Australia. Five children out of a group of nine (aged 5. 5 to 19. 9 years) implanted with the 22 -electrode cochlear implant (Cochlear Ply. Ltd.) have achieved substantial scores on open-set speech tests using hearing without lipreading. Phoneme scores for monosyllabic words ranged from 40 % to 72 %. Word scores in sentences ranged from 26 % to 74 %. Four of these five children were implanted during preadolescence. The fifth child, who had a progressive loss and was implanted during adolescence after a short period of very profound deafness, scored highest on all <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests.</b> The remaining four children who did not demonstrate open-set recognition were implanted during adolescence after a long duration of profound deafness. Post-operative performance on closed-set <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> was better than pre-operative performance for all children. Improvements in speech and language assessments were also noted. These improvements tended to be greater for the younger children. The results are discussed with reference to variables which may contribute to successful implant use: such as age at onset, duration of profound hearing loss, age at implantation, aetiology, educational program, and the type of training provided.

40|$|Introduction: In recent years, the {{benefits}} {{associated with the use}} of cochlear implants (CIs), especially with regard to speech perception, have proven to surpass those produced by the use of hearing aids, making CIs a highly efficient resource for patients with severe/profound hearing loss. However, few studies so far have assessed the satisfaction of adult users of CIs. Objective: To analyze the relationship between the level of speech perception and degree of satisfaction of adult users of CI. Method: This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted in the Audiological Research Center (CPA) of the Hospital of Craniofacial Anomalies, University of São Paulo (HRAC/USP), in Bauru, São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 12 users of CIs with pre-lingual or post-lingual hearing loss participated in this study. The following tools were used in the assessment: a questionnaire, "Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life" (SADL), culturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese, as well as its relationship with the speech perception results; a <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test</b> under quiet conditions; and the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) Brazil under free field conditions. Results: The participants in the study were on the whole satisfied with their devices, and the degree of satisfaction correlated positively with the ability to perceive monosyllabic words under quiet conditions. The satisfaction did not correlate with the level of speech perception in noisy environments. Conclusion: Assessments of satisfaction may help professionals to predict what other factors, in addition to speech perception, may contribute to the satisfaction of CI users in order to reorganize the intervention process to improve the users' quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Background: About 25 % {{children}} with profound deafness have additional disabilities. For children who cannot be evaluated by speech perception tests, an alternative scale scoring-method {{was designed by}} the CI-team at Rikshospitalet, reflecting subjective observations on reactions to sound {{and the desire to}} use CI. Study question: To explore the benefit from CI in {{children with}} profound hearing loss and complex disabilities. Additionally the impact of cognitive dysfunction on benefit was explored. Population and method: Retrospective review of 127 medical records from all children receiving CI during 2008 – 2011 at Rikshospitalet, Norway. Two scales were used for evaluation. The standard scale from 0 - 10 (10 normal speech development) was based on speech perception only. When not applicable, the alternative scale from 0 - 4 (0 = non-user, 4 = great benefit, speech development) was applied. Results: Thirty (24 %) children had complex disability. Of these, nine (30 %) had a cognitive dysfunction. Sixteen (53 %) of the children with complex disabilities could be tested with the normal <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test,</b> and their mean scores equaled mean to scores of otherwise “healthy” children with CI (6, 6 and 7, 6 respectively). The alternative scale was applied for 14 children with complex disorders (nine of them with cognitive dysfunction), the mean score (2, 4) indicated that these children also benefited from CI. Forty-two (33 %) children were not yet tested because of young age or testing difficulties. Conclusion: In this study children with complex disabilities without cognitive dysfunction did as well with CI as children without complex disabilities, in terms of speech development. When cognitive dysfunction was present, alternative scale scores indicated a clear, but variable benefit. Further studies on this group of children with CI are important in order to develop appropriate tools for evaluation and prognosis...|$|E
40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in Australian Journal of Audiology 1994. This version is reproduced with permission from the publisher, Australian Academic Press. [URL] development of multiple channel cochlear implants has been a significant advance in the rehabilitation of profound hearing loss. Speech perception benefits have been particularly evident for postlinguistically deafened adults, who as a group have shown not only supplementation of lipreading scores but also significant comprehension of words and sentences using an implant alone, without the aid of lipreading. In many cases, patients are able to use their implant for telephone conversation. Speech perception benefits for adult users have increased with advances in speech processing and improved means of habilitation. These improvements in open-set speech benefits for adult users have resulted in a steady increase in group mean scores and a reevaluation of selection criteria for cochlear implantation. In the initial development of cochlear implants, only those with little or no residual hearing were considered as candidates. Current selection criteria now include those with substantial residual hearing, who may score up to 40 % in the best-aided condition on word and sentence speech perception tests. In order to provide realistic expectations for prospective cochlear implant patients, it is important to establish the relationship of many preimplant factors to postimplant speech perception benefits. For severely hearing impaired adults, the relationship between preoperative residual hearing, as measured by aided word and sentence <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test</b> scores, and postoperative speech perception benefits is of significant interest. Analysis of data collected over a 15 year period for adult patients is presented. The rationale for conducting full speech perception assessments for all potential cochlear implant patients is stressed. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To {{report the}} <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> and {{intelligibility}} results of Mandarin-speaking patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS) after cochlear implantation (CI); (2) to compare their performance {{with a group}} of CI users without LVAS; (3) to understand the effects of age at implantation and duration of implant use on the CI outcomes. The obtained data may be used to guide decisions about CI candidacy and surgical timing. METHODS: Forty-two patients with LVAS participating in this study were divided into two groups: the early group received CI before 5 years of age and the late group after 5. Open-set <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> (on Mandarin tones, words and sentences) were administered one year after implantation and at the most recent follow-up visit. Categories of auditory <b>perception</b> (CAP) and <b>Speech</b> Intelligibility Rating (SIR) scale scores were also obtained. RESULTS: The patients with LVAS with more than 5 years of implant use (18 cases) achieved a mean score higher than 80 % on the most recent <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> and reached the highest level on the CAP/SIR scales. The early group developed <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> and intelligibility steadily over time, while the late group had a rapid improvement during the first year after implantation. The two groups, regardless of their age at implantation, reached a similar performance level at the most recent follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: High levels of speech performance are reached after 5 years of implant use in patients with LVAS. These patients do not necessarily need to wait until their hearing thresholds are higher than 90 dB HL or PB word score lower than 40 % to receive CI. They can do it "earlier" when their <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> and/or <b>speech</b> intelligibility do not reach the performance level suggested in this study...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} adult {{cochlear implant}} (CI) users to normally hearing (NH) listeners {{in their ability}} to identify various environmental sounds. It also assessed the impact of cochlear implantation on <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> as well as the ability to identify environmental sounds. A comprehensive Environmental Sounds Perception Test (EST) was developed for this study. It was hypothesised that: (i) the NH participants would score higher than the experienced CI users on the EST; (ii) for the pre-to-post CI group, scores on the EST would be higher post-surgery than presurgery, and (iii) for the pre-to-post CI surgery group, scores on <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> would be higher post-surgery than pre-surgery. 10 experienced adult Nucleus CI users and 24 similarly-aged NH subjects were compared on the EST. The study also tested four adults pre-surgery (with HAs), and subsequently post-surgery with the CI on <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> as well as the EST. The closed-set EST consisted of 45 different sounds selected to be representative of everyday stimuli, classified into 9 groups; transport, nature, arriving home, bathroom, kitchen, household appliances, human, office and other. Each sound was represented by two different tokens, ranging in lengths from 2. 5 to 12. 5 seconds. The results showed that NH participants scored significantly higher than the experienced CI users on the EST (p < 0. 001). For the participants tested pre- and post- surgery, the higher scores with the CI than with HAs was approaching significance (p = 0. 068) for both the EST and the <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> measures. No significant correlations were found between scores on the EST and a range of participant factors such as age or <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> scores for any group. Overall these results suggest that CI users are poorer than NH participants, but better than HA users with severeto- profound hearing losses, in recognizing environmental sounds...|$|R
