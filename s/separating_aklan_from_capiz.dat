40|$|Great losses {{caused by}} white spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV) in shrimp culture have beenattributed to poor screening procedures in farms {{and the lack}} of sufficient access to specific pathogenfree brood stock. Thus, early detection of the virus is considered the best option for shrimp farmers. Thestudy, thus, assessed viral incidence in the Philippines and partially sequenced and characterized thePhilippine WSSV isolate with regards to other isolates in GenBank. Developed primers for PCR can detecttarget genes from 0. 4 pg of DNA extract from shrimp samples. PCR detection revealed that 6. 67 %(1 / 15) of market samples from Zambales are infected with WSSV. Shrimp samples from a local shop anda public market in General Santos City showed 46. 67 % (7 / 15) and 20 % (3 / 15) WSSV-positive samplesrespectively. Shrimp sources <b>from</b> <b>Capiz</b> and Batangas, however, showed negative detection for WSV. Nosignificant difference in the number of infected samples from the sampling sites was found.

40|$|The {{excessive}} {{fishing activities}} {{have led to}} the depletion of many coastal fisheries resources in most of the countries in Southeast Asia. It is therefore necessary to find out the causal factors of excessive fishing in order to build up effective fisheries management system. This paper highlights {{the results of the study}} that investigated the overfishing or excessive fishing in Batan Estuary, Aklan, Central Philippines. The data were gathered through an interview of selected households in Barangay Pinamuk-an, <b>Aklan</b> <b>from</b> March 2 - 26 2010. Of the 93 respondent-households, 67 or 72 % is engaged in fishing. The most popular fishing gear was the small set net with synthetic fiber, which was introduced to the community in the latter part of 1970 s. The relatively lower cost of this small fishing gear, and a few labor force requirement, including its availability in nearby market made it easier for the fisherfolks to acquire this fishing gear. The small set net with synthetic fiber has been widely used by the fishers, which led to the overuse of the fishing grounds in the Batan Estuary. Thus, this paper argues that the introduction of new fishing gear and method triggered the excessive fishing in coastal areas in Philippines...|$|R
