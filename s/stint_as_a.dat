5|$|Brought up by poor but musically talented {{parents on}} the island of Funen, he {{demonstrated}} his musical abilities at an early age.

He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23.

5|$|Fort Greble was an American Civil War-era Union {{fortification}} {{constructed as}} part of the defenses of Washington, D.C. during that war. Named for First Lieutenant John Trout Greble, the first West Point graduate killed in the U.S. Civil War, it protected the junction of the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, and from its position on a bluff in the Congress Heights, precluded any bombardment of the Washington Navy Yard and southeastern portions of the city. It was supported by Fort Carroll to the northeast and Fort Foote to the south. It never fired a shot during the war, and after a brief <b>stint</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> U.S. Army Signal Corps training facility, was abandoned and the land returned to its natural state. As of July 2007, the site of the fort is a community park.|$|E

After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's {{reputation as one of}} the most important young filmmakers in Japan.

5|$|Almirante Latorre, {{which was}} closer to {{completion}} than its sister, was bought in 1914 and commissioned into British service as HMS Canada in October 1915. The ship spent its wartime service with the Grand Fleet, seeing action in the Battle of Jutland. After the war, HMS Canada was put into reserve before being sold back to Chile in 1920 as Almirante Latorre. The crew of the battleship instigated a naval mutiny in 1931. After several years of inactivity, the ship underwent a major refit in the United Kingdom in 1937, later allowing it to patrol Chile's coast during the Second World War. After a boiler room fire and a short <b>stint</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prison ship, Almirante Latorre was scrapped in 1959. After Almirante Cochrane was purchased by the British in 1918, {{it was decided to}} convert the ship into an aircraft carrier. After numerous delays, Almirante Cochrane was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Eagle in February 1924. It served in the Mediterranean Fleet and on the China Station in the inter-war period, and operated in the Atlantic and Mediterranean during the Second World War before being sunk in August 1942 during Operation Pedestal.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen was five seconds ahead of Hamilton, but Hamilton began to close in on Räikkönen during the last <b>stint</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the tyres better suiting his McLaren Mercedes. Heavy rain began to fall on lap41. Hamilton closed the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, still sixseconds ahead of Massa. Hamilton {{attempted}} to pass Räikkönen at the Bus Stop chicane, but he cut across the corner. Consequently, Hamilton led out of the chicane but allowed Räikkönen to re-pass him halfway down the straight. Hamilton then passed him again at the La Source hairpin under braking. Räikkönen tried to double-back on Hamilton to regain the position but the line was defended, resulting in Räikkönen touching his front wing on Hamilton's rear tyre. The rain started coming down more heavily and Nico Rosberg spun at Fagnes corner, rejoining in front of the two frontrunners and causing Hamilton to run onto the grass. At the next corner, Räikkönen spun and gave the lead back to Hamilton. Räikkönen then lost control of his Ferrari through the Blanchimont corner and collided with the barrier, ending his race.|$|E

While in Sydney, he became a bodyguard for Jamaican singer Grace Jones and began a relationship with her. He {{received a}} Fulbright scholarship to MIT and moved to Boston. Jones convinced {{him to leave the}} university and move to New York City to be with her and begin acting, where, after a short <b>stint</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> model and bouncer at the Manhattan nightclub The Limelight, Lundgren got a small debut role as a KGB henchman in the James Bond film A View to a Kill, in which Jones starred.|$|E
5|$|Vasey held {{a series}} of staff postings in Australia and India. From 1928 to 1929 he {{attended}} the Staff College at Quetta, India, where Bernard Montgomery was an instructor. In October 1934 he was appointed as a brigade major once more. Following a brief <b>stint</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> GSO2 on the headquarters of the 1st Indian Division, his final posting in India was again as a brigade major, from April 1936 to March 1937. By November 1934 his substantive rank was that of captain, but while he held the brevet and local rank of major, he was not promoted to the substantive rank of major until 1 March 1935. Vasey was finally promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1937, after nearly 20 years as a major, although he was only promoted to the substantive rank on 2 November 1939. This was not unusual, and it fostered a sense of injustice and frustration among regular officers, who found themselves outranked by CMF officers who had enjoyed faster promotion.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in May, Blitz was {{stationed}} as a guard ship in the Elbe, primarily in Glückstadt, where a large number of French prisoners of war were being transferred back to France. In July, Blitz became a fishery protection ship; though the duty was generally uneventful, in one case she had to fire a warning shot toward a British fishing vessel to force the crew to recognize German sovereignty. In late July, Blitz steamed to the island of Sylt, where Kronprinz (Crown Prince) Frederick, his wife Kronprinzessin (Crown Princess) Victoria, and their two sons, Wilhelm and Heinrich came aboard for a fishing trip. From 7 October 1871 to June 1872, Blitz {{was stationed}} as a guard ship in Altona, and on 26 June she began another <b>stint</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fishery protection ship. While Blitz was patrolling in the northern North Sea on 29 June, one of her masts broke, forcing her to put into Aberdeen, Scotland for repairs. The crew's unfamiliarity with tidal conditions in Aberdeen nearly caused the boat to run aground. On 5 July, Blitz was ready to depart for the Shetland Islands, and she arrived in Lerwick three days later. On 9 July, she began the journey back to Germany, arriving in Wihelmshaven on the 20th.|$|E
