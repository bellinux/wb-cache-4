5|$|Judy {{also pointed}} out the {{approach}} of hostile Japanese aircraft long before any of the human crew could hear them. This first occurred prior to the outbreak of war, when the aircraft would fly low over the Gnat with Judy barking at them until they had passed. On an outing to Jiujiang, Jefferey took Judy for a walk outside of the city but she ran ahead, pulling him with her. He realised as he looked back {{that she had been}} pulling him away from a Leopard. In November 1937, the Gnat met with the American river gunboat USS Panay. After the Panay held a party for the two ship's companies, the Gnat crew departed and only realised afterwards that Judy was not with them. They contacted the Panay via <b>signal</b> <b>lamp,</b> but they insisted that they had not seen her. The following morning, the crew heard from a Chinese trader that Judy was on board the Panay after all. In retaliation, a party boarded the American vessel and stole the ship's bell. Afterwards they contacted the Panay and offered them the bell back in return for Judy. She was returned within the hour.|$|E
5|$|The 47th Division {{planned to}} attack with two brigades, each {{reinforced}} by a battalion from the reserve brigade, along {{either side of}} the Ypres–Comines Canal. Large numbers of machine-guns were organised to fire offensive and defensive barrages and signal detachments were organised to advance with the infantry. An observation balloon was reserved for messages by <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> from the front line, as insurance against the failure of telephone lines and message-runners. The divisional trench mortar batteries were to bombard the German front line opposite the 142nd Brigade, where it was too close for the artillery to shell without endangering British troops. Wire-cutting began in mid-May, against considerable local retaliation by German artillery. At the end of May the two attacking brigades began training at Steenvoorde, on practice courses built to resemble the German positions to be attacked, using air reconnaissance photographs to mark the positions of machine-gun posts and hidden barbed wire. Divisional intelligence summaries were used to plan the capture of German company and battalion headquarters. The 140th Brigade with four tanks attached, was to occupy White Château and the adjacent part of , while the 142nd Brigade attacked the spoil heaps and the canal bank to the left. On 1 June, the British artillery began the intense stage of preparatory bombardment for trench-destruction and wire cutting and the two attacking brigades assembled for the attack from 4 to 6 June.|$|E

40|$|There is {{some concern}} that turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. Two studies were performed. The first study was a survey of current practice in the U. S. with regard to the use of clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The main results are that clear outer lenses on rear turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are used in about 28 % of all vehicle models, while the corresponding percentage for front turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is about 70 %. The second study photometrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and color contrast between the on and off states for turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> that use either an amber lens or a clear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that color contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> remains to be ascertained...|$|R

25|$|At daybreak, the Allies and Germans {{exchanged}} <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> messages, {{with the}} Germans repeatedly requesting {{to be taken}} off as {{they were unable to}} stay afloat, and the British refusing to evacuate them until the Germans secured the submarine and stopped it from sinking—the British were concerned that the Germans would deliberately leave behind them a sinking U-boat if they were evacuated. The situation became more confused when a small float-plane, (a Northrop N-3PB of 330 (Norwegian) Squadron), appeared. Unaware of the surrender, it attacked U-570 with small bombs and fired on Northern Chief, which fired back. No damage was done and Burwell ordered the aircraft away by radio.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{advanced}} north {{along the}} western bank of the Jordan River to reach the southern shore of Lake Huleh, searching of a suitable crossing place. In the vanguard the 9th Light Horse Regiment fired on the rearguard from the western bank, while the 10th Light Horse Regiment succeeded in crossing the river during twilight, when a squadron captured a strong rearguard position, 50 prisoners and three guns. The 8th Light Horse Regiment followed the 10th Light Horse Regiment across the Jordan at 19:00 leaving guides and a <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> to show the 9th Light Horse Regiment and Brigade Headquarters the place to cross the river.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, H. A. Jones, the {{official}} {{historian of the}} RAF wrote that the battle showed that infantry co-operation would be a permanent feature of British air operations. Recognition flares had proved effective, although there had been too few and because of infantry were reluctant to risk revealing their positions to German artillery observers. Scheduled illumination was a failure and infantry began {{to wait for a}} call from the contact aeroplane, by <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> or by klaxon. RFC observers reported that direct observation was the most effective method and that flying low enough to be fired on worked best, although this led to many aircraft being damaged and one lost to a British shell. Artillery-observation was hampered by bad weather but the rolling countryside led to constant demands for sorties for counter-battery fire; when the weather grounded the RFC, attacks could fail for lack of observation.|$|E

On the other hand, color contrast between the off and on states is greater with clear-lens turn signals. An experiment was conducted to compare the reaction time of drivers to <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> using clear and amber lenses. The results indicate that luminance contrast is the primary characteristic influencing driver performance and that no compensatory advantage appears to be obtained with increases in color contrast.

500|$|Observing {{that the}} {{concentration}} of facilities, aircraft and personnel, at any relatively small military airfield, made it more vulnerable to enemy attack, Wilson began to consider dispersing some subordinate units.

Repair and maintenance equipment and staff were moved to Daly Waters, almost [...] further south. [...] However, when Wilson also ordered the transfer of obsolete aircraft (five CAC Wirraway armed trainers belonging to No. 12 Squadron RAAF) to Daly Waters, he was overruled by the Deputy Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock.
