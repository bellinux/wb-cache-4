The spin-flip scattering amplitude depends on the chemical composition of the steps, leading to total confinement for pure Bi <b>step</b> <b>edges,</b> and considerable leakage for mixed Bi-Ag <b>step</b> <b>edges.</b> Additionally, the different localization of the occupied and unoccupied surface bands at Ag and Bi sites leads to a spatial shift of the scattering potential barrier at pure Bi <b>step</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Using an STMJHREELS system, we have {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} surface morphology and vibrational modes of C 60 adsorbed on Cu(l 11).

40|$|We {{have studied}} the relaxations and {{vibrations}} of atoms near {{the surface of a}} (1, 1, 19) copper crystal. For this purpose, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations using a semi-empirical many-body potential derived from tight binding models. The total displacement field can be described as the sum of a mean surface relaxation and a specific contribution of the steps, which is maximal for <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> atoms (0. 08 Å) and corner atoms (0. 06 Å). Whereas <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> atoms relax towards the inner terrace and towards the bulk, corner atoms relax in the opposite direction, leading to vortex-like structures in the displacement field. We demonstrate that, as predicted by continuous elasticity, the displacement field induced by steps is equivalent to the one created by a line of dipoles on a flat surface. In the particular case studied here, the equivalent dipole density is 3. 3 × 10 − 10 N. The specific relaxations of kink atoms have been calculated. We have also studied the variation of the relaxations as a function of temperature (T). A strong effect is predicted for inner terrace atoms: when increasing T, the contraction of the first interplanar distance, with respect to the bulk value, progressively cancels and turns to an expansion at high T. This is not the case for the specific contraction of <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> atoms that is nearly temperature independent. This latter behaviour is related to very strong longitudinal correlation between vibrations of the <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> atom and of its nearest neighbour inside the terrace. In the same time, whereas the vibrations of inner terrace atoms are found to be isotropic, the ones of <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> atoms are anisotropic, with a larger component along the direction parallel to the terrace plane and perpendicular to the <b>step</b> <b>edge,</b> the other components being the same as for inner terrace atoms...|$|E
40|$|In this experiment, {{the surface}} {{morphology}} of Ag(111) with deposited Sb was studied by ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV-STM). It was reported previous that Sb acts as a surfactant in the homoepitaxy of Ag(111) and changes the growth mode from 3 -dimensional to 2 -dimensional. The goal of this experiment is to learn how the Sb atoms are incorporated on the Ag(111) surface {{with the aim of}} understanding the surfactant action of Sb. According to the atomically-resolved images, most of the Sb atoms are incorporated onto the Ag(111) surface in substitutional sites at room temperature, with preference to form patches of Ag 2 Sb surface alloy with ([square root] 3 x [square root] 3) R 30 ° periodicity. With 0. 02 to 0. 3 monolayer (ML) Sb deposition, these structures were observed both on the flat surface and also in the form of monolayer islands. After ~ 300 °C annealing, patches at <b>step</b> <b>edges</b> disappeared and the Sb atoms started to have a more uniform distribution except at the <b>step</b> <b>edges</b> which were decorated by a single chain of Sb atoms.
