40|$|Abstract Introduction Hip {{fracture}} fixation {{surgery in}} patients with below-knee amputations poses a challenging problem to the <b>surgeon</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> obtaining traction for reduction of the fracture. The absence of the foot {{and part of the}} leg in these patients makes positioning on the fracture table difficult. We highlight this difficult problem and suggest techniques to overcome it. Case presentation A 73 -year-old man with bilateral below-knee amputations presented with a history of fall. Radiographs revealed an inter-trochanteric fracture of the femur. A dynamic hip screw fixation was planned for the fracture but the dilemma was on how to position the patient on the fracture table for the surgery. Special attention was needed in positioning the patient and in surgical fixation of the fracture. Conclusion Hip fracture fixation {{in patients with}} below-knee amputations poses a special problem in positioning for fracture reduction and fixation. In this case report, we share our experience and suggest techniques to use when encountering this difficult problem. </p...|$|R

40|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{wound healing}} have garnered deep scientific interest {{as well as}} booming financial markets invested in novel wound therapies. Much {{progress has been made}} in the field, but it is unsurprising to find that recent successes reveal new challenges to be addressed. With regard to wound healing, large tissue deficits, recalcitrant wounds, and pathological scar formation remain but a few of our most pressing challenges. Stem cell-based therapies have been heralded as a promising means by which to surpass current limitations in wound management. The wide differentiation potential of stem cells allows for the possibility of restoring lost or damaged tissue, while their ability to immunomodulate the wound bed from afar suggests that their clinical applications need not be restricted to direct tissue formation. The clinical utility of stem cells has been demonstrated across dozens of clinical trials in chronic wound therapy, but there is hope that other aspects of wound care will inherit similar benefit. Scientific inquiry into stem cell-based wound therapy abounds in research labs around the world. While their clinical applications remain in their infancy, the heavy investment in their potential makes it a worthwhile subject to review for plastic <b>surgeons,</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> both their current and future applications...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPurposeMost neurosurgeons in Taiwan are {{not trained}} {{formally}} to perform anterior approaches for thoracolumbar corpectomies {{in the treatment}} of thoracolumbar lesions during their residencies. Often, such procedures are conducted with the assistance of “access surgeons”. Materials and methodsPrior to performing anterior thoracolumbar corpectomies in clinical cases, one senior neurosurgeon, who was not trained in the anterior approaches, acquired the relevant skills from cooperating access surgeons, by attending a workshop, and by practicing on cadavers. Between December 2006 and March 2011, 18 consecutive patients underwent surgeries involving the anterior approach to thoracolumbar lesions. Patients operated on by the self-trained neurosurgeon were included in Group 1, and those operated on by neurosurgeons assisted by access surgeons were included in Group 2. Operative time, blood loss, complications, and neurologic outcomes were compared between the two groups. ResultsGroup 1 consisted of 10 patients (4 men), {{with a mean age of}} 62. 5 years, and Group 2 of eight patients (5 men), with a mean age of 58. 3 years. The median follow-up periods for both groups were 15. 5 and 17 months, respectively. Operative time, blood loss, rate of complications, and neurologic outcomes were comparable between the two groups. ConclusionThrough observation, by attending workshops, and by practicing the anterior approach on cadavers, the self-trained neurosurgeon became competent in the anterior thoracolumbar corpectomy and achieved comparable results to surgeons who were assisted by access <b>surgeons</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> operative time, blood loss, complications, and neurologic outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Background: The fetal {{laceration}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly identified injuries at the caesarean delivery. The incidence in the literature has been reported to be as high as 3 %. The management of such injuries has remained a perplexing problem for both the physician and the parents. Materials and Methods: We present a case of a newborn who accidentally sustained laceration over the face during a caesarean delivery. A review of the literature and management of lacerations with tissue adhesives has been presented. Results: The laceration was successfully managed with tissue adhesive alone with good aesthetic outcome. Conclusion: Topical 2 -octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesives can be an effective alternative therapy for traditional devices for closing simple low-tension lacerations. Caesarean section is the most common major surgical procedure among women of reproductive age and the incidence of accidental fetal laceration during caesarean is not rare, especially when it is performed for emergency indications.

The extremely high incidence of obesity in the USA is a looming health care concern that impacts aspects of health care in all medical specialties. There are specific concerns to the orthopedic surgeon when treating obese patients for acetabular fracture. Patients with body mass index ≥ 30 present particular challenges to the <b>surgeon</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> preexisting medical conditions, diagnostic imaging, and perioperative complications. Specifically, this patient population experiences worse functional outcomes and greater incidence of surgical site infection, intraoperative blood loss, deep venous thrombosis, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, heterotopic ossification, and increased hospital length of stay. These problems are further exacerbated in the morbidly obese, as a scaling effect exists between increasing body mass index and worsening complication profile. This is problematic given the current high incidence of morbid obesity in the USA and particularly worrisome in light of the projected increase in obesity rates for the future.

40|$|Background: Comminuted {{subtrochanteric}} fractures {{have been}} a challenge for orthopedic <b>surgeons</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> appropriate reduction and stable fixation. Numerous methods {{have been used for}} the fixation of comminuted subtrochanteric fractures among which some are accompanied with technical difficulties and complications of their own. Regarding the results of previous studies, we decided to evaluate the biological fixation method in comminuted subtrochanteric fractures. Methods: In this prospective study, we evaluated 20 men with comminuted subtrochanteric femoral fractures. The patients underwent indirect reduction with dynamic hip screw (DHS) or dynamic condylar screw (DCS) fixation within one week of injury. The patients were evaluated clinically for pain, hip and knee range of motion, leg-length discrepancy and angular and rotational deformities, in addition the radiographic assessment of the union. Results: According to Seinsheimer's classification of subtrochanteric fractures, four patients had type III, nine had type IV and seven had type V fractures. Fracture fixation was performed by DCS in eight and by DHS in 12 cases. The average time of the operations was 79. 4 (ranging from 60 - 125) minutes. Mean blood loss was 634 (ranging from 340 - 1160) milliliters. Uneventfully, union occurred in all patients with no clinical pain or dysfunction. Conclusion: Submuscular plating with either DCS or DHS is a viable option to treat comminuted subtrochanteric fractures.

40|$|To assess {{positioning}} accuracy in otosurgery and {{to test the}} impact of the two-handed instrument holding technique and the instrument support technique on surgical precision. To test an otologic training model with optical tracking. In total, 14 ENT surgeons in the same department with different levels of surgical experience performed static and dynamic tasks with otologic microinstruments under simulated otosurgical conditions. Tip motion of the microinstrument was registered in three dimensions by optical tracking during 10 different tasks simulating surgical steps such as prosthesis crimping and dissection of the middle ear using formalin-fixed temporal bone. Instrument marker trajectories were compared within groups of experienced and less experienced surgeons performing uncompensated or compensated exercises. Experienced surgeons have significantly better {{positioning accuracy}} than novice ear <b>surgeons</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> mean displacement values of marker trajectories. The instrument support and the two-handed instrument holding techniques significantly reduce surgeons' tremor. The laboratory set-up presented in this study provides precise feedback for otosurgeons about their surgical skills and proved to be a useful device for otosurgical training. Simple tremor compensation techniques may offer trainees the potential to improve their positioning accuracy to the level of more experienced surgeons. Training in an experimental otologic environment with optical tracking may aid acquisition of technical skills in middle ear surgery and potentially shorten the learning curve.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the current practice of <b>surgeons</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> access to and closure of the abdominal cavity in elective open surgery. Methods Twelve surgical departments of the INSECT-Trial group documented the following variables for 50 consecutive patients undergoing {{abdominal surgery}}: fascial closure techniques, applied suture materials, application of subcutaneous sutures, subcutaneous drains, methods for skin closure. Descriptive analysis was performed and consensus of treatment variables was categorized into four levels: Strong consensus > 95 %, consensus 75 – 95 %, overall agreement 50 – 75 %, no consensus Results 157 out of 599 patients were eligible for analysis (85 (54 %) midline, 54 (35 %) transverse incisions). After midline incisions the fascia was closed continuously in 55 patients (65 %), using slowly absorbable (n = 47, 55 %), braided (n = 32, 38 %) sutures with a strength of 1 (n = 48, 57 %). In the transverse setting the fascia was closed continuously in 39 patients (72 %) with slowly absorbable (n = 22, 41 %) braided sutures (n = 27, 50 %) with a strength of 1 (n = 30, 56 %).

40|$|A {{surgical}} adhesive {{that can}} be used in different surgical situations with or without sutures is a surgeons' dream and yet none has been able to fulfill many such demanding requirements. It was therefore a major challenge to develop an adhesive biomaterial that stops bleeding and bond tissues well, which at the same time is non-toxic, biocompatible and yet biodegradable, economically viable and appealing to the <b>surgeon</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the simplicity of application in complex surgical situations. With this aim, we developed an in situ setting adhesive based on biopolymers such as chitosan and dextran. Dextran was oxidized using periodate to generate aldehyde functions on the biopolymer and then reacted with chitosan hydrochloride. Gelation occurred instantaneously upon mixing these components and the resulting gel showed good tissue adhesive properties with negligible cytotoxicity and minimal swelling in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Rheology analysis confirmed the gelation process by demonstrating storage modulus having value higher than loss modulus. Adhesive strength was in the range 200 - 400 gf/cm(2) which is about 4 - 5 times more than that of fibrin glue at comparable setting times. The adhesive showed burst strength in the range of 400 - 410 mm of Hg which should make the same suitable as a sealant for controlling bleeding in many surgical situations even at high blood pressure. Efficacy of the adhesive as a hemostat was demonstrated in a rabbit liver injury model. Histological features after two weeks were comparable to that of commercially available BioGlue (R). The adhesive also demonstrated its efficacy as a drug delivery vehicle. The present adhesive could function without the many toxicity and biocompatibility issues associated with such products. Statement of Significance Though there are many tissue adhesives available in market, none are free of shortcomings. The newly developed surgical adhesive is a 2 -component adhesive system based on time-tested, naturally occurring polysaccharides such as chitosan and dextran which are both biocompatible and biodegradable. Simple polymer modification has been carried out on both polysaccharides so that when aqueous solutions of both are mixed, the solutions gel in less than 10 s and forms an adhesive that seals a variety of incisions. The strength of the adhesive is over 5 -times the strength of commercially available Fibrin glue and is more tissue compliant than BioGlue. This adhesive biomaterial showed excellent tissue bonding, was hemostatic, biocompatible and biodegradable. The significance of this work lies on the features of the developed tissue adhesive that it stops bleeding, bond the tissues well, can act as a drug delivery vehicle and would appeal to the <b>surgeon</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the simplicity of application in complex surgical situations. There is no need for special delivery systems for application of this adhesive. The two-component adhesive can be applied one over the other using syringes. There is also no need for light curing with UV or visible light and the gelation between the two components spontaneously takes place on application leading to excellent tissue bonding.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Malignancies (M) of the Nose (N) and Para nasal sinuses (PNS) are {{uncommon}} {{to find in}} ENT practice. They pose {{a challenge to the}} <b>surgeon</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> early diagnosis and management that includes multiple treatment modalities. Such malignancies are presented from our institute out of other diseases of the Para nasal sinuses, their clinical, radiological and Histo-pathological features with a special emphasis on their management. All the patients were followed up for recurrence. AIM To make a clinical study of malignant neoplasms of nose and Para nasal sinuses with regard to their, clinical presentation, radiological assessment, Histopathological studies and treatment modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients attending the ENT outpatient department of a Tertiary Level Teaching Hospital of Government Ear, Nose & Throat Hospital, Koti/Osmania Medical College, Hyderabad, Telangana State from January 2014 to June 2015 with various diseases of nose and Para Nasal sinuses were screened and malignant tumors were identified, investigated and treated appropriately. Among these few cases are included in the present study. The patients are kept on a follow-up period of 6 to 9 months. INCLUSION CRITERIA All patients with Histopathological confirmation of malignant neoplasms of nose and Para nasal sinuses irrespective of sex were considered for study. All patients who were immunologically competent only were included in the study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Pediatric malignancies are excluded. All immune-compromised patients are excluded from the study. CONCLUSION The Sino-nasal malignancies are not uncommon in ENT practice. Elderly males are commonly affected. Exact aetiology is obscure There is no evidence that chronic sinusitis predisposes to cancer. The incidence of chronic sinusitis in patients with Sino-nasal malignancies is the same as that in the general population. The challenge lies in diagnosing the malignancy as early as possible followed by selecting an appropriate treatment option and adequate follow up. ...|$|R
40|$|Advances {{in surgery}} {{have led to}} marked {{improvements}} in patient care, in particular, indexed by minimally invasive surgery (MIS). With the assistance of technology, progressively more complex procedures are undertaken {{with the aim of}} diminishing the impact of surgery on the patient. However, this increases demands placed on the <b>surgeon</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> technical ability. Surgical robotics may overcome this by enhancing surgeon capability through a variety of means. However, it is imperative that novel equipment is scrutinised not only for its performance effects but as to its impact on the user. This is to ensure that not all a surgeon’s resources are devoted to using a new instrument rendering them unable to focus on other aspects of surgery such as dealing with unexpected events e. g. bleeding. Neuroergonomics encompasses the study of the brain and behaviour at work and entails appreciating the cortical correlates of work-related tasks in order to understand both task demands and how the work environment may be modulated to facilitate performance. This paradigm has been applied to safety critical industry such as aviation and air traffic control, and is wholly applicable to surgery especially as the increasing demands placed on surgeons may be more cognitive in nature and as such not be as readily detected with conventional ergonomic tools. This purpose of this thesis is to apply neuroergonomic principles to evaluate brain behaviour associated with complex surgical tasks and how this may be modulated by assistive technology. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the cortical substrate for undertaking a complicated navigational task, of the nature likely to benefit from robotic enhancement, is assessed. This establishes firstly, a reliance on cortical regions involved in visuospatial working memory; and secondly demonstrates that experts elicited greater cortical activity than novices. Subsequently, assistive technology known to enhance performance is assessed as to its impact on prefrontal cortical (PFC) activity. A randomised controlled trial across six sessions is then undertaken with the aim of appraising how this technology may affect the learning process <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> frontoparietal cortical activity. Brain behaviour is assessed <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> activity and network behaviour determined using graph theory. Finally, a novel tool for aiding collaborative surgery is investigated demonstrating a modulation of search strategy and underlying cortical activity affording subsequent performance improvement. This work sheds light on the neurocognitive aspects of undertaking surgical tasks and how this information can be applied within the paradigm of neuroergonomics to evaluate and assess novel instrumentation in surgery.

Retrospective cohort study. Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Department, University of Florence, Italy. We included all patients undergoing tracheotomy from July 2008 to January 2013 and compared tracheotomies performed by supervised residents or surgeons. During the study period, 304 patients were submitted to tracheotomy. Patients operated by surgeons had a significantly higher number of tracheal rings fracture (p =  0. 05), subcutaneous emphysema (p =  0. 003) and tracheostomy tube displacement (p =  0. 003), while supervised residents had a higher number of tracheitis/pneumonia (p =  0. 04) as early complications. Patients operated by supervised residents had a significantly higher number of tube obstructions as late complication (p =  0. 04). Using multivariate model, risk factors for early postoperative complications were male sex (p =  0. 04) and delayed time to substitution with cuffless tube (p =  0. 01), while only a trend to statistical significance was observed for urgent tracheotomies concerning the risk for late postoperative complications (p =  0. 08).

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} complications after hip replacement surgery {{is a consequence}} of two main factors: the prolonged survival time in the general population and the increasing number of primary implants made worldwide in the last decades. Among the possible complications, periprosthetic femoral fractures represent a challenge for orthopaedic <b>surgeons.</b> <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> treatment, it is crucial to distinguish between intraoperative (or perioperative) fractures and post-traumatic fractures. The former may be minor fractures that do not necessitate surgical treatment. Posttraumatic fractures usually require operative treatment and are associated both with predisposing factors such as osteolysis, osteopenia and aseptic loosening of the implant as well as with determining factors such as minor traumatic events. The incidence of intraoperative periprosthetic fractures in cementless total hip arthroplasty ranges from 1 to 20 % and is higher in revision surgery [2, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15]. Lower rates are observed in cemented procedures where the need for a tight press fit is less. These fractures are usually located in the calcar region or directly in the trochanter, and they are often the consequence of excessive reaming with rasps and broaches during preparation of the medullary canal or, inadvertently, during insertion of the definitive stem. Although fixation of intraoperative fractures with wire cerclage or plates is effective, it is recommended to avoid such events through careful preoperative planning and optimal surgical technique. Regarding postoperative periprosthetic fractures, the incidence ranges between 1 and 4 %, again with higher rates in revision surgery [2, 6, 10, 12]. These fractures ar...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{date the}} {{healthcare}} experiences of gender diverse Australians have received little attention. Previous international research indicates {{a range of}} both negative and positive healthcare experiences amongst this diverse population, with negative experiences being those most frequently reported. METHOD: An online survey was designed to examine the healthcare experiences of gender diverse Australians. The survey included Likert scales asking participants to rate their mental and physical health, and their experiences with psychiatrists, general practitioners and <b>surgeons</b> (<b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> perceived comfort, discrimination and information provision). Open-ended questions provided the opportunity for participants to further elaborate on their experiences. Data were collected between June 2012 and July 2013. Quantitative data analysis was conducted utilising SPSS 17. 0, including ANCOVAs and correlations to examine the relationships between variables. Qualitative data were coded by the authors in terms of negative or positive responses and the validity of ratings were assessed utilising Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: 110 people assigned male at birth (MAAB) and 78 people assigned female at birth (FAAB) completed two separate surveys. All identified as gender diverse as defined in this paper. 70 % of participants had accessed a psychiatrist. Participants MAAB rated their experiences with psychiatrists more highly than participants FAAB. 80 % of participants had accessed a general practitioner. Comfort with, and respect from, general practitioners were both positively correlated with mental health, whilst discrimination was negatively correlated with mental health. 42. 5 % of participants had undertaken sex-affirming surgery.

Intervention(s) : On day 1 of the subsequent menstrual cycle, patients were randomized to receive oral desogestrel (n ¼ 30) for 10 days combined with a tablet of raloxifene (60 mg) per vaginam (group A); oral desogestrel at 60 mg/day (n ¼ 30; group B); or oral danazol at 200 mg, {{three times a day}} (n ¼ 30; group C). Main Outcome Measure(s) : Ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness on day 11 of both the pretreatment and treatment cycles, surgeon satisfaction (0 to 10, visual analogue scale), and side effects. Result(s) : At the second evaluation, the mean percentage reduction in endometrial thickness in group A was statistically significantly greater than in the other groups. <b>Surgeon</b> satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> endometrial thinning was also greater with group A. Conclusion(s) : Oral desogestrel plus vaginal raloxifene provides a fast, low-cost, and satisfactory preparation of the endometrium for operative hysteroscopy.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{we have seen a}} {{revolution}} in the way that we perform abdominal surgery with increased reliance on minimally invasive techniques. This paradigm shift has come at a rapid pace, with laparoscopic surgery now representing the gold standard for many surgical procedures and further minimisation of invasiveness being seen with the recent clinical introduction of novel techniques such as single-incision laparoscopic surgery and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. Despite the obvious benefits conferred on the patient <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> morbidity, length of hospital stay and post-operative pain, this paradigm shift comes at a significantly higher demand on the <b>surgeon,</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> both perception and manual dexterity. The issues involved include degradation of sensory input to the operator compared to conventional open surgery owing to a loss of three-dimensional vision through the use of the two-dimensional operative interface, and decreased haptic feedback from the instruments. These changes have led to a much higher cognitive load on the surgeon and a greater risk of operator disorientation leading to potential surgical errors. This thesis represents a detailed investigation of disorientation in minimally invasive surgery. In this thesis, eye tracking methodology is identified as the method of choice for evaluating behavioural patterns during orientation. An analysis framework is proposed to profile orientation behaviour using eye tracking data validated in a laboratory model. This framework is used to characterise and quantify successful orientation strategies at critical stages of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and furthermore use these strategies to prove that focused teaching of this behaviour in novices can significantly increase performance in this task. Orientation strategies are then characterised for common clinical scenarios in natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery and the concept of image saliency is introduced to further investigate the importance of specific visual cues associated with effective orientation. Profiling of behavioural patterns is related to performance in orientation and implications on education and construction of smart surgical robots are drawn. Finally, a method for potentially decreasing operator disorientation is investigated in the form of endoscopic horizon stabilization in a simulated operative model for transgastric surgery. The major original contributions of this thesis include:  Validation of a profiling methodology/framework to characterise orientation behaviour  Identification of high performance orientation strategies in specific clinical scenarios including laparoscopic cholecystectomy and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery  Evaluation of the efficacy of teaching orientation strategies  Evaluation of automatic endoscopic horizon stabilization in natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery The impact of the results presented in this thesis, as well as the potential for further high impact research is discussed in the context of both eye tracking as an evaluation tool in minimally invasive surgery as well as implementation of means to combat operator disorientation in a surgical platform. The work also provides further insight into the practical implementation of computer-assistance and technological innovation in future flexible access surgical platforms.

40|$|There are {{substantial}} variations in medical {{services that are}} difficult to explain based on differences in pathophysiology alone. The scale of variation and the number of people affected suggest substantial potential to lower healthcare costs with the reduction of practice variation. Our study assessed practice variation across three affiliated urban sites in one city in the United States and related healthcare costs following the diagnosis of hand osteoarthritis (OA) in patients. (1) What are the factors associated with increased costs and surgery in the first year after diagnosis of hand OA? (2) How much practice variation exists among hand <b>surgeons</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the number of patient visits, use of imaging tests, use of injections, occupational therapy use, and surgery? (3) What proportion of total cost is accounted for by patients who consult with an additional provider? Patients receiving a new diagnosis of primary hand OA between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, were identified from the research database of three affiliated urban hospitals in a single city in the United States. We included 2814 patients (69 %, 1929 women) treated by six hand surgeons. We recorded all visits, imaging tests, injections, occupational therapy visits, and surgical procedures in the first year after that diagnosis. Costs were extracted from the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Reliability of the database was assessed by manual checking of 120 patient charts (4. 3 % of all data); reliability was determined to be 94 % (113 of 120) for diagnoses, 97 % (116 of 120) correct surgeon, 100 % (120 of 120) second surgeon, 99 % (278 of 282) visits, 99 % (132 of 134) imaging procedures, 92 % (11 of 12) injections, 95 % (21 of 22) surgical procedures, and 85 % (102 of 120) prescribing occupational therapy. Predictors of increased costs included younger patient age (regression coefficient [beta] - 3. 5, semipartial R- 2 0. 0049, 95 % confidence interval [CI] - 5. 4 to - 1. 7, p < 0. 001), seeing a second surgeon (beta 283, semipartial R- 2 0. 0095, 95 % CI 176 - 391, p < 0. 001), and specific surgeons (surgeon 1 : beta - 243, semipartial R- 2 0. 026, 95 % CI - 298 to - 188, p < 0. 001; surgeon 2 : beta - 177, semipartial R- 2 0. 0090, 95 % CI - 246 to - 109, p < 0. 001; surgeon 6 : beta 124, semipartial R- 2 0. 0050, 95 % CI 59 - 189, p < 0. 001) (adjusted R- 2 = 0. 056). Similarly, factors associated with increased surgical intervention included younger patient age (beta - 0. 0026, semipartial R- 2 0. 0071, 95 % CI - 0. 0037 to - 0. 0015, p < 0. 001), male sex (beta 0. 041, semipartial R- 2 0. 0028, 95 % CI - 0. 069 to - 0. 012, p = 0. 005), seeing a second surgeon (beta 0. 16, semipartial R- 2 0. 0091, 95 % CI 0. 094 - 0. 22, p < 0. 001), and specific surgeons (surgeon 1 : beta - 0. 14, semipartial R- 2 0. 026, 95 % CI - 0. 18 to - 0. 11, p < 0. 001; surgeon 2 : beta - 0. 13, semipartial R- 2 0. 014, 95 % CI - 0. 17 to - 0. 091, p < 0. 001). There were large variations in the average number of visits (1. 5 -fold), imaging tests (threefold), use of injections (51 -fold), occupational therapy (twofold), and surgery rates (sevenfold) among providers. One hundred twenty patients (4. 3 %) consulted a second surgeon within the first year after receiving the diagnosis of hand OA, which accounted for 8. 1 % (USD 68, 826 /USD 845, 304) of the total costs. Patients who saw additional providers and who were of younger age incurred higher costs and a greater likelihood of undergoing surgery; the latter was also greater in male patients. Use of medical services and associated costs vary widely among providers treating patients with hand OA.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Patient and surgeon {{satisfaction}} with topical versus peribulbar anaesthesia {{have been documented}} by various studies {{and has been a}} conflicting argument. In this study, we assessed <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> patient’s pain and surgeon satisfaction using these two anaesthetic techniques for better outcome of cataract surgeries. AIM To evaluate efficacy <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> pain, visual outcome and surgeon {{satisfaction with}} topical anaesthesia versus peribulbar anaesthesia in Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS). MATERIALS & METHODS A prospective clinical study was conducted at Government Medical College (GMC) Jammu from November 2010 to October 2011. A total of 300 patients underwent SICS with 150 patients in each group receiving topical & peribulbar anaesthesia respectively. Patient’s pain during application of anaesthesia and during surgery were assessed by visual analogue pain scale. <b>Surgeon</b> satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> intraoperative difficulty was evaluated. The student’s t-test and chi square test was used to determine IOWA score in both groups. p ˂ 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS Feeling of pain during the administration of topical anaesthesia was significantly lower as compared to peribulbar anaesthesia (p ˂ 0. 005). While there is not much difference in pain during surgery in both the groups (p= 0. 026, not significant). Regarding visual acuity, there is significant {{difference between the two groups}} on I st postoperative day (p= 0. 005), while there was no difference between the two groups at the 6 th week (p= 0. 85). There was no significant intraoperative difficulty encountered by the <b>surgeon</b> <b>in</b> both the groups. CONCLUSION Topical anaesthesia is preferable to peribulbar anaesthesia and is recommended as a safe and effective alternative to peribulbar anaesthesia for cataract surgery...|$|R

Materials and methods: A total of 173 radical retropubic prostatectomies, performed by the same <b>surgeon,</b> were evaluated <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> early and late continence. Results: The presence of residual prostate cancer cells within the muscle layer was always excluded by the histopathological examination that also demonstrated that the muscle layer was well represented; satisfactory outcomes were obtained <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> both early urinary continence (60 %) and urinary continence at 6 - 12 month follow-up (92. 4 % for the whole series and 97. 2 % for the last series of patients).

40|$|Neuronavigation is the {{technology}} used during brain surgery {{to verify the}} location <b>in</b> which the <b>surgeon</b> is working <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> depth and width. Despite being considered to be helpful, {{the technology}} lacks {{when it comes to}} the consideration of brain shift, the dynamic changes of the brain during surgery. The purpose of this report was to verify the suspected need of an additional tool and investigate the market size and dynamics. The thesis work mainly followed the method of Biodesign – The process of innovating medical technologies, which covers all steps in the innovation process. To fit the specific purpose, the method was partly amended. The results of the report are divided into two categories – need and market. A need statement was developed and the market was mapped <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> size and other players in the market space. The conclusions drawn are that there is a need for technology development in order to safely account for brain shift during tumour resection surgery, but that it is likely to be hard to enter the market due to other researchers who have made more progress in the area...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} whether the recommended methods for the handling of breast excision biopsy specimens from screening patients cause more laboratory work than those used for non-screening patients. METHODS: All breast excision biopsy specimens from 1990 were identified. Ninety one came from patients identified during the prevalent round of breast screening. These were compared with 127 from non-screening patients operated on by the same <b>surgeon.</b> The workload <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> initial blocks taken, cases which needed extra blocks or other additional work, and the time taken for delivery of slides to the pathologist were assessed. RESULTS: The screening cases required significantly more initial blocks than the non-screening cases (8. 03 v 4. 95; p = 0. 000001). When looking at the malignant diagnoses this difference was maintained (7. 74 v 6. 02; p = 0. 00014). CONCLUSIONS: Excision biopsy specimens from screening patients require more laboratory work per case than those from non-screening patients. The reasons for these differences lie {{in the nature of}} the specimens and their subsequent diagnoses, and in the initial indications for biopsy...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{contains a}} number of controversies regarding key questions: (1) When is a biopsy indicated? (2) How should the biopsy be placed? (3) How should the biopsy be performed and which has the greatest diagnostic accuracy? (4) Who should perform the biopsy? (5) What clinical parameters present the greatest diagnostic difficulty? Using PubMed and Google Scholar we performed English-language literature searches of clinical studies reporting biopsy of soft tissue masses. Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria but were only able to address {{three of the five}} questions the authors had hoped to evaluate. Available evidence suggests open biopsy has the highest diagnostic accuracy over core needle biopsy, which was higher than fine needle aspiration. There was no evidence to address who is best suited to perform the biopsy (general surgeon, orthopaedic <b>surgeon,</b> radiologist, pathologist) <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> accuracy of diagnosis. Frozen section at the time of biopsy may improve diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic difficulty was associated with myxoid and round cell neoplasms, infections, and tumors located in the paraspinal region. The limited number of references addressing these issues demonstrated the need for more Level I {{research in the area of}} biopsy of soft tissue masses...|$|R
