40|$|Abstract: In {{contrast}} to imaging optics diffusors are typically used to achieve homogeneous luminance distributions for display and lighting applications. For example, LEDs are nearly point sources and therefore optical beam <b>shaping</b> <b>components</b> are needed. Optical diffusors in reflection and transmission {{are commonly used}} for additional luminance homogenization. However, a detailed quantitative understanding and numerical description of their optical performance are very unconfident or still unclear. In this contribution we focus on volume diffusors and present results on three types of particle-matrix-material combinations. The measured straylight distributions are compared to theoretical predictions and show good agreement. From these results optimized material parameters can be derived {{in order to get}} improved volume diffusers for tailored luminance distributions...|$|E

Using a uniform symmetry plane, the user first draws 2 D sketch lines for each <b>shape</b> <b>component</b> on a sketching plane. The z-depth information of the hand-drawn input sketches can be calculated using their property of mirror symmetry to generate 3 D construction curves. In order to provide more freedom for controlling the local geometric features of the reconstructed free-form shapes (e.g., non-circular cross-sections), our modeling system creates each <b>shape</b> <b>component</b> from four construction curves. Using one pair of symmetric curves and one pair of general curves, an improved cross-sectional surface blending scheme is applied to generate a parametric surface for each component. The final symmetric free-form shape is progressively created, and is represented by 3 D triangular mesh. Experimental results illustrate that our system can generate complex symmetric free-form shapes effectively and conveniently.|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{selection}} pressures <b>shaping</b> <b>components</b> of male reproductive success {{is essential for}} assessing the role of sexual selection on phenotypic evolution. A male's competitive reproductive success is often measured in sequential mating tests by recording P 1 (first mating male) and P 2 (second mating male) paternity scores. How each of these scores relates to a male's overall fitness, for example, lifetime reproductive success is, however, not known. This information {{is needed to determine}} whether males benefit from maximizing both P 1 and P 2 or by trading off P 1 against P 2 ability. We measured P 1, P 2, and an index of lifetime reproductive success (LRSi, a male's competitive reproductive success measured over 12 days) for individual male Drosophila melanogaster. We found no evidence for phenotypic correlations between P 1 and P 2. In addition, whereas both P 1 and P 2 were associated with relative LRSi, only P 2 predicted absolute LRSi. The results suggest that P 2 was most closely linked to LRSi in the wild-type population studied, a finding which may be common to species with strong second male sperm precedence. The study illustrates how P 1 and P 2 can have differing relationships with a male's overall reproductive success, and highlights the importance of understanding commonly used measures of sperm competition in the currency of fitness...|$|E

The source consists of a 150 watt xenon lamp, collecting optics, spectral <b>shaping</b> <b>components,</b> and a refocussing lens. The output spectrum has 70 % of its energy at wavelengths below 400 nm and resembles the spectrum of daylight ultraviolet for a 70 ° sun elevation. The intensity over a 1 cm diameter uniform spot is about 10 times that of daylight ultraviolet. At other focal positions, stronger intensities over smaller uniform areas and weaker intensities over larger uniform areas are found, all with the same spectrum. For uniform areas with less than 1 cm diameter the intensity can exceed the heat erythema threshold for multiple doses. Operation of the simulator fulfills the simplicity requirement and little maintenance is required. The output is constant with no more than a 20 % decrease during the life of the lamp; the simulator weighs 5 pounds, and its power supply, to which it is cabled, weighs 35 pounds, so that each or both are portable. The spectrum can be readily changed by introducing other filters into available holders in the light path so that action spectrum studies can be performed.

40|$|Flashlamp pumped lasers use {{pulsed power}} {{switches}} to commute energy stored in capacitor banks to the flashlamps. The particular application {{in which the}} authors are interested is the National Ignition Facility (NIF), being designed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). To lower {{the total cost of}} these switches, SNL has a research program to evaluate large closing switches. The target value of the energy switched by a single device is 1. 6 MJ, from a 6 mF, 24 kV capacitor bank. The peak current is 500 kA. The lifetime of the NIF facility is 24, 000 shots. There is no switch today proven at these parameters. Several short-lived switches (100 `s of shots) exist that can handle the voltage and current, but would require maintenance during the facility life. Other type devices, notably ignitrons, have published lifetimes in excess of 20, 000 shots, but at lower currents and shorter pulse widths. The goal of the experiments at SNL is to test switches with the full NIF wave shape, and at the correct voltage. The SNL facility can provide over 500 kA at 24 kV charge voltage. the facility has 6. 4 mF total capacitance, arranged in 25 sub-modules. the modular design makes the facility more flexible (for possible testing at lower current) and safer. For pulse shaping (the NIF wave shape is critically damped) there is an inductor and resistor for each of the 25 modules. Rather than one large inductor and resistor, this lowers the current in the pulse <b>shaping</b> <b>components,</b> and raises their value to those more easily attained with lumped inductors and resistors.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigations}} described in the article considerably extend the process understanding {{in connection with the}} questions and aspects which {{must be taken into account}} in the case of remote laser beam welding installations and laser beam welding installations with long focal lengths. With respect to weld quality and weld penetration depth, the methods applied here have also yielded practice-relevant knowledge about the interactions between the laser radiation and the welding fumes as well as about the attainable benefits of controlling the air flow in an appropriate way. Experimental investigations and numerical calculations served to adequately identify the influencing factors which are essential for are liable remote laser beam welding process. One challenge is to find optimum parameter constellations for a given configuration of a welding installation. Because of the complexity of the interactions, empirical designing is generally impracticable or insufficient in order to achieve an efficient air flow control. Virtual welding installation models with which the cabin air flow can be simulated may serve as a useful tool for this purpose. In combination with methods of statistical design and evaluation of experiments, it is possible to make a significance assessment of different manipulated variables and to establish functional dependencies between manipulated and target variables on which the optimisation of the air flow control can be based. Using the obtained results, it was possible to elaborate a resource-conserving air flow control concept which can be applied to retrofit many remote laser beam welding installations in a relatively simple and favourable way. The concept is based on the spatial separation of the region above the workpiece which includes the process zone as well as local supply air and exhaust air equipment from the upper region of the processing cabin which accommodates, amongst other items, the beam <b>shaping</b> <b>components,</b> i. e. the laser processing head as well as the relevant peripheral equipment...|$|E

40|$|With {{the desire}} for energy {{conservation}} and lower costs, the application of pulse-width modulated (PWM) voltage source converter (VSC) drives has grown at an exponential rate. However, due to their high switching frequency and high dv/dt, increased dielectric stresses and thermal stresses are applied to the insulation system of the motors, which {{may lead to the}} failure of the insulation. In order to test the performance of the motor insulation under the above complex stress conditions, an IGBT-based pulse voltage generator which can produce high voltage square wave and PWM waveforms has been successfully developed in this research. The generator consists of IGBT switches and other wave <b>shaping</b> <b>components.</b> The special cascade connection circuit design enables the generator to produce the stable high voltage square wave and PWM waveforms. A microcontroller-based trigger signal generator is used to trigger the power electronic switches in the generator. In order to avoid false triggering from electromagnetic interference (EMI), optical fibre cables are used to connect the trigger signal generator to the switches which are located in a high electric potential area. The generator can produce square wave and PWM waveforms with a peak voltage up to 15 kV and with a switching frequency of 600 Hz to 6 kHz. The fundamental frequency of the PWM waveform is 20 Hz to 1200 Hz, the rise time is less than 200 ns, and the pulse width can be varied up to several milliseconds. A 4 kVrms form wound model stator coil was tested under different voltage waveforms: power frequency, exponential decay pulse, square wave, and sinusoidal pulse-width modulated (SPWM) waveform. Infrared images and the maximum temperature rise of the coil under different electrical stresses were recorded. The results show that both the square and SPWM voltage waveforms cause a significantly higher temperature rise than the power frequency and exponential decay pulse voltage waveforms. Since the actual VSCs generate transients {{similar to those of the}} square and PWM voltage waveforms, it is recommended that the stator coil insulation be analyzed using PWM voltage waveforms in order to simulate actual conditions. 1 yea...|$|E
