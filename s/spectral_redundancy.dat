50|$|Vestigial {{sideband}} modulation (VSB) is a modulation method which {{attempts to}} eliminate the <b>spectral</b> <b>redundancy</b> of pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) signals. Modulating a carrier by a real-valued data sequence results in a sum and a difference frequency, resulting in two symmetrical carrier side-bands. The symmetry means {{that one of the}} sidebands is redundant, so removing one sideband still allows for demodulation. As filters with zero transition bandwidth cannot be realized, the filtering implemented leaves a vestige of the redundant sideband, hence the name “VSB”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{addition}} of two sinusoids is a linear operation that creates no new frequency components. So the bandwidth of the composite signal {{is comparable to}} the bandwidth of the DSB components. Effectively, the <b>spectral</b> <b>redundancy</b> of DSB enables a doubling of the information capacity using this technique. This comes at the expense of demodulation complexity. In particular, a DSB signal has zero-crossings at a regular frequency, which makes it easy to recover the phase of the carrier sinusoid. It is said to be self-clocking. But the sender and receiver of a quadrature-modulated signal must share a clock or otherwise send a clock signal. If the clock phases drift apart, the demodulated I and Q signals bleed into each other, yielding crosstalk. In this context, the clock signal is called a [...] "phase reference" [...] - in NTSC, which uses quadrature amplitude modulation, this is conveyed by the color burst, a synchronization signal.|$|E

30|$|FRESH {{filtering}} occupies two overlapping, but distinct fields: {{adaptive filtering}} and cyclostationary signal processing. The FRESH filter exploits the cyclostationary properties of signals and does so {{through the use}} of adaptive periodically time varying (PTV) filtering, making it well suited for interference mitigation [2]. It can be considered as supplementing existing methods, as it is a more general case of the optimal time invariant (TI) filter [2, 3]. FRESH filters, being PTV filters, outperform their TI counterparts at the cost of additional filtering complexity. As FRESH filters exploit <b>spectral</b> <b>redundancies,</b> they are broadly applicable. This includes further improving the interference mitigation properties of DSSS [4] and array processing systems [5]. A more in-depth discussion of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} FRESH filtering can be found in [6, 7].|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores image {{compression}} in the wavelet transform domain. This the- sis considers progressive compression based on bit plane coding. The rst {{part of the}} thesis investigates the scalar quantisation technique for multidimensional images such as colour and multispectral image. Embedded coders such as SPIHT and SPECK {{are known to be}} very simple and e cient algorithms for compression in the wavelet do- main. However, these algorithms require the use of lists to keep track of partitioning processes, and such lists involve high memory requirement during the encoding process. A listless approach has been proposed for multispectral {{image compression}} {{in order to reduce the}} working memory required. The earlier listless coders are extended into three dimensional coder so that <b>redundancy</b> in the <b>spectral</b> domain can be exploited. Listless implementation requires a xed memory of 4 bits per pixel to represent the state of each transformed coe cient. The state is updated during coding based on test of sig- ni cance. <b>Spectral</b> <b>redundancies</b> are exploited to improve the performance of the coder by modifying its scanning rules and the initial marker/state. For colour images, this is done by conducting a joint the signi cant test for the chrominance planes. In this way, the similarities between the chrominance planes can be exploited during the cod- ing process. Fixed memory listless methods that exploit <b>spectral</b> <b>redundancies</b> enable e cient coding while maintaining rate scalability and progressive transmission. The second part of the thesis addresses image compression using directional filters in the wavelet domain. A directional lter is expected to improve the retention of edge and curve information during compression. Current implementations of hybrid wavelet and directional (HWD) lters improve the contour representation of compressed images, but su er from the pseudo-Gibbs phenomenon in the smooth regions of the images. A di erent approach to directional lters in the wavelet transforms is proposed to remove such artifacts while maintaining the ability to preserve contours and texture. Imple- mentation with grayscale images shows improvements in terms of distortion rates and the structural similarity, especially in images with contours. The proposed transform manages to preserve the directional capability without pseudo-Gibbs artifacts and at the same time reduces the complexity of wavelet transform with directional lter. Fur-ther investigation to colour images shows the transform able to preserve texture and curve. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOur {{research}} {{focuses on}} reducing complexity of hyperspectral image codecs based on transform and/or subband coding, {{so they can be}} on-board a satellite. It is well-known that the Karhunen Loeve transform (KLT) can be sub-optimal for non Gaussian data. However, it is generally recommended as the best calculable coding transform in practice. Now, for a compression scheme compatible with both the JPEG 2000 Part 2 standard and the CCSDS recommendations for onboard satellite image compression, the concept and computation of optimal spectral transforms (OST), at high bit-rates, were carried out, under low restrictive hypotheses. These linear transforms are optimal for reducing <b>spectral</b> <b>redundancies</b> of multi- or hyper-spectral images, when the spatial redundancies are reduced with a fixed 2 -D discrete wavelet transform. The problem of OST is their heavy computational cost. In this paper we present the performances in coding of a quasi-optimal spectral transform, called exogenous OrthOST, obtained by learning an orthogonal OST on a sample of hyperspectral images from the spectrometer MERIS. Moreover, we compute an integer variant of OrthOST for lossless compression. The performances are compared to the ones of the KLT in both lossy and lossless compressions. We observe good performances of the exogenous OrthOST...|$|R
