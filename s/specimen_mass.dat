40|$|Concrete {{durability}} was investigated, taking {{under consideration}} the limestone {{content of the}} cement used, {{as well as the}} effect of chlorides on concrete's deterioration due to the thaumasite form of sulfate attack. A normal Portland cement and two Portland limestone cements (15 % and 35 % w/w limestone content) were used for concrete preparation. The specimens were immersed in two corrosive solutions (chloride-sulfate; sulfate) and stored at 5 ± 1 °C. Visual inspection of the <b>specimens,</b> <b>mass</b> measurements and compressive strength tests took place for 24 months. Concretes containing limestone, as cement constituent and/or as aggregate, suffered from the thaumasite form of sulfate attack, which was accompanied by brucite and secondary gypsum formation. Limestone cement concretes exhibited higher deterioration degree compared to the concrete made without limestone cement. The disintegration was more severe and rapid, the higher the limestone content of the cement used.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} {{chlorides}} on the thaumasite form of sulfate attack in limestone cement concrete is studied. Concrete specimens made from ordinary Portland cement and two Portland limestone cements (limestone content 15 % and 35 % respectively) were prepared.

40|$|For {{water content}} {{determinations}} on organic soils, several researchers have adopted lower oven-drying {{temperatures in the}} range 35 ? 90 ?C (instead of the standardised range for mineral soils of 100 ? 110 ?C) {{in order to prevent}} possible charring, oxidation and (or) vaporisation of substances other than water. However, at too low a temperature, not all of the relevant water is driven off. One major consequence of using such a wide range of drying temperatures for more sensitive materials is to produce considerable disparity in interpolated index values and in deduced correlations between water content and other engineering properties. This paper discusses the pros and cons regarding the ovendrying temperature adopted for routine water content determinations on organic sludges and residues.

30|$|Wood drying {{experiments}} are conducted {{in which the}} temperature and the drying rate are controlled independently. In relationship to drying processes, at least three mechanisms are believed {{to contribute to the}} properties of dried wood. However, only two of these are found to affect the properties of macroscopic specimens, the third mechanism being observable in microtomed earlywood sections, and possibly in specimens loaded in the radial direction. Degradation of structural components and irreversible hydrogen bonding (hornification) are found to contribute to both the hygroscopicity and the mechanical properties of macroscopic wood <b>specimens.</b> <b>Mass</b> loss from thermal degradation occurs predominantly in slow high-temperature drying processes. Irreversible hydrogen bonding takes place in high-temperature drying, in particular with high ultimate dryness. Regarding the effect on strength and stiffness, mass loss and hornification appear to compete. The third identified mechanism, microscopic cell wall damage caused by incompatible drying shrinkage of cell wall elements, does not seem to affect the mechanical properties of macroscopic wood specimens. Consequently, slow high-temperature drying processes do not provide much benefit regarding the mechanical behavior of dried wood. The reasons for this are discussed.|$|R
