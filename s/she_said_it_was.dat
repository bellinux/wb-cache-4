As a surprise, Winfrey shocked Lucci {{and the rest of the}} crowd by bringing back all of Erica's husbands. During February 2011, the TV Land sitcom Hot in Cleveland and All My Children did a crossover event. On the 16th, and February 23, Lucci, Michael E.

500|$|On 2 March 1882, Roderick Maclean, {{a disgruntled}} poet {{apparently}} offended by Victoria's refusal to accept {{one of his}} poems, shot at the Queen as her carriage left Windsor railway station. Two schoolboys from Eton College struck him with their umbrellas, until he was hustled away by a policeman. Victoria was outraged when he {{was found not guilty}} by reason of insanity, but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "worth being shot at—to see how much one is loved".|$|E
500|$|In letters {{written at}} the time, Rand's {{reaction}} to the film was positive. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the most faithful adaptation of a novel ever made in Hollywood and a [...] "real triumph". Sales of the novel increased {{as a result of}} interest spurred by the film. She displayed a more negative attitude later, saying she disliked the entire movie and complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements. Rand said she would never sell rights to another novel to a film company that did not allow her to pick the director and screenwriter, as well as edit the film.|$|E

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|Langford {{later wrote}} that Rae's murder and the {{subsequent}} blaming of Brendan were predictable, but made [...] "compelling drama", and that Rae {{had been killed in}} [...] "a rather gruesome and shocking fashion". Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail criticised the dearth of drug-related storylines in Hollyoaks, and though she praised the element of humour in the plot which saw Rae charged with possession of icing sugar, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "hardly the Marx Brothers". Inside Soap polled its readers on which Hollyoaks character they most wanted to be murdered by Silas. Rae and Theresa were voted as favourites to survive, while Leanne and Ruby Button (Anna Shaffer) were voted to be his next victims.|$|E

The character made her on-screen debut during the episode airing on 6 June 2008. Charlie was billed as having a [...] "warm heart" [...] and being [...] "family oriented"; however, her actions are often misunderstood and her persona has been perceived as [...] "brash".

Queen said the {{collaboration}} with Wisin & Yandel came about from her work on their album, La Revolución (2009). When speaking about the collaboration with Jadiel <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a decision she made with her heart: [...] "When I collaborate with colleagues, I don't care who is a hit {{on the radio and}} who isn't". The track [...] "I Do" [...] was to originally feature American R singer Beyoncé Knowles after Queen signed a contract with International Creative Management (ICM).|$|E

Patrick Freyne of the Sunday Tribune described the programme, in his television review column, as [...] "the People versus A Bunch of Bastards".

Hilary Fannin writing in The Irish Times, {{predicted that the}} programme, {{in relation to the}} economy, [...] "will [...] be allowed to debate much else in the months to come". She also rated it {{as one of the best}} current affairs programmes in 2009. The two reviewers said that, compared to The Late Late Show, Kenny was more [...] "in his comfort zone". Sarah Carey, also in The Irish Times, was disappointed by the tone of the programme even though Kenny was [...] "thoroughly enjoying himself". <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a televised version of Liveline.|$|E
50|$|Speaking of her poetry, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the bond}} of the {{internal}} with the external. In one direction or another, for me poetry always bridges that inside {{with that of the}} outside, is the way of passing {{from one to the other}} of these spaces, but which unites them. The internal only can expressed when reflected in that outside -that necessary knot-, the outside can be a mirror or vice versa.|$|R

Jessica Raine was offered the part of Emma Grayling, and later said that she had not realised [...] "what an institution Doctor Who is" [...] until she arrived on set. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> produced very differently from her series Call the Midwife. Raine had also worked with Matt Smith before on a play. Cross said that Raine and co-guest star Dougray Scott were good at filling out their characters, as he found it difficult to fully [...] "evoke the history of a quite complex relationship" [...] between their characters with just the script. Subsequent to filming her appearance in this episode, Raine was cast as Doctor Whos original producer, Verity Lambert, in a docudrama made for the show's 50th anniversary, An Adventure in Space and Time.|$|E

Franks {{did not expect to}} be asked to return in 2010, and said the call came as a surprise. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "ideal" [...] because it fitted in with another acting job she was undertaking at the time. She commented that Rainie would be [...] "unlikely to return without stirring up a bit of trouble". Rainie returned again on 12April2011 as a regular character, for Tanya's wedding to Greg Jessop, along with Tanya and Rainie's mother Cora, where Cora tries to build bridges between the sisters.|$|E
