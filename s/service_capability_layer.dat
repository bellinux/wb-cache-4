40|$|International audienceThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) {{released}} {{a set of}} specifications to define a restful architecture for enabling seamless service provisioning across heterogeneous Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) systems. The current version of this architecture is strongly centralized, thus requiring new enhancements to its scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. To bridge this gap, herein it is presented an Overlay <b>Service</b> <b>Capability</b> <b>Layer,</b> based on Information Centric Networking design. Key features, example use cases and preliminary performance assessments are also discussed to highlight the potential of our approach...|$|E
30|$|Taking a more telecom operator-oriented {{approach}} to service provisioning in Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) networks (which {{can be regarded}} as a generalization/superset of sensor networks), ETSI recently completed the specification of the functional architecture for M 2 M communications [34]. This architecture relies on a <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> <b>layer</b> located at the network and gateway (or device) domains, which is responsible for functions like application enablement, secure transport session establishment, network communication selection, network reachability and addressing, remote entity management, secure service bootstrap, etc. In contrast to SWE, the ETSI M 2 M architecture builds on the use of resources for the exchange of information between system components. The structure of the resources as well as API primitives has been specified and the information exchange follows a RESTful approach. In compliance with this approach, the communication between the gateway and the resource-constrained devices takes place through the COAP protocol [35], which is currently under standardization in IETF.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} multi-tiered {{architecture}} for middleware-independent Grid job management. The architecture {{consists of a}} number of services for well-defined tasks in the job management process, offering complete user-level isolation of <b>service</b> <b>capabilities,</b> multiple <b>layers</b> of abstraction, control, and fault tolerance. The middleware abstraction layer comprises components for targeted job submission, job control and resource discovery. The brokered job submission layer offers a Grid view on resources, including functionality for resource brokering and submission of jobs to selected resources. The reliable job submission layer includes components for fault tolerant execution of individual jobs and groups of independent jobs, respectively. The architecture is proposed as a composable set of tools rather than a monolithic solution, allowing users to select the individual components of interest. The prototype presented is implemented using the Globus Toolkit 4, integrated with the Globus Toolkit 4 and NorduGrid/ARC middlewares and based on existing and emerging Grid standards. A performance evaluation reveals that the overhead for resource discovery, brokering, middleware-specific format conversions, job monitoring, fault tolerance, and management of individual and groups of jobs is sufficiently small to motivate the use of the framework...|$|R
40|$|Reusing <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> to {{implement}} different integrated services in Next Generation networks (NGN) provides flexible and open service architecture capable of creating innovative services {{that do not}} need to be standardized and are based on the standardized <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> In this architecture, invoking each integrated service may provoke the invocation of multiple <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The <b>service</b> architecture must therefore provide a mechanism to manage the interactions and the incompatibilities that may occur between these <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> invocations. Due to the shortcomings in the NGN service architecture domain for defining such mechanisms, we define in this paper, new architectural concepts regarding the implementation of a <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> interaction manager as well as the functionalities that this new entity must provide to avoid conflicts between <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> interactions in order {{to implement}} integrated services based on the standardized <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> ...|$|R

A growing number of studies have demonstrated that <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> are related to competitive advantage and organizational performance. When encountering an environment characterized by economic uncertainty, the shipping industry was required to emphasize dynamic capabilities associated with adaptation to sustain competitive advantage. The purpose of this study was to examine the linkages between dynamic <b>capabilities,</b> <b>service</b> <b>capabilities,</b> competitive advantage, and organizational performance in container shipping using data surveys from 134 respondents in container shipping firms in Taiwan. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to identify the crucial dimensions underlying dynamic <b>capabilities,</b> and <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses. The research findings indicated that dynamic capabilities positively influenced both competitive advantage and <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>capabilities</b> and competitive advantage were positively related to organizational performance.

In this article, we intend to present an alternative approach for service creation, that is, service composition, which reuses existing <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> to implement the innovative services. For this goal, we make a survey for current service delivery mechanisms in IMS and the works being undertaken by the standardization organizations for advanced service composition management. By comparing their solutions, analyzing the advantages and shortcomings, we propose a service composition management model which enriches the concept of SCIM (<b>Service</b> <b>Capability</b> Interaction Manager) for managing and brokering the <b>service</b> <b>capabilities,</b> creating the <b>service</b> logic through a visual environment, as well as exposing the <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> to <b>service</b> provider...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), {{which makes}} a final product for the {{consumer}} marketplace by purchasing components from its suppliers, faces unexpected supply network failures and market events, models of suppliers‟ manufacturing <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> can provide information required for efficient recovery of these supply network. Models of manufacturing <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> include descriptions of both material processing and manufacturing information processing capabilities of a supplier. Presently, manufacturers and suppliers are challenged in making and streamlining sourcing decisions due to limited, imprecise, or ambiguous semantics associated with these models. This paper identifies issues with existing manufacturing <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> (MSC) models by analyzing several practical use cases found in existing web portals containing supplier capability descriptions. We identify {{the use of an}} ontology-based manufacturing <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> model can address the imprecision and ambiguity issues. This paper also proposes an approach based on concept analyses on archetypal data sets as a way to enrich semantics and address the limited semantic issues. Several model extension methods for semantic enrichments are formalized within the approach. We demonstrate the approach on an ontology-based manufacturing service model called manufacturing service description language (MSDL) using data sets including product and <b>service</b> categories, detailed <b>capability</b> descriptions of specific processes, and product-term definitions...|$|R
