The value of the South Korean won against the US Dollar was the strongest during his administration since 1997. Due to the <b>strong</b> <b>currency,</b> {{for the first time}} in history, South Korea became the world's 10th largest economy and exceeded the $20,000 milestone in nominal GDP per capita during his administration.|$|E
25|$|These {{new forms}} of {{monetary}} interdependence made possible huge capital flows. During the Bretton Woods era, countries were reluctant to alter exchange rates formally even in cases of structural disequilibria. Because such changes had {{a direct impact on}} certain domestic economic groups, they came to be seen as political risks for leaders. As a result, official exchange rates often became unrealistic in market terms, providing a virtually risk-free temptation for speculators. They could move from a weak to a <b>strong</b> <b>currency</b> hoping to reap profits when a revaluation occurred. If, however, monetary authorities managed to avoid revaluation, they could return to other currencies with no loss. The combination of risk-free speculation with the availability of huge sums was highly destabilizing.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{late 1990s}} {{a series of}} {{financial}} crises caused the government to abandon its own currency, the sucre, and adopted the U.S. dollar. Ecuador formally adopted the U.S. dollar in the year 2000. Introducing a <b>stronger</b> <b>currency</b> caused great inflation that deeply affected the agricultural industry.|$|R
500|$|Devaluation, {{with its}} adverse consequences, has {{historically}} rarely been a preferred strategy. According to economist Richard N. Cooper, writing in 1971, a substantial devaluation {{is one of}} the most [...] "traumatic" [...] policies a government can adopt – it almost always resulted in cries of outrage and calls for the government to be replaced. Devaluation can lead to a reduction in citizens' standard of living as their purchasing power is reduced both when they buy imports and when they travel abroad. It also can add to inflationary pressure. Devaluation can make interest payments on international debt more expensive if those debts are denominated in a foreign currency, and it can discourage foreign investors. At least until the 21st century, a <b>strong</b> <b>currency</b> was commonly seen as a mark of prestige, while devaluation was associated with weak governments.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} operations made in dollars {{were subject to}} a <b>strong</b> <b>currency</b> substitution to pesos, the [...] "pesification". There were disputes over the exchange rate of such substitution, as the current price of the dollar in the open market would force most firms and individual debtor to bankruptcy. The initial policy was to make 1 to 1 substitutions to the operations below 100,000 dollars. Another conflict was the corralito, imposed by De la Rúa, which attempted to stop the bank run by forbidding the withdrawal of money from bank accounts. Duhalde promised in his oath of office speech that [...] "The one who deposited dollars will receive dollars". The minister of economy Jorge Remes Lenicov pointed out {{that that would be}} impossible, as the amount of dollars required was higher than even the foreign-exchange reserves of the Central Bank. Duhalde acknowledged two weeks later that he was mistaken. The bank accounts in dollars would be [...] "pesified" [...] at a 1.4 exchange rate, and the state financed the banks for the different rates with other operations. The taxes of public services were [...] "pesified" [...] and fixed at their current values. Most industries benefited from the [...] "pesification" [...] and the devaluation, as they could now export at higher prices, and the economy started to improve. The jump in the international price of soybean in July 2002 also proved highly beneficial. The devaluation also increased the price of imported products, which allowed import substitution industrialization. As the local prices became cheap in dollars, international tourism to the country was increased. The national state absorbed the debts of the provinces and the bonds used as alternative currency, on the condition that they transferred the power to issue bonds.|$|E

25|$|During the European debt crisis, {{government}} bonds of some countries (Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Austria) {{have been sold}} at negative yields. Suggested explanations include desire for safety and protection against the eurozone breaking up (in which case some eurozone countries might redenominate their debt into a <b>stronger</b> <b>currency).</b>|$|R
50|$|World {{political}} leaders, national {{ministers of}} finance and central bank directors coordinated their efforts to reduce fears, but the crisis continued. At the end of October 2008 a currency crisis developed, with investors transferring vast capital resources into <b>stronger</b> <b>currencies</b> such as the yen, the dollar and the Swiss franc, leading many emergent economies to seek aid from the International Monetary Fund.|$|R
40|$|Aggregate {{issuance}} of international bonds {{is found to}} be significantly higher in <b>strong</b> <b>currencies</b> than in weak ones. The mix of currencies is also found to be influenced by interest rate differentials, with greater issuance in higher-yielding currencies, and by the amount of home country issuance. Taken together, the results suggest that both the investor's and the issuer's preferences determine currency choice in international bond issuance. ...|$|R

50|$|Often, foreign {{exchange}} controls {{can result in}} the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker <b>currency</b> for <b>stronger</b> <b>currencies.</b> This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.|$|R

40|$|The present article {{analyses}} {{the current}} state of international monetary policy and arrangements. The author first examines the nature of monetary arrangements guided by political institutions that are tempted to exploit the monetary system through the monopoly right to issue base money. The development of international institutions for controlling the monopoly right, the system of fixed exchange rates and the gold standard, and the eventual collapse of the Bretton Woods system are then reviewed. The recent development of the European Monetary System, its central issues and its prospects are then assessed. The author concludes that if the bureaucratic approach encouraged by the political process continues to disregard the one and only condition assuring a viable fix-rate system, that is sever constraints national monetary policies, the most likely outcome of the EMS will be a new series of speculative waves and an erratic monetary growth in the <b>stronger</b> <b>currency</b> areas with intermittent pressures on the <b>stronger</b> <b>currency</b> areas to accommodate the comparatively weaker area.

500|$|Not all {{academics}} {{accepted the}} criticism against Keynes – Minsky {{has argued that}} Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, {{and that it was}} unfortunate that this branch of economics had even continued to be called [...] "Keynesian". Writing in The American Prospect, Robert Kuttner argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of capital controls, which allowed capital flight from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to Gresham's law phenomenon (where weak <b>currencies</b> undermine <b>strong</b> <b>currencies).</b>|$|R

50|$|New {{marketing}} strategies {{developed for the}} key UK market encouraged customers to explore premium Australian brands, while maintaining sales of the lower-margin high-volume brands, following research that indicated a celebratory dinner {{was more likely to}} be accompanied by an inferior French wine than a premium Australian wine. This is partly due to exchange rate fluctuations, making Australian wines appear much cheaper than French wines in the UK and hence perceived as being of poorer quality. While this situation may be somewhat mitigated by the continued rise in the Australian dollar during 2010, the <b>stronger</b> <b>currency</b> threatens to weaken Australian exports to the crucial US market.|$|R

In the early 1990s the European Monetary System was strained by the differing economic policies and conditions of its members, especially the newly reunified Germany, and Britain (which had initially declined to join and only did so in 1990) permanently withdrew from the system in September 1992. Speculative attacks on the French Franc during the following year led to the so-called Brussels Compromise in August 1993 which established a new fluctuation band of +15%.|$|R
