5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present <b>special</b> <b>problems</b> due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I draw a {{distinction}} between a special and a general version of the Gettier problem. I argue that the <b>special</b> <b>problem</b> is partially a logical problem, {{as well as an}} epistemological one, and I show that it is very easy to solve. This is interesting, since most of the Gettier-style examples that appear in the literature fall under the <b>special</b> <b>problem,</b> and hence as they stand they too are very easy to solve...|$|R

Very fine solids and solids with densities close to the density of water pose <b>special</b> <b>problems.</b> In such case filtration or ultrafiltration may be required.

25|$|Cataract {{extraction}} following {{refractive surgery}} poses <b>special</b> <b>problems</b> {{for the patient}} and the surgeon because the corneal change as a result of refractive surgery complicates accurate keratometry, a key element of lens implant power calculation. After laser refractive surgery for myopia, this could result in overestimation of corneal power, underestimation of the IOL power required, and hyperopic outcomes after cataract surgery.|$|E

25|$|The main micronutrients are molybdenum, zinc, and copper. These {{elements}} are provided as water-soluble salts. Iron presents <b>special</b> <b>problems</b> because it converts to insoluble (bio-unavailable) compounds at moderate soil pH and phosphate concentrations. For this reason, iron is often administered as a chelate complex, e.g., the EDTA derivative. The micronutrient needs {{depend on the}} plant. For example, sugar beets appear to require boron, and legumes require cobalt.|$|E

25|$|In 1795, the First Russian Orthodox Church was {{established}} in Kodiak. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society. As a result, {{an increasing number of}} Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska. Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state. In 2009 there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for whom observance of halakha may pose <b>special</b> <b>problems).</b> Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to defend}} airfields {{presented}} <b>special</b> <b>problems.</b> Airfields were large open areas where any above-ground structure would present a hazard to aircraft. One solution was the Pickett-Hamilton Fort; this {{was designed to}} be lowered to ground level while aircraft were operating, but to be raised when necessary by means of a hydraulic mechanism. The fort was manned by a crew of two with light machine guns. Access was provided by means of a hatch in the roof. The forts were prone to flooding and they were not sufficiently strong to bear the weight of the heavy aircraft developed during the war. 48 examples of this type remain extant but a number of these are no longer in their original locations.|$|E

25|$|Road {{and bridge}} repair methods. There were {{several ways to}} keep traffic moving amid the {{destruction}} wrought by the bombers. Simple pontoon bridges were made of lashed together bundles of bamboo, topped by heavy wooden planking. Sturdier pontoon structures were made by tying wooden canal boats together â€“ with camouflage measures to hide them during the day from aerial observation. Bridges were also built underwater to escape detection. As noted above, supplies, equipment and material was pre-stocked along roads, and near various choke points like ferry crossings so that repairs could be made quickly. Delayed action bombs caused <b>special</b> <b>problems.</b> Designated personnel were tasked with dismantling them, or watchmen kept them under observation- signaling all within blast distance to disperse when the bombs showed signs of detonating. Repairs were often done at night when the enemy aircraft would be less active.|$|E
25|$|The union, {{faced with}} a {{challenge}} to its very existence, threatened to strike if the Mayor went through with this plan. With {{the support of the}} national CIO, the union was able to maintain its collective bargaining agreements and the right to represent the IRT and BMT employees after the City took over those systems in 1940. The union soon found itself struggling with the <b>special</b> <b>problems</b> of creating a civil service system for thousands of employees, while providing representation for thousands of workers who faced problems with meeting the City's new naturalization and medical requirements. But the union lost ground among its members, both in terms of actual numbers after it lost the closed shop and in terms of actual support, since many workers who may have remained members saw the union as less important now that they had the seeming job security that civil service status promised and the union had lost the right to strike.|$|E
25|$|People with A-T have {{a highly}} {{increased}} incidence (approximately 25% lifetime risk) of cancers, particularly lymphomas and leukemia, but other cancers can occur. When possible, treatment should avoid {{the use of}} radiation therapy and chemotherapy drugs that work {{in a way that}} is similar to radiation therapy (radiomimetic drugs), as these are particularly toxic for people with A-T. The <b>special</b> <b>problems</b> of managing cancer are sufficiently complicated that treatment should be done only in academic oncology centers and after consultation with physicians who have specific expertise in A-T. Unfortunately, there is no way to predict which individuals will develop cancer. Because leukemia and lymphomas differ from solid tumors in not progressing from solitary to metastatic stages, there is less need to diagnose them early in their appearance. Surveillance for leukemia and lymphoma is thus not helpful, other than considering cancer as a diagnostic possibility whenever possible symptoms of cancer (e.g. persistent swollen lymph glands, unexplained fever) arise.|$|E
