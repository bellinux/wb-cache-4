5|$|In the Puppet Theater minigame, {{the player}} is tasked with {{finishing}} the script {{of an ongoing}} play so that it makes <b>sense.</b> <b>If</b> the player chooses a word {{that does not make}} sense {{in the context of the}} play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{mentioned}} in discussion of constitutional convention. Whilst it replaced conventions regarding {{the role of}} the House of Lords, it also relies on several others. Section 1(1) only makes <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> money bills do not arise in the House of Lords and the provisions in section 2(1) only if proceedings on a public bill are completed in a single session, otherwise they must fail and be put through procedure again.|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E

5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is {{because of what happened}} in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E
5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles {{to make sense of}} what he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes no <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two different versions of the story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E

50|$|First, the {{atmosphere}} may absorb {{part of the}} energy passing through it.

25|$|Documents {{written by}} {{contemporary}} Spaniards and Franciscan friars argue {{that for the}} name to be changed to a native name, such as Tepeaca or Tepeaquilla, would not make <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> a Nahuatl name were already in use, and suggest the Spanish Guadalupe was the original.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} {{feature of the}} concept is that {{opportunity}} cost would only make <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> the opportunity were fixed or reasonably limited.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the common {{definition}} of adaptation, a central concept in evolution, is a trait that was functional to the reproductive {{success of the}} organism and that is thus now present due to being selected for; that is, function and evolution are inseparable. However a trait can have a current function that is adaptive without being an adaptation in this <b>sense,</b> <b>if</b> for instance the environment has changed. Imagine {{an environment in which}} having a small body suddenly conferred benefit on an organism when previously body size had had no effect on survival.|$|E

25|$|The {{age of the}} {{universe}} is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> the flat, static Minkowski spacetime conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, spacetime is curved in a way that corresponds to the expansion of space, as evidenced by Hubble's law. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.|$|E
25|$|Implicitly {{for this}} definition, the second law of {{thermodynamics}} provides information that establishes the virtuous {{character of the}} temperature so defined. It provides that any working substance that complies with the requirement stated in this definition {{will lead to the}} same ratio of thermodynamic temperatures, which in this sense is universal, or absolute. The second law of thermodynamics also provides that the thermodynamic temperature defined in this way is positive, because this definition requires that the heat reservoirs not be in thermal equilibrium with one another, and the cycle can be imagined to operate only in one <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> net work is to be supplied to the work reservoir.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of leet is its unique approach to orthography, using substitutions of other characters, letters or otherwise, to represent a letter or letters in a word. For more casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use homoglyphs, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. The choice of symbol is not fixedâ€”anything that the reader can make sense of is valid. However, this practice is not extensively used in regular leet; more often it is seen in situations where the argot (i.e., secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the average reader cannot make sense of is valid; a valid reader should himself try to make <b>sense,</b> <b>if</b> deserving of the underlying message. Another use for Leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords. Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (usually alphanumeric and underscore) require less extensive forms of Leet when used in this application.|$|E

[...] Variety gave a negative review, noting: [...] "A particularly poor script {{is the basis for}} the ills besetting this mystery melodrama.

500|$|Tresham {{has long}} been {{suspected}} as the letter's author. Mark Nicholls states that he almost certainly wrote it, pointing {{to the fact that}} once Catesby was made aware of its existence he immediately suspected Tresham and went with Thomas Wintour to confront him. [...] The two threatened to [...] "hang him", but [...] "with such oaths and emphatic assertions" [...] Tresham managed to convince the pair of his innocence, the next day urging them by letter to abandon the plot. [...] Antonia Fraser suggests that Catesby and Wintour's decision to believe him should not be disregarded. [...] While making his deathbed confession in the Tower of London, Tresham failed to mention the letter; an omission which in her opinion makes no <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> he is to be regarded as its author, especially considering that its recipient was by then being credited as the country's saviour. [...] Author Alan Haynes views Tresham as the most likely culprit, but raises the possibility that Cecil penned the letter himself, to protect a source.|$|E
500|$|Nicole Perlman, who was {{enrolled}} in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009, was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on. Out of those, Perlman chose Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning's Guardians of the Galaxy, due to her interest in space and science fiction, adding, [...] "I think [...] were a little taken aback when I chose Guardians, because there were ones {{that would make a}} lot more <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> you were a romantic-comedy writer or something like that." [...] Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the Guardians universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft, before Gunn was brought in in early 2012 to contribute to the script. Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because [...] "it didnâ€™t work" [...] for him; he would use the film The Dirty Dozen as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel. Gunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no Walkman; he stated, [...] "In Nicoleâ€™s script everything is pretty different... it's not about the same stuff. But that's how the WGA works. They like first writers an awful lot." [...] In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script, however, it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script, since he did not receive production credit.|$|E

500|$|William of Malmesbury {{wrote that}} Alfred the Great honoured his young {{grandson}} with a ceremony {{in which he}} gave him a scarlet cloak, a belt set with gems, and a sword with a gilded scabbard. Medieval Latin scholar Michael Lapidge and historian Michael Wood see this as designating Ã†thelstan as a potential heir {{at a time when}} the claim of Alfred's nephew, Ã†thelwold, to the throne represented a threat to the succession of Alfred's direct line, but historian Janet Nelson suggests that it should be seen in the context of conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s, and might reflect an intention to divide the realm between his son and his grandson after his death. Historian Martin Ryan goes further, suggesting that at the end of his life Alfred may have favoured Ã†thelstan rather than Edward as his successor. An acrostic poem praising prince [...] "Adalstan", and prophesying a great future for him, has been interpreted by Lapidge as referring to the young Ã†thelstan, punning on the old English meaning of his name, [...] "noble stone". Lapidge and Wood see the poem as a commemoration of Alfred's ceremony by one of his leading scholars, John the Old Saxon. In Michael Wood's view, the poem confirms the truth of William of Malmesbury's account of the ceremony. Wood also suggests that Ã†thelstan may have been the first English king to be groomed from childhood as an intellectual, and that John was probably his tutor. However, Sarah Foot argues that the acrostic poem makes better <b>sense</b> <b>if</b> it is dated to the beginning of Ã†thelstan's reign.|$|E
