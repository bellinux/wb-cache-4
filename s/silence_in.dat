40|$|Virulence-attenuating hypoviruses of {{the species}} Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV 1) encode a papain-like protease, p 29, that shares {{similarities}} with the potyvirus-encoded suppressor of RNA silencing HC-Pro. We now report that hypovirus CHV 1 -EP 713 -encoded p 29 can suppress RNA <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> the natural host, the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica. Hairpin RNA-triggered <b>silencing</b> was suppressed <b>in</b> C. parasitica strains expressing p 29, and transformation of a transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP) -silenced strain with p 29 resulted in an increased number of transformants with elevated GFP expression levels. The CHV 1 -EP 713 p 29 protein was also shown to suppress both virus-induced and agroinfiltration-induced RNA silencing and systemic spread of <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> GFP-expressing transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana line 16 c plants. The demonstration that a mycovirus encodes a suppressor of RNA silencing provides circumstantial evidence that RNA <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> fungi may serve as an antiviral defense mechanism.

5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> {{response to a}} specific question posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed {{because he did not}} expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's <b>silence</b> <b>in</b> response to a question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{interest}} {{has been focused}} on inducing RNA interference (RNAi) in neurons to study gene function and identify new targets for disease intervention. Although small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been used to <b>silence</b> genes <b>in</b> neurons, in vivo delivery of RNAi remains a major challenge limiting its applications. We have developed a highly efficient method for <b>in</b> vivo gene <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> dorsal root ganglia (DRG) using replication-defective herpes simplex viral (HSV- 1) vectors. HSV-mediated delivery of short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting reporter genes resulted in highly effective and specific <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> neuronal and non-neuronal cells in culture and in the DRG of mice in vivo including in a transgenic mouse model. We further establish proof of concept by demonstrating <b>in</b> vivo <b>silencing</b> of the endogenous trpv 1 gene. These data are the first to show <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> DRG neurons in vivo by vector-mediated delivery of shRNA. Our results support the utility of HSV vectors for gene <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> peripheral neurons and the potential application of this technology to the study of nociceptive processes and in pain gene target validation studies...|$|R

Here, we investigate the mode of action of P 50 suppressor. An agroinfiltration assay in GFP-expressing N. benthamiana line 16 c (GFP-plant) showed that P 50 could not prevent the short-distance spread of <b>silencing.</b> <b>In</b> grafting experiments, the systemic <b>silencing</b> was inhibited <b>in</b> GFP-plants (scion) grafted on P 50 -expressing N. benthamiana (P 50 -plant; rootstock) when GFP <b>silencing</b> was induced <b>in</b> rootstock. In double-grafted plants, GFP-plant (scion) /P 50 -plant (interstock) /GFP-plant (rootstock), the systemic <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> scion was inhibited when GFP <b>silencing</b> was induced <b>in</b> rootstock. Analysis of P 50 deletion mutants indicated that the N-terminal region (amino acids 1 – 284) is important for its suppressor activity. In gel mobility shift assay, P 50 lacks binding ability with siRNAs. These results indicated that P 50 has a unique suppressor activity that specifically inhibits the long-distance movement of silencing signals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{contrast}} to diploids, most polyploid plant species, {{which include the}} hexaploid bread wheat, possess an additional layer of epigenetic complexity. Several {{studies have demonstrated that}} polyploids are affected by homoeologous gene <b>silencing,</b> a process <b>in</b> which sub-genomic genomic copies are selectively transcriptionally inactivated. This form of silencing can be tissue specific and may be linked to developmental or stress responses. Results Evidence was sought as to whether the frequency of homoeologous <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> in vitro cultured wheat callus differ from that in differentiated organs, given that disorganized cells are associated with a globally lower level of DNA methylation. Using a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) platform to detect the pattern of expression of 20 homoeologous sets of single-copy genes known to be affected by this form of <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> the root and/or leaf, we observed no <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> any of the wheat callus tissue tested. Conclusion Our results suggest that much of the homoeologous <b>silencing</b> observed <b>in</b> differentiated tissues is probably under epigenetic control, rather than being linked to genomic instability arising from allopolyploidization. This study reinforces the notion of plasticity in the wheat epi-genome. </p...|$|R

40|$|Proteins of the GW 182 {{family are}} {{essential}} for miRNA-mediated gene <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> animal cells; they interact with Argonaute proteins (AGOs) and are required for both the translational repression and mRNA degradation mediated by miRNAs. To gain insight {{into the role of}} the GW 182 –AGO 1 interaction <b>in</b> <b>silencing,</b> we generated protein mutants that do not interact and tested them in complementation assays. We show that silencing of miRNA targets requires the N-terminal domain of GW 182, which interacts with AGO 1 through multiple glycine–tryptophan (GW) -repeats. Indeed, a GW 182 mutant that does not interact with AGO 1 cannot rescue <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> cells depleted of endogenous GW 182. Conversely, silencing is impaired by mutations in AGO 1 that strongly reduce the interaction with GW 182 but not with miRNAs. We further show that a GW 182 mutant that does not localize to P-bodies but interacts with AGO 1 rescues <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> GW 182 -depleted cells, even though in these cells, AGO 1 also fails to localize to P-bodies. Finally, we show that in addition to the N-terminal AGO 1 -binding domain, the middle and C-terminal regions of GW 182 (referred to as the bipartite silencing domain) {{are essential for}} silencing. Together our results indicate that miRNA <b>silencing</b> <b>in</b> animal cells is mediated by AGO 1 in complex with GW 182, and that P-body localization is not required for silencing...|$|R
