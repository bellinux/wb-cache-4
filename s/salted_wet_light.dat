In this paper we review wet etching of three important materials, namely ZnO, GaN and SiC. While ZnO is readily etched in many acid solutions including HNO 3 /HCl and HF/HNO 3, and in the nonacid acetyleacetone, the group III nitrides and SiC {{are very difficult to}} wet etch and generally dry etching is used. Various etchants for GaN and SiC have been investigated, including aqueous mineral acid and base solutions, and molten <b>salts.</b> <b>Wet</b> etches have a variety of applications to wide bandgap semiconductor technology, including defect decoration, polarity and polytype (for SiC) identification by producing characteristic pits or hillocks, and device fabrication on smooth surfaces.

50|$|With the {{advantage}} of being located near the Arabian peninsula, Somali traders have increasingly begun to challenge Australia's traditional dominance over the Gulf Arab livestock and meat market, offering quality animals at very low prices. In response, Gulf Arab states have started to make strategic investments in the country, with Saudi Arabia building livestock export infrastructure and the United Arab Emirates purchasing large farmlands. Most livestock is exported through the northern Port of Bosaso and Port of Berbera. In March 2013, livestock traders also resumed exports from the southern Port of Mogadishu. After inspection at a newly constructed animal quarantine facility in Mogadishu, 13,000 goats and 2,435 camels were sent to markets in Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.A ten-year-old manufacturing, distributing, wholesale and import/export company, the Bosaso Tannery processes <b>wet</b> <b>salted,</b> dry <b>salted,</b> <b>wet</b> blue, limed, pickled, and air/frame dried sheep and goat hides and skin.

Raw camel hides and sheep and goat skin are also dispatched to the United Arab Emirates. The wet blue type is exported to the Middle East and various parts of Europe.

In this study, a new methodology based on Artificial-Neural-Networks (ANN) is developed to predict Epoxy insulators lifetime using laboratory measurements of their surface leakage current under accelerated aging. The effect of adding fillers with various concentration rates to the Epoxy insulators such as; Calcium Silicate (CaSiO 2), Mica and Magnesium Oxide (Mg(OH) 2) on their lifetimes is compared with the base case (no filler and dry condition). Furthermore, the lifetime of each specimen under study is examined under various weather conditions such as dry, <b>wet,</b> <b>salt</b> <b>wet</b> (NaCl) and hydro carbon solvent Naphtha. The obtained results are weighing against the experimental measured data based on two ANN techniques; i. e., Feed-Forward-Neural-Network (FNN) and Recurrent-Neural-Network (RNN).
