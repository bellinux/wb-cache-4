Abstract-In an {{increasingly}} noisy society, methods of reducing noise {{are becoming more}} important. Filtering has the great importance {{in the field of}} the biomedical signal processing. In many applications of signal processing it is desired to remove <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>interferences</b> while leaving the broadband signal unchanged. Examples are in the areas of communication, control, biomedical engineering and others. A typical one is to cancel 60 Hz power line interference in the recording of electrocardiogram (ECG). Usually this task can be achieved by the notch filters characterized by a unit gain at all frequencies except at the sinusoidal frequencies in which their gain is zero. To eliminate one narrow band of frequencies one uses a so-called "notch " filter (named for the fact that it makes a notch in the frequency spectrum).

30|$|To {{compare the}} notch behaviors, we {{evaluated}} {{the transfer function}} from d(n) to e(n) at the steady state. The results are presented in Figure 6. Also, the power spectral densities of the recovered target signals are presented in Figure 7. The transfer functions in Figure 6 show that the VSS-NLMS algorithm distorts the frequency response around the frequencies of <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>interferences</b> with large amplitudes, which is clearly visible at 250 and 1, 020 Hz. As a result, the VSS-NLMS algorithm produced high EMSE. On the other hand, both the previous and the proposed VSS-GAL algorithms produced insignificant distortions at frequencies other than the interference frequencies. However, the notches produced by the previous VSS-GAL algorithm were not sufficiently accurate so that the interferences were not completely removed, which {{can be seen from}} the steady-state power spectral density in Figure 7 (b). Consequently, the proposed VSS-GAL algorithm achieved the lowest EMSE among the algorithms, and the target signal was recovered with the smallest distortion.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 91 - 94) This research presents three novel adaptive noise cancellation {{techniques for}} reducing periodic interferences, such as engines, blowers, compressors, and fans. (1) The sub-band two-model adaptive HR noise cancellation scheme structure enables {{the cancellation of}} multiple <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>interferences</b> in a received speech signal. Compared with the classical LMS adaptive noise cancellation method of B. Widrow et al., this new structure has two major differences. First, the quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks {{have been used to}} decompose signals into sub-bands. Second, a new constrained time-varying HR notch filter and adaptive HR bandpass filter were developed to form a two-model adaptive HR noise canceller to remove the multi-rate noise from a received signal. Computer simulations were performed using a set of actual speech signals corrupted by car engine noise. Experiments demonstrated that more than 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements have been achieved. (2) In the case that the reference signal is not available, a new noise control structure using a single-pulse excitation generator, the synchronous adaptive noise control with LPC noise synthesizer, was developed. The linear predictive coding (LPC) technique is employed along with the adaptive noise-cancelling technique to form this new structure. The comparison result shows that the proposed structure converges faster and has a better mean-squared error compared with Elliott and Darlington’s method, {{in which there is no}} LPC noise synthesizer involved. (3) An alternative structure, the synchronous adaptive noise control with multi-pulse excitation, using a multi-pulse generator is also presented. Because of the better exciting signal generated by the multi-pulse excitation generator, the LPC synthesizer can be removed to reduce the complexity. Due to the engine noise’s periodic and harmonic properties, the weighting process has been omitted to further reduce computation cost. A faster convergence rate and a more than 10 dB mean-squared error (MSE) improvement have been achieved by using the new structure, as compared with that of Elliott and Darlington. M. S.

The quantum description predicts <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>interference</b> for specific {{outcomes of the}} experiment, and these predictions can be verified in experiment. In the spirit of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen {{it is possible to}} ask if the quantum-mechanical description (of this setup) can be considered complete. This question will be answered in detail in this paper, by delineating the quite complicated relation between energy-time entanglement experiments and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) elements of reality. The mentioned <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>interference</b> pattern is the same as that giving a violation in the usual Bell experiment. Even so, depending on the precise requirements made on the local realist model, this can imply (a) no violation, (b) smaller violation than usual, or (c) full violation of the appropriate statistical bound. Alternatives include (a) using only the measurement outcomes as EPR elements of reality, (b) using the emission time as EPR element of reality, (c) using path realism, or (d) using a modified setup. This paper discusses the nature of these alternatives and how to choose between them. The subtleties of this discussion needs {{to be taken into account}} when designing and setting up experiments intended to test local realism.

When a multiply scattering medium is illuminated by a laser beam, the scattered intensity results from the interference between the amplitudes associated with the various scattering paths; for a disordered medium, the interference terms are washed out when averaged over many sample configurations, except in a narrow angular range around exact backscattering where the average intensity is enhanced.

It shows that the error transfer function approach is very accurate for extremely narrow bandwidth input signals, and it deteriorates as the bandwidth of input signal increases. 1. &quot;RODUCTTON Traditional analysis of adaptive filter performance typically invokes a set of assumptions that the filter error feedback is independent of current input data [I]. These assumptions simplify the analysis of the adaptive filter performance and the resulting steady-state Mean Square Error (MSE) is bounded by the MSE produced by the finite-length Wiener filter. It has been shown that these well known assumptions mask the nonlinear effects that arise in the LMS adaptive filters and it is possible for adaptive filter using Least-Mean-Square (LMS) algorithm to outperform a finite-length Wiener filter in the cases of adaptive channel equalization for narrowband interference suppression [2], adaptive noise cancellation when the primary and reference inputs are narrowband signals with slightly different frequencies [3 J, and adaptive prediction for narrowband signal recovery in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with stationary or chirped input signals [4][5][6]. A simplified method to approximate the steady-state MSE of the LMS adaptive filter without invoking the independence assumptions is the error transfer function approach, which is derived fiom the transfer function method proposed in [7][8].
