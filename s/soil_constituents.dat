50|$|Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide occurs {{naturally}} as four minerals, the polymorphs {{denoted by}} the Greek letters α, β, γ and δ. Goethite, α-FeO(OH), {{has been used}} as a pigment since prehistoric times. Akaganéite is the β polymorph, formed by weathering and noted for its presence in some meteorites and the lunar surface. The γ polymorph lepidocrocite is commonly encountered as rust on the inside of steel water pipes and tanks. Feroxyhyte (δ) is formed under the high pressure conditions of sea and ocean floors, being thermodynamically unstable with respect to the α polymorph (goethite) at surface conditions. It also occurs as siderogel - a colloid - and limonite, which is a commonly found mixture of mainly goethite, lepidocrocite, quartz and clay minerals. Goethite and lepidocrocite, both crystallizing in orthorhombic system, are the most common forms of iron(III) oxide-hydroxide and the most important mineral carriers of iron in soils. The mineral ferrihydrite, also a <b>soil</b> <b>constituent,</b> is a related compound.|$|R
40|$|Tillage redistributes {{soil and}} {{contributes}} {{significantly to the}} within-field soil variation, especially on topographically complex terrain. Although {{the basic principles of}} the redistribution are well understood, models for simulating the redistribution are poor predictors. This paper presents a modelling structure that allows a simulation of the redistribution of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> on complex topographies for various tillage implements. The model simulates the redistribution of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> by convoluting the probability distribution of the tillage displacement with the spatial distribution of the <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> The probability distributions in two dimensions are derived from a series of tillage experiments conducted with a mouldboard plough at various positions in the landscape. Furthermore, the effects of topography and tillage direction on the probability distributions were characterized and implemented in the model.

40|$|Recent studies clearly {{indicated}} that soil tillage {{is a major}} Factor affecting soil redistribution on arable land. However, existing modeling studies of the redistribution of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> by tillage are largely theoretical in nature {{due to the lack}} of sufficient experimental data. This paper describes the results of field experiments carried out with a moldboard plow on different slope gradients showing that an important net downslope translocation and dispersion of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> is associated with soil tillage. Both translocation and dispersion are strongly affected by slope gradient. Available experimental evidence suggests that redistribution of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> can be modeled by convoluting the displacement probability distribution with the spatial distribution of the soil constituent. The convolution model presented here was found to be superior to existing models because it accounts for dispersion, directionality of tillage, and topogaphy.

The total arsenic (As) content ranged from ca. 20 – 100 mg kg− 1 and the bioaccessible As content, as measured by a physiologically based in vitro extraction test, ranged from 1 to 6 mg kg− 1. A chemometric algorithm for mixture resolution, when applied to total element and total organic carbon concentration of the soils, was able to identify chemically distinct <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> and their associated As content. Multiple linear regression (MLR) modelling, using the As content of the intrinsic <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> and their first order interactions as independent variables, was able to predict the bioaccessible As content of the soils (R 2 = 0. 85) with an uncertainty of 1. 33 mg kg− 1.

Conse quently, TVA believes that additional studies are no longer necessary. Enclosed is an assessment supporting this conclusion based on data and modeling capability which show very low expected levels of emission, transport, deposition, and impact potential for these nuclear plants. The assessment indicates that freshwater constituents are not present in high concentration and will not be sufficiently concentrated by or emitted by the proposed cooling towers for each plant. Expected rates of deposition are well within the natural rainfall and <b>soil</b> <b>constituent</b> ranges of variability. The criterion proposed in Regulatory Guide 4. 11, Revision 1, is 20 kg/ha-yr as a threshold for additional studies.

Chemical degradation of naphthol and naphthalene {{in the presence}} of a manganese oxide was also studied.

Under anaerobic conditions naphthol degraded to nondetectable levels in 15 days, whereas naphthalene and acenaphthene showed no significant degradation over periods of 50 and 70 days, respectively. Under denitrification conditions naphthol, naphthalene, and acenaphthene were degraded from initial aqueous-phase concentrations of 8, 7, and 0. 4 mg/liter to nondetectable levels in 16, 45, and 40 days, respectively.

In studies of single <b>soil</b> <b>constituents,</b> iron and aluminum oxides have shown a particularly high affinity for glyphosate compared to other <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> We used goethite and poorly crystalline boehmite (PCB) in this study as model sorbents to show the interactions of glyphosate on <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> We identified glyphosate sorption on goethite and PCB using coupled sorption and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), diffuse reflectance, and in situ attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR measurements. ^ Glyphosate sorbed strongly to goethite and PCB. The sorption of glyphosate reached a maximum of 133 and 217 μmol/g glyphosate for goethite and PCB, respectively. As the loading of glyphosate increased, the solution pH also increased. The increase in pH suggests that hydroxyl groups were displaced from the sorbent surfaces, thus evidence of ligand exchange. ^ By using ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, {{we found that the}} phosphonate bands of glyphosate shifted with changes in pH. At pH 3 the protonated P-OH group displayed a band at 917 cm- 1, and the symmetric and asymmetric P-OH modes appear at 1080 and 1186 cm- 1, respectively. At higher pH values, the P-OH band disappears due to deprotonation of the P-O bond. The POH modes merge and form a single band at 1093 cm- 1, which represents the P-O asymmetric stretching mode. ^ We also compared the spectra of glyphosate in solution with those of glyphosate on the sorbents. We noticed that the sorbent perturbed the phosphonate group of glyphosate. In the presence of goethite and PCB, the phosphonate stretching bands appeared at 1137 and 1107 cm- 1, respectively. In solution, this band appeared at 1093 cm- 1. The shift of the P-O stretch to a higher frequency when {{in the presence of the}} sorbents is evidence for glyphosate binding via its phosphonate moiety. ^ In an effort to join batch sorption and spectroscopic studies, we also found that the coupled batch sorption and spectroscopic studies showed good agreement concerning the macroscopic sorption behavior of glyphosate on the sorbents. This information, linked with the aforementioned spectroscopic work is significant because it provides further information concerning the binding of glyphosate with the sorbents. ...|$|E

40|$|Climatic {{variations}} {{and human}} activity now and increasingly {{in the future}} cause land cover changes and introduce perturbations in the terrestrial carbon reservoirs in vegetation, soil and detritus. Optical remote sensing and in particular Imaging Spectroscopy has shown the potential to quantify land surface parameters over large areas, which is accomplished {{by taking advantage of}} the characteristic interactions of incident radiation and the physico-chemical properties of a material. The objective of this thesis is to quantify key soil parameters, including soil organic carbon, using field and Imaging Spectroscopy. Organic carbon, iron oxides and clay content are selected to be analyzed to provide indicators for ecosystem function in relation to land degradation, and additionally to facilitate a quantification of carbon inventories in semiarid soils. The semiarid Albany Thicket Biome in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa is chosen as study site. It provides a regional example for a semiarid ecosystem that currently undergoes land changes due to unadapted management practices and furthermore has to face climate change induced land changes in the future. The thesis is divided in three methodical steps. Based on reflectance spectra measured in the field and chemically determined constituents of the upper topsoil, physically based models are developed to quantify soil organic carbon, iron oxides and clay content. Taking account of the benefits limitations of existing methods, the approach is based on the direct application of known diagnostic spectral features and their combination with multivariate statistical approaches. It benefits from the collinearity of several diagnostic features and a number of their properties to reduce signal disturbances by influences of other spectral features. In a following step, the acquired hyperspectral image data are prepared for an analysis of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> The data show a large spatial heterogeneity that is caused by the patchiness of the natural vegetation in the study area that is inherent to most semiarid landscapes. Spectral mixture analysis is performed and used to deconvolve non-homogenous pixels into their constituent components. For soil dominated pixels, the subpixel information is used to remove the spectral influence of vegetation and to approximate the pure spectral signature coming from the soil. This step is an integral part when working in natural non-agricultural areas where pure bare soil pixels are rare. It is identified as the largest benefit within the multi-stage methodology, providing the basis for a successful and unbiased prediction of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> from hyperspectral imagery. With the proposed approach it is possible (1) to significantly increase the spatial extent of derived information of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> to areas with about 40 % vegetation coverage and (2) to reduce the influence of materials such as vegetation on the quantification of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> to a minimum. Subsequently, soil parameter quantities are predicted by the application of the feature-based soil prediction models to the maps of locally approximated soil signatures. Thematic maps showing the spatial distribution of the three considered soil parameters in October 2009 are produced for the Albany Thicket Biome of South Africa. The maps are evaluated for their potential to detect erosion affected areas as effects of land changes and to identify degradation hot spots in regard to support local restoration efforts. A regional validation, carried out using available ground truth sites, suggests remaining factors disturbing the correlation of spectral characteristics and chemical <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> The approach is developed for semiarid areas in general and not adapted to specific conditions in the study area. All processing steps of the developed methodology are implemented in software modules, where crucial steps of the workflow are fully automated. The transferability of the methodology is shown for simulated data of the future EnMAP hyperspectral satellite. Soil parameters are successfully predicted from these data despite intense spectral mixing within the lower spatial resolution EnMAP pixels. This study shows an innovative approach to use Imaging Spectroscopy for mapping of key <b>soil</b> <b>constituents,</b> including soil organic carbon, for large areas in a non-agricultural ecosystem and under consideration of a partially vegetation coverage. It can contribute to a better assessment of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> that describe ecosystem processes relevant to detect and monitor land changes.

Using the <b>soil</b> <b>constituent</b> of PM 2. 5 (particles of aerodynamic particle diameter less than 2. 5 micrometers (m)) as an illustration, a Bayesian hierarchical calibration model is developed that combines information from reference and equivalent monitors to produce a temporally resolved posterior distribution of the complete concentration time series.

To account for bias in monitors relative to each other, the mean at the equivalent monitor {{is represented by the}} product of an unknown bias parameter times the unknown mean concentration at the reference monitor. Estimation of the bias parameter involves inference about the ratio of normal means as in the well-known Fieller-Creasy problem. A new multi-parameter reference prior is developed for this comparative calibration setting, permitting simultaneous inference about the underlying mean concentrations and the bias parameter. By using a Bayesian hierarchical approach, the posterior distribution of unknown pollutant concentrations conditional on the measured data and model parameters can be estimated at all time points including those with missing data.

This results in a frequent spatial disconnection between soil carbon, energy sources and the decomposer organisms {{and a variety of}} microhabitats that are more or less suitable for microbial growth and activity. However, current biogeochemical models account for C dynamics at the macroscale (cm, m) and consider time and spatially averaged relationships between microbial activity and soil characteristics. Different modelling approaches have intended to account for this microscale heterogeneity, based either on considering aggregates as surrogates for microbial habitats, or pores. Innovative modelling approaches are based on an explicit representation of soil structure at the fine scale, i. e. at μm to mm scales: pore architecture and their saturation with water, localization of organic resources and of microorganisms. Three recent models are presented here, that describe the hetero-trophic activity of either bacteria or fungi and are based upon different strategies to represent the complex soil pore system (Mosaic, LBios and μFun). These models allow to hierarchize factors of mi-crobial activity in soil’s heterogeneous architecture.

Surfactants that had been bound to illite or montmorillonite were typically degraded to lesser extents than the other forms, while surfactant-humic acid complexes were degraded more slowly than the other forms. The desorption coefficients (Kd) of the soil constituent-bound surfactants were negatively correlated with the initial rates of degradation (k 1) and estimates of 14 CO 2 yield (Po) as well as actual total yields of 14 CO 2. However, there was no relationship between Kd and second-stage zero-order rates of mineralization (ko). Microbial community characteristics (biomass and activity) were not correlated with any of the mineralization kinetic parameters. Overall, this study showed that environmental form had a profound effect on the ultimate fate of biodegradable chemicals in soil. This form is defined by the physicochemical characteristics of the chemical, the composition and mineralogy of the soil, and the mode of entry of the chemical into the soil environment...|$|E

In binary sorbents, ferrihydrite and humic acid coatings on montmorillonite provided sorption sites for 2, 4 -D, although the exclusion of the anionic form from highly charged clay surfaces partially obscured the role of Fe and HA as sorbents of 2, 4 D. Sorption of 2, 4 -D on ferrihydrite-HA binary particles was not very different from that on pure ferrihydrite because most of the ferrihydrite surface area was from micropores being not accessible to large humic macromolecules and hence remained available for herbicide sorption. In ternary sorbents HA coatings reduced the sorption of 2, 4 -D by the montmorillonite-ferrihydrite binary complex, indicating that HA blocked many of the sorption sites provided by the Fe coatings. This work shows that the amount and nature of the surface that remains available after the interassociation of single <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> is a critical parameter in determining the sorptive behavior of the resultant aggregate for ionizable contaminants such as 2, 4 D. Thus, the use of calculated sorption parameters such as K(oc), K(ow), K(minera), or K(Fe), for modeling contaminant behavior. In aquatic or soil environments may result in serious deviation from the reality. | Binary and ternary model particles containing montmorillonite, ferrihydrite, and humic acid (HA) {{were used to determine}} the changes in the sorption behavior of the herbicide 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dicholorophenoxyacetic acid) upon the interassociation of these three major <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> The results showed that the amount and nature of the surface that remains available after the interassociation of single oil constituents is a critical parameter in determining the sorptive behavior of the resultant aggregate for ionizable contaminants such as 2, 4 -D.

40|$|Near-infrared {{reflectance}} spectroscopy (NIRS) {{has been}} accepted as a fast method to evaluate various <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> However, very few studies have used NIRS {{as a predictor of}} the textural and mineralogical content of tropical soils. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential use of NIRS as a tool for assessment of diverse soil properties, with specific attention to the prediction of properties related to the mineralogy of a wide range of Latosols from the Cerrado region of central Brazil. The reflectance of the soil samples, 148 in total, taken from 0. 0 to 0. 2 and 0. 6 to 0. 8 -m depth, was determined in the near-infrared region between 1100 and 2500 nm at 2 -nm intervals with a NIRS spectrophotometer. Our results show that for soil sampling corresponding to a large-scale map and taking into account the variability of Latosols over a wide region, NIRS can predict most of the mineralogical properties of the Latosols accurately. Near-infrared spectroscopy did not predict most of the physico-chemical characteristics of soils accurately, in particular those that are largely dependent on agricultural practice, such as pH or CEC. However, the main characteristics that correspond to <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> (organic matter and clay content) were relatively well predicted...|$|E

Since the reinforced <b>soil's</b> individual <b>constituents</b> obey a 3 D Mohr-Coulomb strength condition, such a numerical problem can be treated trough an optimization procedure using semidefinite programming. The whole numerical procedure is applied to the derivation of both lower bound and upper bound estimates to the macroscopic yield surface of a soil reinforced either by columnar inclusions (stone columns) or a double array of trenches (cross trench reinforcement). The so-obtained results highlight the efficiency of the proposed numerical method...|$|R

This study concerns reproductive ecology assessments supported by molecular characterisation to improve {{our understanding of the}} effects of fire and fire residues on the germination behaviour of 12 arboreal species with a wide geographic distribution. For this purpose, we analysed the effects of three ash and one BC concentration on the germination of Acacia dealbata Link, A. longifolia (Andrews) Willd., A. mearnsii De Wild., A. melanoxylon R. Br., Pinus nigra Arnold, P. pinaster Aiton, P. radiata D. Don, P. sylvestris L., Quercus ilex L., Q. pyrenaica Willd., Q. robur L., and Q. rubra L. Each tree species was exposed to ash and BC created from its foliage or twigs (except for Q. rubra, which was exposed to ash and BC of Ulex europaeus L.). We monitored germination percentage, the T 50 parameter, and tracked the development of germination over time (up to 1 yr). The BC of A. dealbata, P. pinaster, and Q. robur was analysed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (PY-GC-MS) to assess the molecular composition. In six species, ash inhibited the germination, while in another five species, germination was not affected by ash or by BC. In Q. rubra, ash and BC stimulated its germination. This stimulating effect of the BC on Q. rubra is likely {{to be related to the}} chemical composition of the ash and BC obtained from Ulex feedstock. The BC of U. europaeus has a very different molecular composition than the other BC samples analysed, which, together with other factors, probably allowed for its germination stimulating effects.|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} deepen into the dynamics of N in a FL's soil so as to provide tools to reduce its environmental impact. The study was conducted in a FL, located in Balcarce County (Buenos Aires, Argentina). Soil samples were taken between November 2006 and May 2007 in a control Pasture, in the FL-High (Upper Slope position) and FL-Low (Lower Slope position) of the FL, and in the runoff area (RA). Urease activity and concentrations of Ammonium-N, Nitrate-N and urea-N were evaluated in the soil up to 60 cm depth. Urea-N values were always low (6 mg kg- 1), due to the high urease activity measured (438 mg kg- 1). Ammonium-N concentration was highest in FL-Low, reaching a value of 65. 5 mg kg- 1 at 40 - 60 cm soil depth. Nitrate-N concentration was highest in FL-High for all depths, with a maximum concentration of 97. 4 mg kg- 1 in the 0 - 10 cm layer; at 40 - 60 cm depth, Nitrate-N concentration in FL was 31. 98 mg kg- 1, higher than that in Pasture (1. 21 mg kg- 1). There were no differences in Nitrate-N concentration between Pasture and RA; hence, it can be inferred that there was no transport of nitrate by surface water flow from the FL to RA. However, the potential for groundwater contamination via nitrate, a mobile <b>soil</b> <b>constituent,</b> should be studied...|$|R
