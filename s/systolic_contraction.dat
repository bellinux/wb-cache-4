30|$|In {{our studies}} we also {{estimated}} the coupling efficiency (CE) and the respiratory control ratio (RCR), of the isolated ASCs.

RCR is calculated as a ratio between the cellular proton leak and their maximal capacity. Therefore, a change in either {{one of these two}} parameters will alter RCR, offering a solid estimation of overall bioenergetic dysfunction. Since CE and RCR are calculated as ratios, both measures are useful internal controls. However, the CE and RCR did not significantly differ between ASCs from each location in this study. The fact that we observed no significant differences in CE and RCR between groups could be explained by biomechanics and organ function. Due to the constant, but normal, wear and tear of pressures imposed upon the knee joints during ambulation, the cells in that peri-organ region require a faster rate of healing, proliferation, and regeneration. Similarly, the function of human heart requires the peri-organ milieu to support quick cell turnover, proliferation and regeneration. Furthermore, due to the high oxygen demand of cardiac cells required to sustain diastolic and <b>systolic</b> <b>contractions,</b> it is logical that pericardial ASCs would display a maximal respiration state compared to ASCs from skeletal muscle regions (e.g., shoulder).|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the ionic {{mechanisms}} involved in serotonergic control of the ventricle from the mollusc Mercenariamercenaria. The effects of calcium (Ca 2 +), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg 2 +) and chloride (Cl 2) ions on the action of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) were tested using a sucrose-gap technique. 5 -HT increased the amplitude and frequency of the cardiac action potentials (APs) and coupled systolic force {{in a range of}} concentrations from the threshold, at 10210 moll– 1, to 1026 moll– 1. Low, physiological doses of 5 -HT increased the rate of rise and amplitude of the fast rising phase of the AP, and hastened the process of repolarization. Doses of 5 -HT higher than 1025 moll– 1 caused systolic arrest. The action of 5 -HT was highly dependent on the presence of physiological levels of extracellular Ca 2 +. It had a maximal effect on systolic activity in a calcium chloride concentration range of 9 – 18 mmoll 21. The activity of 5 -HT was blocked by treatment with Ca 2 +-free saline, with inorganic Ca 2 +blockers (lanthanum or cobalt) or with an organic Ca 2 + entry blocker (verapamil). The effects of 5 -HT were potentiated by treatment with barium ions (Ba 2 +), by a dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca 2 +agonist, Bay K 8644, or by a vertebrate Ca 2 +entry blocker, diltiazem. Removal of extracellular Na+or treatment with a Na+ ionophore, monensin, did not significantly affect excitation by 1026 moll– 1 5 -HT; nor did the removal of Cl 2 or Mg 2 +. Unlike Ca 2 +, these three ions probably did not have a critical role during the excitatory action of 5 -HT. The excitatory action of 5 -HT was not significantly altered by treatment with K+-fre saline.

Whether this also occurs in cardiac patients is unknown. We investigated the impact of prolonged single day and three-day walking exercise on cardiac function and cardiac biomarkers between cardiac patients and healthy controls in an observational study. METHODS: We recruited 10 cardiac patients (nine males, one female, 68 [*]±[*] 5 years) and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (nine males, one female, 68 [*]±[*] 4 years) to perform 30 or 40 [*]km of walking exercise per day for three consecutive days. Cardiac function was examined using echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers (cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide) with blood samples. Data were collected before walking and directly after walking on day 1 and day 3. RESULTS: Post-exercise early <b>systolic</b> tissue <b>contraction</b> velocity of the left ventricle (p[*]=[*] 0. 005) and global longitudinal left ventricle strain (P[*]=[*] 0. 026) were increased in both groups compared with baseline.

We hypothesized that LA <b>systolic</b> synchronous <b>contraction</b> as a functional measure of LA remodeling is deranged in patients with paroxysmal AF and HF. Methods: We performed a nested case-control analysis with 1 : 2 matching for 39 cases of paroxysmal AF (n= 28, in sinus rhythm during cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)) and HF (n= 14, AF+HF; n= 3) and 78 controls with similar demographic and clinical characteristics at the baseline (Table 1). LA circumferential (short axis) and longitudinal strain rate (horizontal long axis) were measured using Multi-modality Tissue Tracking (Toshiba, Japan) from short and long-axis cine CMR images. Circumferential LA systolic dyssynchrony among 18 LA segments (6 segments x 3 slices) was evaluated as; Standard Deviation (SD) of time to pre atrial contraction Strain rate (PreA Src) and Peak systolic strain rate (Peak Srac) (Figure 1). Similarly, longitudinal LA dyssynchrony parameters (among 6 segments) were: SD-Time to pre-atrial contraction strain rate (PreA SrL) and SD-Time to peak systolic strain rate (Peak-SraL). Wilcoxon-rank sum test (non-parametric) or two sample t-test (parametric) were used for comparison between the groups. Results: In participants during MESA exam 5 (age 74 ± 8 years, 51. 4 % men), systolic circumferential dyssynchrony (SD-TP-PreA Src, msec) was significantly higher in the cases compared to controls (45. 06 vs. 28. 73, p< 0. 010).

High-resolution Cine CT scans of a patient with normal cardiac function were acquired at a resolution of 0. 77 mm per pixel at 10 phases of the cardiac cycle. The images were segmented and the VTC surface was obtained by triangulating the segmented data. Fractal dimension of the VTC surface was calculated for each cardiac phase as a function of scale size using the box-counting algorithm. The fractal dimension, D corresponding to VTCs ranged between 2. 05 and 2. 2 and varied as a function of time during the car-diac cycle. Fractal dimension is highest at diastole and lowest at peak systole with the change being significantly different (P < 0. 003). This variation of D when plotted against stroke volume (i. e., D-V loop) revealed an active VTC role due to hysteresis in the loop.

Overall, signifi cant improvements were observed for ECHO/TDI measures of systolic function (global <b>systolic</b> <b>contraction</b> score, p 0. 001; ejection time, p 0. 05), diastolic function (diastolic fi lling period, p 0. 01; mitral velocity-time integral, p 0. 05) and left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony (standard deviation of time to peak displacement, p 0. 05). In most patients referred for chronic PMO, ECHO/TDI-guided PMO {{can be used to}} objectively improve cardiac systolic function, diastolic function and/or LV dyssynchrony...|$|E
40|$|ArticleDisagreement {{about various}} aspects of the {{structure}} and function of the pylorus persists. Morbid anatomical, living anatomical, manometric and radiographic studies were done in an attempt to clarify some problems. It is shown that the pyloric ring (sphincteric ring) is not a separate anatomical structure, but that it constitutes the aboral end of the pyloric sphincteric cylinder, a muscular tube several centimeters in length. The ring does not function independently and conventional peristaltic waves do not proceed as far as the ring. Consequently the ring does not relax reciprocally with an oncoming peristaltic wave in the sense that a wave travels up to the ring, which relaxes upon its arrival. Each peristaltic wave stops on arrival at the oral end of the cylinder, simultaneously initiating a concentric or <b>systolic</b> <b>contraction</b> of the entire cylinder, including the ring. The cylinder, including the ring, is open at rest...|$|E
40|$|The kinins have an {{important}} role in control of the cardiovascular system. They have been associated with protective effects in the heart tissue. Kinins act through stimulation of two 7 -transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors, denoted B- 1 and 13, receptors. However, the physiological relevance of B receptor in the heart has not been clearly established. Using B- 1 kinin receptor gene knock-out mice we tested the hypothesis that the B- 1 receptor plays {{an important}} role in the control of baseline cardiac function. We examined the functional aspects of the intact heart and also in the isolated cardiomyocytes to study intracellular Ca 2 + cycling by using confocal microscopy and whole-cell voltage clamp techniques. We measured heart rate, diastolic and <b>systolic</b> tension, <b>contraction</b> and relaxation rates and, coronary perfusion pressure. Whole-cell voltage clamp was performed to measure L-type Ca 2 + current (I-Ca,I-L) the hearts from B- 1 (-/-) mice showed smaller systolic tension. the average values for WT and B- 1 (-/-) mice were 2. 6 +/- 0. 04 g vs. 1. 6 +/- 0. 08 g, respectively. This result can be explained, at least in part, by the decrease in the Ca 2 + transient (3. 1 +/- 0. 06 vs. 3. 4 +/- 0. 09 for B and WT, respectively). There was an increase in I-Ca,I-L at depolarized membrane potentials. Interestingly, the inactivation kinetics of I-Ca,I-L was statistically different between the groups. the coronary perfusion pressure was higher in the hearts from B- 1 (-/-) mice indicating an increase in coronary resistance. This result can be explained by the significant reduction of eNOS (NOS- 3) expression in the aorta of B- 1 (-/-) mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that B- 1 receptor exerts a fundamental role in the mammalian cardiac function. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to asses left ventricular functions and its relation with hepatosteatosis grade with conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography in patients with the non-alcholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: A total of 32 patients (15 males, 17 females; mean age 50 ± 9 years and) with ultrasonographically diagnosed non-alcholic fatty liver disease and 22 healty subjects (11 female and 11 male; mean age: 50 ± 10) without hepatosteatosis were enrolled in this study. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions, myocardial performance index and its relation with HS grade were assessed by conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant charasteristics difference, chambers diameters, standard Doppler parameters and conventional echocardiography parameters between the patients and control groups. Among tissue Doppler parameters the mitral annulus peak early diastolic velocity and ratio of early to late diastolic velocity were lower in patients group than in controls (p < 0. 001, p < 0. 001 respectively). Isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) and myocardial performance index (MPI) were significantly higher (p = 0. 002, p < 0. 001 respectively) in the patient group. There {{were no significant differences in}} mitral annuler late diastolic velocity, deceleration time of early diastolic filling, mitral annuler peak <b>systolic</b> velocity, isovolumetric <b>contraction</b> time and contraction time between the two groups. HS grade was positively correlated with the left ventricle MPI index (r = 0. 57 p = 0. 001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These results show that left ventricular diastolic dysfunctions in patients with non-alcholic fatty liver disease and degree of hepatosteatosis is associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunctions...|$|R
40|$|To assess {{regional}} contractility in idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS), {{a primary}} myopathic disorder with documented hyperdynamic ventricular <b>contractions,</b> <b>systolic</b> wall thickening and {{velocity of contraction}} of the septum and left ventricular posterior wall were measured in echocardiograms from 16 patients with IHSS and 16 normal subjects. The average thickening of the normal septum and posterior wall was 75. 9 ± 8. 8 % and 84. 8 ± 6. 3 %, respectively. The posterior wall in IHSS thickened by 75. 1 ± 6. 8 %. None of these values differed significantly. However, the increase in thickness of the IHSS septum averaged 22. 5 ± 2. 4 %, significantly {{less than that of}} either the IHSS posterior wall or the normal septum. Velocity measurements confirmed the impression of diminished septal function. The mean velocity of normal septal contraction averaged 37. 0 ± 2. 3 mm/sec, normal posterior wall 42. 3 ± 2. 0 mm/sec and IHSS posterior wall 55. 7 ± 3. 5 mm/sec, whereas the septum in IHSS contracted at the rate of 26. 0 ± 2. 5 mm/sec. Thus, the IHSS septum contracted significantly more slowly than the normal septum or IHSS posterior wall. However, the posterior wall velocity in IHSS was significantly more rapid than that measured in normal ventricles perhaps to compensate for the septum. Normalization of all velocities for left ventricular end-diastolic inter-nal diameter did not alter the significance of the results. Consideration of IHSS as an asymmetric myopathy based on prior observations of predominantly septal hypertrophy and distorted septal cellular architecture i...|$|R
