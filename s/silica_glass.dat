5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or <b>silica</b> <b>glass.</b> Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E

25|$|<b>Silica</b> <b>glass</b> can be doped {{with various}} materials. One purpose of doping {{is to raise}} the {{refractive}} index (e.g. with germanium dioxide (GeO2) or aluminium oxide (Al2O3)) or to lower it (e.g. with fluorine or boron trioxide (B2O3)). Doping is also possible with laser-active ions (for example, rare-earth-doped fibers) {{in order to obtain}} active fibers to be used, for example, in fiber amplifiers or laser applications. Both the fiber core and cladding are typically doped, so that the entire assembly (core and cladding) is effectively the same compound (e.g. an aluminosilicate, germanosilicate, phosphosilicate or borosilicate glass).|$|E
25|$|Attenuation {{in fiber}} optics, {{also known as}} {{transmission}} loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of <b>silica</b> <b>glass</b> that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.|$|E
25|$|Charles K. Kao and George A. Hockham of the British company Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) {{were the}} first, in 1965, {{to promote the}} idea that the {{attenuation}} in optical fibers could be reduced below 20 decibels per kilometer (dB/km), making fibers a practical communication medium. They proposed that the attenuation in fibers available at the time was caused by impurities that could be removed, rather than by fundamental physical effects such as scattering. They correctly and systematically theorized the light-loss properties for optical fiber, and pointed out the right material to use for such fibers— <b>silica</b> <b>glass</b> with high purity. This discovery earned Kao the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.|$|E

500|$|Elsebeth Thomsen of the University of Copenhagen {{proposed}} a different hypothesis in 1980. She {{suggested that the}} Black Stone may be a glass fragment or impactite from {{the impact of a}} fragmented meteorite that fell some 6,000 years ago at Wabar, a site in the Rub' al Khali desert 1,100km east of Mecca. The craters at Wabar are notable for the presence of blocks of <b>silica</b> <b>glass,</b> fused by the heat of the impact and impregnated with beads of a nickel-iron alloy from the meteorite (most of which was destroyed in the impact). Some of the glass blocks are made of shiny black glass, with a white or yellow interior and gas-filled hollows, which allow them to float on water. Although scientists did not become aware of the Wabar craters until 1932, they were located near a caravan route from Oman and were very likely known to the inhabitants of the desert. The wider area was certainly well-known; in ancient Arabic poetry, Wabar or Ubar (also known as [...] "Iram of the Pillars") was the site of a fabulous city that was destroyed by fire from the heavens because of the wickedness of its king. If the estimated age of the crater is accurate, it would have been well within the period of human habitation in Arabia and the impact itself may have been witnessed. A recent (2004) scientific analysis of the Wabar site suggests that the impact event happened much more recently than first thought and might have occurred only within the last 200–300 years.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo {{extend the}} use of erbium- (Er-) /aluminum- (Al-) codoped optical fibers in hostile environments, the {{reduction}} of the Al amount has been identified as a serious way to harden them against harsh radiation. In this work, sol–gel monolithic Er 3 +-doped and Er 3 +/Al 3 +-codoped <b>silica</b> <b>glasses</b> were prepared from nanoporous silica xerogels soaked in a solution containing an Er salt together or not with an Al salt. After sintering, these glasses were used as the core material of microstructured optical fibers made by the stack-and-draw method. The influence of Al incorporation on the optical properties of Er 3 +-doped <b>silica</b> <b>glasses</b> and fibers is investigated. This approach enabled the preparation of <b>silica</b> <b>glasses</b> containing dispersed Er 3 + ions with low Al content. The obtained fibers have been tested in an all-fibered cavity laser architecture. The Er 3 +/Al 3 +-codoped fiber laser presents a maximum efficiency of 27 % at 1530 [*]nm. We show that without Al doping, the laser exhibits lower performances that depend on Er content inside the doped fiber core. The effect of Er pair-induced quenching also has been investigated through nonsaturable absorption experiments, which clearly indicate that the fraction of Er ion pairs is significantly reduced in the Al-codoped fiber...|$|R

A {{few years later}} they produced a fiber with only 4dB/km attenuation using germanium dioxide as the core dopant.

2500|$|Between 1997 and 2006, the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) {{spacecraft}} mapped {{the global}} mineral {{composition of the}} planet. TES identified two global-scale volcanic units on Mars. Surface Type 1 (ST1) characterises the Noachian-aged highlands and consists of unaltered plagioclase- and clinopyroxene-rich basalts. Surface Type 2 (ST2) is common in the younger plains north of the dichotomy boundary and is more silica rich than ST1. [...] The lavas of ST2 have been interpreted as andesites or basaltic andesites, indicating the lavas in the northern plains originated from more chemically evolved, volatile-rich magmas. (See Igneous differentiation and Fractional crystallization.) However, other researchers have suggested that ST2 represents weathered basalts with thin coatings of <b>silica</b> <b>glass</b> or other secondary minerals that formed through interaction with water- or ice-bearing materials.|$|E
2500|$|Analysis of {{the soil}} samples {{collected}} by the Viking landers in 1976 indicate iron-rich clays consistent with weathering of basaltic rocks.

[...] Much of the surface is deeply covered by dust as fine as talcum powder. The red/orange appearance of Mars' surface is caused by iron(III) oxide (rust). Mars has twice as much iron oxide in its outer layer as Earth does, despite their supposed similar origin. It is thought that Earth, being hotter, transported much of the iron downwards in the [...] deep, , lava seas of the early planet, while Mars, with a lower lava temperature of [...] was too cool for this to happen.|$|E
