40|$|A study {{into the}} {{sanitary}} state of roots and culm base of winter wheat {{was carried out}} in 1999 - 2002 in the Production and Experimental Station in Bałcyny near Ostróda. Experimental wheat was cultivated after spring cross plants such as spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. oleiferus Metz.), white mustard (Sinapis alba L), chinese mustard (Brassica juncea L.), oleiferous radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleiferus L.), false flax (Camelina sativa L.), crambe (Crambe abbysinica Hoechst.) and after oats (Avena sativa L.) as a control. The other experimental factor was the method of after-harvest residue management, i. e. ploughing in the stubble, ploughing in the stubble and <b>straw,</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the stubble and straw with nitrogen added. The occurrence of root rot and stem base diseases was affected by weather conditions and forecrop species. Winter wheat roots were attacked to the lowest degree when spring rape and radish were used as forecrops, and to the highest degree - when grown after oat. The culm base was most intensely infected with fusarium foot rot (Fusarium spp.). The remaining root-rot diseases occurred every year but with different intensity. The method of utilization of after-harvest residues did not have a clear effect on the intensity of infection of the roots and culm base of winter wheat...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium langsethiae, a toxigenic fungus {{known to}} {{contaminate}} small-grain cereals with type A trichothecene mycotoxins, HT- 2 and T- 2 {{was described as}} a new species in 2004. HT- 2 and T- 2 {{are some of the most}} potent Fusarium toxins in eukaryotes, capable of inhibiting protein synthesis. The epidemiology of F. langsethiae is not well understood and with the intent of the European Commission to set maximum levels of contamination of cereals with these toxins, importance is currently placed in trying to understand the fungal infection process and its favorable growth conditions. A field study was carried out to investigate the effect of artificially inoculated oats <b>straw,</b> <b>ploughing</b> and minimum tillage with and without incorporated crop debris (straw) on infection and mycotoxin production by F. langsethiae on oats cultivar Gerald. The results indicated that cultural field practices had effects on the infection of oats by F. langsethiae. Fusarium langsethiae DNA was quantified in significantly larger amounts (p 0. 05) on oat infection by F. langsethiae as quantified by DNA concentration. HT- 2 +T- 2 quantification and analysis, gave no good evidence that either inoculation or cultural practice had any significant influence on the concentration of mycotoxins in the samples (p> 0. 05), but samples from minimum tillage with incorporated straw plots resulted in 2. 5 times more HT- 2 +T- 2 toxins than samples from ploughed with removed straw. These findings indicate the importance of tillage and crop debris management in the mitigation in an effort to prevent F. langsethiae infection, colonization and possible contamination of oats with HT- 2 and T- 2 toxins...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was conduced {{in the years}} 2000 - 2002. The aim of the {{research was}} to determinate the health of leaves and ears of spring wheat cultivated after spring cruciferae plants such as: spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. oleiferus Metz.), chiiiese mustard (Brassica juncea L.), white mustard (Sinapis alba L.), ole iferous radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleiferus L.), false flax (Camelina sativa L.), crambe (Crambe abbysinica Hoechst.), as well as after oat (Avena sativa L.) as con trol. Spring wheat cv. Torka was sown after: pIoughed stubble cultivated on this field, <b>ploughed</b> stubble and <b>straw,</b> <b>ploughed</b> stubble with <b>straw</b> and 30 kg nitrogen per hectare. During all the years of studies on leaves and ears of spring wheat septo ria of leaf blotch and glume blotch (Mycosphaerella graminicola, Phaeosphaeria nodorum) were found. Brown rust (Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici) was seen on leaves of wheat only during years 2001 - 2002. Besides on ears fusarium ear blight (Fusarimn sp.) was present in 2002 and sooty mould (Cladosporium sp., Alternaria sp.) in 2001. According to health of overground parts of plants the good forecrops to spring wheat were oat, chinese mustard, oleiferous radish. The biggest impact on presence of diseases of leaves and ears had the weather during years of studies. The use of after harvest rests didn't have significant influence on health of leaves and ears of spring wheat...|$|R
40|$|Litterbag {{were used}} to {{study the effects of}} {{different}} ploughing depths on decomposition rate of barley <b>straw</b> with different <b>ploughing</b> depths. The burying depth of the litter (13 vs 25 cm) affected the decomposition rate of barely straw more than the different ploughing depths (13 vs 25 cm). From our results we suggest that slowly decomposable organic matter, such as leached barley straw, may be incorporated deeply by ploughing in organic cereal production systems, in order to regulate perennial weeds. In soils with good structure and porosity, the decomposition rate of straw can even be larger with deep ploughing. In dense, clayey soils {{it is important to be}} very accurate in ploughing time in order to secure that the ploughing is in fact loosening the soil. Otherwise, lack of oxygen and low decomposition of straw is likely to be the results...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain {{momentum}} in the consolidation process of no-tillage systems in Europe’s Organic Agriculture, occasional direct seeding (DS) of faba bean (FAB) into a mulch layer of residues from precrop oats should be scrutinized. In contrast to non-legumes, grain legumes do not depend on soil-borne nitrogen due {{to their ability to}} fix nitrogen symbiotically. Concerning weed infestation, straw residues left by precrops may at least physically suppress weeds. In order to prove this hypothesis, two field experiments were carried out in 2009 at two sites in the lower Rhineland region, Germany. DS treatments were combined with 0, 4, and 6 t ha- 1 of <b>straw</b> residues. Mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> (MP) combined with conventional seedbed preparation was used as control. Compared to the DS treatment without straw residue (0 t ha- 1), DS treatments with straw residues (4 and 6 t ha- 1, resp.) resulted in significantly lower weed density (70 and 84 % resp.). Neither differences were observed in both shoot dry matter of FAB and weeds for DS with straw residues compared with MP, nor for the grain yields of FAB. We conclude that occasional DS of FAB in OA is successful to reduce annual weeds sufficiently and may not lead to reduced FAB yields...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Crop growth {{simulation}} models {{can be useful}} in evaluating the impacts of different tillage and residue management operations on the changes in land productivity and soil-water balance components. They offer a potentially valuable set of tools for examining questions related to performance of conservation agriculture. This can be both to improve our understanding or conceptualization of processes and to improve quantitative predictions for use by agronomists, growers, policy makers or others. We applied the new Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) version 4. 5, an improved crop growth simulation model, to three conservation agriculture treatments and one conventional tillage treatment data from a field-scale study in west Henan region of China to predict winter-wheat yield, leaf area index and soil-water balance. The site’s average annual precipitation is 632 mm and it had a winter wheat-fallow-winter wheat rotation. There winter wheat planting in October and harvesting in next year June. The model was calibrated using 2005 - 2006 winter-wheat crop data from field experiments of the four treatments. The treatments were: (1) decreased tillage (DT) : mulching of 10 - 15 cm height <b>straw</b> and one <b>ploughing</b> operation to 25 cm depth on July 1 st; (2) zero tillage (ZT) : zero tillage with 35 - 40 cm height straw mulching; (3) subsoiling (SS) : 35 - 40 cm height straw mulching and subsoil to 40 cm depth on July 1 st; (4...|$|R
