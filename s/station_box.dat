5|$|The University of Washington showed {{interest}} in developing an office tower over the <b>station</b> <b>box,</b> whose development rights were acquired by the university in 2013.

5|$|The station's {{architecture}} is an austere combination {{of concrete and}} stainless steel, with stacked banks of escalators supported from the cross-bracing structures spanning the <b>station</b> <b>box</b> and routes for passengers entering or leaving the station separated from those changing between lines. As with the other underground stations on the extension, the Jubilee line platforms feature platform screen doors to improve airflow through the system and increase safety. The station design won a number of awards including Civic Trust awards in 2000 and 2002, the Royal Fine Art Commission Millennium Building of the Year award in 2000 and the RIBA Award for Architecture in 2001. Both projects were jointly short-listed in 2001 for the RIBA's prestigious Stirling Prize.|$|E
5|$|By late 1988, the Pioneer Square station {{structure}} was 70 percent complete, and work had begun on the station's entrances and the vaulted ceiling. The station {{was the subject}} of two controversies during its construction over the use of South African materials in its construction, as the country was then under a Metro boycott for its Apartheid policies. In late 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham was forced to remove steel beams used for temporary shoring at the <b>station</b> <b>box</b> after unknowingly sourcing it from South Africa. Metro later acquired South African black granite {{to be used in the}} station's platform and mezzanine, which was discovered and returned; the incident resulted in the resignation of Metro's executive director, amid outcry from African American leaders.|$|E

After a delay in delivering the TBMs, the MTA's contractors completed the TBM installation on May 14, 2010, and turned it on at the Second Avenue Subway launch box at 96th Street, boring southward to connecting shafts built at 86th and 72nd Streets. On October 1, 2010, MTA awarded a $431 million contract to joint venture SSK Constructors for the mining of the tunnels connecting the 72nd Street station to the existing Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station, and for the excavation and heavy civil structures of the 72nd Street station. A subsequent contract was awarded to Skanska Traylor Joint Venture for excavation of the cavern at the 86th Street station on August 4, 2011. In January 2011, MTA awarded Judlau Contracting a 40-month, $176.4 million contract to rebuild and enlarge the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station.|$|E

25|$|Addition of Northern Powerhouse Rail and Station to the Manchester Piccadilly {{system will}} be the last step of the process of {{transforming}} the station in to a transport super hub. The NPR station and its construction will need to be considered throughout the design and implementation of the other station improvements which form the station concept but which are delivered earlier. The NPR station is proposed to stay underground on its way east as it passes through Manchester city. This provides opportunities and offers location and orientation alternatives. Staying under the existing Piccadilly station or positioning NPR under the HS2 <b>station</b> <b>box</b> will maximise interchange efficiencies and travel distances. The orientation will also dictate the number of vertical connection cores also referred to as “drums” and their locations. The drums will have the function to connect all levels of transport to one and other at critical junction points.|$|E
500|$|The {{construction}} of the deep-level station involved the excavation of a [...] deep void around and beneath the sub-surface station to house the escalators to the Jubilee line platforms. The void, known as the <b>station</b> <b>box,</b> was the deepest ever excavation in central London and was carried out between thick reinforced concrete diaphragm walls stiffened and braced horizontally for stability. Under Bridge Street, {{on the south side}} of the <b>station</b> <b>box,</b> the two Jubilee line platform tunnels are arranged with the westbound platform below the eastbound. The depth of the <b>station</b> <b>box</b> excavation and the proximity of the tunnels represented a significant risk to the stability of the foundation of the Houses of Parliament's clock tower (popularly known as Big Ben), which stands only [...] from the edge of the <b>station</b> <b>box.</b> To protect the foundation and manage settlement in the sub-soil, a series of [...] long steel tubes was installed horizontally around and beneath the clock tower's [...] thick foundation. The tubes were provided with a control system through which grout was injected into the ground to compensate for settlement detected from detailed measurements of the clock tower's position. As excavation of the <b>station</b> <b>box</b> and the tunnels took place, grout was injected on 22 occasions between January 1996 and September 1997. The process limited the movement of the clock tower to an acceptable maximum of [...] Without the grout injection, the movement would have been at least [...] causing cracking to the structure of the tower and the Houses of Parliament. The Jubilee line platforms were opened on 22 December 1999, although trains had been running through the station without stopping since 20 November 1999.|$|E
