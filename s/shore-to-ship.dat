500|$|Following {{his death}} in 1959, his widow Dorothy Brown, who was a noted New Orleans philanthropist, renovated the {{property}} for a more modern look, including a wide arched canopy in the front. [...] In the early 1960s, the Mississippi Gulf Coast was emerging as a prime alternative to Florida as a southern vacation destination, and the Broadwater Beach Resort was considered the pacesetter for the area. [...] In 1963, Dorothy Brown spent $3 million to build a marina and a heliport. The Broadwater Resort Marina plan was especially ambitious, involving hosting up to 150 sail and powerboats, and offering <b>shore-to-ship</b> maid service and room service to those docked, all {{in an effort to}} capture blue-water game fishing business. When the marina opened in 1965, it was considered state of the art. In 1968, she built the Broadwater Beach Sun Course on land originally owned by Jefferson Davis, and thus added golf as a prime attraction for visitors; by 1974 a Sea Course was also present. During the 1960s, a men's store was present in the hotel. [...] For entertainment, the hotel featured musicians from New Orleans and elsewhere. [...] From the 1950s on, operational control of the hotel and resort rested with Leigh MacConnell, one of the few women to rise {{to the top of the}} local hotel industry in that era. [...] In the 1960s the Broadwater Beach Resort found its glory years. Hosting movie stars, leading politicians, and top business figures, as well as people on vacation, it became the Gulf Coast's flagship resort. [...] During this decade, the iconic and colorfully lit Broadwater Beach Resort front sign was added.|$|E

After being thoroughly reconditioned for her new operators, the liner sailed on 11 September 1922 for her maiden voyage under her new name, bound for Honolulu, Hawaii, in a new dazzling white paint scheme. In January 1931, the handsome liner figured in an experimental <b>shore-to-ship</b> air mail flight. A Ford Trimotor — flying from the Grand Central Air Terminal at Glendale, California — followed City of Los Angeles out to sea and, off the California coast, dropped a bag containing 12,527 envelopes onto the passenger liner's deck.

5000|$|By the 1920s when {{amplification}} made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird {{employed the}} Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave {{the first public}} demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. [...] Since human faces had inadequate contrast {{to show up on}} his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named [...] "Stooky Bill" [...] talking and moving, whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as first television demonstration. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. A selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over 438 mi of telephone line between London and Glasgow. In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first <b>shore-to-ship</b> transmission.

40|$|Our oceans {{are filled}} with ships that {{take care of the}} most {{important}} distribution of goods in the world economy. Evolving from isolated chunks of hollow metal containers, ships {{are becoming more and more}} like interconnected floating computers, and thus increasingly exposed to unwanted cyber events. This paper shows how a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) design can be applied to protect digital communication in the maritime sector. This includes new services depending on ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and <b>shore-to-ship</b> datalinks, and where intentional and unintentional cyber threats can have severe consequences to the cargo, crew, ships and the environment. The design considers domain specific characteristics, such that bandwidth is limited and ships may be offline for long periods of time. In addition, international applicability and a cost-efficiency have been important drivers. We present design goals derived from workshops and surveys involving stakeholders from the maritime domain, outline the design of the proposed PKI and explain how it can be operated in global maritime setting...|$|E
40|$|Geostationary {{maritime}} satellites, {{one over}} the Pacific and {{one over the}} Atlantic Ocean, are planned to make available high-speed communications and navigation (position determination) services to ships at sea. A shipboard satellite terminal, operating within the authorized maritime L-band, 1636. 5 to 1645. 0 MHz, will allow ships to pass voice, teletype, facsimile, and data messages to shore communication facilities {{with a high degree}} of reliability. The <b>shore-to-ship</b> link will also operate in the maritime L-band from 1535. 0 to 1543. 5 MHz. A significant number or maritime/commercial ships are expected to be equipped with an L-band satellite terminal by the year 1980, and so consequently, there is an interest in determining electromagnetic compatibility between the proposed L-band shipboard terminal and existing, on-board, shipboard communications/electronics and electrical systems, as well as determining the influence of shore-based interference sources. The shipboard electromagnetic interference survey described was conducted on-board the United States Line's American Leader class (15, 690 tons) commercial container ship, the "American Alliance" from June 16 to 20, 1974.

40|$|Abstract — Mobile {{medicine}} {{is a new}} application in the wireless multi-media communications, and the maritime {{medicine is}} {{the extension of the}} mobile medicine. In this article, we propose a <b>shore-to-ship</b> maritime medicine system in an attempt to provide interactive medical service between doctors on hospital and patients on ship. Our maritime medicine system contains (i) blood pressure and body temperature measurement value with very few bits;(ii) medical signals measured by the electrocardiogram device; the data transmission rate is about 9 kbps;(iii) the mobile doctor's advice, data transmission rate is about 1 kbps to show patients ’ medication andrelated matters of attention; the request of transmission bit error rate for these data media is 710;(iv) the approximate 10 kbps audio signal, the request of transmission bit error rate is 310 ；and (v) the 600 kbps with CCD sensor video signal, the request of transmission bit error rate for these media is 410. Data signal is stricter in restriction than general wireless audio & video signal, and it is integrated onto the maritime medical platform. By the help of the multi-code CDMA spread spectrum satellite mobile communication system to make immediate transmission, concurrently we are providing the downlink power control strategy applied in this maritime medical system, making it possible for transmission media in this system to meet the demand of service quality, and achieve the purpose of the maximum resource utilization. We also apply mathematics model analysis to measure power and capacity performance of multi-code CDMA spread spectrum Ka band LEO satellite mobile communications system, and complete related medical signal transmission and simulation tests. Key Words — multi-code CDMA, downlink power control, Ka band, maritime medical, ECG signal. I...|$|E
