The program {{would lead to}} replacement of traditional power meters with <b>smart</b> <b>power</b> meters, which could track and manage energy usage more accurately. However the British Computer Society is doubtful these principles were ever actually implemented. In 2009 the Dutch Parliament rejected a similar smart metering program, basing their decision on privacy concerns. The Dutch program later revised and passed in 2011.|$|E

The proposed robust system framework ensures optimal <b>smart</b> grid <b>power</b> generation for acceptable load demand tracking or for ecological benefits under wind power and model uncertainties.
