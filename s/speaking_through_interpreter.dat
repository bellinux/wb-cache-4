"Now, Salamander," [...] said Lumley, who, {{although}} he had considerably increased {{his knowledge of the}} Indian language by conversing with the guide during our voyage, preferred to <b>speak</b> <b>through</b> an <b>interpreter</b> when he had anything important to say, [...] "tell the old chief that this war-party must not go forth.

500|$|During {{the voyage}} to England Kruger {{encountered}} a 19-year-old law student from the Orange Free State named Martinus Theunis Steyn. Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, {{in their eyes}} more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies {{and the structure of}} the universe, he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, he might as well throw his Bible overboard. At the Colonial Office in Whitehall, Carnarvon and Kruger's own colleagues were astonished when, <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> <b>interpreters,</b> he rose to what Meintjes calls [...] "remarkable heights of oratory", averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal. His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of [...] "a handful of irreconcilables". Carnarvon dismissed Kruger's idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain.|$|R

5000|$|Half Yellow Face (or Ischu Shi Dish in the Crow language), (1830? to 1879?) was {{the leader}} of the six Crow Scouts for George Armstrong Custer's 7th Cavalry during the 1876 {{campaign}} against the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne. [...] Half Yellow Face led the six Crow scouts as Custer advanced up the Rosebud valley and crossed the divide to the Little Bighorn valley, and then as Custer made the fateful decision to attack the large Sioux-Cheyenne camp which precipitated the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. At this time, the other Crow Scouts witnessed a conversation between Custer and Half Yellow Face. Half Yellow Face made a statement to Custer (<b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> the <b>interpreter,</b> Mitch Boyer) that was poetically prophetic, at least for Custer: [...] "You and I are going home today by a road we do not know".|$|R
2500|$|Though {{he began}} his mission around 1900, he {{continued}} to have other business interests as well. [...] One of those interests was gold mining. [...] In 1897, the Los Angeles Times published an article on Yoakum's claim that he had discovered a new method of [...] "X-Ray Prospecting" [...] for gold. [...] Yoakum {{reported that he had}} laid [...] a bit of gold-bearing quartz on the x-ray plate while taking an x-ray of a patient with a tumor. [...] The x-ray showed the location of the gold deposits in the quartz, and Yoakum proposed using x-rays in mine tunnels to [...] "ascertain decisively if gold is present, and if so, exactly where it lies and in what quantities." [...] Following this report, Yoakum became active in gold and copper mining. [...] In 1902, he ran a newspaper advertisement (pictured at left) offering stock at 25 cents a share in his new mining company. Yoakum later claimed that it was while traveling in Mexico, the location of his mining interests, that he spoke {{for the first time in}} [...] "tongues." [...] He reported: [...] "I was in the heart of Mexico in a church, <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> an <b>interpreter</b> to the Mexicans and Indians, when suddenly a distinct rush of some might wind came upon me, and when I opened my mouth it was not English, but a beautiful smooth Castilian language, and for 20 or 30 minutes I held that large audience." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 184 BC Flamininus was {{expelled}} from the Senate by the Censor, Cato the Elder, reportedly for unbecoming conduct during his consulship. In a speech before the Senate, Cato accused Flamininus {{of a number of}} charges, including being a pederast, a practice which he had picked up in Greece. Cato reported that during his consulship, Flamininus took his mistress with him to the north of Italy. Whilst there, a noble Boii and his family sought sanctuary in Flamininus’ tent. As the mistress had often told Flamininus that she had never seen a man die, the consul turned to her and asked her whether she wanted to see a Gaul die. The Boii noble was still <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> an <b>interpreter</b> when Flamininus ordered his lictor to behead the Boii noble. However Anthony Everitt provides a different possible version of events. On page 305 of his book The Rise of Rome he says that Flamininus had been jokingly enticed by his young male lover and prostitute, Phillipus the Carthaginian, to make up for dragging Phillipus away from Rome and missing the Gladiatorial games, upon which Flamininus had a Celt seeking asylum called in and ran him through personally with his gladius. Everitt goes on to explain, on page 448, [...] "There are variations on this story, one being that the boy was a girl, another that the man killed was a condemned criminal rather than a distinguished Celt, a third that the prostitute requested the execution and, finally, that the deed was done by the lictor, not the consul himself. However in his account of the affair, Livy (39 42) claims to have read the speech Cato made about the affair, {{and there is no reason}} to doubt him. Cato's version is likely to be the nearest to the truth." ...|$|R
