25|$|Most of the earth's carbon is <b>stored</b> inertly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earth's lithosphere.

Some of it was {{deposited}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of organic carbon from the biosphere. Of <b>the</b> carbon <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> geosphere, about 80% is limestone and its derivatives, which form from the sedimentation of calcium carbonate <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shells of marine organisms. The remaining 20% is stored as kerogens formed through the sedimentation and burial of terrestrial organisms under high heat and pressure.

5|$|According to Home Office statistics, an {{estimated}} 400businesses within {{half a mile}} (0.8km) of the blast were affected, 40% of which did not recover. The heaviest damage was sustained by the three buildings nearest the bomb: Michael House, comprising a Marks & Spencer store and a six-storey office block; Longridge House, offices for Royal and Sun Alliance, an insurance company; and the Arndale Centre, a shopping mall. Michael House was deemed beyond economic repair and demolished. Marks & Spencer {{took the opportunity to}} acquire and demolish the adjacent Longridge House, using the enlarged site for the world's biggest branch of the store. The company's fortunes changed during construction, and Selfridges subsequently co-occupied the building; Marks & Spencer leased part of the Lewis's <b>store</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interim. The frontage of the Arndale was badly damaged and was removed in a remodelling of that part of the city centre.|$|E
