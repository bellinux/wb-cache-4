Universal <b>motors,</b> including <b>shunt</b> <b>wound,</b> were favoured as AC motors at this time as they were self-starting.

The universal motor is modified in several ways to allow for proper AC supply operation. There is a compensating winding typically added, along with laminated pole pieces, {{as opposed to the}} solid pole pieces found in DC motors. [...] A universal motor's armature typically has far more coils and plates than a DC motor, and hence fewer windings per coil. This reduces the inductance.|$|R

50|$|If {{the train}} starts to descend a grade, the speed {{increases}} because the (reduced) drag {{is less than}} the torque. With increased speed, the internally generated back-EMF voltage rises, reducing the torque until the torque again balances the drag. Because the field current is reduced by the back-EMF in a series <b>wound</b> <b>motor,</b> there is no speed at which the back-EMF will exceed the supply voltage, and therefore a single series <b>wound</b> DC traction <b>motor</b> alone cannot provide dynamic or regenerative braking.|$|R

Servos, in constant speed changing use, have a better life cycle than typical AC <b>wound</b> <b>motors.</b> Servo motors can also act as a brake by shunting off generated electricity from the motor itself.|$|R

The producer gas generator was constructed from the smokebox section of a scrapped 6th Class locomotive's boiler. Smokebox char was used as fuel and the gas was passed from the gas generator through suitable wet scrubbers to remove tar to two Tilling-Stevens petrol engines. The engines came from Whippet tanks and {{were obtained from the}} Defence Department. A gas expansion chamber was constructed from an old chimney. The two engines drove <b>shunt</b> <b>wound</b> dynamos, obtained from General Electric, to power the traction motors which were two tramway motors obtained from De Beers in Kimberley. Since the gas was generated by the suction from the two internal combustion engines, the vehicle became known as a suction gas locomotive.|$|R

40|$|The {{automatic}} control {{has played a}} vital role in the advance of engineering and science. Nowadays in industries, the control of direct current (DC) motor is a common practice thus the implementation of DC motor of controller speed is important. The main purpose of motor speed control is to keep the rotation of the motor at the present speed and to drive a system at the demand speed. The DC Series <b>Wound</b> <b>Motor</b> is very popular in industrial application and control systems because of the high torque density, high efficiency and small size. The main purpose of this project is to control speed of DC Series <b>Wound</b> <b>Motor</b> using four controllers which are PID, PI, P, and Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). Initially all the controllers are developed by using MATLAB simulink model. In this project, PID, PI, and P controller are developed and tuned in order to get faster step response and the Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is design based on the membership function and the rule base. The expectation of this project is the Fuzzy Logic Controller will get the best performance compared to other controllers in terms of settling time (Ts), rise time (Tr), peak time (Tp), and percent overshoot (%OS). Finally a GUI of these controllers are developed which allow the users to select any controller and change its parameters according to the different conditions under loaded and unloaded scenarios...|$|R

5000|$|Early {{examples}} of this system were the front-wheel drive conversions of horse-drawn cabs by Louis Antoine Krieger in Paris in the 1890s. The Krieger electric landaulet had a drive motor in each front wheel with {{a second set of}} parallel windings (bifilar coil) for regenerative braking. In England, the Raworth system of [...] "regenerative control" [...] was introduced by tramway operators in the early 1900s, since it offered them economic and operational benefits as explained by A. Raworth of Leeds in some detail. These included tramway systems at Devonport (1903), Rawtenstall, Birmingham, Crystal Palace-Croydon (1906), and many others. Slowing the speed of the cars or keeping it in control on descending gradients, the motors worked as generators and braked the vehicles. The tram cars also had wheel brakes and track slipper brakes which could stop the tram should the electric braking systems fail. In several cases the tram car <b>motors</b> were <b>shunt</b> <b>wound</b> instead of series wound, and the systems on the Crystal Palace line utilized series-parallel controllers. Following a serious accident at Rawtenstall, an embargo was placed on this form of traction in 1911; the regenerative braking system was reintroduced 20 years later.|$|R

50|$|The {{three phase}} {{induction}} regulator {{can be regarded}} as a <b>wound</b> induction <b>motor.</b> The rotor is not allowed to turn freely and it can be mechanically shifted by means of a worm gear. The rest of the regulator's construction follows that of a <b>wound</b> rotor induction <b>motor</b> with a slotted three-phase stator and a wound three-phase rotor. Since the rotor is not allowed to turn more than 180 degrees, mechanically, the rotor leads can be connected by flexible cables to the exterior circuit. If the stator winding is a two-pole winding, moving the rotor through 180 degrees physically will change the phase of the induced voltage by 180 degrees. A four-pole winding only requires 90 degrees of physical movement to produce 180 degrees of phase shift.|$|R

50|$|An old {{method of}} {{powering}} free flight models is Alphonse PÃ©naud's elastic motor, essentially a long rubber band that is wound up prior to flight. It {{is the most}} widely used powerplant for model aircraft, found on everything from children's toys to serious competition models. The elastic motor offers extreme simplicity and survivability, but suffers from limited running time, {{and the fact that the}} initial high torque of a fully <b>wound</b> <b>motor</b> drops sharply before 'plateauing' to a more steady output, until finally declining as the final turns unwind. Using this torque curve efficiently is one of the challenges of competitive free-flight rubber flying, and variable-pitch propellers, differential wing and tailplane incidence and rudder settings, controlled by an on-board timeswitch, are among the means of managing this varying torque and there is usually a motor weight restriction in contest classes. Even so, a competitive model can achieve flights of nearly 1 hour.|$|R
