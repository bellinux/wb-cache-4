5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat <b>spreaders</b> prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the {{flexibility}} of the new broilers, the new equipment has several features intended to decrease operational costs. A more efficient design of the burners in the Nieco units produces a 30 percent reduction in energy consumption. The Duke units produce a $4,000 -$5,000 annual savings on energy compared to the original units, which ran approximately at full capacity all day. The units are so fuel-efficient that in many US states, the company and its franchises qualify for energy-efficiency rebates. However, and issue arose in September 2011 when the state of Washington department of health warned Burger King of issues with the Duke units. In multiple incidents in seven counties throughout the state, the Duke units were found to have cracked heat <b>spreaders</b> which resulted in under cooked products. Additionally, there was foreign material contamination caused by loose insulation resulting from the cracks as well as other issues. Upon notification, Burger King released a statement that the company has notified franchisees and corporate-owned stores operating the Duke units with orders to repair the problem immediately. Additional training for operators was also ordered.|$|E

The standard boat has a keel stepped non-tapered double spreader masthead sloop rig, with rod rigging and a hydraulic backstay adjuster. the R and XL variants have a tapered triple-spreader mast with all rod rigging, plus runners, checkstays, and an adjustable babystay for mast bend control. The backstay is split, with two hydraulic rams, on the boats with walk through transom (37+ and XL). The masthead, gooseneck and boom end are custom machined aluminum, welded {{to the one}} piece extrusion. The aerodynamic <b>spreaders</b> are secured to the mast via machined, continuous aluminum spreader bars. They precisely fit the spreader bases and traverse the mast and along with separate support bars carry the compression loads exerted by the shrouds.

2500|$|Soil {{stabilization}} is {{the permanent}} {{physical and chemical}} alteration of soils to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and/or control the shrink-swell properties of a soil, thus improving the load-bearing capacity of a sub-grade to support pavements and foundations. Stabilization {{can be used to}} treat a wide range of sub-grade materials from expansive clays to granular materials. Stabilization can be achieved with a variety of chemical additives including lime, fly ash, and Portland cement. Proper design and testing is an important component of any stabilization project. This allows for the establishment of design criteria, and determination of the proper chemical additive and admixture rate that achieves the desired engineering properties. Stabilization process benefits can include: Higher resistance (R) values, Reduction in plasticity, Lower permeability, Reduction of pavement thickness, Elimination of excavation - material hauling/handling - and base importation, Aids compaction, Provides [...] "all-weather" [...] access onto and within projects sites. Another form of soil treatment closely related to soil stabilization is soil modification, sometimes referred to as [...] "mud drying" [...] or soil conditioning. Although some stabilization inherently occurs in soil modification, the distinction is that soil modification is merely a means to reduce the moisture content of a soil to expedite construction, whereas stabilization can substantially increase the shear strength of a material such that it can be incorporated into the project's structural design. The determining factors associated with soil modification vs soil stabilization may be the existing moisture content, the end use of the soil structure and ultimately the cost benefit provided. Equipment for the stabilization and modification processes include: chemical additive <b>spreaders,</b> soil mixers (reclaimers), portable pneumatic storage containers, water trucks, deep lift compactors, motor graders.|$|E
