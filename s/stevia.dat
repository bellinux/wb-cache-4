In 1987, the FDA issued a ban on <b>stevia</b> because {{it had not been}} approved as a food additive, although it continued to be available as a dietary supplement.

2500|$|In the United States, seven {{intensely}} sweet sugar substitutes {{have been}} approved for use. They are <b>stevia,</b> aspartame, sucralose, neotame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), saccharin, and advantame. Cyclamates are used outside the U.S., but have been prohibited in the U.S. since 1969. Others, {{which may or may}} not be approved depending on jurisdiction, include allulose (psicose) and monk fruit. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates artificial sweeteners as food additives. [...] Food additives must be approved by the FDA, which publishes a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) list of additives. [...] <b>Stevia</b> is exempt under the FDA's GRAS policy due to its being a natural substance in wide use well before 1958, and the FDA has approved it on these grounds.

40|$|Background:Stevia’s leaf {{contains}} steviol, stevioside and rebaudioside {{which have}} effect to increase secretion insulin. Honey, natural sweetener contains several antioxidant such as propolis, flavonoid and vitamin. It will eliminate free radicals and indirectly improve pankreas glands cells to produce insulin. This research was aimed {{to know the}} difference effect of <b>stevia’s</b> ethanol extract comparedto honey on changing of blood glucoselevel on diabetic model Wistar rats. Methods:This was experimental research with pre and post test controlled group design. Samples were 32 male rats, Wistar Strain, 6 - 8 weeks and + 200 gweight. Sampling technique used in this research was incidental sampling. Samples were divided into 4 groups: negative control group (aquadest), positive control (glibenclamide dose 0. 09 mg/ 200 g body weight), treatment group 1 (<b>stevia’s</b> ethanol extract dose 20 mg/ 200 g body weight), treatment group 2 (honey dose 2 ml/ 200 g body weight). Data were analyze using Saphiro-Wilk’s test of normality and Friedmann test (α = 0. 05) and Post Hoc Multiple Comparison (Wilcoxon) (α = 0. 05) using SPSS 17 for Windows. Results:There was a significant difference (p = 0. 002) on the Wistar’s blood glucose level which was given <b>stevia’s</b> ethanol extract or honey. <b>Stevia’s</b> ethanol extract effect more on decreasing the blood glucose than honey.

The mobile phase comprised of Methanol: acetonitrile: mixed phosphate buffer (pH 2. 6) at a ratio of (40 : 12 : 48). Analyses were run using cyano column (7. 5 mm x 4. 6 mm i. d, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 1. 2 ml. min- 1 with diode array detector operating at a detection wave length of 234 nm in HPLC and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by using the software Kinetica (Version 4. 4. 1 Innaphase, USA).

2500|$|Changes to the {{composition}} of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content, moving away from trans-fats, and producing products in calorie-specific serving sizes to discourage overconsumption, among other changes. One of the earlier ingredient changes involved sugar and caloric reduction, {{with the introduction of}} Diet Pepsi in 1964 and Pepsi Max in 1993—both of which are variants of their full-calorie counterpart, Pepsi. More recent changes have consisted of saturated fat reduction, which Frito-Lay reduced by 50% in Lay's and Ruffles potato chips in the U.S. between 2006 and 2009. Also in 2009, PepsiCo's Tropicana brand introduced a new variation of orange juice (Trop50) sweetened in part by the plant <b>Stevia,</b> which reduced calories by half. Since 2007, the company also made available lower-calorie variants of Gatorade, which it calls [...] "G2".
