5|$|Germany: The {{species is}} known from two {{different}} areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-Württemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site. The species is also known from the Kyffhäuser hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest. The species was also recorded in deciduous forest at a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia. M.alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> and Saxony, where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> records are from near water. However, the species was also recorded {{in the center of}} the city of Chemnitz in Saxony.|$|E
5|$|Material {{assigned}} to Plateosaurus {{has been found}} at over 50 localities in Germany (mainly along the Neckar and Pegnitz river valleys), Switzerland (Frick) and France. Three localities are of special importance, because they yielded specimens in large numbers and of unusually good quality: near Halberstadt in <b>Saxony-Anhalt,</b> Germany; Trossingen in Baden-Württemberg, Germany; and Frick. Between the 1910s and 1930s, excavations in a clay pit in <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> revealed between 39 and 50 skeletons that belonged to Plateosaurus, along with teeth and {{a small number of}} bones of the theropod Liliensternus, and two skeletons and some fragments of the turtle Proganochelys. Some of the plateosaur material was {{assigned to}} P.longiceps, a species described by palaeontologist Otto Jaekel in 1914 but now considered a junior synonym of P.engelhardti. Most of the material found its way to the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, where much of it was destroyed during World War II. The Halberstadt quarry today is covered by a housing development.|$|E
5|$|Reinhold Werner {{was born}} on 10 May 1825, {{in the town of}} Weferlingen, Prussia in what is now <b>Saxony-Anhalt.</b> He served for several years in the {{merchant}} marine in the 1830s and 1840s, during which he made several voyages to the East Indies. While in the merchant marine, he was given the nickname Schweizer (Swiss), as his North German shipmates found his accent to be particularly foreign compared to their native Plattdeutsch.|$|E
5|$|Born in Wegeleben (now in <b>Saxony-Anhalt)</b> in the Kingdom of Prussia in the German Empire, Bormann {{was the son}} of Theodor Bormann (1862–1903), a {{post office}} employee, and his second wife, Antonie Bernhardine Mennong. The family was Lutheran. He had two half-siblings (Else and Walter Bormann) from his father's earlier {{marriage}} to Louise Grobler, who died in 1898. Antonie Bormann gave birth to three sons, one of whom died in infancy. Martin (born 1900) and Albert (born 1902) survived to adulthood. Theodor died when Bormann was three, and his mother soon remarried.|$|E
5|$|Mühe {{was already}} seriously ill at the prize-giving {{ceremony}} in Los Angeles in February 2007 when Das Leben der Anderen was awarded its Oscar, and {{flew back to}} Germany hours later for an urgent stomach operation. In an article in Die Welt dated 21 July 2007, Mühe discussed his diagnosis of stomach cancer which had put his acting career on hold; he died the following day. On 25 July 2007 he was buried in his mother's village of Walbeck in the Landkreis (rural district) of Börde, <b>Saxony-Anhalt.</b>|$|E
5|$|M. alcathoe {{lives in}} small groups. In Greece, a {{maternity}} colony, containing three females and two juveniles, {{has been found}} in a plane tree. Additional roosts were found high in oak trees in Baden-Württemberg and <b>Saxony-Anhalt.</b> Twenty-seven roosting sites have been found in the Czech Republic, all but one in trees (the last was in a concrete pole). Most of the tree roosts were in oaks (Quercus robur); others were in limes (Tilia cordata), birches (Betula pendula), and various other species. Its strong preference for roosting sites in trees is unusual among European bats. Roosts tend to be located high in the canopy, and are often in old trees. In summer, roosts may contain large groups of up to 80 individuals, but autumn roosts in the Czech Republic are occupied by smaller groups. M.alcathoe swarms from late July to mid-September in southern Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the Mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago. The oldest complete hunting weapons found {{anywhere in the world}} were discovered in a coal mine in Schöningen where three 380,000-year-old wooden javelins were unearthed. The Neander Valley was the location where the first ever non-modern human fossil was discovered; the new species of human was called the Neanderthal. The Neanderthal 1 fossils are known to be 40,000 years old. Evidence of modern humans, similarly dated, has been found in caves in the Swabian Jura near Ulm. The finds include 42,000-year-old bird bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found, the 40,000-year-old Ice Age Lion Man which is the oldest uncontested figurative art ever discovered, and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels which is the oldest uncontested human figurative art ever discovered. The Nebra sky disk is a bronze artifact created during the European Bronze Age attributed to a site near Nebra, <b>Saxony-Anhalt.</b> It is part of UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme.|$|E

25|$|Saxony-Wittenberg, {{in modern}} <b>Saxony-Anhalt,</b> became {{subject to the}} margravate of Meissen, ruled by the Wettin dynasty in 1423. This {{established}} a new and powerful state, occupying large portions of the present Free State of Saxony, Thuringia, <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> and Bavaria (Coburg and its environs). Although the centre of this state was far to the southeast of the former Saxony, {{it came to be}} referred to as Upper Saxony and then simply Saxony, while the former Saxon territories were now known as Lower Saxony.|$|E
25|$|In 1997–98 Magdeburg {{managed to}} stay in the third-tier Regionalliga and win the <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> Cup for the second time and in the {{following}} year, the team competed for promotion to 2nd Bundesliga for a long time, but eventually finished third, raising hopes that the team would be able to qualify for the reduced Regionalligas in the following season. However, a tenth place meant relegation to tier IV once more. Consolation could only be found in the club's reserves winning the <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> Cup for a third time.|$|E

25|$|The Free State of Saxony was reconstituted with {{slightly}} altered borders in 1990, following German reunification. Besides the formerly Silesian area of Saxony, which was mostly {{included in the}} territory of the new Saxony, the free state gained further areas north of Leipzig that had belonged to <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> until 1952.|$|E
25|$|Various sites {{both inside}} and outside Germany (supposedly) visited by Martin Luther {{throughout}} his lifetime commemorate it with local memorials. <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> has two towns lawfully named after Luther, Lutherstadt Eisleben and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.

25|$|The {{eastern states}} Saxony, <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> and Thuringia combine Hauptschule and Realschule as Sekundarschule, Mittelschule and Regelschule respectively. All German states have Gymnasium as one {{possibility}} {{for the more}} able children, and all states - except Saxony - have some Gesamtschulen, but in different forms. The states of Berlin and Hamburg have only two types of schools: comprehensive schools and Gymnasium.|$|E
25|$|The Saxon stem duchy {{covered the}} greater part of present-day Northern Germany, {{including}} the modern German states (Länder) of Lower Saxony and <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> up to the Elbe and Saale rivers in the east, the city-states of Bremen and Hamburg, as well as the Westphalian part of North Rhine-Westphalia and the Holstein region (Nordalbingia) of Schleswig-Holstein. In the late 12th century, Duke Henry the Lion also occupied the adjacent area of Mecklenburg (the former Billung March).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the GDR, the subject of {{euthanasia}} in Bernburg was not addressed. Only in the 1980s did the hospital staff begin slowly to deal with the topic. In the wake of the Wende, a memorial was opened, which was transferred in 1994 to the state. The director of the memorial is Ute Hoffmann. Since 1 January 2007, the memorial has been sponsored by the Memorial Foundation of <b>Saxony-Anhalt.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{the primary}} {{registries}} are the Horse Breeders' Associations of Saxony-Thuringia and <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> and Thuringia, this studbook {{has proven to}} be the most liberal, accepting heavy warmbloods registered in Westphalia, Baden-Wurttemberg, Weser-Ems, Bavaria, and Berlin-Brandenburg. The goal of this policy is to identify and promote any and all remaining heavy warmblood horses. The heavy warmblood makes up 15-25% of the horse population in Saxony and Thuringia, which attests to the program's efficacy. As of 2005 there were 51 stallions and 1140 mares.|$|E
25|$|Domhardt {{was the son}} of {{a domain}} tenant who immigrated from the Anhalt in 1724 to the {{north-east}} of Prussia. His parents were Justus Heinrich Domhardt († 1736) and his wife Katharina Gertrud Trüstedt, who came from a family of civic leaders in Gardelegen, <b>Saxony-Anhalt.</b> He attended the Martineum (Halberstadt) and the Royal Litvian Provincial School and acquired a good school education. His father died when he was 19 years old. Subsequently, he took over the his father's lease of the property in Ragnit.|$|E
25|$|Magdeburg have fan rivalries with Hallescher FC and Dynamo Dresden. The {{rivalry with}} Hallescher FC {{centers around the}} {{question}} of being no. 1 in <b>Saxony-Anhalt,</b> while the Dresden rivalry {{can be traced back}} to the 1970s, when both clubs formed the elite of East German football. There is a friendly relation to Eintracht Braunschweig, accepted by a large part of Magdeburg supporters. Some, however, merely respect the friendship, while remaining generally critical. The fans have also friendly relations with fans of Polish team Hutnik Kraków.|$|E
25|$|The Saale-Unstrut {{region was}} spared {{destruction}} during the Second World War. The liberation by American {{troops in the}} spring of 1945 was followed in the summer of the same year by hand-over of the area to the Red Army and the Saale-Unstrut region thus became part of East Germany (GDR). There was no attempt in the Saale-Unstrut area to demolish old town quarters. After the reuniﬁcation of the two German states in 1990 the well-preserved cultural landscape of the Saale-Unstrut region became part of the Federal State of <b>Saxony-Anhalt.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Saxons {{were one}} of the most robust groups in the late tribal culture of the times, and {{eventually}} bequeathed their tribe's name to a variety of more and more modern geo-political territories from Old Saxony (Altsachsen) near the mouth of the Elbe up the river via the Prussian Province of Saxony (in present-day <b>Saxony-Anhalt)</b> to Upper Saxony, the Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony from 1806 corresponding with the German Free State of Saxony, which bears the name today though it {{was not part of the}} medieval duchy (see map on the right).|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of the former margraviate, {{commonly known as the}} , lies in present-day eastern Germany and western Poland. Geographically it encompassed the majority of the present-day German states Brandenburg and Berlin, the Altmark (the northern third of <b>Saxony-Anhalt),</b> and the Neumark (now divided between Poland's Lubusz and West Pomeranian Voivodeships). Parts of the present-day federal state Brandenburg, such as Lower Lusatia and territory which had been Saxon until 1815, were not parts of the Mark. Colloquially but not accurately, the federal state Brandenburg is sometimes identified as the Mark or Mark Brandenburg.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} 1989 the Dessau {{section of the}} Armeesporttvereinigung Vorwärts was {{dissolved}} and players and teams joined the civilian sports association Dessau 89. On 20 June 1990 the members decided to rename the club FC Anhalt Dessau. Until 1998 the club played in the NOFV-Oberliga, winning the Bezirkspokal in 1992. In 1992, 1994 and 1999 Anhalt reached {{the final of the}} <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> Cup, but suffered defeats against FSV Lok/Altmark Stendal (twice) and VfL Halle 96, respectively. FC Anhalt were relegated twice, in 1998 and 2002, but won immediate re-promotion to the NOFV-Oberliga on both occasions.|$|E
25|$|Reformation Day commemorates the {{publication}} of the Ninety Five Theses in 1517 by Martin Luther; it has been historically important in the following European entities. It is a civic holiday in the German states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> and Thuringia. Slovenia celebrates it due to the profound contribution of the Reformation to its culture. Austria allows Protestant children not to go to school that day, and Protestant workers have a right to leave work in order to participate in a church service. Switzerland celebrates the holiday on the first Sunday after 31 October. It is also celebrated elsewhere around the world.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} season Magdeburg {{finished}} eighth, but winning the <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> Cup meant qualification for the DFB-Pokal. Magdeburg met then Second Bundesliga club Wuppertaler SV and beat them 8–7 after penalties in a dramatic game. In the third round, holders Bayer 04 Leverkusen came to a sold out Ernst-Grube-Stadion and triumphed, Magdeburg was beaten 5–1. The 1993–94 season saw Magdeburg miss out in yet another qualification, finishing seventh because they had scored less goals than Hertha Zehlendorf. Magdeburg competed in tier IV now, finishing twelfth in Oberliga Nordost/Staffel Nord. This was the worst position the club ever finished in– and a mere 444 spectators {{came to see the}} matches on average.|$|E
25|$|In July 1945, Perkhorovich was {{appointed}} first {{deputy chief of}} the Soviet Military Administration in <b>Saxony-Anhalt.</b> In February 1946, he {{was appointed}} commander of the 28th Army, now stationed in the Belorussian Military District, but Perkhorovich did not actually assume command and in May he entered the Higher Academic Courses at the Higher Military Academy named for K.E. Voroshilov. Due to illness {{he was not able}} to graduate, but in April 1947, Perkhorovich became chief of the General Staff's Combat Training Directorate. He retired in July 1951 and lived in Moscow, where he died on 11 October 1961. Perkhorovich was buried in section 14 of the Vvedenskoye Cemetery. A street in Voronezh is named for him.|$|E
25|$|The coldbloods of Germany {{were already}} well-suited {{to the new}} demands of farming given their immense power, and the Ostfriesen had to prove it could offer these same qualities. The one {{advantage}} for the warmbloods was their versatility. They were subsequently bred to have greater depth, breadth and strength, {{at the expense of}} the dryness, nerve, expression and gait qualities for which they had previously been selected. From 1908 to 1940, the average height of Ostfriesisches decreased 4cm while average weight increased from 630kg to 760kg. Other regions began to breed heavy warmbloods: Baden-Württemberg, Hesse, Bavaria, Thuringia, <b>Saxony-Anhalt,</b> Saxony, and Silesia. While they were founded on their own stock, horses from Oldenburg and Ostfriesland were sold there each year to help them realize their goals.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuing}} Hallische Händel-Ausgabe edition {{was first}} inaugurated in 1955 in the Halle region in <b>Saxony-Anhalt,</b> Eastern Germany. It {{did not start}} as a critical edition, but after heavy criticism of the first volumes, which were performing editions without a critical apparatus (for example, the opera Serse was published with the title character recast as a tenor reflecting pre-war German practice), it repositioned itself as a critical edition. Influenced in part by cold-war realities, editorial work was inconsistent: misprints are found in abundance and editors failed to consult important sources. In 1985 a committee was formed to establish better standards for the edition. The unification of Germany in 1990 removed communication problems, and the volumes issued have since shown a significant improvement in standards.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the landfall, an {{approximate}} 25,000 homes in southern England were without electricity after electricity pylons were damaged by the storm. Same day, the German states of Brandenburg, Saxony and <b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> were hit by a massive power cut. 52,000 homes were without energy, according to local utility envia. The German district Siegen-Wittgenstein had issued a state of emergency, with schools remaining closed on Friday, 19 January, and roads not to be cleared right away, but closed instead until the situation improved. By {{the second day of the}} storm, more than one million homes were left without power in the Czech republic with another million households without electricity in Germany and tens of thousands dark homes in Austria and Poland.|$|E
