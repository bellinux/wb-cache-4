50|$|Over the years, the {{equipment}} {{at the station}} was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The Air Force inactivated the 693d on 30 September 1970. In 1972, Dauphin Island {{became part of the}} <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> Defense <b>Systems</b> (SADS). It was given a new NORAD designation, Z-249. The 635th was inactivated on 1 July 1974.|$|R
50|$|The 678th Air Defense Group is a disbanded United States Air Force organization. Its last {{assignment}} {{was with the}} 20th Air Division of Air Defense Command (ADC) at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The group was formed in 1970 when ADC expanded its radar units that operated Back-Up Interceptor Control sites from squadron sized units to groups. From 1977 until it was inactivated in 1983 the 678th was responsible for operating the <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> Defense <b>System.</b>|$|R
50|$|Activated a {{third time}} in 1972 as an ADC radar squadron, it was {{colocated}} with a Federal Aviation Administration control center in Houston, Texas {{as part of the}} <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> Defense <b>System</b> (SADS) In 1969, the inadequacy of the radar coverage to the south of the United States were dramatically illustrated whan a Cuban MiG-17 went undetected before it landed at Homestead AFB, and two years later, an An-24 similarly arrived unannounced at New Orleans International Airport. As a result, ADC established SADS with the squadron operating a manual control center at the Houston ARTCC and added radars to supplement the existing Federal Aviation Administration coverage in the area, which were manned by the Operating Locations of the squadron.|$|R
5000|$|The Squadron was {{activated}} {{again in}} 1973 to replace Operating Location F of the 630th Radar Squadron at Lake Charles AFS {{as part of}} the <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> Defense <b>System</b> (SADS). [...] SADS had been established because of the inadequacy of the radar coverage to the south of the United States that had been dramatically illustrated whan a Cuban MiG-17 went undetected before it landed at Homestead AFB, and two years later, an An-24 similarly arrived unannounced at New Orleans International Airport. As a result, ADC established SADS with the squadron operating a manual control center at the Houston ARTCC and added radars to supplement the existing Federal Aviation Administration coverage in the area. [...] However, the squadron was inactivated {{little more than a year}} later.|$|R
5000|$|In 1969, the {{inadequacy}} of the radar coverage {{to the south of}} the United States had been dramatically illustrated whan a Cuban Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 went undetected before it landed at Homestead Air Force Base,south of Miami, Florida. and two years later, an Antonov An-24 similarly arrived unannounced at New Orleans International Airport. As a result, ADC established The <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> Defense <b>System</b> (SADS). Initially, the 630th Radar Squadron operated a manual control center at the Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center and the USAF added radars to supplement the existing Federal Aviation Administration coverage in the Caribbean area. In 1977, responsibility for operating the SADS control center was transferred to the group, which was operating the last BUIC III site in ADC. [...] The previous year the group also assumed responsibility to operate the Tyndall NORAD Control Center.|$|R

He {{felt it was important}} to preserve the historic link to the past, and Lindenwood agreed to leave the <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> sign up so that it would be recognized for its historical value. James D. Evans became president of Lindenwood in 2007, and under his watch Lindenwood requested to replace the <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> with a Lindenwood University sign in 2010. Lindenwood wanted to cancel its previous agreement regarding the <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> sign in an effort to attract more students to the satellite campus in Wentzville.

50|$|In 1990 a hill {{at one end}} of {{the strip}} was leveled; this left more room for {{aircraft}} to land, and allowed easier access to the strip. <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> then purchased FXE and FWZ in 1990 to replace FGR and FFL because of difficulty obtaining parts (FFL's main parts—such as its fuselage—are in Invercargill, as are parts of FGR). Smith brought the post office/depot in 1995; Stewart Island Travel was no longer needed for van service, since <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> had Bedford CFs and Hiaces for this now. In 1997 <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> was brought by Allan Aitcheson, and the name was changed to <b>Southern</b> <b>Air</b> 1997 Limited.
