40|$|The Service Path Attribution Network (SPAN) {{framework}} {{provides a}} novel, user-centric, connectivity-based approach to ecosystem service assessment and valuation (ESAV). Ecosys-tem services are delivered to users through the simulated flow of some <b>service</b> <b>medium</b> (i. e., matter, energy, or information) from the ecosystems {{in which it}} originates (sources) to the people or assets which it affects (users). Along the way, the <b>service</b> <b>medium</b> may be absorbed by intervening landscape features (sinks) or captured by rival users. Crucially, the <b>service</b> <b>medium</b> is not itself an ecosystem service or benefit but rather an agnostic transport mechanism which establishes connectivity between sources, sinks, rival users, and nonrival users within a delimited study region. Each user then receives benefits or harm from the encountered <b>service</b> <b>medium</b> depending on their specific relationship with it.

In the SPAN terminology, sources provide provisioning ecosystem services to users with a beneficial relationship with the <b>service</b> <b>medium.</b> Similarly, sinks provide preventive ecosystem services to users with a detrimental relationship with the <b>service</b> <b>medium</b> by reducing the amount flowing to their locations. Notably, within a single SPAN analysis, both sources and sinks may provide ecosystem services given a sufficiently heterogeneous pool of users. The results of a SPAN ESAV analysis are myriad, totalling up to 30 output maps for some services. Taken together, these maps {{tell the story of}} which sources provide services to which users, which sinks protect users from harm, which users compete for the same resources (and who wins), and how all of the sources, sinks, rival users, and nonrival users affect one another. Additionally, a SPAN simulation produces maps of the flow paths taken by the <b>service</b> <b>medium</b> from sources to users as well as where and by how much the flow strength is reduced by sinks. Studying these flow paths can help decision makers identify those locations at which management actions would be maximized or minimized depending on their specific development goals. A crowning achievement of this work is that for most ecosystem services the SPAN algorithm 2 ̆ 7 s complexity is guaranteed to be linear O(n) in both time and space with respect to the number of discrete locations analyzed. This makes it a viable option for high resolution landscape level ESAV studies using no more than commodity hardware. This dissertation explores the SPAN framework in depth, from its novel conceptual terminology and computational algorithms through to the intended interpretation of its results. In addition to describing the conceptual and mathematical components of this system in detail, this work also provides a complete Literate Program demonstrating the application of the SPAN framework to an assessment of the scenic beauty ecosystem service in Chittenden County, Vermont...|$|E

40|$|According to the Czech law Czech Radio Council is {{the body}} through which the public excercises their right to control public <b>service</b> <b>medium.</b> Thesis Work of Czech Radio Council between 1992 and 2002 {{analyzes}} the operation of this supervisory authority {{in the first decade}} of its existence. Two basic approaches are applied. The first one is the quantitative analysis of the agenda of the Czech Radio Council. Based on research of the records from the Council meetings, the analysis divides the issues discussed by the Council into ten basic cathegories that are then quantified and compared. However, use of the above method necessarily leads to considerable standardization of the input data. Numeric outcome is therefore combined with historical interpretation that introduces factual operation of the Council and presents it in the context of integral functioning of the Czech Radio. Based on these two approaches the thesis provides a concept of periodization of the Czech Radio Council operation between 1992 and 2002. The text attempts to apprehend the Czech Radio Council in broader context of the development of public service broadcasting and its control, and also in the context of media system transformation in Central Europe after 1989...|$|E

It has been demonstrated that the radio editors compensate the non- visual nature with the means such as telling the stories on designers and their creative efforts, analysis of socio-economical context of the fashion industry etc. Besides that, the editors use websites (including podcasts, pictures and video reports) and social networks to complement the sound recording with visual communication. The thesis also includes a case study that compares features about a specific fashion event of a national importance (the Prague Fashion Week of September 2015) on the radio, in the print an online.

40|$|International audienceDuring the ageing of in <b>service</b> <b>medium</b> voltage equipments, {{electrical}} {{losses are}} mainly due to partial discharges. These partial discharges {{can lead to}} the electrical failure of industrial equipments. Partial discharges include (i) bulk discharges occurring in insulating material voids, (ii) corona discharges affecting or not the insulator and (iii) surface discharges developing on an insulator surface from a triple point (conductor/insulating material/air). Bulk and surface discharges can respectively lead to a final volume or surface breakdown whereas corona discharges may only induce in a long term chemical surface ageing. Surface discharges and corona discharges produce chemical species in atmospheric air, i. e. ozone and nitrogen oxides. These products can be identified and quantified by a periodic sampling of the ambient air in the medium voltage equipment enclosure during accelerated ageing cycles. In previous studies, it was demonstrated that the nature and relative distribution of concentration of these stable gaseous products was closely correlated to the discharge regime (glow, streamer, spark regimes). Measurements have been carried out on a distribution cell and transformer using low cost electrochemical and semi conductive sensors; acoustic measurements were simultaneously performed. It is shown that gas discharges can be detected within a few minutes from their onset. The discharge regime can also be characterized thanks to the specific detection of nitrogen oxides while low regime corona discharges are simultaneously occurring. The change in the surface discharge regime is evidence of accelerated insulator surface ageing (risks of surface breakdown); equipment enclosure ambient air sampling can then be an accurate method for determination of the state of health of this type of equipment...|$|E

The daily forecasts included predictions of maxi-mum and minimum temperatures for one to five days (Day-l to Day- 5) in the future. The predictions were veri-fied using official observations of the National Weather Service. The media forecasts were compared with each other, with the observations, with predictions from the National Weather <b>Service</b> <b>Medium</b> Range Forecast Model Output Statistics (MRF-MOS), and with "no-skill " fore-casts based on persistence and climatology. Typically, the media forecasts differed little from each other or from the MRF-MOS, but very large departures occasionally occurred, especially for longer-range projections. Root mean square (rms) errors of daily maximum temperature forecasts increased from 5. 5 °F for Day-l to 10. 9 °F for Day- 5 for the six-media average. Although differences among the media forecasts were generally small, one media team had slightly smaller rms errors for temperature forecasts for maximum and for minimum temperatures {{for most of the}} five individual projections {{as well as for the}} five days combined.

40|$|In my {{dissertation}} entitled “The Critical Eye: Re-Viewing 1970 s Television,” I {{argue that}} TV scholars would benefit greatly {{by engaging in}} a more nuanced consideration of the television critic’s industrial position as a key figure of negotiation. As such, critical discourse has often been taken for granted in scholarship without attention to how this discourse may obscure contradictions implicit within the TV industry and the critic’s own identity as both an insider and an outsider to the television business. My dissertation brings the critic to the fore, employing the critic as a lens through which I view television aesthetics, media policy, and technology. This study {{is grounded in the}} disciplines of television studies, media industries studies, new media studies, and cultural studies. Yet because the critic’s writing reflects the totality of television as an entertainment and public <b>service</b> <b>medium,</b> the significance of this study expands beyond disciplinary concerns to a reconsideration of the impact of television upon American culture. This project offers a history of the television critic during the 1970 s, a decade in which the field of criticism professionalized and expanded dramatically. Methodologically, I am incorporating three approaches, including historical research of the 1970 s television industry, textual analysis of critical writing, and interviews with critics working during that decade. I’ve identified the 1970 s for a variety of reasons, including its parallels with today’s significant technological and industrial transformations. My central texts will be the industry trade publications, Variety and Broadcasting, and national daily newspapers including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, and Chicago Tribune. Viewing TV criticism as a profession, a historical source, and a site of scholarly analysis, this project offers a series of interventions, including a consideration of how critical writing may serve as a primary source for historians and how television studies has overlooked the significance of the critic as an object of analysis in his/her own right...|$|E
40|$|Trotz relativ guter physiogeographischer Rahmenbedingungen fällt die Landwirtschaft Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns nach Wertschöpfung, Flächenproduktivität, Subventionseffektivität weit hinter die der westlichen Bundesländer zurück. Ursachen sind unter anderem die Inflexibilität und Unproduktivität übergroßer Unternehmen, die Dominanz billiger Massenproduktion und der Verzicht der Großbetriebe auf die Bedienung nachfragestarker Marktsegmente im ökologischen und hochqualitativen Bereich. Die Subventionierung und Privilegierung der großbetrieblich strukturierten Agrarindustrie muss abgebaut, die Förderung innovativer kleiner und mittlerer bäuerlicher Betriebe intensiviert werden. Die Infrastruktur in Ländlichen Räumen muss wachstumsorientiert für Landwirtschaft, Tourismus, hochwertiges Wohnen und seniorenbezogene Dienstleistungen ausgebaut werden. In {{spite of}} {{relatively}} good general conditions and good soils, agriculture in Mecklenburg-Vorpom-mern {{is the only}} economic sector in the state whose gross value added has not seen a positive development in the last 20 years. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern’s agricultural sector stagnates at a low level and with a productivity of only 613 euros per hectare at 31. 7 per cent below the German average. One {{of the most significant}} causes for this are the large farming businesses which are specialised in cheap mass production. Low area productivity is a result of inadequate flexibility of the large farming companies when it comes to reacting to market signals. Whilst smaller farms, which dominate agriculture in West Germany, can adjust their productive alignment relatively quickly or diversify to mix their income, large farming businesses try to avoid changes or put them off for as long as possible. The form of production, which is dominated by industrial farming, and the marginalisation of small and medium-sized farms as a result of land speculation and price dumping, cause the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern regional economic damages of at least € 250 million annually. The subsidisation and privileged treatment of industrial farming has to be cut down on as quickly as possible. We propose a new model of cooperation in rural areas called “Garden of metropolises”.

40|$|Agriculture {{is crucial}} to the {{economic}} and social wellbeing of the Republic of Cameroon. A national need for increased productivity, farm incomes, food security and rural development requires more effective agricultural extension and advisory systems. The need is persistent. This study analyzed strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that existed within the current national extension program and examined how form, function, and policy influenced two regions in Cameroon. Analysis focused on 15 -year time changes using a comparative case study design. Four regional focus groups and 28 individual interviews bounded 59 cases from four stakeholder groups of farmer leaders, non-governmental organizations, extension representatives, and governmental counterparts. Eighteen primary themes emerged with overlap of opportunities and threats among stakeholders. Incentives to program performance included staff competence and innovative technology transfer. Barriers included infrastructure, postharvest technology, market incentives, financial sustainability, and feedback. A lack of vision for sustainability, inadequate government funding, poor collaboration and linkages, uncoordinated parallel programs, and ineffective management systems reduced program potential. Four themes framed recommendations for improved programs: government investment, trainings, market incentives, and management. Options to improve program sustainability included subsidies that benefit all farmers, more council and private sector engagement with extension, rural infrastructure development, price standardization, and fees for <b>service.</b> <b>Medium</b> and large-scale farmers were willing to pay for extension services when and if available whereas small-scale farmers relied heavily on subsidized services. Accessibility to markets, farm size, and cash crop production are associated with farmers? acceptance of fees for service. These findings highlighted areas where changes in the nation?s agricultural extension service could improve its relevance in meeting performance targets. Stakeholders? recommendations for more effective agricultural extension and advisory systems included: 1) providing an autonomous extension service that focuses on specific needs and market opportunities and coordinates all support/parallel programs while collaborating among research and private advisory services; 2) implementing holistic government policies that integrate technology transfer, innovation, health, value-chains, and markets to benefit all farmers; 3) redesigning subsidies that equitability incentivize production and sound environmental practices that benefit all farmers; 4) increasing in-service trainings related to innovations; and 5) updating innovations and harmonizing program activities...|$|E
