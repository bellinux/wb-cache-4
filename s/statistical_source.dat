They are usually compiled by national statistical offices and/or central banks in each country, though this is not always the case, and may be released on both an annual and (less detailed) quarterly frequency. Practical issues include inaccuracies from differences between economic and accounting methodologies, lack of controlled experiments on quality of data from diverse sources, and measurement of intangibles and services of the banking and financial sectors.|$|E

Recently, some central banks and statistical authorities have started projects to build up securities databases to store information on securities holders. This paper introduces the Bank of Japan’s recent exploration of the central securities depository (CSD) data as a <b>statistical</b> <b>source</b> of securities holders ’ information. First, it explains the features of the CSD in Japan. Second, it introduces the improvement in the flow of funds accounts statistics implemented in March 2010. Third, it argues the challenges to develop CSD data as a <b>statistical</b> <b>source</b> to identify final holders of securities. This paper concludes that using CSD data is one approach to solve data gap problems. Key words: CSD, security by security, data gap...|$|E

These <b>statistical</b> <b>sources</b> allow similarities to be drawn between the Henan famine and other famines that {{occurred during}} the Second World War, such as in Bengal, when the combination of bad weather, war-induced disruptions to food markets, and the relegation of famine relief to the war effort, brought great hardship to civilians living near the war front.

Our main <b>statistical</b> <b>source</b> is the Spanish Industrial Establishments Register, which has plant-level microdata on location of new industrial establishments.

The increased concentration of financial wealth was an important factor in determining this path. ...|$|E
