The {{ultimate goal is to}} be able to identify patterns of high rating and match them towards a reference database consisting naturalistic driving data. Two segmentations of the drives are used, equilength subsegments and steering operations. An alternative morphed <b>standardised</b> <b>rating</b> scaled is proposed. Two data mining approaches are applied. The first method is based on using an ensemble classifier on features derived from the CAN-data to predict the rating of each segment of the data. The second method uses an outlier detection algorithm and a hierarchical clustering approach on a distance metric based on the angles between the principal variance components of the observations. Using the ensemble classifier and general variables a large proportion of rating variance can be explained when including driver and route factors. Large rating values can be identified well. For the <b>standardised</b> <b>rating</b> the prediction of high values is worse with many false positives. The matching of signals using the covariance structure works well. Using hierarchical clustering clusters with <b>standardised</b> <b>rating</b> high above average can be obtained. Outliers with high <b>standardised</b> <b>rating</b> are extracted and matched towards a larger database. The matches are few but similar to the original situations owing to the fact the matching is strict. In conclusion the ensemble classifier works well for predicting rating when driver and route factors are included. The covariance-based method performs well for situation matching and clusters with high rating can be identified. It also has potential to be be used for extracting and matching more sofisticated patterns...|$|R

Results: A higher proportion of greenspace in an area was generally associated with better population health. However, this association varied according to the combination of area income deprivation and urbanity. There was no significant association between greenspace and health in higher income suburban and higher income rural areas.

DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis of inpatient Körner data for January 1988 to April 1989. SETTING [...] Three districts in North East Thames region. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number of readmissions after index discharge for all acute specialties combined and by specialty (general medicine, general surgery, gynaecology, trauma and orthopaedics, and geriatrics); readmission rates at 28 days after index discharge; and <b>rates</b> <b>standardised</b> for age group and sex by specialty and by consultant. RESULTS [...] All specialties showed an early peak in number of admissions, which levelled off by 28 days. Readmission rates at 28 days were appreciably lower in surgical specialties than in medical specialties (for example, general surgery 4. 1 % v geriatric medicine 15. 1 %). They were related to age and sex of the patient. <b>Rates</b> <b>standardised</b> for these variables did not significantly differ by district. Likewise, significant differences in <b>standardised</b> <b>rates</b> were not obtained for consultants within a specialty in one district.

This analysis used aggregated population-based data on fetal and neonatal mortality stratified by maternal age, parity and multiple birth from 12 countries participating in the EURO-PERISTAT project to explore this question.

There were wide variations in fetal and neonatal {{mortality rates}}, from 3. 3 to 7. 1 and 2. 0 to 6. 0 per 1000 total and livebirths, respectively, and in the prevalence of mothers over 35 (7 - 22 %), primiparae (41 - 50 %) and multiple births (2 - 4 %).

This paper examines trends in mortality rates of people receiving sickness benefit or invalid's benefit (SBIB) between 1981 and 2004 using repeated cohort studies (linking the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001 censuses to mortality data). Mortality rates, standardised for age and ethnicity, were calculated for each census cohort for 25 - 64 year olds by benefit receipt status. <b>Standardised</b> <b>rate</b> differences and rate ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to measure disparities on both absolute and relative scales. Between 1981 and 2004 overall SBIB receipt increased from 2 % to 5 % of the working age population. Mortality rates were at least three times higher in the SBIB than the non-SBIB group at all points in time for men and women. Mortality rates declined in all groups, for example in men receiving SBIB, mortality decreased from 2354 / 100 Â  000 in the 1981 - 84 cohort to 1371 / 100 Â  000 in the 2001 - 04 cohort. Absolute inequalities between SBIB and non-SBIB declined in both men and women (for example in women <b>standardised</b> <b>rate</b> differences decreased from 954 / 100 Â  000 to 688 / 100 Â  000) but relative inequalities remained largely stable (for example in men the risk ratio increased from 4. 27 to 4. 54). Mortality rates declined more in sickness benefit than invalid's benefit recipients. The substantial expansion of SBIB receipt in New Zealand has not been accompanied by any reduction in the excess mortality risk experienced by SBIB recipients. These findings are likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy, labour force and disability experience in New Zealand.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age <b>standardised</b> mortality <b>rates,</b> age <b>standardised</b> <b>rates</b> of years of potential life lost, and age specific mortality rates in relation to cause of death, sex, and year were computed as well as the comparative mortality figure and the ratio of <b>standardised</b> <b>rates</b> of years of potential life lost.

This is a surprising situation due to the apparently high degree of development in the Balearics. But probably the concept of development has to be revised. From this fact, a study about the causes and determining factors for such a high mortality rate is carried out. This is done taking the autonomous community as the territorial unit, whereas the chosen period is 1990 - 94. · The general concept of mortality, in connection with collective health, and its indicators are analysed. Good indicators in this sense are the <b>standardised</b> <b>rate</b> of mortality, life expectancy at birth and the risk or specific mortality rates by age (profiles of mortality). · The Balearic Islands exhibit the fifth highest <b>standardised</b> <b>rate</b> in Spain (among 17 autonomous communities), the lowest life expectancy at birth and the highest risk of mortality at some ages (20 to 25 and 40 to 45). · 23 socioeconomic indicators have been selected as determining factors of mortality. · The main component analysis {{has been used to}} reduce the 23 socioeconomic indicators into five large "factors", the three most important being people's educational level, their nourishing regime and their demo-economical level. · By using the cluster analysis (similarity), the 17 autonomous communities have been grouped into larger territories regarding (a) the socioeconomic factors, (b) the profiles of mortality. · Classical two-dimensional and multidimensional statistical analysis, as well as a combined cartography developed "ad hoc", have been used. · The most remarkable results are: (a) the direct causes of the apparently paradoxical present situation in the Balearics are a much higher incidence of heart diseases than the Spanish average for ages between 15 and 64, and also a higher incidence of AIDS at young ages (15 to 44), (b) societal determinants that are explanatory enough (in the statistical sense) of the above mentioned facts are a relatively low educational level, associated with a relatively poor density of medical professionals, and the high economic and demographic dynamism, which is connected to a high immigration and social destabilisation...|$|E

Subjects: all patients 65 years and older who presented to EDs between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2006 (n = 97, 161). Measurements: patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Logistic regression was used to model the effect of living in RCFs on the likelihood of a particular ED diagnosis, hospital admission and in-hospital death. Results: the age–sex <b>standardised</b> <b>rate</b> of ED presentation for those living in RCFs was 1. 69 times that of community dwellers. Compared to community dwellers, people from RCFs were older (mean age 84. 7 years vs. 76. 0 years, P < 0. 001) and a lower proportion were male (28. 7 % vs. 46. 7 %, P < 0. 001). Adjusting for age and sex revealed that people from RCFs were mor...|$|E
40|$|Background: Apathy is {{a common}} but under-recognised {{behavioural}} disorder associated with depression and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). However, the longitudinal course of apathy in PD has not been studied. Objective: To examine the occurrence of and risk factors for apathy over time in {{a representative sample of}} patients with PD. Methods: A sample of 139 patients was drawn from a population-based prevalence study of PD in Rogaland County, Western Norway. Apathy was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, using a composite score> 4 to indicate clinically significant apathy. Additional mea-surements included <b>standardised</b> <b>rating</b> scales fo...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} extent to which the need for {{tertiary}} cardiac care is being met uniformly within two Health Authorities in North-West England. We analyse small-area data from 1993 - 1996 on <b>standardised</b> <b>rates</b> of investigation (angiography) and surgery (bypass grafts and angioplasty). Utilisation by electoral ward is shown to be related to material deprivation. Small areas in which the Asian population is high have significantly fewer angiograms and angioplasties than might be expected according to need, while there is some evidence that women do not receive the levels of bypass surgery that might be expected...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{diagnostic}} work up {{of dementia}} {{may benefit from}} structured reporting of CT and/or MRI {{and the use of}} <b>standardised</b> visual <b>rating</b> scales. We advocate a more widespread use of standardised scales as part of the workflow in clinical and research evaluation of dementia. We propose routine clinical use of rating scales for medial temporal atrophy (MTA), global cortical atrophy (GCA) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). These scales can be used for evaluation of both CT and MRI and are efficient in routine imaging assessment in dementia, and may improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Our review provides detailed imaging examples of rating increments in each of these scales and a separate teaching file. The radiologist should relate visual ratings to the clinical assessment and other biomarkers to assist the clinician in the diagnostic decision. Teaching points: • Clinical dementia diagnostics would benefit from structured radiological reporting. • <b>Standardised</b> <b>rating</b> scales should be used in dementia assessment. • It is important to relate imaging findings to the clinically suspected diagnosis...|$|R
