5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a <b>spectacled</b> <b>caiman,</b> to the surprise of all.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's turtle fauna {{includes}} both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two of these species, the hawksbill turtle and the leatherback sea turtle, are critically endangered. Threats to these species include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The <b>spectacled</b> <b>caiman,</b> an introduced species, {{is the only}} representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Domestic American {{alligators}} {{range from}} long and slender to short and robust, possibly due to variations in {{factors such as}} growth rate, diet, and climate. American alligators have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws are closed, {{the edges of the}} upper jaws cover the lower teeth which fit into the jaws' hollows. Like the <b>spectacled</b> <b>caiman,</b> this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. The teeth number 74–80. Dorsally, adult American alligators may be olive, brown, gray, or black in color, while their undersides are cream-colored.|$|E

25|$|Many {{widespread}} Amazonian {{mammals and}} reptiles {{find a home}} in this region. These include tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), jaguars (Panthera onca), the world’s largest living rodents, capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), kinkajous (Potos flavus), and white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari). Some of the globally threatened animals found in this region include black caimans (Melanosuchus niger) and <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans</b> (Caiman crocodilus crocodilus), woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagotricha), giant otters (Pteronura brasiliensis), giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), and ocelots (Leopardus pardalis).|$|R
5|$|Other {{species that}} prey upon similar food {{resources}} include the caimans and large fish that are themselves piscivores. Gymnotids, {{such as the}} electric eel, and the large silurid catfish are among aquatic competitors. Two river dolphins, the tucuxi and boto, might potentially compete with the giant otter, but different spatial use and dietary preferences suggest minimal overlap. Furthermore, Defler observed associations between giant otters and the Amazon river dolphins, and suggested that dolphins may benefit by fish fleeing from the otters. The <b>spectacled</b> <b>caiman</b> is another potential competitor, but Duplaix found no conflict with the species in Suriname.|$|E
25|$|The American {{crocodile}} is saltwater-tolerant {{and have}} thus been capable of colonizing {{a multitude of}} islands within the Caribbean islands and on some coastal Pacific islands as well. They coexist with the rather smaller <b>spectacled</b> <b>caiman</b> within Central America. The only other crocodiles present within the American crocodile's range are two species smaller than this species on average: the critically endangered Cuban crocodile, along with the Morelet's crocodile in southern Mexico and Guatemala.|$|E
25|$|The park houses {{many species}} of {{crocodiles}} such as the gharial, the marsh crocodile, the salt water crocodile and the American <b>spectacled</b> <b>caiman.</b> Except the Cuban crocodile, the park has all other six major varieties, namely, Indo-Pacific or the salt water crocodile, swamp crocodile, Nile crocodile of Africa, Orinoco crocodile, Morelet's crocodile and American crocodile. The eight enclaves for crocodiles comprise about 220 individuals, including 125 adult specimens belonging to the six varieties. This includes two pairs of adult fresh water crocodiles. Many of the species also breed here.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spectacled</b> <b>caimans</b> have {{strongly}} protective maternal behaviour. They {{raise their}} young in crèches, one female {{taking care of}} her own, as well as several others' offspring. They take care of their young for the first two to four months after the eggs hatch, the time it takes for the floods of the wet season to subside.|$|R
50|$|Green iguanas are oviparous with females laying {{clutches}} of 20 to 71 eggs once per year during a synchronized nesting period. The female green iguana gives no parental protection after egg laying, apart from defending the nesting burrow during excavation. In Panama, the green iguana {{has been observed}} sharing nest sites with American crocodiles and in Honduras with <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans.</b>|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} crocodilian are traded as exotic pets. They are {{appealing}} when young, and pet-store owners can easily sell them, but crocodilians {{do not make}} good pets; they grow large and are both dangerous and expensive to keep. As they grow older, pet crocodilians are often abandoned by their owners, and feral populations of <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans</b> exist in the United States and Cuba. Most countries have strict regulations for keeping these reptiles.|$|R
500|$|Growth in {{hatchlings}} {{and young}} crocodilians {{depends on the}} food supply, and sexual maturity is linked with length rather than age. Female saltwater crocodiles reach maturity at , while males mature at [...] Australian freshwater crocodiles take ten years to reach maturity at [...] The <b>spectacled</b> <b>caiman</b> matures earlier, reaching its mature length of [...] in four to seven years. Crocodilians continue to grow throughout their lives. Males in particular continue to gain in weight as they get older, but this is mostly {{in the form of}} extra girth rather than length. Crocodilians can live 35–75 years, and their age can be determined by growth rings in their bones.|$|E
2500|$|The bank {{is home to}} 14 {{species of}} the 23 crocodilian species living across the world, {{two of which are}} listed by the IUCN as {{critically}} endangered and three more as threatened. The 14 crocodile species available in the bank are mugger (Crocodylus palustris), salt-water crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), tomistoma (Tomistoma schlegelii), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus Moreletii), <b>spectacled</b> <b>caiman</b> (Caiman crocodilus), West African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis), Australian fresh water crocodile (Crocodylus Johnsoni), African slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops cataphractus), dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus), yacare caiman (Caiman yacare), Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and the endangered Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis). The bank currently houses over 2,400 crocodiles and also many species of turtles, snakes, and lizards which are viewable by the public. The bank houses 12 endangered species of turtles and tortoises and 5 species of snakes, including king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), Asian water monitors (Varanus salvator salvator), two species of pythons, and albino cobras. Of the 5,000 reptiles bred at the bank, 3,000 represent the native Indian species Crocodylus palustris, known as muggers. One of the biggest attractions of the park is a fierce salt-water crocodile known as Jaws III. This species, believed to be the biggest in southern Asia, is [...] long and weighs over a ton. The bank is also going to get four new species of crocodiles. These are black caimans, smooth-fronted caimans, Cuban crocodiles and broad-snouted caimans. Anacondas will also appear at the bank. Since April, 2016 four Komodo dragons - three male, one female - {{have been added to the}} list of exhibits. The dragons were acquired from Bronx Zoo in New York.|$|E

50|$|Isla Damas, or Damas Island, {{is a small}} (6 km²) {{island in}} Costa Rica in the {{vicinity}} of Quepos. It is particularly noted for its estuaries lined with mangroves. Fauna on the island include white-faced monkeys, sloths, green iguanas, crocodiles, <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans,</b> boas, crab-eating raccoons and silky anteaters, as well as crabs and numerous bird species, such as: heron, pelicans. Boat and kayak tours through the island's estuaries are popular excursions with tourists staying in Quepos, Manuel Antonio National Park, or Jacó.|$|R
25|$|Adult American {{crocodiles}} have {{no natural}} predators and almost any terrestrial or riparian animal they encounter is potential prey. American crocodiles are known predators of lemon sharks, and sharks avoid areas with American crocodiles. Usually American crocodiles are dominant over American alligators. However, on one occasion, an American crocodile in a Florida zoo escaped its cage {{and started a}} fight with a large male American alligator in a bordering pen and was killed by the American alligator. Conversely, there is one confirmed case of an American crocodile preying on a sub-adult American alligator in the wild in Florida. American alligators and American crocodiles do not often come into conflict in the wild normally, due largely to habitat partitioning and largely separate distributions. There are several records of American crocodiles killing and eating <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans</b> (Caiman crocodilus) in South America as well as additional records of cannibalism there. Areas with healthy American crocodile populations often hold only limited numbers of <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans,</b> while conversely areas that formerly held American crocodiles but {{where they are now}} heavily depleted or are locally extinct show a growth of caiman numbers, due to less competition as well as predation. In areas where the two species coexist, the smaller but more aggressive Cuban crocodile is behaviorally dominant over the larger American crocodile. In Mexico some Morelet's crocodile individuals have escaped from captivity, establishing feral populations and creating a problem for the populations of American crocodile, which must compete with this invasive species.|$|R

2500|$|Nukak are expert hunters. The men hunt using blowguns, with darts {{coated with}} curare [...] "manyi", a poison made from {{different}} plants (curares). They specially hunt {{several species of}} monkeys (Alouatta spp., Cebus spp., Saimiri sp., Lagothrix spp., Ateles sp., Saguinus spp., Callicebus torquatus), and birds (Muscovy duck, chachalacas, guans, curassows, grey-winged trumpeter and toucans). Also they use javelins of Socratea exorrhiza palm wood to hunt two species of peccaries (Tayassu pecari and T. tajacu) and <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans,</b> whose eggs they consume too.

5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans</b> in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|R
50|$|The Orinoco {{crocodile}} {{is highly}} endangered due to excessive hunting for its hide. During the 1940s to the 1960s, {{thousands of these}} animals were slaughtered in the Orinoco River and the Llanos wetlands, and the species {{came very close to}} extinction. The Orinoco crocodile was given protected status in the 1970s, but has yet to recover. Today, it is protected both in Colombia and Venezuela, and also included on Appendix I by CITES. In addition to hunting for its hide, more recent threats include the collection of juveniles for sale in the live animal trade, pollution, and the proposal of a dam in the upper Orinoco River region. Another problem is the increased population of <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans,</b> a smaller crocodilian that can outcompete the Orinoco crocodile for fish due to its much larger population and much more accelerated breeding rates.|$|R

It is not uncommon for the mother to care for her young even weeks after they have hatched, remaining attentive to their calls and continuing to provide transportation. About five weeks after hatching, the young American crocodiles disband in search of their own independent lives. Most of them, of course, will not survive, being preyed upon by several types of raptorial birds and larger fishes (e.g. barred catfish (Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum), Atlantic tarpons (Megalops atlanticus), common snook (Centropomis undecimalis) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris)), boa constrictors (Boa constrictor), black spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis), <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans,</b> as well as raccoons.

50|$|Several {{scientists}} and students have undertaken studies in Piedras Blancas National Park, using La Gamba Field Station {{as a base}} for their investigative trips. They have produced a booklet with descriptions of 37 amphibian and 42 reptile species of the Esquinas rainforest. You are likely to encounter spectacularly colored frogs such as the red-eyed leaf frog or poison-arrow frogs, tree frogs, glass frogs, rain frogs and cane toads. The nocturnal concert of frog calls at Esquinas Lodge is unforgettable. Basilisks and iguanas frequent the streams, anole lizards {{can be seen in the}} garden, and geckos can be seen chasing insects in the main lodge building at nighttime. The most common and most dangerous snake is the fer-de-lance, but coral snakes, vine snakes, boa constrictors and pit vipers are seen occasionally. <b>Spectacled</b> <b>caimans</b> live in the ponds, and American crocodiles can be seen in larger rivers and mangrove swamps.|$|R

5000|$|The Tropical Realm is {{also the}} centre of the reptile collection. The {{crocodile}} pools (which formerly housed West African dwarf crocodiles, American alligators and Philippine crocodiles) currently house <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans</b> in one and white-winged wood ducks in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for tuataras. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving sphenodont, a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) rhinoceros ratsnakes, emerald tree boas and eyelash vipers now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of Serrated Casquehead Iguanas, Green-Crested Lizards, caiman lizards, and a Parson's chameleon.|$|R
50|$|About {{four million}} <b>spectacled</b> <b>caimans</b> {{are found in}} Venezuela. Recent surveys show the {{population}} {{is expected to continue}} to increase. This {{is an example of how}} well the species is able to adapt. However, it is difficult to determine how well the species is doing on a global scale, since populations are not doing well in other countries, including Peru and El Salvador. Despite being commonly mistaken as this species, the incredibly large population of caimans living within the Brazilian pantanal are a separate species, the yacare caiman. More up-to-date surveys are required for clarification, and to examine the interactions between the different subspecies. Further taxonomic work would make control measures easier to implement, as identification of different subspecies currently can be difficult. The major threat to this species and its subspecies is currently illegal hunting. Smuggling rings operating from Thailand and Singapore are extremely damaging to individual populations, and greater control measures and more effective legislation are needed.|$|R
