Admitted to the Iowa Bar in 1996, Hense subsequently misappropriated $ 837, 000 in client trust funds to feed her addiction to casino gambling.

If a mariner does not meet certain requirements related to safety and security at sea, Coast Guard investigative officers are to serve the mariner with a complaint that lists the allegation(s) and initiate proceedings that can result in the mariner's credential being suspended or revoked. GAO was asked to review elements of the ALJ program and this report addresses (1) {{the extent to which}} the ALJ program contains elements designed to foster the decisional independence of ALJs, (2) {{the extent to which the}} ALJ program includes protections for mariners and whether complaints and decisions include elements required by program regulations, and (3) the outcome of mariner <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> cases in recent years. To conduct this study, GAO analyzed the laws, regulations, and policies governing the ALJ program. GAO also reviewed all <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> cases opened <b>and</b> closed from November 10, 2005, through September 30, 2008, to determine outcomes, and further reviewed a representative sample of these cases to determine whether complaints and decisions included the required elements.
