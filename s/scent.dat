5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is critically important}} for strepsirrhines like the ring-tailed lemur. Males and females <b>scent</b> mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital <b>scent</b> glands. The ring-tailed lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with its feet while it applies its <b>scent.</b> Use of <b>scent</b> marking varies by age, sex and social status. Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their <b>scent.</b> This is known as spur-marking.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} <b>scent,</b> {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony <b>scent.</b> Any ant that enters a colony without a matching <b>scent</b> will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
5|$|Communication among North American river otters is {{accomplished}} mainly by olfactory and auditory signals. <b>Scent</b> marking is imperative for intergroup communication. The river otter scent-marks with feces, urine, and possibly anal sac secretions. Musk from the <b>scent</b> glands {{may also be}} secreted when otters are frightened or angry.|$|E
40|$|Fragrance free/unscented: According to Health Canada's {{labeling}} regulations, “fragrance free/unscented” {{means that}} no fragrance {{has been added}} to the cosmetic product, or that a masking agent has been added in order to suppress the <b>scents</b> from the other ingredients in the cosmetic. <b>Scented</b> Personal Products: Refers to any <b>scented</b> personal care product including, but not limited to, perfume, cologne, essential oils, <b>scented</b> aftershave lotions, <b>scented</b> deodorant, <b>scented</b> moisturizing hand, body or face washes, lotions or sprays, massage oils, <b>scented</b> sunscreen, and any <b>scented</b> hair shampoo / conditioner/ mousse / gel/hairspray, <b>scented</b> powder or talc, solid or spray air fresheners, incense and potpourri. Policy Statement: Mount Sinai Hospital will strive to ensure that the use of chemical products with <b>scents</b> and fragrances, are minimized or, where necessary, based on health risk, eliminated. The issues around the health effects of exposure to <b>scented</b> products are complex. In consideration of the allergies and sensitivities from which many people suffer, and in recognition {{of the fact that there}} is evidence to support the theory that <b>scented</b> products may trigger symptoms of the above noted health conditions, the wearing of <b>scented</b> personal products within hospital buildings is to be limited, so that the use does not cause any sort of negative health reaction or discomfort...|$|R
50|$|Backhousia citriodora (common names lemon myrtle, lemon <b>scented</b> myrtle, lemon <b>scented</b> ironwood) is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Myrtaceae, genus Backhousia. It is endemic to subtropical rainforests of central and south-eastern Queensland, Australia, with a natural distribution from Mackay to Brisbane. Other common names are sweet verbena tree, sweet verbena myrtle, lemon <b>scented</b> verbena, and lemon <b>scented</b> backhousia.|$|R
50|$|Most gourmand <b>scents,</b> such {{as those}} in the form of bath products, perfume or cologne, are not {{intended}} for human consumption. Other gourmand <b>scents</b> are not only <b>scented</b> but flavoured, such as Amoretti's line of products or Jessica Simpson's discontinued Dessert Treats. These <b>scented</b> products include other forms such as lip glosses, dusting powders and lotions.|$|R
5|$|Females {{predominantly}} <b>scent</b> mark {{with their}} anogenital <b>scent</b> glands, by squatting to rub their anogenital region along horizontal surfaces, such as tree limbs. Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces and rubbing themselves over them. Both sexes will occasionally <b>scent</b> mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.|$|E
5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it leaves a <b>scent</b> mark on it. This <b>scent</b> mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the <b>scent</b> degrades. This <b>scent</b> mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E
5|$|Locating prey: The wolves {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of <b>scent,</b> chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by <b>scent,</b> though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's <b>scent</b> is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E

5|$|Sharks {{have the}} ability to {{determine}} the direction of a given <b>scent</b> based on the timing of <b>scent</b> detection in each nostril. This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound.|$|E
5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their <b>scent.</b> This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their <b>scent</b> in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread <b>scent</b> and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the <b>scent</b> of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the <b>scent</b> was found.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scent</b> plays a {{significant}} role in olfactory communication. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own <b>scent</b> before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behaviour but less prominently than the males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.|$|E
40|$|The <b>scented</b> gland, a musk-secreting {{organ of}} male muskrats, shows clear {{seasonal}} changes. When entering the secreting season in March, <b>scented</b> glands gradually increase {{in size and}} active secretion starts. In September, <b>scented</b> glands become gradually smaller and secretion decreases. By November, <b>scented</b> glands are gradually replaced by adipose tissue. In this study, six healthy adult male muskrats were analysed: three from the secreting season (March) and three from the non-secreting season (November). Using RNA-Seq analysis, gene expression profiles of <b>scented</b> glands from both seasons were determined. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, we found that genes involved in calcium and TGF-beta signalling pathways were significantly more expressed in the non-secreting than in the secreting season. These changes in gene expression correlated with alterations in <b>scented</b> gland size. Both calcium and TGF-beta signalling pathways are important regulators of cell apoptosis, which may thus be involved in muskrat <b>scented</b> gland degeneration...|$|R
50|$|In Medieval times a <b>scented</b> {{water was}} used for hygiene by a person washing their hands with it before meals, since many meals were forkless. The wealthy of Medieval times had their linen clothes boiled in <b>scented</b> water. Varahamihira (6th century) was using <b>scented</b> water to clean his toothbrushes. Just prior to Marie Antoinette's {{execution}} in 1793 one of her servants was able to smuggle her some minimal need requests, one being some <b>scented</b> water for her teeth.|$|R

5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its <b>scent,</b> derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the <b>scent</b> (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by <b>scent</b> alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use <b>scent</b> to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{patch of}} {{hair on the}} central pad of their hind paws marks plantar glands that give off a distinctive odor.

40|$|Tea volatiles’ {{generation}} and retention over manufacturing processes are crucial for tea quality. In this study, floral volatile adsorption and retention in green tea <b>scented</b> with Jasminum sambac flowers were examined over the <b>scenting</b> process. Out of 34 enhanced volatiles in the <b>scented</b> tea, β-ionone, β-linalool, indole, and methyl anthranilate {{were the most}} potent odorants with 5. 1 – 45. 2 -fold higher odor activity values than the corresponding controls in the nonscented tea. <b>Scenting</b> efficiencies for the floral volatiles retained in the <b>scented</b> tea (the percentage of volatile abundance over its corresponding amount in jasmine flowers) ranged from 0. 22 % for α-farnesene to 75. 5 % for β-myrcene. Moreover, due to additional rounds of heat treatment for <b>scented</b> green tea manufacturing, some volatiles such as carotenoid-derived geraniol and β-ionone and lipid-derived (Z) -jasmone were heat-enhanced and others such as nonanal were heat-desorbed in the <b>scented</b> green tea. Our study revealed that dynamic volatile absorption and desorption collectively determined tea volatile retention and tea aroma. Our findings may have a great potential for practical improvement of tea aroma...|$|R
5|$|As {{with all}} strepsirrhine primates, {{olfactory}} communication is used extensively by ruffed lemurs – <b>scent</b> marking in territorial defense and disputes, {{as well as}} female greeting displays. The scents communicate the sex, location, and identity of their owner.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the <b>scent</b> and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the <b>scent</b> was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{are also}} mimicked by {{plants such as}} the bee orchid which imitates both the {{appearance}} and the <b>scent</b> of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.|$|E
