30|$|The ICH {{guidelines}} {{assume that}} shipping is validated and controlled, as the quality, efficacy, {{and safety of}} drugs are, in part, dependent on the transportation conditions (PDA technical report. 53, 2012). Regulatory agencies do allow excursions during shipping albeit based upon well-controlled shipping conditions, which in low-cost transport settings are not effectively controlled, particularly in remote areas of the world. During transport, products could be exposed to i) temperature extremes, ii) humidity extremes, iii) high light exposure, iv) accidents on route that lead to changes of shipping route, v) air pressure changes particularly in ships and aircraft, vi) severe agitations/drops/shocks, vii) unclear <b>shipping</b> <b>details</b> etc. In addition to the ICH recommendations, further risk analysis studies on drug stability are needed that can evaluate the impact of severe excursions, as mentioned above, on drug products {{that may have been}} exposed to unusual transport conditions or events, particularly for vaccine products. These studies can analyze the stability risks for three major excursion categories, 1) factors that can be controlled but usually are not addressed, for instance high light intensity in certain parts of the world, 2) factors, such as poor transport or handling, that can be controlled, and 3) unexpected excursions, e.g. transport/shipping system breakdown. These kinds of studies will help evaluate and determine safety margins for the drug products, while making sure the drugs are efficiently supplied without increased risk, due to transport conditions, to the patients. An excellent discussion of stability studies for handling and transport conditions of pharmaceutical and biologics as well ICH recommendations are reviewed by Ammann 2011.|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{low back}} pain (CLBP) {{is one of the}} most common medical conditions, ranking as the {{greatest}} contributor to global disability and accounting for huge societal costs based on the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study. Large genetic and -omics studies provide a promising avenue for the screening, development and validation of biomarkers useful for personalized diagnosis and treatment (precision medicine). Multicentre studies are needed for such an effort, and a standardized and homogeneous approach is vital for recruitment of large numbers of participants among different centres (clinical and laboratories) to obtain robust and reproducible results. To date, no validated standard operating procedures (SOPs) for genetic/-omics studies in chronic pain have been developed. In this study, we validated an SOP model that will be used in the multicentre (5 centres) retrospective "PainOmics" study, funded by the European Community in the 7 th Framework Programme, which aims to develop new biomarkers for CLBP through three different -omics approaches: genomics, glycomics and activomics. The SOPs describe the specific procedures for (1) blood collection, (2) sample processing and storage, (3) <b>shipping</b> <b>details</b> and (4) cross-check testing and validation before assays that all the centres involved in the study have to follow. Multivariate analysis revealed the absolute specificity and homogeneity of the samples collected by the five centres for all genetics, glycomics and activomics analyses. The SOPs used in our multicenter study have been validated. Hence, they could represent an innovative tool for the correct management and collection of reliable samples in other large-omics-based multicenter studies...|$|E

40|$|Significant wave heights are modeled {{by means}} of a spatial-temporal random Gaussian field. Its {{dependent}} structure can be localized by introduction of time and space dependent parameters in the spectrum. The model has the advantage of having {{a relatively small number of}} parameters. These parameters have natural physical interpretation and are statistically fitted to represent variability of observed significant wave height records. The fitted spatial-temporal significant wave field allows for prediction of fatigue accumulation in <b>ship</b> <b>details</b> and of extreme responses encountered. The method is exemplified by analyzing a container ship data relevant for North Atlantic trade and the results show a high agreement with actual on-board measurements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
