25|$|All three goddesses were ideally {{beautiful}} and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris {{with power over}} all Asia and Europe, and Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite promised Paris that, {{if he were to}} choose her as the fairest, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> him marry the most beautiful woman on earth. This woman was Helen, who was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple. The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the Trojan War.|$|E
2500|$|Meyer {{decided to}} include the {{pregnancy}} in her story while she was researching vampires, early in 2003, and came across {{the legend of the}} incubus, a demon who could father children. Bella's insistence to not let her child die was inspired by Meyer's reaction when asked if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> one of her children die so she could live, which was to deliver the child no matter what the consequences were. Meyer {{said in an interview with}} Shannon Hale, published in , that the birth scene published is a little less grotesque than the one she wrote before editing due to her editor, agent and publisher's requests to [...] "tone down the violence a little". She stated that Bella's pregnancy and childbirth, for her, were [...] "a way to kind of explore that concept of what childbirth used to be" [...] in the past and acknowledged that they were [...] "taking Bella in a new direction that wasn't [...] relatable for a lot of people." [...] Concerning the subject of the relatability of Bella, Meyer admitted that she lost some of her relatability to the character when she became a vampire and said, [...] "every point up until that point in the story [...] I would say I could step into this story right here and I could do everything she could do which made it really fun." [...] Meyer wanted to experience Bella's vampiric experiences and [...] "enjoyed very much" [...] writing about them and wanted to end the book from her perspective, but still thought it was [...] "a little bit harder" [...] as she couldn't step in into the story anymore.|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
