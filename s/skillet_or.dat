50|$|The cheese {{dream is}} an open faced version of the American grilled cheese {{sandwich}} made with bread, cheese, and butter, {{as well as other}} ingredients. It can be cooked in a pan <b>or</b> <b>skillet</b> on the stove top, under a broiler, or using a pan in the oven. In its simplest form, it consists of a slice of bread, topped with American cheese and broiled until the cheese puffs up and browns. Variants include the addition of ingredients such as bacon, tomato, pineapple, and eggs.|$|R
50|$|It is {{typically}} done using a <b>skillet</b> <b>or</b> frying pan, which generally should be preheated to a medium high temperature to avoid sticking. In order to brown properly, the meat should first have surface moisture removed. This is usually achieved by patting the meat {{with a paper}} towel. The function {{of this is to}} remove water which creates steam instead of evenly browning the meat.|$|E
50|$|Bing {{are usually}} a casual food and {{generally}} eaten for lunch, {{but they can}} also be incorporated into formal meals. Both Peking duck and moo shu pork are rolled up in thin wheat flour bao bing with scallions and sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce. Bing may also have a filling such as ground meat. Bing are commonly cooked on a <b>skillet</b> <b>or</b> griddle although some are baked.|$|E
5000|$|In the Appalachian Mountains, cornbread {{baked in}} a round iron <b>skillet,</b> <b>or</b> in a cake pan of any shape, is still {{referred}} to as a [...] "pone" [...] of cornbread (as opposed to [...] "hoe cakes," [...] the term for cornbread fried in pancake style); and when biscuit dough (i.e., [...] "biscuits" [...] in the American sense of the word) is occasionally baked in one large cake rather than as separate biscuits, this is called a [...] "biscuit pone." ...|$|E
50|$|A frying pan, frypan, <b>or</b> <b>skillet</b> is a {{flat-bottomed}} pan {{used for}} frying, searing, and browning foods. It is typically 200 to 300 mm in diameter with relatively low sides that flare outwards, a long handle, and no lid. Larger pans {{may have a}} small grab handle opposite the main handle. A pan of similar dimensions, but with less flared vertical sides and often with a lid, is called a sauté pan. While a sauté pan can be used like a frying pan, it is designed for lower heat cooking methods, namely sautéing.|$|R
50|$|Only {{eggs are}} {{necessary}} to make scrambled eggs, but nearly always salt is used, and very often other ingredients such as water, milk, butter, cream {{or in some cases}} crème fraîche or grated cheese may be added. The eggs are cracked into a bowl; with some salt, and the mixture is stirred or whisked: alternatively, the eggs are cracked directly into a hot pan <b>or</b> <b>skillet,</b> and the whites and yolks stirred together as they cook. More consistent and far quicker results are obtained if a small amount of thickener such as cornstarch, potato starch or flour is added; this enables much quicker cooking with reduced risk of overcooking, even when less butter is used.|$|R
50|$|Skillet-fried or skillet-baked cornbread (often {{simplified}} to cornbread <b>or</b> <b>skillet</b> bread) is {{a traditional}} staple in the rural United States, especially in the South. This involves heating bacon drippings, lard or other oil in a heavy, well-seasoned cast iron skillet in an oven, and then pouring a batter made from cornmeal, egg, and milk directly into the hot grease. The mixture is returned to the oven to bake into a large, crumbly and sometimes very moist cake with a crunchy crust. This bread tends to be dense and is usually served as an accompaniment {{rather than as a}} bread served as a regular course. In addition to the skillet method, such cornbread also may be made in sticks, muffins, or loaves.|$|R
50|$|Several {{properties}} distinguish wats from stews {{of other}} cultures. Perhaps {{the most obvious}} is an unusual cooking technique: the preparation of a wat begins with chopped onions slow cooked, without any fat or oil, in a dry <b>skillet</b> <b>or</b> pot until much of their moisture has been driven away. Fat (usually niter kibbeh) is then added, often in quantities that might seem excessive by modern Western standards, and the onions and other aromatics are sautéed before the addition of other ingredients. This method causes the onions to break down and thicken the stew.|$|E
50|$|Chicken fried steak is {{prepared}} {{by taking a}} thin cut of beefsteak and tenderizing it by pounding, cubing, or forking. It is then either immersed in egg batter and/or dredged in flour to which salt, pepper, and often other seasonings have been added (called breading). After this, the steak is fried in a <b>skillet</b> <b>or,</b> less commonly, deep-fried. Restaurants often call the deep fried version chicken fried and the pan fried type country fried. The frying medium has traditionally been butter, lard, or other shortening, but in recent years, health concerns have led most cooks to substitute the shortening with vegetable oil.|$|E

50|$|The {{cheese is}} made by heating whole milk, adding quark, and then cooking the mixture until fluffy curds {{separate}} from a clear whey. The whey is discarded when the cheese mass reaches a temperature of 72 - 77 C. At this point, the curds are placed into a <b>skillet</b> <b>or</b> cooking pan, and stirred with a traditional mixture of egg, butter, salt, and caraway seeds. Once a solid, firm ball is formed, the cheese is placed in a muslin or cheese cloth to drain. Generally, the cheese is prepared {{a few days before}} eaten, and is allowed to ripen in a cool place before consumption.|$|E
5000|$|Each minigame {{represents}} a different {{activity in the}} meal preparation, such as mixing, frying, or chopping the provided ingredients. The minigame mechanics themselves range from quickly drawing parallel lines in order to chop items, to a rhythm game where ingredients are added to a <b>skillet</b> <b>or</b> the heat is adjusted at precisely the right time. In many cases, players must {{look at the top}} screen of the DS for guidance on what to do next and then perform the task on the bottom screen. If the player makes a serious blunder or time expires without sufficient progress being made, that step in the cooking process is considered a failure. When this happens, a graphic of an angry [...] "Mama" [...] with flames erupting from her eyes is displayed, along with the caption [...] "Don't worry, Mama will fix it!".|$|E
5000|$|Most bare {{cast-iron}} {{pots and}} pans are cast as {{a single piece of}} metal, including the handle. This allows them to be used on both the stovetop and in the oven. Many recipes call for the use of a cast-iron <b>skillet</b> <b>or</b> pot, especially so that the dish can be initially seared or fried on the stovetop then transferred into the oven, pan and all, to finish baking. Likewise, cast-iron skillets can double as baking dishes. Cornbread in particular is seen as a food item that is best prepared in a cast-iron skillet: the iron pan is heated beforehand in the oven, the ingredients are first combined and mixed in a mixing bowl, then added to the heated pan, and the dish is then placed directly into the oven for fast baking. This differs from many other cooking pots, which have varying components that may be damaged by the excessive temperatures of [...] or more.|$|E
5000|$|Skillet Glacier is in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, United States. The glacier is {{situated}} on the eastern cliffs of Mount Moran and is easily seen from Jackson Hole. The shape of the glacier led to the naming as the uppermost section of the glacier is long and narrow and then broadens abruptly more than halfway down the mountain into a larger area, giving it {{the shape of a}} <b>skillet</b> <b>or</b> frying pan. The glacier is one of twelve that remain in Grand Teton National Park and one of five glaciers located on Mount Moran. Mountain climbers consider the Skillet Glacier route to be the fastest and one of the easiest ways to climb Mount Moran, and was the route taken when the peak was first climbed in 1922, though it is rarely used in late summer due to poor footing. On November 21, 1950, A DC-3 crashed into Mount Moran, adjacent to Skillet Glacier, killing all 21 passengers aboard. The remains of the passengers and the plane are still on the mountain.|$|E
5000|$|If {{it is not}} pre-seasoned, a new {{cast iron}} <b>skillet</b> <b>or</b> dutch oven {{typically}} comes from the manufacturer with a protective coating of wax or shellac, otherwise it would rust. This needs to be removed before the item is used. An initial scouring with hot soapy water will usually remove the protective coating. Alternatively, for woks, {{it is common to}} burn off the coating over high heat (outside or under a vent hood) to expose the bare metal surface. For already-used pans that are to be re-seasoned, the cleaning process can be more complex, involving rust removal and deep cleaning (with strong soap or lye, or by burning in a campfire or self-cleaning oven to remove existing seasoning and build-up.Once the pan has been heated, dried, and thinly layered with oil or fat, it is placed in an oven, grill, or other heating enclosure for the oil to be polymerized onto the metal's surface. The process of polymerization is dependent on the oil, temperature of the enclosure, and the duration. The precise details of the seasoning process differ from one source to another, and there is much disagreement regarding the correct oil to use. There is also no clear consensus about the best temperature and duration. Lodge Manufacturing uses a proprietary soybean blend in their base coats as stated on their website. Others use lard, or animal fats. Some advocate the use of food-grade flaxseed oil (a drying oil). The temperature recommended for seasoning varies from high temperatures above [...] to temperatures below [...] Some say that a temperature around the smoke point of the oil or fat should be targeted since this will allow vaporization of the lighter hydrocarbons from the oil, leaving behind heavier molecules for optimal polymerization and carbonization to occur. And, there is also no consensus on the correct duration of heating: from half an hour to an hour is often recommended.|$|E
