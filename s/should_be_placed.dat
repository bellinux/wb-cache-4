5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> over the heart.|$|E

5|$|Recent extractions of DNA {{from the}} dodo and Rodrigues solitaire, {{as well as}} 37 species of doves, has found where in Columbidae the raphines <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed.</b> Surprisingly, raphines are not the most {{primitive}} columbid, instead they are grouped with the Nicobar pigeon as their closest relative, with other closely related birds being the crowned pigeons and tooth-billed pigeon.

5|$|A similar {{cladogram}} {{was published}} in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Dicunculus and including the pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) {{at the base of}} the clade. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, another rodent {{from the}} same group was described: Noronhomys, a {{recently}} extinct species from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha. Michael Carleton and Storrs Olson, who described the animal, argued that Holochilus primigenus was probably outside the clade of Noronhomys and extant Holochilus and that H.primigenus should probably be excluded from the genus. When Ulyses Pardiñas described another extinct rodent from this group, Carletonomys from the Pleistocene of Argentina, he suggested that H. primigenus <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in its own genus because of its mosaic of Holochilus- and Lundomys-like features.|$|E

5|$|The {{classification}} of the Amylostereaceae {{is not completely}} resolved. The next closest relatives might be – depending on the research – either Echinodontium tinctorium and most other species of the genus Echinodontium, or Artomyces pyxidatus. Most of the previous DNA analysis results suggest a narrow relation to Echinodontium, but several results of studies partially contradict this conclusion. Only the classification to the Russulales is regarded as correct. Some authors have suggested that Amylostereum <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in the family Echinodontiaceae.|$|E
5|$|Whether the bigeye and {{smalltooth}} sand tigers {{belong in}} the same family as the superficially similar sand tiger shark (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with morphological and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis was found to be closer to the crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in separate families.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{cladogram}} {{was published}} in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Dicunculus and including the pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) {{at the base of}} the clade. The DNA used in these studies was obtained from the Oxford specimen, and since this material is degraded, and no usable DNA has been extracted from subfossil remains, these findings still need to be independently verified. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence.

5|$|In 1811, Louis Bosc did {{not mention}} the earlier works when {{describing}} it as Lycoperdon heterogeneum, although he also suggested it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in its own genus. Jean Poiret transferred Persoon's S.callostoma to Lycoperdon in 1817, while including Bosc's L.heterogeneum separately. In the same year, Nees von Esenbeck noted Bosc's belief that the species deserved its own genus and created Mitremyces, without referencing Desvaux's prior assignment to Calostoma. An 1825 paper by Edward Hitchcock referred to the species with the entirely novel binomial name Gyropodium coccineum; although Hitchcock claimed this name was established by Lewis Schweinitz, he admitted that no such description had been previously published, and the name and its claimed origin are considered doubtful.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, John Foster {{suggested}} that the differences usually cited to differentiate Amphicoelias altus from the more well known Diplodocus are not significant and {{may be due to}} individual variation. Foster argued that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus, and that if further research bears this out, the familiar name Diplodocus would need to be abandoned in favor of Amphicoelias, {{as was the case with}} Brontosaurus and its senior synonym Apatosaurus. In 2015, Woodruff and Foster reiterated this conclusion, stating that there is only one species of Amphicoelias and that it could be referred to Diplodocus as Diplodocus altus. They considered the name Amphicoelias to be a nomen oblitum. It has also been hypothesized that Amphicoelias should be considered an apatosaurine, and therefore <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in the subfamily Apatosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} act of public service, in 1839 Rowan was {{appointed}} as a commissioner to adjust land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico. During an adjournment {{of the commission}} in 1842, Rowan returned to Kentucky to visit relatives. While there, he fell ill {{and was unable to}} return to Washington, D.C.; consequently, he resigned his commission. Rowan died July 13, 1843. He was interred in the family burial ground at Federal Hill. In his will, Rowan specified that no marker <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> over his grave, noting that his parents' graves had no markers, and {{he did not want to}} be honored above his parents. Several years later, members of his family placed a marker over his grave, despite his wishes. According to legend, the marker frequently tumbles from its base, purportedly a manifestation of Rowan haunting his grave.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the specimen was either a runt of either the yellow-breasted fruit dove or a Treron pigeon, or a hybrid instead of a unique species; however, these views are generally considered invalid {{due in part to the}} distinctiveness of the specimen, particularly in the bare skin around the eye, and no proper evidence has suggested that the Negros fruit dove is an invalid species. It is uncertain where the dove <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> within the genus Ptilinopus as the male's plumage, a key feature used in organizing the Ptilinopus doves, is unknown. It has been suggested that the Negros fruit dove is either most closely related to the black-naped fruit dove or represents an early colonization of the Philippines by the genus that has left no surviving close relatives. It has no known subspecies and is also known as Ripley's fruit dove.|$|E
5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> on the wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected {{the view that the}} executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|When {{displayed}} alongside other flags, {{the national}} flag takes {{the position of}} honour; it is raised first and lowered last.

As a sign of mourning, flags flown externally shall be lowered to half-mast; two black ribbons may be attached to those otherwise displayed.
