An association between oxidative stress {{and the global}} methylation status of the sperm genome has also been suggested. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether the global sperm DNA methylation status was affected in the spermatozoa of carriers of chromosome <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations.</b> The relationships between the 5 -methylcytosine (m 5 C) levels in spermatozoa and chromatin integrity status were evaluated. The study patients comprised male carriers of chromosome <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations</b> with reproductive failure (n = 24), and the controls comprised normozoospermic sperm volunteers (n = 23). The global m 5 C level was measured using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and immunofluorescence (IF) techniques.

However, sperm chromatin integrity tests revealed significantly higher values in chromosomal rearrangement carriers than in controls (P < 0. 05). Although the potential relationship between sperm chromatin integrity status and sperm DNA fragmentation and the m 5 C level juxtaposed in both analyzed groups (P vs K) was represented in a clearly opposite manner, the low chromatin integrity might be associated with the high hypomethylation status of the sperm DNA observed in carriers of chromosome <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Genetic {{variation}} in MTHFR gene might explain the interindividual {{differences in the}} reduction of DNA repaired and the increase of chromosome breakage and damage. Nowadays, chromosomal rearrangement is recognized as {{a major cause of}} lymphoid malignancies. In addition, the association of MTHFR polymorphisms with aneuploidy was found in several studies, making the MTHFR gene as a good candidate for leukemia etiology. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the common sequence variation, 677 C>T and 1298 A>C in the MTHFR gene of 350 fixed cell specimens archived after chromosome analysis. The distribution of the MTHFR polymorphisms frequency was compared in leukemic patients with structural chromosome abnormality and chromosome aneuploidy, as well as in those with no evidence of chromosome abnormalities. We observed a significant decrease in the distribution of T allele in 677 C>T polymorphisms among patients with chromosomal abnormalities including both <b>structural</b> <b>aberration</b> and aneuploidy. The same significance result also found in patients with <b>structural</b> <b>aberration</b> when compare with the normal karyotype patients.

Purpose: To quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the changes in chromosomal aberrations during early cleavage in mouse embryos derived from γ-irradiated spermatozoa. Materials and methods: Mature males were exposed to 2 [*]Gy or 4 [*]Gy of ^ Cs γ-rays, and their spermatozoa were used to produce embryos via in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The metaphase chromosomes were prepared from one-cell, two-cell, and four-cell embryos. In the chromosome preparations from two-cell and four-cell embryos, the separation of the sister blastomeres was precluded by treatment of the embryos with concanavalin A. The incidence of embryos with <b>structural</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations,</b> aneuploidy, or mosaicism was estimated. The fates of the different types of γ-ray-induced <b>structural</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> were also investigated in those embryos. Results: The exposure of spermatozoa to 2 [*]Gy or 4 [*]Gy γ-rays caused <b>structural</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> in 25. 9 % and 35. 7 % of the resultant one-cell embryos, respectively. At two-cell embryonic stage, the incidence of <b>structural</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> was 17. 4 % in the 2 [*]Gy group and 27. 1 % in the 4 [*]Gy group. At the four-cell embryonic stage, although the incidence of control embryos with <b>structural</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> was considerably high, the net incidence of embryos with radiation-induced <b>structural</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> was similar to that at the one-cell stage. The incidence of aneuploidy was high in two-cell and four-cell embryos after both doses of γ-rays. The incidence of mosaicism increased significantly in dose- and embryonic-stage-dependent manners. Anaphase lag, and the degeneration and non-disjunction of the aberrant chromosomes were frequently observed in aneuploid and mosaic embryos. Conclusions: Mouse sperm DNA is highly vulnerable to γ-rays. The <b>structural</b> chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> of sperm origin are unstable in their behaviour and structure during cleavage, and therefore cause secondary aneuploidy and mosaicism in the early cleavage embryos...|$|R
40|$|Aberrations of TP 53 (mutations and/or deletions) are {{associated}} with a dismal prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Complete loss of ATM is another mechanism of failed DNA damage response and also associated with poorer prognosis in CLL. However, p 53 dysfunction may arise through alternative mechanisms unrelated to <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations</b> (deletion and/or mutation) of TP 53 or ATM, and thus be undetectable by traditional DNA-directed approaches (fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH], sequencing, karyotyping). In order to address the latter changes, and also to better understand the consequences of TP 53 /ATM aberrations, p 53 functional assays have recently been developed. The purpose of dynamic assessment of p 53 response in CLL is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of all mechanisms causing p 53 -deficient phenotype, including those unrelated to genomic aberrations of TP 53 and ATM. The present review focuses on the current knowledge of p 53 function assays in CLL, including important features such as technical issues, correlation with <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations</b> and clinical value. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Infertile males {{sometimes}} bear structurally balanced chromosome aberrations, such as translocations and inversions, {{which involve}} both autosomes and sex chromosomes. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations in a sample of infertile men with various types of Y chromosome abnormalities. In particular, we examined the effect of (i) balanced <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations</b> such as translocations between sex chromosomes and autosomes; (ii) unbalanced <b>structural</b> <b>aberrations</b> such as deletions or isodicentrics, both [idic(Yp) ] and [idic(Yq) ]. We studied 13 subjects bearing Y chromosome aberrations. Each patient underwent seminal fluid examination, andrological inspection, hormone study, testicular ultrasound, conventional and molecular cytogenetic analysis and study of Y chromosome microdeletions. Comparison of genotype and sperm phenotype in infertile patients with various Y chromosome aberrations revealed the key role of meiotic pairing defects in arresting spermatogenesis, both in the presence and in the absence of azoospermic factor microdeletions and cell mosaicism. The failure of meiosis and, in consequence, spermatogenesis may be a result of the failure to inactivate the X chromosome in the meiotic prophase, which is necessary for normal male spermatogenesis to take place...|$|R
