30|$|The deeper {{the calcium}} oxalate was {{detected}} the darker the marble, with no or <b>slight</b> <b>discolouration</b> {{occurring in the}} areas where calcium oxalate was absent. The differential absorption of the oil of the bronze-like patina by the weathered marble surfaces, which also might have been aggressively cleaned prior to patination, could explain the localized deeper presence of oxalates in the marble. Nitrogen-containing components were detected {{in the majority of}} the samples, as well as lipids derived from fat, perhaps from an old milk-based treatment. Further analysis, also using immunological methods, may help establish the source of proteins, if present or survived.|$|E

40|$|Powdery mildew on Ocimum canum L. {{caused by}} Oidium was {{observed}} during December- Janu-ary in Gujarat. Locally known 'Shyam tulsi' (Ocimum canum L.) is popular in India from re-ligious {{point of view}} as well as medicinal proper-ties. In the initial stage, the fungus developed scattered ashy growths on the upper surface of the leaves. <b>Slight</b> <b>discolouration</b> and alteration in pig-mentation appeared later on the infected leaves. Under cool and humid conditions, this disease assumed severity and symptoms were also exhib-ited on the lower surface of the leaves and on newly emerged tender branches. Drying of the leaves and defoliation occurred. During winter season 1989 - 90 the incidence and intensity of the powdery mildew on leaves and tender branches were very high. Three celled hyaline conidiophores with com-paratively bigger cell (A. v. 80 urn) at the base were invariably observed. The other two cells {{were more or less}} of similar size (A. v. 13. 0 to 15. 5 um). Hyaline conidia were born in chain of 3 to 5 with distinct lobulation and measured 34. 7 x 21. 2 urn.
