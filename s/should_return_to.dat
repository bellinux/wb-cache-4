5|$|During {{her time}} in the Middle East, Manning had picked up amoebic dysentery, which led to several admissions to {{hospitals}} in Cairo and Palestine.

5|$|However, his {{attitude}} {{could not be}} maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness {{of the government to}} use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi <b>should</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, {{as a result of the}} Banca Romana scandal.|$|E

5|$|Then, in 1924, Buck fell pregnant. The couple {{agreed that}} she <b>should</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> England for better {{healthcare}} during the birth, {{and she went}} there {{to set up a}} home with her mother's help. In early November 1924 she gave birth prematurely to a son, Anthony, and a few days later died of poisoning from chloroform administered against the pain of delivery. The grief-stricken Keable's own health worsened and he was advised to return to Tahiti; the baby, too weak to travel, was left in England with Jack and Rita Elliott, friends of the couple's since the Ralston Street salon days. The Elliotts were eventually to adopt him.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the {{references}} to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he <b>should</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of £17,000 (updated value £) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a £7,000 loan guarantee (updated value £). With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907. One reason for Shackleton's sense of urgency was {{the knowledge that the}} Polish explorer Henryk Arctowski was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case {{is a waste of time}} and they <b>should</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Washington.|$|E

5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he <b>should</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E
5|$|Captain Rachel Garrett of the Enterprise-C and {{her crew}} learn they have {{traveled}} into the future. Garrett explains {{that they were}} responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on NarendraIII, and were attacked by Romulan starships. While his crew works to repair the Enterprise-C and tend to the crew's injuries, Picard and his command staff discuss {{whether or not the}} ship <b>should</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the past. Commander Riker argues that their deaths would be meaningless, but Data suggests that it would be considered an honorable act by the Klingons. Picard discusses the situation with Garrett, who tells him that her crew will serve the Federation in the present. Picard quietly reveals to her that the Federation {{is on the verge of}} defeat and the presence of one ship will make no difference, but if the Enterprise-C were to return to the past they might prevent the war from ever starting. Garrett agrees and announces to her crew that they will return through the anomaly; at that moment, the two ships are ambushed by a Klingon Bird of Prey. Garrett is killed, and her helmsman, Richard Castillo, takes command.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on convoy SLS 64, Admiral Hippers fuel stocks were running low. She {{therefore}} returned to Brest on 15 February. British bombers were regularly attacking the port, however, and the Kriegsmarine therefore decided Admiral Hipper <b>should</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Germany, where she could be better protected. Before the ship could leave, damage caused to the ship's hull by wrecks in the harbor had to be repaired. On 15 March, the ship slipped out of Brest, unobserved, and passed through the Denmark Strait eight days later. While en route, Admiral Hipper stopped to refuel in Bergen. By 28 March, the cruiser was docked in Kiel, having made the entire journey without being detected by the British. Upon arrival, the ship went into the Deutsche Werke shipyard for an extensive overhaul, which lasted for seven months. After completion of the refit, Admiral Hipper conducted sea trials in the Baltic before putting into Gotenhafen on 21 December for some minor refitting. In January 1942, the ship had her steam turbines overhauled at the Blohm & Voss shipyard; a degaussing coil was fitted to the ship's hull during this overhaul. By March, the ship was again fully operational.|$|E

5|$|James {{asserted}} {{his authority}} not only over the nobility but also upon the Church and lamented that King David I's benevolence towards the Church proved costly to his successors {{and that he}} was 'a sair sanct to the croun'. James also considered that the monastic institutions in particular needed improvement and that they <b>should</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> being strictly ordered communities. Part of James's solution was to create an assembly of overseeing abbots and followed this up by establishing a Carthusian priory at Perth to provide other religious houses with an example of internal conduct. He also sought to influence Church attitudes to his policies by having his own clerics appointed to the bishoprics of Dunblane, Dunkeld, Glasgow and Moray. In March 1425, James's parliament directed that all bishops must instruct their clerics to offer up prayers for the king and his family; a year later, parliament toughened up this edict insisting that the prayers be given at every mass under sanction of a fine and severe rebuke. This same parliament legislated that every person in Scotland should 'be governed under the king's laws and statutes of this realm only'. From this, laws were enacted in 1426 to restrict the actions of prelates whether it was to regulate their need to travel to the Roman Curia or their ability to purchase additional ecclesiastical positions while there. In James's parliament of July 1427, it is evident that statute being enacted had the purpose of reducing the powers of the church jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|On June 10, the Lithuanian {{government}} {{discussed the}} new developments. It decided that Merkys <b>should</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Kaunas and Urbšys should deliver a note offering {{withdrawal from the}} Baltic Entente, a full investigation of the incident, and dismissal of Skučas and Povilaitis. A personal letter from President Antanas Smetona to Chairman of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Mikhail Kalinin repeated assurances that Lithuania always honored the mutual assistance pact. The third and final meeting between Merkys, Urbšys, and Molotov on June 11 brought no resolution. The Soviets continued to press charges which the Lithuanians could not meaningfully answer and made no more actionable requests. On June 12, Merkys returned to Lithuania and informed {{the government of the}} situation. It was decided that Skučas should resign and Povilaitis would be immediately dismissed. The Lithuanian Army was ordered to be alert, but no orders were issued regarding mobilization or preparedness. Lithuanian politicians did not fully understand the gravity of the situation and did not think the results would be catastrophic. Urbšys reported that the Soviets strongly disapproved of Merkys and his cabinet; he suggested that a new government be installed, possibly led by Stasys Raštikis, former Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army. Such suggestion interfered with Lithuania's domestic affairs.|$|E
