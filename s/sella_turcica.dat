5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic nerve and {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{pituitary}} gland or hypophysis {{is often referred}} to as the [...] "master gland" [...] of the human body.

The {{pituitary gland}} is located below the brain in a depression (fossa) of the sphenoid bone known as the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica.</b> Although anatomically and functionally connected to the brain, the pituitary gland sits outside the blood-brain barrier. It is separated from the subarachnoid space by the diaphragma sella, therefore the arachnoid mater and thus cerebral spinal fluid cannot enter the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica.</b>|$|E
50|$|An MRI of {{the brain}} {{focusing}} on the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> after gadolinium administration allows for clear delineation of the pituitary and the hypothalamus {{and the location of}} the tumor. A number of other overgrowth syndromes can result in similar problems.|$|E
