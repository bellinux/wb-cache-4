50|$|The Congress was {{formally}} {{opened in the}} afternoon of 12 June with addresses of welcome from Anna Whitlock, acting president of the National Suffrage Association of Sweden, and the Hon. Ernest Beckman, M. P., president of the National Swedish Liberal Association, and response from the Alliance was made by Chrystal Macmillan of Great Britain, proxy for Millicent Garrett Fawcett, its first vice-president. Anna Kleman, president of the Stockholm suffrage society, then presented the beautiful white <b>satin,</b> <b>gold</b> embroidered Alliance banner, which was carried by six university students in white dresses with sashes of the Swedish colors. Catt announced that the Alliance flag was now flying over the Grand Hotel where they were assembled. The banner was the gift of Lotten von Kroemer, a pioneer suffragist of Sweden, and {{the flag of the}} resident Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Tea Co., US. A suffrage song written by K.G. Ossiannilsson and the music composed by Hugo Alfvén for the occasion was sung by the Women's Choir of Gothenburg, after which an official delegate of the Government extended its greeting while the audience rose and the flags of the nations waved from the galleries. Catt received an ovation as she came {{to the front of the}} platform to make her address. It filled twenty-three pages of the printed minutes and was a complete resume of the early position of women, the vast changes that had been wrought and the great work which the Alliance was doing.|$|E
40|$|A {{few years}} ago I was in Thailand to give a talk {{at a conference in}} Bangkok on the “post-Zionist {{performance}} of Israeliness ” among Israeli psytrancers in Thailand. I had the pleasure of meeting Robert A. Leonard, an American professor of forensic linguistics, {{who turned out to be}} an old friend of my doctoral advisor as well as a founding member and bassist of Sha Na Na, the rock and roll doo-wop group who (wearing <b>satin</b> <b>gold</b> sweat suits) opened for Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. When I asked Leonard “how does it feel when you’re making history?”, he responded that when people “make history”, they are usually too busy doing it to fully notice the magnitude of what they are achieving. Afterwards, what one recalls often overlaps and gets filtered through the authorized account of the event. This notion came to mind after reading Goa: 20 Years of Psychedelic Trance. This coffee table book, elegantly published and stylishly edited, ventures to capture and convey the romance and excitement that accompanied the expansions of Goa psytrance music and culture in the past few decades. Goa is an engaging book, lavished with original artwork and vivid photography depicting psychedelic trance events from across the globe and offering readers a portrayal of life in full HD. The forty-two chapters, over 500 color photos and a companion DVD featuring an “unreleased ” montage of Goa music and parties provide a well-informed account of the phenomenal Goa psychedelic trance social movement from its early days in Goa to its (r) evolutionary proliferation “right across the planet, going through every culture and social class as well as every spiritual, religious, political, sexual, musical, philosophical and economic orientation”(14). The period indicated in the sub-title (1990 – 2010) does not refer to specific dates or precise events, nor does it entirely account for ‘the story of psytrance’. Rather, during these two decades, the Goa movement underwent a process of formalizatio...|$|E
