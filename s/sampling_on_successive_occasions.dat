40|$|Estimators of the {{population}} mean have been presented for <b>sampling</b> <b>on</b> two <b>successive</b> <b>occasions</b> when there is non-response in the sample.

40|$|Some estimators of the {{population}} ratio have been proposed for <b>sampling</b> <b>on</b> two <b>successive</b> <b>occasion.</b> These estimators are constructed using ratio, product, difference-cum-ratio and difference-cum-product method of estimation. Their performances are compared empirically with the ordinary ratio estimator. It is found that, for certain values of the correlation coefficient, the proposed estimators perform better than the ordinary ratio estimator...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we first}} {{determined}} the {{low molecular weight}} dissolved organic carbon (LMW DOC) concentration-dependent kinetics of soil respiration in a temperate grassland soil <b>sampled</b> <b>on</b> <b>successive</b> <b>occasions.</b> We then used the established relationship to estimate in situ LMW DOC concentrations from basal respiration measurements. 14 C-labelled glucose {{was used as a}} model substrate and was added to soil over a wide range of concentrations (0. 05 â�� 4000 Î¼g C gâ�� 1 DW soil; equivalent to ca. 2. 5 Î¼Mâ�� 200 mM glucose-C). The time-dependent loss of 14 C-glucose to 14 CO 2 was similar to previous assessments. The Michaelisâ��Menten parameter Vmax varied between 17 (September 2010) and 42 (October 2010) Î¼g CO 2 â��C gâ�� 1 hâ�� 1 (corresponding to 1. 4 â�� 3. 5 Âµmol CO 2 gâ�� 1 hâ�� 1), while Km varied between 893 (September 2010) and 1990 (October 2010) Î¼g glucose-C gâ�� 1 (41 â�� 92 mM glucose), thus within the span previously reported for soils, albeit in the higher end of the range. However, the estimates were 6 orders-of-magnitude greater than those found in previous studies in natural waters. A possible methodological reason for this difference was an induced multiphasic concentration dependence, biasing Km and Vmax with high concentrations of LMW DOC. By combining the established concentration dependences with measurements of basal respiration, we estimated in situ concentrations of LMW DOC of 131 (October 2010), 112 (January 2011) and 270 (September 2010) Î¼g LMW DOC gâ�� 1, far exceeding the total DOC concentration in the soil (17 â�� 20 Î¼g DOC gâ�� 1 soil), thus invalidating our approach. We propose a way forward, and suggest that although current estimates of LMW DOC cycling need revision, there is evidence for a rapidly cycling pool of LMW DOC, possibly turning over > 30 times per day, that warrants further attention...|$|R
40|$|Three {{separate}} estimators, for {{the estimation}} of the population total, based <b>on</b> two-stage <b>sampling</b> design <b>on</b> two <b>successive</b> <b>occasions</b> with partial replacement of secondary stage units only have been presented. For these estimators {{it is assumed that}} there is unit non-response. Hence, Hansen and Hurwitz (1946) technique has been used to adjust for the non-response. Empirically, it has been found that the estimator that uses individual weights within first stage units perform better than the other estimators that use common weights in estimating the population total. Theoretically, it has also been shown that the larger the ratio of the within first stage unit variability of the non-respondents to the between first stage unit variability the higher the gain in efficiency of the proposed estimators over the estimator obtained when there is no partial matching of units...|$|R
40|$|A {{multi-stage}} sampling design, particularly {{intended for}} large scale <b>sample</b> surveys <b>on</b> <b>successive</b> (or repeated) <b>occasions</b> is developed. The sampling design is {{general in the}} sense that the probabilities of selecting units (for the preliminary first-stage sa~le) are arbitrary. Each of these first-stage units is drawn with replacement. The technique of partial replacement of first-stage sa~ling units is based on the order of occurrence of these units. The partial replacement technique is developed to meet two basic objectives: (i) To spread the burden of reporting among respondents which may be expected to help in maintaining a high rate of response. (ii) To enable the sampler to take advantage of the saItij?ling design in the reduction of sampling variance of several estimators proposed. Several ways of utilizing the past as well as the present information from the sampling design to estimate the total, and the change in total of a population characteristic of interest, are presented. The nature of the gain in efficiency from using the four different forms of estimators in estimati~g the total, and the change in total, is explored. The comparisons of efficiency among the estimators wherever possible, are given under certain assumptions simiiar to the assumption of Second Order or Weak Sense Stationarity · used in conventional time series analysis. • The estimation theory is covered in detail for two-stage <b>sampling</b> <b>on</b> two <b>successive</b> <b>occasions.</b> The extension to higher stage <b>sampling</b> <b>on</b> more than two <b>successive</b> <b>occasions</b> is sufficiently indicated, In all, the reduction in the variance of an estimator whenever achieved, is in the total variance namely, the between first-stage units variance plus the within first-stage units variance, and so on if there are more than two stages of sampling...|$|R

40|$|The pioneer {{community}} of the exposed reservoir margins contained plants of several ecological provenances growing largely at random over the sub-strand-line mud.

Maximum diversity was consistently encountered in the mid-section of each transect which, it is suggested, reflects both optimum growing period and conditions for the maximum number of individuals and species of both bryophytes and higher plants to develop.
