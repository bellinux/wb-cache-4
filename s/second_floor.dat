5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Hampshire Review {{newspaper}} {{occupied the}} building's <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> with its offices and printing plant from 1884 to 1895. John J. Cornwell, {{who later became}} West Virginia's governor, and his brother William B. Cornwell purchased the newspaper in 1890. The newspaper continued to operate from the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the Wirgman Building until 1895, when the Cornwell brothers relocated the Hampshire Review office and printing plant {{to the first floor}} of their new brick building on West Main Street. In the newspaper's printing plant on the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the Wirgman Building, the Hampshire Review was printed by a hand-operated Benjamin Franklin printing press.|$|E

5000|$|A new, grand {{staircase}} {{that links}} the museum's first and <b>second</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred on the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a lathe and {{what appeared to be}} blood on the ground of the <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> is {{a bronze}} bust, by Albin Polasek, of {{sculptor}} and muralist Frank Millet, {{who had also}} died on the Titanic.|$|E

5|$|Oregon Agricultural College {{opened a}} new library in 1918, marking {{the first time that}} the library had its own building. Prior to 1918 the library had been housed on the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the college's {{administration}} building, Benton Hall. When the new building was completed, the school built a temporary trellis from neighboring Benton Hall's <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> to the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the new building in order to more easily transfer the books to their new location. Initially, the new building also housed offices and classrooms, but within a decade the library expanded to occupy all of the structure. John V. Bennes designed the new building, as well as many of the campus buildings constructed during that period. By 1922 the collection had grown to 73,000 volumes, and Lucy M. Lewis served as the school's librarian.|$|E
5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance opened onto a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the entrance hall up to the <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on the <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b> The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much the same as it always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E

50|$|In 1913, Whidden & Lewis {{oversaw the}} {{addition}} of six stories for the Gevurtz Furniture Company. In 1951, JJ Newberry remodeled the first and <b>second</b> <b>floors</b> (Glenn Stanton Architect) of the Failing Building and constructed a new six-story building, which replaced the Richmond Building, located just to the east. A ceramic veneer was added which covered the original large window openings on the first and <b>second</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R

5|$|The entry hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. The <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> central hall and Washington Room (on the <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation.|$|E
50|$|The {{total area}} of the ground, first and <b>second</b> <b>floors</b> of the {{building}} is 63,000 square metres.|$|R

5|$|In the Middle Byzantine period, {{more complex}} plans emerge, {{such as the}} {{integrated}} chapels of Theotokos of Lips, a monastic church in Constantinople that was built around 907. It included four small chapels on its <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> gallery level {{that may have been}} domed.|$|E
5|$|Lépine {{sat for a}} time in {{the office}} of the {{registrar}} on the <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b> He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{changes to}} the planetarium were made during this time, {{including}} {{the addition of a}} new spiral staircase that led straight to the Theatre of the Stars, an adjacent elevator for the elderly and disabled, and a larger gallery space on the <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
