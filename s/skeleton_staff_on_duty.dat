25|$|While the {{earthquake}} {{quickly became the}} only subject on talkback radio, other early coverage relied on comments from Police and other 24-hour services who were immediately affected and needed {{to communicate with the}} media. Because {{the earthquake}} occurred early on a Saturday morning, with only overnight <b>staff</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty,</b> it took several hours for some media outlets to give the event full live coverage. So it took until mid-morning for some media outlets to have sufficient stories and <b>staff</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> to allow them to commence continuous live broadcasts. One television producer later observed that if the earthquake had happened just a few hours earlier, or later, they would have had a full studio crew <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> and have been able to go live immediately.|$|R

50|$|The World Series of Rock {{was known}} {{not only for}} its arena rock spectacle, but was also notorious for the rowdiness, rampant drug use and {{drunkenness}} of the crowd. As a result, concertgoers occasionally fell—or jumped—off the steep stadium upper deck onto the concrete seating area far below, causing serious injury. The Cleveland Free Clinic staffed aid stations in the stadium with physicians, nurses and other volunteers, and through 1977, made its treatment statistics public. From 1978, Belkin Productions conditioned its funding of the Free Clinic on the Clinic's nondisclosure of the number of Clinic <b>staff</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> at the concerts, the nature of conditions treated, and quantity of patients treated.|$|R

3000|$|The {{absence of}} a clear {{separation}} of production activities and residential areas in many town areas. As urban expansion takes place, industrial production areas are increasingly in close spatial proximity to residential areas. When an explosion occurs in an industrial facility, especially one that is chemical related, the impact can have very disastrous consequences. The Qingdao pipeline explosion on 22 November 2013 exemplifies the problem (State Administration of Work Safety 2014). As the city’s residential areas grew, they crisscrossed the petrochemical plants and pipelines that {{are located in the}} suburbs of this coastal city. The explosion killed 62 and injured an additional 136 people, including pedestrians, <b>staff</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty,</b> local residents, and workers in the factory’s temporary living quarters, which were located near the explosion site; [...]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Medical <b>staff</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> in {{hospitals}} provides high quality care for high-risk patients, especially those situated {{in intensive care}} units. Such care may present, in addition to great psychophysical pressure to the staff, considerable expenses for the hospital in question. In the {{paper we propose a}} Post Intensive CAre Monitoring System (PICAMS), based on the emerging technologies, which may eventually diminish the requirement for the doctor’s non-interrupted presence, and allow for a faster transfer of the patient from the intensive care unit to the ordinary ward. What is more, it would also give patients the ability to move freely, which can be only positive for them in terms of better mood, quicker rehabilitation and indirectly lower costs for the hospital in question...|$|R
50|$|Lincoln Detox cost {{four times}} more per patient than {{comparable}} New York City clinics, but treated only half as many patients. It also smuggled medical supplies to the Black Liberation Army. Acupuncture was introduced by Richard Taft, a graduate of Baylor College of Medicine, in 1974. Mutulu Shakur worked at the clinic for years before turning to bank robbery and becoming a FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive. In 1976, NYC's Health and Hospitals Corporation discovered one million dollars in unsubstantiated payroll. An auditor's visit found that only 50% of <b>staff</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> were actually present and a doctor overdosed and died inside the clinic, although clinic personnel claim he was murdered by the CIA. Much of the clinic's funding was embezzled and spent on cocaine.|$|R
40|$|Constructing duty {{schedules}} {{for nurses}} at large hospitals {{is a difficult}} problem. The objective is usually {{to ensure that there}} is always sufficient <b>staff</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty,</b> while taking into account individual preferences with respect to work patterns, requests for leave and financial restrictions, {{in such a way that}} all employees are treated fairly. The prob-lem is typically solved via mixed integer programming or heuristic (local) search methods in the operations research literature. In this paper the problem is solved using a tabu search approach as a case study at Stikland Hospital, a large psychiatric hospital in the South African Western Cape, for which a computerized decision support system with respect to nurse scheduling was developed. This decision support system, called NuRoDSS (short for Nurse Rostering Deci-sion Support System) is described in some detail...|$|R
