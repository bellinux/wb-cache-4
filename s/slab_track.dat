25|$|A {{combination}} of ballasted and <b>slab</b> <b>track</b> are used, with <b>slab</b> <b>track</b> exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. <b>Slab</b> <b>track</b> is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional {{area of the}} tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.|$|E
25|$|Building a <b>slab</b> <b>track</b> is more {{expensive}} than building traditional ballasted track, which has slowed its introduction outside of high-speed rail lines. <b>Slab</b> <b>track</b> is also difficult to modify {{after it has been}} installed, and the curing time of concrete makes it difficult to convert an existing, busy railway line to a ballastless set-up.|$|E
25|$|<b>Slab</b> <b>track</b> {{can also}} {{generate}} significantly more noise pollution and cause more vibration than traditional ballasted track. While {{this is partly}} attributable to slab track's decreased sound absorption qualities, a more significant factor is that <b>slab</b> <b>track</b> typically uses softer rail fasteners to provide vertical compliance similar to ballasted track, and these can lead to more noise, because they permit the rail to vibrate over a greater length.|$|E

30|$|The <b>track</b> <b>slab</b> {{temperature}} varies periodically {{with the}} air temperature—rising during the daytime and dropping at nighttime. The higher the air temperature, the higher the <b>track</b> <b>slab</b> temperature. The time for <b>track</b> <b>slab</b> temperature to reach its extreme value is 2  h later than that for the air temperature for a 30 -cm-thick <b>track</b> <b>slab</b> in Chengdu area.|$|R
30|$|Despite many {{modifications}} {{over its}} history, the ballasted track system continues to present considerable problems, such as {{changes in the}} track geometry, fast deteriorations of track components, and rising maintenance and repair costs due to increasing train speed and transport capacity (Miura et al. 1998; Bezin et al. 2010). Accordingly, the need for non-ballasted railway tracks with higher durability has gradually increased worldwide (Galvín et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2016). For example, the percentage of <b>slab</b> <b>tracks</b> for Japanese high-speed lines has greatly increased since {{the introduction of the}} Sanyo Shinkansen line in 1972 (Miura et al. 1998; Paixão et al. 2009). The use of <b>slab</b> <b>tracks</b> has also risen in many European countries (Paixão et al. 2009).|$|R
25|$|The ZSX Twin tie is {{manufactured}} by Leonhard Moll Betonwerke GmbH & Co KG {{and is a}} pair of two pre-stressed concrete ties longitudinally connected by four steel rods. The design is said to be suitable for track with sharp curves, track subject to temperature stress such as that operated by trains with eddy brakes, bridges and as transition track between traditional track and <b>slab</b> <b>track</b> or bridges.|$|E
25|$|The Tōkaidō Shinkansen often {{experiences}} {{heavy snow}} {{in the area around}} Maibara Station in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the Jōetsu Shinkansen, winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and <b>slab</b> <b>track,</b> to mitigate the effects of deep snow.|$|E
25|$|These systems {{offer the}} {{advantage}} of superior stability and almost complete absence of deformation. Ballastless track systems incur significantly lower maintenance costs compared to ballasted track. Due {{to the absence of}} any ballast, damage by flying ballast is eliminated, something that occurs at speeds in excess of 250km/h (150mph). It is also useful in renovating existing railroad tunnels. Because <b>slab</b> <b>track</b> allows shallower construction than ballasted track, it may provide the extra overhead clearance necessary for converting a line to overhead electrification, or allow the passage of trains with a greater loading gauge.|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} above {{indicates that}} the asphalt railway substructure, which can perform well as foundation damping, has better performance in ground vibration attenuation than the conventional concrete <b>slab</b> <b>tracks.</b> The asphalt layer in the substructure is also beneficial for the long-term performance of rail substructures.|$|R
30|$|In {{the year}} 1972, the ballastless ‘slab track’ had been {{developed}} and applied to the Sanyo Shinkansen line; in the year 2007, the ‘slab track’ was used for 1244 -km-long line, which shared about 57  % of the Shinkansen network [9]. In China, both ballast and ballastless <b>slab</b> <b>tracks</b> have been used [10].|$|R
40|$|Purpose. On the Railways of Ukraine a {{very large}} number of <b>slab</b> <b>tracks</b> are {{operated}} with cracks. Many scientific works of previous years are dedicated to improving the design of <b>slab</b> <b>tracks.</b> The main causes of defects are: poor exploitation of the track; insufficient physic-mechanical characteristics of concrete; poor quality of initial materials. It is therefore necessary to develop an optimum concrete mix for the manufacture of these concrete products. Methodology. To assess the impact of individual factors and effects of their interactions on properties of concrete mix and concrete method of experimental and statistical modeling was used. At this, methodological fundamentals of mathematical experiment planning in concrete technology and modern methods of optimization of composite materials were taking into account. Based on the obtained data during the planned experiment conducting, including 15 studies and using the computer program MathCad, were obtained the regression equations, which describe the relevant physical and mechanical properties of concrete. On the basis of the equations with the help of computer program MATLAB R 2012 b the graphs were drawn, illustrating the dependences of system response from the changes of two factors at a fixed value of the third factor. Findings. Firstly was the analysis of cracks that occur in the process of operation in the constructions of <b>slab</b> <b>tracks.</b> Further reasons of possible occurrence of these cracks were presented. In the process of the conducted research the author has concluded that for rational concrete mix development it is necessary to conduct the planned experiment with the use of quality materials. It was established that to increase the strength, chemical additives should be added in to concrete mix, it will let reduce cement amount. Originality. Experiments proved the usage of modern chemical additives in order to improve the properties of concrete. Models were developed, reflecting characteristics of concrete strength. With their help one can optimize concrete composition. Practical value. Research proved that the usage of more sustainable concrete mix for production of <b>slab</b> <b>tracks</b> will increase their strength, and with it the reliability of these designs mechanical properties...|$|R
25|$|The {{track on}} a railway or railroad, {{also known as}} the {{permanent}} way, is the structure consisting of the rails, fasteners, railroad ties (sleepers, British English) and ballast (or <b>slab</b> <b>track),</b> plus the underlying subgrade. It enables trains to move by providing a dependable surface for their wheels to roll upon. For clarity it {{is often referred to as}} railway track (British English and UIC terminology) or railroad track (predominantly in the United States). Tracks where electric trains or electric trams run are equipped with an electrification system such as an overhead electrical power line or an additional electrified rail.|$|E
25|$|Rail {{transport}} is a {{means of}} transferring of passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, also known as tracks. It is also commonly referred to as train transport. In contrast to road transport, where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on ties (sleepers) and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as <b>slab</b> <b>track,</b> where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.|$|E
25|$|The {{new line}} {{will be built}} using <b>slab</b> <b>track,</b> {{although}} overtaking tracks and connections to the existing network are being built with conventional ballast. The {{distance between track centres}} will be 4.70metre and the planning width of a straight section of track is 13.30metres. In the Thuringian section of the line, the track distance was adjusted to 4.50metre in a change of plans in 1998. The planning width was reduced to 12.10metres and the cross-section of the tunnel was reduced from 101 to 92square metres. The additional cost of maintaining the larger track distances in Bavaria was estimated by the Federal Audit Office in 2014 to be at least €35 million. The Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt—EBA) stated that in Bavaria, in contrast to Thuringia, changes to the planning approval decisions would have led to a risk of third-party objections. The Federal Audit Office considered this to be inaccurate, since the reduction in the distance between the tracks in Bavaria would have reduced {{the extent to which the}} environment was affected. Near the Augustaburg tunnel, the track distance is reduced to 4.00metres.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} the {{mechanical}} properties of steel-reinforced concrete precast <b>slab</b> <b>tracks</b> on non-ballasted elasto-plastic foundations. To work out the spanning behavior of <b>slab</b> <b>tracks,</b> a FEM analysis was executed for discrete and continuous systems. At first, full-size slabs without foundation including solid and hollow-core specimens (with 30 % weight reduction) were tested under centric static (monotonic) line loads, and load–deflection curves were extracted. Then, FEM results for zero foundation stiffness were verified with those of experiments, which were in good agreement. Original results include the effects of several parameters on the cracking load, ultimate load, and energy absorption of slabs placed on elasto-plastic foundations including the slab width, concrete tensile strength and load factor. Analyses revealed that mechanical properties in hollow-core sections are {{not so different from}} those in solid ones, and thus hollow-core sections are more efficient because of significant weight reduction...|$|R

40|$|A mixed two- and {{three-dimensional}} model is developed {{to simulate the}} dynamic track-tunnel-soil interaction in underground railway with ballastless track {{taking into account the}} moving train comprising a number of carriages, the track irregularities, and interaction among various components of the system. The effects of different track irregularities on the environmental vibration generated by underground railway with direct fixation and floating <b>slab</b> <b>tracks</b> are investigated. The results show that random track irregularities have large effects on the environmental vibration compared with perfectly smooth track condition. For direct fixation tracks, the environmental vibration induced by the irregularity of short wavelength is more significant than that induced by the irregularity of medium wavelength. However, for floating <b>slab</b> <b>tracks,</b> the environmental vibration induced by the irregularity of short wavelength is less significant than that induced by the irregularity of medium wavelength. The track irregularity samples measured by track geometry measuring trolley should therefore be used together with the short-wavelength random track irregularity for accurate prediction of the environmental vibration induced by underground railway with direct fixation track...|$|R

500|$|The first {{track was}} {{laid in the}} Bowshank Tunnel on 4 April 2014. On 30 September 2014, the first train on the Waverley Route for 45 years – a works train – ran to Newcraighall. Tracklaying began in earnest on 6 October 2014, {{although}} preliminary works had resulted in a section of <b>slab</b> <b>track</b> laid through Bowshank Tunnel, south of Stow, as well as ballasting along large sections of the route and pre-cast switch and crossing units for the passing loops.

By the end of October, more than [...] of track had been laid as far as Tynehead and the double-track on the Shawfair loop had been completed plus [...] of the second track on the Borthwick loop. Work was halted in late November 2014 after a contractor working for BAM Nuttall in the Gala area was injured when a sleeper came loose when being lifted into position and landed on his leg. Work restarted on 12 January 2015 following a review by BAM of their track installation methodology. By 3 February, the track was complete through Galashiels and hundreds of spectators turned out to welcome the first train into the station since 1969, which was hauled by GBRf Class 66761 and 66741.|$|E

Nevertheless, the extent of elevation variation of the <b>track</b> <b>slab</b> with rail declines considerably compared to that without rail. The maximum elevation of the slab center decreases from 0.3  mm in the case without rail to 0.07  mm in the case with rail.

Though the elevation values differ with corners slightly, their variation patterns are the same. The maximum values occur from 20 : 00 to 06 : 40. The variation pattern depicted by dial gauge measurements (Figs.  5, 6) is generally consistent with that by electronic level (Figs.  3, 4), but the specific value and time are slightly different. Comparing Figs.  5 with 6, we find that the maximum elevation occurs {{at the corner of the}} <b>track</b> <b>slab</b> without rail is 1.61  mm, whereas the maximum value of the <b>track</b> <b>slab</b> with rail laid is 0.86  mm.
