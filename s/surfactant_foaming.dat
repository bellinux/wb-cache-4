40|$|This thesis investigates how the {{properties}} of foams can be modulated {{by the addition of}} particles to the foam solution. As a model system hydrophobic and hydrophilic silica particles were used. The de-agglomeration of hydrophilic silica particles in water and surfactant solutions was studied. Two methods are investigated: ultrasound cavitation (UC) and mechanical agitation (MA). The efficiency of these two methods was compared with respect to their ability to produce foams and to de-agglomerate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic silica particles. The same particles were used as additions to protein and <b>surfactant</b> <b>foaming</b> solutions. In the experiments, the amount and types of particles, proteins and surfactants were varied in the foaming dispersions. Then UC and MA were used to foam the dispersions and the drainage, breakage and microstructure of the resulting foams were examined. In the protein foaming solutions, both casein and whey protein foams were considered. In the <b>surfactant</b> <b>foaming</b> solution, C 12 LAS and CTAB were used. Partially hydrophobic silica particles were used in pure water to generate foam. Foamability and foam stability both increased with increasing concentration of particles. Moderately hydrophobic particles gave optimum foamability whilst no foam could be produced with fully hydrophilic particles. In the foam rheology test, a transition from solid-like to liquid-like behaviour was found while the foam with addition of SCMC exhibited no such transition. ...|$|E

40|$|NAPL (non-aqueous phase liquid) blob {{mobilization}} and solubilization {{models were}} developed to predict residual NAPL fate and describe flow dynamics of various displacing phases (water and <b>surfactant</b> <b>foam).</b> The models were achieved by pore-scale mass and force balances and were focused on {{the understanding of the}} physico-chemical interactions between NAPL blobs and the displacing phases. The pore-level mass balance indicated changes in NAPL saturation instead of mass reduction occurring with blob solubilization. The force balance was used to explain the complex flow configurations among NAPL blobs and the displacing phases. Some factors such as the wettability and the spreading/entering coefficients were useful in determining flow configurations. From the models developed in this study, dimensional analysis was performed to identify NAPL blob motion during water or <b>surfactant</b> <b>foam</b> flooding. In non-dimensionalized forms, a Trapping number employed as an indicator of blob displacement performance was modified to quantify the onset of blob mobilization. Its value for water flooding was nearly 2 - 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of <b>surfactant</b> <b>foam</b> flooding. Next, to investigate the blob flow regime in porous media, a blob velocity was computed. Regardless of the displacing phases, a blob?s velocity increased with increasing blob sizes after commencement of blob motion, and the velocity of DNAPL (dense non-aqueous phase liquid) blobs was greater than that of LNAPL (light non-aqueous phase liquid) blobs. From this investigation, it is expected that the pore-scale solubilization and mobilization models would provide better understanding leading to a predictive capability for the flow behavior of NAPL blobs removed by various displacing phases in a porous medium. Additionally, the models based on newly approached concepts and modified governing equations would be useful in conceptualization, as well as the model prediction of other immiscible or miscible fluids flowing through a porous medium. Further, the models developed in our study would be a useful contribution to the study of small-scale contaminants or substances such as particle and bacterial transport in porous media...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate the fire-extinguishing performance of a compressed air foam system at different mixing ratios of pressurized air. In this system, compressed air is injected into an aqueous solution of foam and then discharged. The experimental device uses an exclusive fire-extinguishing technology with compressed air foam that is produced based on the Canada National Laboratory and UL (Underwriters Laboratories) 162 standards, with a 20 -unit oil fire model (Class B) applied as the fire extinguisher. Compressed air is injected through the air mixture, and results with different air-to-aqueous solution foam ratios of 1 : 4, 1 : 7, and 1 : 10 are studied. In addition, comparison experiments between synthetic <b>surfactant</b> <b>foam</b> and a foam type which forms an aqueous film are carried out at an air-to-aqueous solution foam ratio of 1 : 4. From the experimental results, at identical discharging flows, {{it was found that the}} fire-extinguishing effect of the aqueous film-forming foam is greatest at an air-to-aqueous solution foam ratio of 1 : 7 and weakest at 1 : 10.

30|$|In a {{previous}} publication (Le et al. 2008), a novel foam concept was proposed and a surfactant concentration of 0.1 wt% in CO 2 {{at ambient temperature}} and 1800 Â psi was roughly determined. Oil recoveries with variable injection strategies were presented briefly. In our earlier work (Ren et al. 2014), solubility and partition coefficients {{of a series of}} nonionic CO 2 -soluble surfactants have been tested at varying pressures, temperatures, and salinity in our laboratory. Preliminary probes have revealed superiorities of CO 2 -soluble <b>surfactant</b> <b>foam</b> over conventional aqueous soluble <b>surfactant</b> <b>foam</b> through laboratory core floodings of Silurian dolomite carbonate and field scale simulations (Ren et al. 2013). However, the conclusions drawn previously deserve to be further examined with broader rock types and injection strategies. Moreover, some conclusions from prior literature based on conventional surfactants, such as optimal injection strategy, could be updated or modified in the presence of CO 2 -soluble surfactants. Through laboratory experiments and field scale simulations, in the current paper, we will peruse the following goals: demonstrate the remarkable advantages of CO 2 -soluble surfactant on the laboratory scale with co-injection, alternating injection, and novel pure CO 2 injection with dissolved surfactant; with field scale simulation, exhibit the considerable superiorities of CO 2 -soluble surfactant over conventional aqueous surfactant through SAG and co-injection with variable perforation interval or slug size; investigate the unique characteristics of the novel CO 2 <b>foam,</b> including <b>surfactant</b> delivery media, optimal injection strategy, and some additional considerations; and then, examine whether previous conclusions in the literature for conventional surfactants were still valid for this novel foam with our practical postulations.|$|R

30|$|The {{impact of}} the fire effects on water have already {{been shown to be}} {{disastrous}} in the case of Basel Switzerland. Fire is commonly extinguished with water, although other agents (e.g., <b>surfactants,</b> <b>foams)</b> may be used {{depending on the type of}} fire.

40|$|This {{research}} explores a {{new method}} using foams for water production control in an oilfield. Reducing water production during oil production {{is an important}} objective impacting the profitability of a mature oilfield. Currently practiced methods using gel or polymer based systems either offer inadequate water flow reduction or suffer problems of proper placement in the field. Because of its properties, foam {{has the potential for}} use in water control. In this study, foams stable in presence of flowing water (washout stability) were developed using polymeric surfactants. A screening test was developed to measure the washout resistance of various conventional and polymeric <b>surfactants.</b> <b>Foam</b> from several polymeric surfactants such as triblock F 108 and hydrophobically modified HMPA 1 exhibited remarkable improvement in washout stability over conventional <b>surfactants.</b> Strong <b>foam</b> that offered a large resistance to flow of water was generated in a two-foot long sand pack with some of these polymeric surfactants. Again, the polymeric <b>surfactants</b> exhibited higher <b>foam</b> washout resistance than the conventional surfactants as predicted by the screening tests. Investigation of surfactant desorption from an air-water interface using bubble shape analysis showed that this improved foam washout resistance was due to almost irreversible adsorption of polymeric <b>surfactants.</b> Collapse of <b>foam</b> from polymeric <b>surfactants</b> at long times in the screening test was determined to be due to hydrodynamic effects and not desorption. Also, foam washout stability with polymeric surfactants in sand pack was found to be limited by air dissolution into flowing water. Scale-up calculations for oilfield geometries showed that foam from F 108 can be stable for a long enough time, even with gas dissolution, for the process to be practicable. Foam stable to residual oil, expected in the water producing zones, was created by mixing an anionic surfactant CS- 330 with nonionic F 108. This is because ionic surfactants produce an electrostatic barrier that prevents entry of oil droplets into the air water interface. Flowing oil, however, produced a stable emulsion with this surfactant combination which offered a large resistance to flow. This was undesirable and was minimized by a brine flush to remove surfactant from the aqueous phase of the foam region before contact with flowing oil...|$|R

40|$|Success of foam as a {{displacing}} {{fluid in}} porous media depends on longevity of foams {{in the presence}} of non-aqueous phase liquids such as hydrocarbons. The stability of foam at bulk scale has been used in many cases to screen potential surfactants for core flooding studies.

30|$|There {{are many}} uses of foam in {{petroleum}} industry {{yet there is}} no dependable industry standard on screening a wide variety of <b>foaming</b> <b>surfactants</b> available for a particular application. This study aims to fill this gap. Three anionic <b>foaming</b> <b>surfactants</b> were characterized and tested with the two commonly used screening methods at room temperature and oil-free conditions. The results were comprehensively analyzed to compare their foaming performance. The analysis is more comprehensive than previously reported and covers many foaming attributes (peak and residual foamability, foam longevity, and rate of decay). The three <b>surfactants</b> for possible <b>foaming</b> applications in sandstone reservoirs were selected, and their foamability and foam stability performances were experimentally determined by bulk foam stability tests and coreflood tests. All methods agreed on the ratings of the three surfactants for peak and residual foaming attributes as follows in the following order of effectiveness: MFOMAX, AOS, and ENORDET. However, they broadly disagreed on ratings for other characteristics including onset of foaming, the time required for peak foaming, foam longevity, and foam decay rate. In conclusion, the screening tests revealed that the simple and faster bulk foam stability test could be cautiously used to screen out the poor performers to narrow the range of acceptable surfactants. Also, the new and rigorous analysis technique presented in this paper offers more insight than conventional half-life test.|$|R

Beside classical methods to investigate polymer/surfactant systems, we applied, {{for the first}} time concerning these systems, the analogy between the small angle neutron scattering by foams and the neutron reflectivity of films to measure in situ film thicknesses of foams. CTAB/pectin foam films are much thicker than that of the pure <b>surfactant</b> <b>foam</b> film but similar for highly and lowly charged pectin/CTAB systems despite the difference in structure of complexes at interfaces. The improvement of the foam properties of CTAB bound to pectin is shown to be directly related to the formation of pectin-CTAB complexes at the air-water interface. However, in opposition to surface activity, there is no specific behavior for the highly charged pectin: foam properties depend mainly upon the bulk charge concentration, while the interfacial behavior is mainly governed by the charge density of pectin. For the highly charged pectin, specific cooperative effects between neighboring charged sites along the chain are thought {{to be involved in the}} higher surface activity of pectin/CTAB complexes.

The results show that the small addition of SDS can enhance foaming functions of DAMP 4 at a lowered protein concentration. Dynamic surface tension measurements suggest that there is a synergy between DAMP 4 and SDS which enhances adsorption kinetics of DAMP 4 at the initial stage of adsorption (first 60 s), which in turn stabilizes protein foams. Further interfacial properties were revealed by X-ray reflectometry measurements, showing that there is a re-arrangement of adsorbed protein-surfactant layer {{over a long period of}} 1 h.

We previously investigated some of their unique properties, especially the strongly reduced coarsening. Here we report another type of study on these foams: performing diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS), we investigate {{for the first time the}} internal dynamics on the scales of both the particles and the bubbles. When compared to <b>surfactant</b> <b>foams,</b> unusual features are observed; in particular, two well-separated modes are found in the dynamics, both evolving with foam aging. We propose an interpretation of these specificities, taking into account both the scattering by free particles in the foam fluid (fast mode), and by the foam structure (slow mode). To validate our interpretation, we show that independent measurements of the interstitial fluid scattering length, obtained indirectly on the foam and directly on the drained liquid, are in good agreement. We have also identified the experimental conditions required to observe such two-process dynamics. Counter-intuitively, the fraction of free particles within the foam interstitial fluid has to be very low to get an optimal signature of these particles on the DWS correlation curves. This study also sheds light on the partitioning of the particles inside the foams and at the interfaces, as the foam ages. Lastly, the results shown here (obtained by analyzing the fluctuations of the transmitted light) implement the previous ones (obtained by analyzing the mean transmitted intensity), and prove that the foam structure is actually not fully frozen...|$|R
