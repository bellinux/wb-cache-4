40|$|Organisation with a Memory”, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) {{established}} the Working Group on the Labelling and Packaging of Medicines (WGLPM). The working group’s remit was {{to review the}} labelling and packaging of medicines, in particular the labelling of the vinca alkaloids, to see what improvements {{could be made to}} reduce the likelihood of medication errors occurring as a result of labelling and to advise the CSM. The working group reviewed the published evidence related to medication errors in which aspects of medicines labelling and packaging were implicated as a causative factor. Discrete areas of concern were identified with labelling and packaging which affected both health professionals and patients and had the potential to result in incorrect administration of medicines thereby causing harm. The working group also considered reports of specific cases of incorrect drug administration. The working group discussed and made recommendations in respect of general labelling and packaging principles, which should apply, to all medicines. The group has also proposed <b>specific</b> <b>labelling</b> <b>requirements</b> for medicines that have previously been implicated in medication errors, some with fatal outcome. The working group acknowledged that labelling and packaging was only part of any overall system to avoid errors with medicines. They recognised that {{some of the issues that}} were discussed were also encompassed in the wider remit of other groups involved in the implementation of an Organisation With A Memory. Members commend the outcome of these discussions to those considering the wider aspects of the issue of safe use of medicines. It is acknowledged that there are no changes that can eradicate all errors. It is anticipated that CSM may agree that implementation of the proposals put forward by the working group could make a significant contribution to reducing medication errors. wgplm report 8. do...|$|E
50|$|While most {{countries}} have specific regulations {{and standards for}} food, Canada has certain egg regulations pertaining to what products can be labelled as an egg. Balut eggs are not subjected to the egg regulations in Canada under the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, meaning they do not require the <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>requirements</b> and rules of the traditional chicken egg.|$|R
5000|$|Phthalates {{are used}} in some but not all PVC formulations, {{and there are no}} <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>requirements</b> for phthalates. PVC {{plastics}} are typically used for various containers and hard packaging, medical tubing, and bags, and are labelled [...] "Type 3" [...] for recycling reasons. However, the presence of phthalates rather than other plasticizers is not marked on PVC items. Only unplasticized PVC (uPVC), which is mainly used as a hard construction material, has no plasticizers. If a more accurate test is needed, chemical analysis, for example by gas chromatography or liquid chromatography, can establish the presence of phthalates.|$|R
25|$|Di-2ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) {{has been}} {{medically}} approved {{for many years}} for use in medical devices; the PVC-DEHP combination proving to be very suitable for making blood bags because DEHP stabilises red blood cells, minimising haemolysis (red blood cell rupture). However, DEHP is coming under increasing pressure in Europe. The assessment of potential risks related to phthalates, {{and in particular the}} use of DEHP in PVC medical devices, was subject to scientific and policy review by the European Union authorities, and on 21 March 2010, a <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>requirement</b> was introduced across the EU for all devices containing phthalates that are classified as CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction). The label aims to enable healthcare professionals to use this equipment safely, and, where needed, take appropriate precautionary measures for patients at risk of over-exposure.|$|R

40|$|According to European Commission (EC) Regulation 1139 / 98, {{foods and}} food {{ingredients}} {{that are to}} be delivered to the final consumer in which either protein or DNA resulting from genetic modification is present, shall be subject to additional <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>requirements.</b> Since 1994, genetically altered tomatoes, squash, potatoes, canola, cotton, and soy have been on the market. Recently, insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant maize varieties have been introduced. Soy and maize are 2 of the most important vegetable crops in the world. During the past 4 years, both protein-and DNA-based methods have been developed and applied for detection of transgenic soy and maize, and their derivatives. For protein-based detection, specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have been developed; for immunochemical detection, Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are the most prominent examples. For detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) at the level of DNA, polymerase chain reaction-based methods are mainly used. For these reactions, highly specific primer sets are needed. This study compares the principally different methods. Specificity of methods and the possible risks of false-positive or false-negative results are considered in relation to sampling, matrix effects, and food processing procedures. In addition, quantitative aspects of protein-and DNA-based GM detection methods are presented and discussed. This is especially relevant as EC regulation 49 / 2000, which defines a threshold for an unintentional comingling of 1 %, came into force on April 10, 2000.

50|$|The Panel and Appellate Body in Tuna-Dolphin GATT Case (I and II) {{held that}} the US {{labeling}} measures for dolphin-safe tuna was a technical regulation. The requirements were not compulsory {{for the sale of}} tuna in the US, however the requirements were compulsory for dolphin-safe certification. The Appellate Body stated that because the US provided no other methods of obtaining the dolphin-safe <b>label,</b> the <b>requirement</b> was binding, and therefore de jure mandatory.

40|$|In immunoelectron {{microscopy}} (immuno-EM) on ultrathin sections, gold {{particles are}} used for localization of molecular components of cells. These particles are countable, and quantitative methods have been established to estimate and evaluate the density and distribution of “raw” gold particle counts from a single uncontrolled labeling experiment. However, these raw counts are composed of two distinct elements: particles that are <b>specific</b> (<b>specific</b> <b>labeling)</b> and particles that are not (nonspecific labeling) for the target component. So far, approaches for assessment of <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> and for correction of raw gold particle counts to reveal <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> densities and distributions have not attracted much attention. Here, we discuss experimental strategies for determining specificity in immuno-EM, and we present methods for quantitative assessment of (1) the probability that an observed gold particle is specific for the target, (2) the density of <b>specific</b> <b>labeling,</b> and (3) the distribution of <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> over a series of compartments. These methods should be of general utility for researchers investigating the distribution of cellular components using on-section immunogold labeling.
