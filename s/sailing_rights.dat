5000|$|During World War II OSK, {{like other}} Japanese {{shipping}} companies, {{was forced to}} be a mere ship owner. When the war ended it had only 55 vessels left, totalling , {{most of which were}} so-called wartime standard ships, of poor quality. All ships were under control of the Allied powers through the Civilian Merchant Marine Committee. In 1950, however, OSK returned to global service. By the end of 1957 the company had almost recovered the <b>sailing</b> <b>rights</b> it had been given by the FEFC before the war, and was making 18 voyages per month on 13 overseas liner routes. Competition was far more intense than before the war, as anyone who had money could construct ships under the government-sponsored shipbuilding program, started in 1947. Before the war, conference members had sought to exclude newcomers. OSK constructed 38 ships under the program. In 1953 OSK established an eastbound route to South America to transport emigrants from Japan. At first the service was profitable, but the number of emigrants fell to below 2,000 per year in 1962. In 1963 OSK established the Japan Emigration Ship Co., Ltd. (JES) to hive off this loss making business. Later, JES was reorganized into Mitsui OSK Passenger Co., Ltd. In this period most of OSK's businesses were loss making. In 1964 it owned 41 vessels totalling [...] The company was capitalized at ¥7.6 billion and its debts totalled approximately ¥34.9 billion.|$|E
60|$|I haven't {{piled up}} MS so in years as I have done since {{we came here}} to the farm three weeks and a half ago.

60|$|After {{steaming}} {{about twenty-five}} {{miles up the}} St. John's River, we went in close to the western shore, and then made a sharp turn into a narrow opening between the tall trees, and <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> into the forest.|$|R
6000|$|... "The captain be damned" [...] said I, and we let him {{sleep through}} {{two hours of}} chase till a {{rainstorm}} swallowed us up. Then we changed our course and <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> across them, and by morning only her smoke was showing.|$|R

6000|$|... "But how {{on earth}} did you manage it?" [...] the captain asked. [...] "I see the brig has been cut up a good deal, about the sails and rigging. You don't {{mean to say that}} she <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> into Cartagena? Why, they would have blown her out of the water!" ...|$|R
50|$|Throughout its history, the {{proximity}} of the marsh to the European mainland meant that this area was in the front line whenever invasion threatened. In AD 892, one such invasion was successful. The Danish fleet of 250 ships <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> into the Rother and took the fortress at Appledore (allegedly built by King Arthur), which they destroyed.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{the bark}} came so near {{that we could}} see the people on board, but still she went past us. This was the hardest to bear of all, for she seemed so near. But when she tacked and came back, she <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> down to us. We could see her all the time now, whether we were up or down.|$|R
25|$|Coastal California has a {{rich history}} of marine {{utilization}} by Native Americans and early settlers. Cordell Bank {{was a mystery}} prior to the 19th century because neither the Miwok natives nor the settlers had any incentive to venture far out from shore, when food resources were available close to shore. Many European mariners <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> over Cordell Bank without even knowing it was there.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's nothin'," [...] {{said the}} boy, contemptuously, [...] "for this boat I'm goin' {{to take you}} in can sail more'n four {{times as fast as}} any steamer you ever saw. Why, she <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> around Tom Stevens's boat the other day, an' there wasn't any wind at all. I tell you what it is, just you come up here with me an' see her, then you'll know what she can do." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{the first}} time that Corny had let herself out in this way, but I don't wonder she did it. The captain {{explained}} that the ship couldn't <b>sail</b> <b>right</b> to us, because the wind was not in the proper direction for that. She had to tack. If she had been a steamer, the case would have been different. We all sat and waited, and waved our flag.|$|R
500|$|The Manchester Ship Canal {{was built}} between 1888 and 1894, in some {{sections}} by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey, running [...] from Salford to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey. This enabled oceangoing ships to <b>sail</b> <b>right</b> into the Port of Manchester. On the canal's banks, {{just outside the}} borough, the world's first industrial estate was created at Trafford Park. Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.|$|R
50|$|Dockyards {{have always}} {{required}} shore defences. Among the earliest for Chatham was Upnor Castle, built in 1567, {{on the opposite}} side of the River Medway.

500|$|In 1912, the Norwegian {{explorer}} Roald Amundsen {{wrote of}} the Ross expedition that [...] "Few people of the present day are capable of rightly appreciating this heroic deed, this brilliant proof of human courage and energy.

50|$|A small Swedish naval unit <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> {{into the}} mighty Russian fleet {{anchored}} at Granhamn. A fierce battle took place, the Swedes lost their four frigates {{after they had}} run aground but the Russian losses became so heavy that the entire fleet quickly decided to withdraw from Åland, leaving 43 sunken ships and 1000 dead Russians behind. The Russian losses prevented their navy from launching any further major operations until the war ended with the Treaty of Nystad the following year.|$|R
5000|$|As the Industrial Revolution took off, {{a series}} of works were built along the Tawe river from 1720 onwards and {{a series of}} mines were opened. Initially, the {{smelting}} works concentrated on copper. Coal was brought down to them by waggonways and tramways; copper ore was brought on ships which could <b>sail</b> <b>right</b> up to the works; and the resulting copper was exported out again. Swansea had become [...] "Copperopolis", and the lower Tawe valley became a mass of industry.|$|R

It was in the Dixie, a ship {{almost as big as}} this. There was a strong fair wind blowing, and father did not take a tug. We <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> through the Golden Gate and up the San Francisco water-front. There was a swift flood tide, too; and the men, both watches, were taking in sail as fast as they could.|$|R

I <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> over a big alder bush, and when I came down on my feet, young Mr. Fox had just got it into his head that I'd played him a trick.

60|$|For a {{few moments}} or an hour--no one will ever know how long--we ran round him, raising the dust, {{scattering}} the stones, breaking the branches, dodging his onslaughts. He leaped at us to {{the full length of}} his tether, <b>sailing</b> <b>right</b> into our faces, a fierce, uncowed, tigerish beast. If it had not been for the collar and swivel he would have choked himself a hundred times. Quick as a cat, supple, powerful, tireless, he kept on the go, whirling, bounding, leaping, rolling, till it seemed we would never catch him.|$|R
50|$|But {{the reign}} of Pagan Min (1846-52) there was a blemish in Burmese Muslim history. Amarapura's mayor Bai Sab and his clerk U Pain were arrested and sentenced to death. U Pain {{was the one who}} {{constructed}} and donated the Taunthaman bridge with more than 1000 teak piles and is still in good condition. Although the real background or aim of building the bridge was not known, before the bridge was built, British Ambassador Arthur Fair's ship could <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> up to the Amarapura city wall but the bridge actually obstruct the direct access by British.|$|R
5000|$|In Roman {{times the}} Harbour was navigable {{all the way}} to Fishbourne and Roman galleys may have <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> up to the Fishbourne Palace. Sea levels in the harbour were higher in the Middle Ages than they are now and there are records of losses of land to the sea. The Great Flood of Apuldram {{occurred}} in 1274 and additional sea walls and sluices were installed after that. The former existence of a tide mill on the River Lavant near Apuldram Common is an indication of the level of the sea at that time at the northern boundary of the parish.|$|R
6000|$|... "'My rock {{people live}} at the shore. I used to visit them almost every evening before the winter came. Now I can't go till spring, {{but they will be}} there, for people like that never change [...] . that is the splendid thing about them. Nora was the first one of them I got acquainted with and so I think I love her the best. She lives in Andrews' Cove and she has black hair and black eyes, and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies. You ought to hear the stories she can tell. Then there are the Twin Sailors. They don't live anywhere, they sail all the time, but they often come ashore to talk to me. They are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen {{everything}} in the world. [...] . and more than what is in the world. Do you know what happened to the youngest Twin Sailor once? He was sailing and he <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> into a moonglade. A moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea, you know, teacher. Well, the youngest Twin Sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon, and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it and <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> through.

50|$|Initially, the {{smelting}} works {{concentrated on}} copper. Coal was brought down {{to them by}} waggonways and tramways; copper ore was brought on ships which could <b>sail</b> <b>right</b> up to the works; and the resulting copper was exported out again the same way. Swansea became known as Copperopolis; and the lower Tawe valley became a mass of industry. In {{the wake of the}} copper and coal industry followed pottery-making (another industry which requires large amounts of coal, together with clay and flint, which could be shipped in from the West Country); the alum industry (based on pyrites found with coal); and the manufacture of fire-clay, which was used to line furnaces.|$|R
5000|$|Aalholm {{was located}} on a very {{favorable}} site, standing on a little island in the inlet known as Nysted Nor. Completely surrounded by water, it was protected from the open sea although ships of all kinds could <b>sail</b> <b>right</b> up to the island, provided they had crews conversant with the channel to be followed. Not far {{to the north and}} west, there was fertile land where produce could be grown for the castle, with a surplus for the vassal and the king. Moreover, Nysted Nor was the only suitable site for a building of the kind between Nakskov in the south of Lolland and Stubbekøbing in the northeast of Falster.|$|R
60|$|On {{the third}} day we pursued rather an {{irregular}} course, as I was employed in examining some beds of marble. On the fine plains of turf we saw many ostriches (Struthio rhea). Some of the flocks contained as many as twenty or thirty birds. These, when standing on any little eminence, and seen against the clear sky, presented a very noble appearance. I never met with such tame ostriches in {{any other part of}} the country: it was easy to gallop up within a short distance of them; but then, expanding their wings, they made all <b>sail</b> <b>right</b> before the wind, and soon left the horse astern.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} the affair," [...] the captain said, [...] "and a very gallant one it was; for, if I am right, the frigate {{could not get}} into the entrance, but landed her men, captured two of the pirates' batteries, and turned the guns on their ships, while a schooner she had captured {{a few days before}} <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> in and engaged them, and was nearly destroyed when one of the pirates blew up. The officer in command of her was killed, and a midshipman was very highly spoken of, for he succeeded to the command, and gallantly went on board another pirate and drowned their magazine." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} morning of 25 July, the Dutch fleet of 88 ships {{discovered}} the English fleet of 89 ships near North Foreland, sailing to the north, and pursued it from the southeast in a leeward position, as the wind blew from the northwest. Suddenly, the wind turned to the northeast. The commander of the English fleet, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, then turned sharply east to regain the weather gauge and De Ruyter followed to keep it. This {{proved to be a}} fatal manoeuvre for the Dutch. They now <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> into the core of a high-pressure area. The Dutch van, commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Johan Evertsen, lost all speed and couldn't maintain a line of battle. This awkward situation lasted for hours; then, again, a soft breeze began to blow from the northeast. Immediately, the English van, commanded by Thomas Allin, and part of the centre formed a line of battle and <b>sailed</b> <b>right</b> to the Dutch van, still in disarray and basically defenceless. Ship after ship of the Frisian fleet was mauled by the combined firepower of the English line. Vice-Admiral Rudolf Coenders was killed. Lieutenant-Admiral Tjerk Hiddes de Vries had {{an arm and a leg}} shot off, yet still tried to bring cohesion to his forces, but to no avail. Unable to reach them with his centre, the horrified De Ruyter saw the Frisian ships drifting to the south, now no more than floating wrecks full of dead, the moans of the dying clearly audible above the other sounds of battle.|$|R
