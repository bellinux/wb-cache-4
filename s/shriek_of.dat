The Hawks {{eventually}} separate the Queen from the entity, as the skeletons from the Hawks past incarnations come alive due {{to the power of the}} Violet Battery and take Queen Shriek to the inside of the battery where she's sealed away with all the skeletons.|$|E

2500|$|Three former Michigan {{football}} players {{were killed in}} the war. One of the casualties was Curtis Redden, star end of Fielding Yost's [...] "Point-a-Minute" [...] teams. In April 1918, newspapers published a letter from Redden to a friend back home describing his unit's [...] "baptism of fire":"And so it went from day to day, but oftimes the nights were very bad. At night, when the infantry launched its raids, or the enemy his, or the infantry became nervous and called for help, the guns stamped like stallions and snorted their breaths of fire. The blackness of the night became a series of dots and dashes, until the world resembled a vast radio station, spelling hell, hell, and hell again. To this must be added the <b>shriek</b> <b>of</b> shells, the whistle of fragments, the automatic hammer effect of the machine gun, the rattle of the rifle fire, the rockets and star shells out over No Man's land—all combined to make the night weird, hideous, fascinating, sublime." ...|$|E

2500|$|Redden {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army during World War I. [...] He served as a {{lieutenant}} colonel of the 149th Field Artillery with the Rainbow Division in France. [...] His unit {{was among the first}} to leave for France. [...] In April 1918, newspapers published a letter from Redden to a friend back home describing the Illinois artillery unit's [...] "baptism of fire." [...] He described the heavy shelling the unit withstood:"And so it went from day to day, but oftimes the nights were very bad.

2500|$|The 15th Hussars charged, {{over about}} [...] of snowy, frozen ground, {{shouting}} [...] "Emsdorf and Victory!" [...] It {{was so cold}} the hussars wore their pelisses, rather than having them slung over their shoulders, and many had cloaks over all. Eyewitnesses also spoke of numbed hands hardly able to grasp reins and sabres. The impact when the hussars met the chasseurs was terrible, as one British officer recorded: [...] "horses and men were overthrown and a <b>shriek</b> <b>of</b> terror, intermixed with oaths, groans and prayers for mercy issued from the whole extent of their front." [...] The impetus of the British hussars carried them {{through the ranks of}} the chasseurs and into those of the dragoons behind. The French force was broken, and it routed eastwards with the British in pursuit. Many French cavalrymen (though the chasseurs were largely of German origin) were taken prisoner at very little cost to the 15th Hussars. Two French lieutenant colonels were captured and the chasseurs, who lost many men captured, ceased to exist as a viable regiment. The 10th Hussars came up during the pursuit, however, they were initially mistaken for French cavalry. This caused the 15th Hussars to break off their pursuit to re-form, ending the action.|$|E
