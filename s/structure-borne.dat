5000|$|A contact {{microphone}}, {{also known}} as a pickup or a piezo, is a form of microphone that senses audio vibrations through contact with solid objects. Unlike normal air microphones, contact microphones are almost completely insensitive to air vibrations but transduce only <b>structure-borne</b> sound. Often used as acoustic leakage probes, they also enjoy wide usage by noise music artists experimenting with sound. Contact microphones based on piezo materials are passive and high-impedance, which can make them sound 'tinny' without a matching preamp.|$|E
50|$|Low {{frequency}} Rayleigh waves generated during earthquakes {{are used}} in seismology to characterise the Earth's interior.In intermediate ranges, Rayleigh waves {{are used in}} geophysics and geotechnical engineering for the characterisation of oil deposits. These applications {{are based on the}} geometric dispersion of Rayleigh waves and on the solution of an inverse problem on the basis of seismic data collected on the ground surface using active sources (falling weights, hammers or small explosions, for example) or by recording microtremors.Rayleigh ground waves are important also for environmental noise and vibration control since they make a major contribution to traffic-induced ground vibrations and the associated <b>structure-borne</b> noise in buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Electromagnetic torque, {{which can}} be {{calculated}} as the average value of the Maxwell stress tensor along the airgap, is one consequence of electromagnetic forces in electric machines. As a static force, it does not create vibrations nor acoustic noise. However torque ripple (also called cogging torque for permanent magnet synchronous machines in open circuit), which represents the harmonic variations of electromagnetic torque, is a dynamic force creating torsional vibrations of both rotor and stator. The torsional deflection of a simple cylinder cannot radiate efficiently acoustic noise, but with particular boundary conditions the stator can radiate acoustic noise under torque ripple excitation [...] <b>Structure-borne</b> noise can also be generated by torque ripple when rotor shaft line vibrations propagate to the frame [...]|$|E
5000|$|The {{sources of}} noise {{in a vehicle}} are many, {{including}} the engine, driveline, tire contact patch and road surface, brakes, and wind. Noise from cooling fans, or the HVAC, alternator, and other engine accessories is also fairly common.

These are classified as [...] "structure-borne" [...] noise. Others are generated acoustically and propagated by airborne paths. <b>Structure-borne</b> noise is attenuated by isolation, while airborne noise is reduced by absorption or {{through the use of}} barrier materials.

50|$|HFIM, {{acronym for}} high-frequency-impulse-{{measurement}}, {{is a certain}} kind of measurement technique in acoustics, where <b>structure-borne</b> sound signals are detected and processed with certain emphasis on short-lived signals as they are indicative for crack formation in a solid body, mostly steel. The basic idea is to use mathematical signal processing methods such as Fourier analysis in combination with suitable computer hardware to allow for real-time measurements of acoustic signal amplitudes as well as their distribution in frequency space. The main benefit of this technique is the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio {{when it comes to the}} separation of acoustic emission from a certain source and other, unwanted contamination by any kinds of noise. The technique is therefore mostly applied in industrial production processes, e.g. cold forming or machining, where a 100 percent quality control is required or in condition monitoring for e.g. quantifying tool wear.|$|E

50|$|Like in seismology, ground {{vibrations}} {{are associated}} with different types of elastic waves propagating through the ground. These are surface waves, mostly Rayleigh waves, and bulk longitudinal waves and transverse waves (or shear waves) propagating into the ground depth. Typical frequency range for environmental ground vibrations is 1 - 200 Hz. Waves of lower frequencies (below 1 Hz) are usually called microseisms, and they are normally associated with natural phenomenae, e.g. water waves in the oceans. Environmental ground vibrations generated by rail and road traffic may cause annoyance to residents of nearby buildings both directly and via generated <b>structure-borne</b> interior noise. Very strong ground vibrations, e.g. generated by heavy lorries on bumped roads, may even cause structural damage to very close buildings. Magnitudes of ground vibrations are usually {{described in terms of}} particle vibration velocity (in mm/s or m/s). Sometimes they are also described in decibels (relative to the reference particle velocity of 10−9 m/s). Typical values of ground vibration particle velocity associated with vehicles passing over traffic calming road humps are in the range of 0.1 - 2 mm/s. Magnitudes of ground vibrations that are considered to be able to cause structural damage to buildings are above 10-20 mm/s.|$|E
40|$|A {{potentially}} {{important source}} of <b>structure-borne</b> interior noise transmission in advanced turboprop aircraft is the impingement of the propeller wake/vortex on downstream aerodynamic surfaces. The expected levels of propeller wake/vortex-induced <b>structure-borne</b> noise transmission are not known nor can they be determined with present-day technology. A test apparatus has been designed, built and calibrated {{for the purposes of}} studying propeller-induced, <b>structure-borne</b> noise transmission in prototypical aircraft structures. The principal approach to the test apparatus design was to provide a physical means of separating the airborne and <b>structure-borne</b> noise components so that the <b>structure-borne</b> noise transmission response could be studied directly without airborne noise contamination. This was accomplished by housing the receiving fuselage structure in an acoustic shield fitted with a wing-to-fuselage acoustic seal. Initial evaluation of the wing-to-fuselage acoustic seal indicates adequate airborne noise isolation to allow direct study of <b>structure-borne</b> noise transmission...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{emitted by}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} suction unit {{consists}} of airborne and <b>structure-borne</b> noise. The airborne noise is generated mainly by the turbo blower and the <b>structure-borne</b> noise is generated mainly by the driving electric motor. The <b>structure-borne</b> noise depends on the suction unit design and on operating conditions, and is especially distinct at partial flow rates when rotating stall and surge appear. Among geometrical parameters, the statorof the blower and the electric motor, or metal shield if any, have the greatest effect on the <b>structure-borne</b> noise. Therefore, {{in this part of}} the paper, the effects of vibrations of the electric motor structure on the noise characteristics have been measured and analysed at the design and off-design operation.

Most important was the development of in-flight <b>structure-borne</b> noise transmission detection techniques using a combination of ground-based frequency response function testing and in-flight structural response measurement.

40|$|Estimates of {{the level}} of {{in-flight}} <b>structure-borne</b> noise transmission in the Propfan Test Assessment Aircraft were carried out for the first three blade passage frequencies. The procedure used combined the frequency response functions of wing strain to cabin sound pressure level (SPL) response obtained during ground test with in-flight measured wing strain response data. The estimated cabin average in-flight <b>structure-borne</b> noise levels varied from 64 to 84 dB, with an average level of 74 dB. The estimates showed little dependence on engine/propeller power, flight altitude, or flight Mach number. In general, the bare cabin noise levels decreased with increasing propeller tone, giving rise to a plausible <b>structure-borne</b> noise transmission problem at the higher blade passage tones.

30|$|Axial {{piston pumps}} are broadly applied in {{industrial}} and mobile applications to convert mechanical energy into fluid power energy [1]. Axial piston pumps are advantageous {{in terms of}} their efficiency, compactness and reliability [2, 3]. The prominent disadvantage is a high noise level. The noise emitted from an axial piston pump can be divided into <b>structure-borne</b> noise, fluid-borne noise and airborne noise [4]. The <b>structure-borne</b> noise is generated by various internal forces and moments, and the fluid-borne noise is produced by flow ripples in the inlet and outlet ports [5]. Both <b>structure-borne</b> noise and fluid-borne noise contribute to the generation of airborne noise.|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} to have two or more {{vibratory}} machines of the same type mounted on the same supporting structure. These vibratory machines transmit <b>structure-borne</b> sound to adjacent walls or floors and the <b>structure-borne</b> sound is eventually emitted as noise into indoor spaces. The interactions of the mounting points among coherent machines increase the <b>structure-borne</b> sound power transmission significantly at some frequencies and decrease it considerably at some other frequencies. However, {{there is still no}} general design frameworks of supporting structure optimization strategy that target on minimizing <b>structure-borne</b> sound power transmission by utilizing the interactions of the mounting points among coherent machines properly. This paper for the first time develops a practical design framework to obtain an optimal set of geometrical parameters for a supporting structure by using a genetic algorithm with parametric finite element models. A steel-made supporting structure with two coherent fans installed on were analyzed. Experiments were conducted to obtain the source mobilities and free velocities of the coherent fans that are required for the calculation of <b>structure-borne</b> sound power transmission. Parametric finite element analysis was conducted to obtain the receiver mobility of the supporting structure. A genetic algorithm solved the optimal solution. The results shown that the proposed approach is sufficiently capable of minimizing the <b>structure-borne</b> sound power transmission on a supporting structure with coherent machines mounted on a supporting structure.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} ageing effect of {{mechanical}} joints reflecting from the tyre/joint impacting noise {{by measuring the}} vehicle <b>structure-borne</b> noise change. Field data is collected applying two measurement methods suitable for newly installed and existing old expansion joints. The measurement methodology is improved by designing and applying a trailer for equipment installation. The main advantage of this method is not to disturb existing traffic by lane closure for measurement. Field measurements were conducted regularly for a study period up to 16 months after new joint replacement to monitor the variation of the <b>structure-borne</b> noise change inside a test vehicle while passing through mechanical joints. Empirical relationship is developed based on the field data of the roadside airborne noise change and the vehicle <b>structure-borne</b> noise change. The roadside tyre/joint noises could be converted using calibrated empirical formula. Key result findings include the following. (1) The vehicle <b>structure-borne</b> noise change is found smallest during the 3 rd– 6 th months even lower than that measured when a new joint is installed.

40|$|Reduction of <b>structure-borne</b> {{noise in}} the {{compartment}} of a car is an important task in automotive engineering. Transfer path analysis using the vibroacoustic reciprocity technique or multiple path decomposition method has generally been used for <b>structure-borne</b> noise path analysis. These methods are useful for solving a particular problem, {{but they do not}} quantify the effectiveness of vibration isolation of each isolator of a vehicle. To quantify the effectiveness of vibration isolation, vibrational power flow has been used for a simple isolation system or a laboratory-based isolation system. It is often difficult to apply the vibrational power flow technique to a complex isolation system like a car. In this paper, a simple equation is derived for calculation of the vibrational power flow of an isolation system with multiple isolators such as a car. It is successfully applied not only to quantifying the relative contributions of eighteen isolators, but also to reducing the <b>structure-borne</b> noise of a passenger car.

40|$|Noise {{continues}} to be a significant factor in the development of wind energy resources. In the case of building-mounted wind turbines (BMWTs), in addition to the usual airborne sound there is the potential for occupants to be affected by <b>structure-borne</b> sound and vibration transmitted through the building structure. Usual methods for prediction and evaluation of noise from large and small WTs are not applicable to noise of this type. This letter describes an investigation aiming to derive a methodology for prediction of <b>structure-borne</b> sound and vibration inside attached dwellings. Jointly funded by three UK government departments, the work was motivated by a desire to stimulate renewable energy generation by the removal of planning restrictions where possible. A method for characterizing BMWTs as sources of <b>structure-borne</b> sound was first developed during a field survey of two small wind turbines under variable wind conditions. The 'source strength' was established as a function of rotor speed although a general relationship to wind speed could not be established. The influence of turbulence was also investigated. The prediction methodology, which also accounts for the sound transmission properties of the mast and supporting building, was verified in a field survey of existing installations. Significant differences in behavior and subjective character were noted between the airborne and <b>structure-borne</b> noise from BMWTs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Structure-borne</b> noise within vehicle {{structures}} {{is often}} transmitted in a multi-dimensional manner {{and thus the}} vibro-acoustic model(s) of automotive powertrain or chassis must incorporate longitudinal and transverse (flexural) motions {{as well as their}} couplings. In this article, we employ the continuous system theory to model a typical vibration isolator (say the engine mounting system) and a compliant receiver that could simulate the body structure. The powertrain source is however assumed to be rigid, and both harmonic force and moment excitations are considered. Our analysis is limited to a linear time-invariant system, and the frequency domain based mobility method is utilized to synthesize the overall system. Contributions of both in-plane and flexural motions to <b>structure-borne</b> and radiated noise are incorporated. Two examples are considered to illustrate the methodology. First, multi-dimensional transmissibility and effectiveness terms are analytically and comparatively evaluated along with vibration power-based measures for an inverted 'L' beam receiver and selected source configurations. Further, free field sound pressures are calculated and correlated with <b>structure-borne</b> power transmitted to the receiver. Second, sound measurements and predictions for an experimental inverted 'L ' plate receiver demonstrate that a rank order based on free field sound pressures may be regarded as a measure of <b>structure-borne</b> noise reduction.

40|$|In <b>structure-borne</b> sound {{problems}} in buildings, {{knowledge of the}} contact forces between vibrating equipment and a receiving element is often required. When multiplying these forces with the simultaneously measured velocities at the contact points of the equipment, the <b>structure-borne</b> sound power can be determined, which is the quantity governing the sound energy transfer from a source space to a receiving space. Measuring contact forces directly is however not straightforward. Therefore, a structural-acoustical method is {{used to determine the}} contact forces inversely. This technique is already used in the automotive industry, but applications in buildings are rather rare. The installation used is a vibrating platform, which induces tonal, low-frequency vibrations into the building. Therefore, the used sound source has to perform well for low frequencies. The resulting forces are used for <b>structure-borne</b> sound power calculation and verified by comparing the sound pressure, caused by this injected power, with measured sound pressure. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Vibrating {{sources in}} buildings, such as service equipment, {{elevators}} and electric devices, often {{cause a lot}} of noise because of the mechanical excitation of building elements (<b>structure-borne</b> sound). De draft standard prEN 12354 - 5 describes how the normalized sound pressure in a room can be calculated based on the injected <b>structure-borne</b> sound power of an installation in another room. Estimating this power is not simple, because both source properties (installation) as receiver properties (building element) play a role. The draft standard prEN 15657 - 1 delivers a method to do this for sources of which the mobility is much larger than the mobility of the receiving building element, therefore making a measurement of the source mobility unnecessary. In this method, the source is put into operation on a plate that is resiliently connected to the surroundings. The injected power in this so-called “reception plate” is then determined out of the <b>structure-borne</b> sound power in the diffuse velocity field of the plate. In this investigation, the injected <b>structure-borne</b> sound power by an operating fitness vibration plate into three different floors between two acoustical transmission rooms is determined via the reception plate method. The power is also calculated according to the more exact “mobility method”, that takes the source mobility into account.
