Is it a marriage contract or something else? Panofsky interprets the gesture as an act of fides, Latin for [...] "marital oath". He calls the representation of the couple [...] "qui desponsari videbantur per fidem" [...] which means, [...] "who were contracting their marriage by marital oath". The man is grasping the woman's right hand with his left which is the basis for the controversy. Some scholars like Jan Baptist Bedaux and Peter <b>Schabacker</b> argue that if this painting does show a marriage ceremony, then the use of the left hand points to the marriage being morganatic and not [...] A marriage is said to be morganatic if a man marries a woman of unequal rank. However, the subjects originally thought by most scholars to be represented in this painting, Giovanni Arnolfini and Giovanna Cenami, were of equal status and rank in the courtly system, so the theory would not hold true. On {{the opposite side of the}} debate are scholars like Margaret Carroll. She suggests that the painting deploys the imagery of a contract between an already married couple giving the wife the authority to act on her husband's behalf in business dealings. Carroll identifies Arnolfini's raised right hand as a gesture of oath-taking known as [...] "fidem levare", and his joining hands with his wife as a gesture of consent known as [...] "fides manualis".|$|E

The old route also followed current Fulton County Route 155 through Vail Mills where it overlaps briefly with NY 30 and continues into the village of Broadalbin. In Broadalbin, original NY 29 entered as West Main Street, turning right onto Mill Street, then left on Saratoga Avenue, leaving the village and meeting the current routing. East of Broadalbin, other original alignments included Stevers Mill Roads, Mueller Road, and Old State Road.

Some aspects of technical analysis {{began to appear in}} Amsterdam-based businessman Joseph de la Vega's accounts of the Dutch financial markets in the 17th century. In Asia, technical analysis {{is said to be a}} method developed by Homma Munehisa during the early 18th century which evolved into the use of candlestick techniques, and is today a technical analysis charting tool. In the 1920s and 1930s Richard W. <b>Schabacker</b> published several books which continued the work of Charles Dow and William Peter Hamilton in their books Stock Market Theory and Practice and Technical Market Analysis. In 1948 Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published Technical Analysis of Stock Trends which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline. It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts, because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of point and figure chart analysis.|$|E
