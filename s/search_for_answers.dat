A year later she started working on Ray of Light, her eighth studio album. Madonna wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard, Rick Nowels and Babyface. The album would reflect the singer's changed perspectives about life. Author Carol Benson noted that it was a [...] "deeply spiritual dance record", with the crux of it based on Madonna's career, her journey and the many identities she had assumed over the years. Motherhood had softened the singer emotionally, which was reflected in the songs. She started talking about ideas and used words which implied deep and personal thoughts, rather than the regular dance-floor anthemic tunes she had composed. The singer began introspecting herself with motherhood being a [...] "big catalyst for me.

500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna and American {{producer}} and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom {{she gave birth to}} in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. [...] "That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>answers</b> to questions I'd never asked myself before," [...] she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including [...] "Nothing Really Matters". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of [...] "Nothing Really Matters"'s music.

500|$|Following {{the release}} of her {{compilation}} album Something to Remember (1995), Madonna started taking vocal lessons in preparation {{for her role in}} Evita (1996). She also gave birth to her daughter, Lourdes, the same year. These events inspired a period of introspection. [...] "That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>answers</b> to questions I'd never asked myself before," [...] she said to Q magazine, in 2002. During the same period, she embraced Kabbalah and started studying Hinduism and yoga, all of which helped her [...] "step outside [...] and see the world from a different perspective." [...] Madonna felt that there was a [...] "whole piece" [...] of her voice left unused, which she decided to utilize for the album. By May 1997, Madonna had started writing songs for the album. She began collaborating with Babyface, who had first worked with her on her previous album Bedtime Stories. The two wrote a couple of songs together before Madonna decided the collaborations were not going in the musical direction she wanted for the album. According to Babyface, the songs [...] "had a 'Take a Bow-ish' kind of vibe, and Madonna didn't want, or need, to repeat herself." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2010, she {{was criticized}} after saying that {{breastfeeding}} should be law.

[...] Bündchen later posted a statement on her blog saying, [...] "My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding {{has nothing to do with}} the law.

2500|$|Arriving at the cave, Cornelius is {{intercepted by}} Dr. Zaius and his soldiers. Taylor holds them off, {{threatening}} to shoot them {{if he has}} to. Zaius agrees to enter the cave to disprove their theories and to avoid physical harm to Cornelius and Zira.

2500|$|The Mystery of the Sea {{has also}} been {{classified}} as a novel of science. Scholar Carol A. Senf has recognized connection between the Gothic strains of the novel and science, and while she does not explicitly classify The Mystery of the Sea as science fiction, she argues that the novel presents [...] "a world where both science and mystery can exist side by side" [...] and that [...] "Stoker has not totally abandoned Gothic mystery for scientific certainty". Senf traces the importance of technology—such as warships, revolvers, mechanisms used to explore the underground cave—to {{the events of the}} novel and the characters' efforts to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>answers,</b> and sees a juxtaposition between this technological impulse and characters such as Don Bernardino and Gormala, who are remnants of the Gothic. [...] Gormala, according to Senf, is a reminder of mystery and the unexplainable. While the Gothic and science are essentially opposing forces, the conflict between them is an important aspect of the atmosphere of Stoker's work. The scientific connection once more brings The Mystery of the Sea into a place in the literature of empire; Englishmen who were confident in the power of science and knowledge were in turn confident of the control they exerted around the world.|$|E
