50|$|Gross LGD is {{most popular}} amongst {{academics}} {{because of its}} simplicity and because academics only have access to bond market data, where collateral values often are unknown, uncalculated or irrelevant. Blanco LGD is popular amongst some practitioners (banks) because banks often have many secured facilities, and banks would like to decompose their losses between losses on unsecured portions and losses on <b>secured</b> <b>portions</b> due to depreciation of collateral quality. The latter calculation is also a subtle requirement of Basel II, but most banks are not sophisticated enough {{at this time to}} make those types of calculations.|$|R

[...] "I had always wanted to make a sculpture for the Churchill Memorial at Westminster," [...] Sandys said, [...] "and this seemed the perfect moment to do something. Friends in Berlin had come back with tiny little pieces of wall, and I thought, ‘Wouldn't it be great to make a sculpture.’ I thought I'd better go straight Berlin while there was some wall left."In 1990, with the support of Westminster College, Sandys and her husband, Richard Kaplan, had traveled to East Berlin to <b>secure</b> <b>portions</b> of the wall.

40|$|Abstract This study designs {{a natural}} field {{experiment}} {{linked to a}} controlled laboratory experiment to examine the effectiveness of matching gifts and challenge gifts, two popular strategies used to <b>secure</b> a <b>portion</b> of the $ 200 billion annually given to charities. We find evidence that challenge gifts positively influence contributions in the field, but matching gifts do not. Methodologically, we find important similarities and dissimilarities between behavior in the lab and the field. Overall, our results have clear implications for fundraisers and provide avenues for future empirical and theoretical work on charitable giving...|$|R

40|$|Smart Metering is an {{important}} component of Smart Grids. Detailed load profiles are available through smart metering at a high resolution. Load profiles allow inferring detailed information on the end user by non-intrusive load monitoring. Therefore, these load profiles need to be regarded as sensitive data, and treated with security and privacy in mind. We propose a method that allows conditional access to different resolution levels of the load data, allowing access on a “need-to-know ” basis only. For this purpose, a multiresolution representation of the load data is created using the simple Haar wavelet transform. <b>Securing</b> the <b>portions</b> of the wavelet representation pertaining to each resolution with a unique key allows to implement conditional access for smart meter data...|$|R
