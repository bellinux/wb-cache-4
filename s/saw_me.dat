I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
25|$|His {{success in}} {{containing}} the Maw threat gave Swa additional leeway {{to deal with}} other issues. In 1373, Swa sided with an Arakanese (Rakhine) faction over the recently vacated Arakense throne at Launggyet. Swa's nominee, his uncle Saw Mon II proved an able ruler and ruled Arakan {{until his death in}} 1380/81 (or 1383/84). This time, Swa sent <b>Saw</b> <b>Me,</b> governor of Talok and one of his long-serving loyalists, to Arakan. But <b>Saw</b> <b>Me</b> proved to be a tyrant and was driven out of Arakan in 1385/86. Swa chose not respond as his attention was now focused on Pegu. Ava would return to Arakan and finish off the Launggyet dynasty in 1406.|$|E

The authorities exiled him to the village of Ovčarevo, near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan monks. Andrić soon befriended the friar Alojzije Perčinlić and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule. Andrić lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andrić's mother soon came to see her son, and offered to serve as a housekeeper for the parish priest. [...] "Mother is very happy," [...] Andrić wrote.

500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions."

500|$|... "Half of Me" [...] is {{a chamber}} pop and R song which lasts for a {{duration}} of three minutes and twelve seconds. The line [...] "You <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> on the television" [...] {{is a possible}} reference to her interview with Oprah Winfrey after her boyfriend, Chris Brown assaulted her. Christina Lee for Idolator thought that {{this is because of}} how Rihanna's popularity and personal life combined with her [...] "paparazzi-documented interactions" [...] with Brown has generated headlines and news stories around the world. [...] "Half of Me" [...] can be interpreted as a [...] "personal essay" [...] rather than just a song. Stacy-Ann Ellis for Vibe noted that the singer appears to have improved her vocals with regard to [...] "experimentation", which she cites as being evident on [...] "Half of Me", as well as [...] "Diamonds" [...] and [...] "Stay". Ellis also noted that co-writer Emeli Sandé's [...] "candid and immediate charm" [...] is present on the song, and described it as the [...] "perfect" [...] ending to the album. Concluding her opinion of the song, Ellis wrote that [...] "Half of Me" [...] is delivered in a [...] "firm and steady voice" [...] which is filled with irony, as she feels that Rihanna is saying no one truly knows who she is and that is half the fun of working her out, but is in no way [...] "remorseful" [...] about letting people in completely: ...|$|E
500|$|While Mr. Eko {{was created}} as a more passive character, the idea changed when the {{producers}} first saw Akinnuoye-Agbaje play the character. Akinnuoye-Agbaje explained: [...] "once they <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> on the screen without a shirt, all 6 foot 2 and using a stick beating three guys up, they knew this guy wasn't {{going to be just}} a passive priest". Eventually, Cuse and Lindelof decided to combine their original idea for the character with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character on Oz. Originally, the character was named [...] "Emeka", and later [...] "Omecca", but after Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast, the name was changed to [...] "Eko", in order to be consistent with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's own Nigerian tribal lineage. Eko refers to the City of Legos (Lagos) in Nigeria, coming from Eleko, Lord of Lagos. Adding [...] "Mr." [...] in front of the character's name was also a suggestion made by Akinnuoye-Agbaje. While at first Cuse and Lindelof thought this was [...] "the silliest thing in the world", they changed their minds after repeating the name a few times, realizing there [...] "was something really cool about it". The character first appeared in [...] "Adrift", where he was only shown briefly, knocking down three of the show's main characters with a stick. Akinnuoye-Agbaje was given the stick and told to [...] "knock those three guys out". Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt [...] "there's no better way to make an entrance". The religious scripture on the stick was a suggestion of Akinnuoye-Agbaje.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{increasingly}} {{expanded his}} social circle {{to include a}} mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. Smile was the album projected to follow Pet Sounds. This time, Wilson worked with Van Dyke Parks, whose surreal and oblique lyrics led Love to adopt the term [...] "acid alliteration" [...] when describing them. Love says that he [...] "wasn't resistant to ... I mean, crazy stupid sounds, like animals, farmyard sounds, did all that shit, laying {{in the bottom of}} an empty pool, singing up at the mic. I did all that stuff. ... I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on Smile." [...] Capitol was not interested in Wilson's newest ideas for forthcoming projects, such as an album of found sounds, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was [...] "the most receptive" [...] to the idea, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound [...] "best friend" [...] David Anderle {{as the head of the}} label—despite the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo. By December 1966, Wilson [...] completed much of the album's backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from a month-long tour of Europe, they were confused by the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him. As Gaines writes, Anderle now appeared as the leader of [...] "a whole group of strangers [...] had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys." [...] Anderle had been encouraging Wilson to leave the group, and he was [...] "sure they <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> as somebody ... who was fueling Brian's weirdness.
