5|$|The only soundtrack album {{released}} for {{the game}} was Xenosaga III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, an album of <b>selections</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack rather {{than all of the}} tracks. The two-disc album has 40 tracks, and a total length of 1:51:46. It was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album reached position #50 on the Japanese Oricon charts, and stayed on the charts for four weeks. In the liner notes for the album, sound producer Keiichi Nozaki explains that the album would have needed to be six discs long to hold all of the music from the game, so he asked Kajiura to select a sample that would only fill two discs.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Episode III was {{composed}} by Yuki Kajiura. Having previous {{contributed to the}} score of Episode II by composing the cimenatic tracks, Kajiura was brought back to compose the entire score. Despite the increased work load of handling an entire game's soundtrack, Kajiura found the difficulty similar to the work she did on Episode II. She drew inspiration from the game's artwork and impression of the setting when creating the score. Takahashi, {{in addition to his}} other roles in production, acted as coordinator for the score. A soundtrack album titled Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, featuring <b>selections</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game's score, was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album's brevity was {{due to the fact that}} the full soundtrack would have taken up six CDs, and so Kajiura was asked by sound producer Keiichi Nozaki to create samples for a two-disc release.|$|E
