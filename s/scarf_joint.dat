The analyses of the experimental data allowed the assessment of the mechanical properties of the laminated Iroko wood as well as the influence of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints.</b> The experimental results demonstrated that the presence of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> only affect the strength of the glued laminate, while the stiffness properties in terms of Young modulus in bending and shear modulus, obtained applying the “method of variable support span”, remain essentially the same. The investigated laminates have been also analysed using a 3 D computed tomography and an ultrasonic phased array equipment in order to assess the dimensions of possible defects or voids in the adhesive and the dynamic modulus of elasticity. The tomographic measurements of the glue thickness explained the reason of the reduced strength of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joints,</b> due to the inhomogeneity of the glue bond-line. The value of the dynamic modulus of elasticity, obtained by the ultrasonic technique, is slightly higher than the value of the modulus of elasticity obtained by the bending tests.

50|$|Determination of {{the maximum}} axial force for two pieces joined by {{adhesive}} can easily be determined using two equations that {{can be derived from}} the geometry of the problem by breaking the axial force component into a tensile force and shear force normal and parallel to the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint.</b> Shear strength is assumed to be equal to σ/2. The following equations need to be adjusted if the shear strength is greater than σ/2. The two equations that give a maximum axial force are F=σ/sin(α)^2 and F=σ/sin(2α), where α is the angle from the horizontal to the joint. Both should be evaluated for a given problem, and the smaller F of the two is the magnitude {{of the maximum}} allowable axial force. The first equation accounts for failure in tension. The second equation accounts for failure in shear. Some special angles should be noted or the graphs of two equations should be compared on the same plot. The joint is weakest at α=90° due to tension limits and 45° due to shear limits. However, α=45° will be stronger than α=90° if shear strength is greater than σ/2. The joint is strongest between these two angles at 63.4°. The joint becomes stronger than 63.4° at 25.4°. At a shallow enough angle, strength of the joint continues to increase and failure will occur anywhere in the two pieces, possibly outside the joint.|$|E

5000|$|Plywood {{offers the}} builder a better [...] "plank", far wider, thinner, and {{stronger}} than a simple wood plank. Ply is normally produced in 4' × 8' (1.2 m × 2.4 m) sheets or similar. It is normally joined lengthwise by an 1:8 <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> using epoxy resin glue. A chined hull built out of plywood will often be designed to keep most of the lengthwise joints between the plywood sheets at the chines, thus making the building process easier. While chine logs (often just called chines) {{can be used for}} plywood boats, another common technique replaces the chine logs with a fiberglass and epoxy fillet joint that provides both connection and stiffness to the joint; this method is most commonly called stitch and glue construction. The result of the stitch and glue operation is a composite [...] "chine log" [...] with a much greater degree of flexibility in curvature and shape than is possible with a wooden chine log. Thinner ply panels, especially 4 mm, can be warped into compound bends to achieve arc bottom boats. This has the benefit of giving a more rounded section, with more displacement and in theory slightly higher speed. Additionally the bent ply is far stiffer than a flat ply panel, so needs less internal support, in the hull, in the form of frames or stringers. This further reduces weight giving a significant boost in performance and by clever design can be used to create a shape closer in appearance to a rounded hull but at far less cost.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scarf</b> <b>joints</b> are an {{effective}} method of bonding thick composite laminates for {{applications such as}} the repair of composite aircraft structures. However, concerns remain about their damage tolerance characteristics. Typically composite scarf repairs to aircraft structures require use of hand tools or rudimentary jigs. If the scarf is incorrectly prepared, this may cause a profile deviation to the joint, affecting the bond line stresses and in turn, reducing the residual strength of the joint or repair. The subject of this work examined the sensitivity of composite <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> to machining profile deviation and artificial disbond, when subject to static tensile load. Tensile test specimens were prepared with two different configurations of scarf for representing an undercut or imprecise scarf typical of a machining error.

40|$|A {{prominent}} critical {{problem with}} the use of adhesively bonded composite <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> in aircraft structures is their susceptibility to unpredictable failure. Any efficient and robust design approach for adhesively bonded scarf joints under fatigue loading should account for the damage mechanisms in the joint and this cannot be achieved without understanding damage development with initiation and propagation. Research into damage development using methodical approach were conducted on the stiffness of polymer adhesively bonded composite <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> since it is the prime physical parameter that can be measured most accurately. The research produced significant new knowledge of damage development under fatigue as strain hardening and a methodology to characterize damage initiation and propagation in adhesively bonded joints. Under uninterrupted fatigue, stiffness degradation and plasticity effects led to strain hardening of the joint adhesive until failure. But there was in-homogenous stiffness degradation in regions within the joint due to defects and anomalies so that the general stiffness degradation of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> could be either a stiffness increase or decrease to failure. The changes in the rate of stiffness over the fatigue life of a <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> reveal three characteristic regions. Region I &amp; II marked the damage initiation life of scarf joints and this was (66 ± 9) % of the fatigue life for specimens tested, and Region III marked the onset of damage propagation to failure.

It is shown that the damage initiation &amp; propagation life under variable and constant fatigue loading for scarf joints is independent of the adhesive thickness, the fatigue load application frequency, and the severity of the applied load.

40|$|A {{request of}} {{material}} change when performing repairs on composite parts of SAABs JAS 39 Gripen has {{lead to the}} initiation of this project. The aim {{is to create a}} quicker and more robust repair method. The requested method of repair is to use a direct-cured repair patch made of CFRP fabric instead of CFRP tape and to mount the patch with a <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> see Figure 1. 1. The fabric patch should then provide a robust quasi-isotropic repair, where the operator not is dependent of complete design data such as ply-directions etc. Today tape repairs are made on tape laminate and fabric repairs made on fabric laminate. The new method is to repair tape laminate with a fabric patch. This project will evaluate the possibility of implementing this method. The work started with a literature study to find out how repairs in composite parts of the airframe are being performed today. SAABs in-house analytical tools were then used to try to predict the results and examine some of the details in the questions at issue. Finite element models were then constructed to simulate a previous physical test program conducted to validate a repair method using a step joint and a direct-cured repair patch. If the FE models could show similar results as the physical tests the results from the FE models then can be assumed to be credible. The results of this project indicate that the change from fabric to tape in the repair patch can be done without disturbing the load path of a quasi isotropic composite laminate. Fabric repairs in orthotropic composite plates results in a knock-down of about 40 %. The use of a <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> instead of a step joint should also work well as the repair patches show similar strains in the centre of the patches. The difference between step joint and <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> is the strain {{near the edge of the}} patch. It increases with <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> and it may lead to an earlier fibre failure in the repair patch.

30|$|The most used joint {{types are}} SLJ, DLJ, stepped-lap <b>joints</b> and <b>scarf</b> <b>joints.</b> Undoubtedly, the SLJ {{is the most}} studied joint type due to the easy {{fabrication}} process, although the efficiency averaged to the bonded length is the worst between the mentioned joint types [15, 16]. DLJ are also simple to fabricate {{but there is a}} need to have access to both sides of the structures to perform these joints. However, the efficiency of this joint is much higher than that of the SLJ because of duplicating the shear-resistant area for the same LO [17]. Stepped-lap and <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> have an improved overall performance for the same bonded area, but the components to be bonded need milling operations, which makes the joints more demanding to fabricate [18, 19].|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} investigations of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> indicate that slight bluntness of adherend tips induces adhesive stress concentrations which significantly reduce joint strength, and the stress distribution through the adhesive thickness is non-uniform and has significant stress concentrations {{at the ends}} of the joint.

30|$|In this work, an {{experimental}} and numerical (CZM) comparison was made between {{several types of}} adhesive joints, and considering three adhesives. From the experimentally obtained results, {{it is possible to}} conclude that the performance of the joints is very influenced by the choice of the adhesive. For the Araldite® AV 138 and large values of LO, the joint with the best performance was the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> because the this joint takes advantage of the adhesives’ strength, even for brittle adhesives, due to the typically flat stress distributions. However, for shorter LO, due the area effect in the DLJ, these joints behave better. Higher LO lead to large peak stresses and the area effect is cancelled because of the adhesive’s brittleness. On the other hand, for the Araldite® 2015, since this adhesive is more ductile, the DLJ performs best. Under these conditions, the joints take advantage of the higher bonded area, despite the peak stresses. The <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> approaches the DLJ for higher LO because of taking advantage of the more uniform stress distributions and due the DLJ attaining the adherends’ limit strength. The Sikaforce® 7752 also performs best in the DLJ joint type. Moreover, for LO[*]=[*] 50  mm, Pm is identical to the Araldite® 2015 due to the adherends’ plastic deformation effect. The other joint types are much below the DLJ, with slight advantage for the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint.</b> However, the fabrication complications may not justify the advantage over the SLJ. The CZM simulations with triangular cohesive laws showed a good match to respective experiments, except for consistent Pm under predictions when using the Sikaforce® 7752, because of the ductility of this adhesive, which is not correctly modelled with a triangular CZM. Nonetheless, rough predictions were achieved. The <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> showed slightly better strength predictions by CZM modelling. Actually, due to the improved stress distributions of this joint type, the cohesive strengths rule the failure process, instead of the failure displacements. The maximum errors obtained by joint type were as follows, always for the Sikaforce® 7752 : 16.0 % (SLJ), 15.6 % (DLJ), 13.9 % (stepped-lap joint) and 12.7 % (<b>scarf</b> <b>joint).</b> For the other adhesives, the correspondence was significantly better. Thus, it can be concluded that CZM is an accurate tool for the strength prediction of bonded joints, which enabled to define the best geometry for each adhesive type (and vice versa).|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites as a primary structural material leads to a need for repairs of such structures. One such repair method is the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> an adhesive joint that allows for the original surface profile of a structure to be maintained. Studies of scarf joints have primarily considered an idealized version of the configuration, whereas there will be imperfections that arise during manufacture and installation of a real <b>scarf</b> <b>joint.</b> Parametric studies that consider <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> configurations have generally considered only the linear behavior of the adhesive material, although adhesive materials typically have large nonlinear capability. Finally, in studies of scarf joints, only the stress state in the adhesive tends to be considered. In this work, the stress and strain states in both the adherends and in the adhesive are studied for imperfect scarf joints via finite element analyses. Seven parameters that characterize different imperfections, with two to four values each, are studied and compared to the baseline configuration, which is an idealized <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> for the case of linear behavior of the adhesive. One to two values of each parameter are studied for the case of nonlinear behavior of the adhesive. The parameters investigated are tip bluntness, through-thickness patch offset, mismatched adherend thickness, mismatched scarf angle, adhesive thickness variation, rotated patch adherend, and delamination in the patch. The imperfections are applied {{to one of the}} adherends. The resulting strains of the different configurations are presented for the adhesive and adherends. The yield progressions are presented for the nonlinear behavior. Results show that the nonlinear behavior case can be estimated from the results of the linear behavior. The onset of yield occurs at the location of maximum strain and is primarily associated with shear strain. The yield typically occurs at the sharp adherend tip, and failure typically coincides with the location of the onset of yield. The full nonlinear behavior of the adhesive needs to be considered for any complete study of failure. The effects of imperfections are both local and global in nature for the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> configuration. There is an effect on the global strain response as a result of load eccentricity due to asymmetry that leads to bending and other overall equilibrium considerations, while local effects are manifested in the strain fields near the imperfection. The tip bluntness parameter, adherend rotation parameter, and delamination parameter are found to have the most significant effects on the response of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> configuration in both the adhesive and adherend due to the specifics of the local strain field due to the imperfections. All other parameters have reduced effects on the behavior that are a result of global bending and resulting changes in the overall length of the joint. Key lengthscales are identified for imperfections and for overall joint behavior. Recommendations for further work are presented. by Holly K. Jeffrey. Thesis: Ph.

The CZM predictions were very accurate, and they were always inside the experimental scatter, except for LO[*]=[*] 17.0  mm (α[*]=[*] 10 °) and LO[*]=[*] 5.2  mm (α[*]=[*] 30 °). The maximum error was found for the latter of these two, of 5.8 %. The good agreement extends to the Araldite® 2015. For this adhesive, the biggest discrepancy, of 8.0 %, was found for LO[*]=[*] 5.2  mm (α[*]=[*] 30 °). Moreover, only in this case was the numerical value outside of the experimental range (by approximately 130  N). For the other LO, much smaller deviations were found. The numerical Pm values for the <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> bonded with the Sikaforce® 7752 were typically below the experimental ones and outside the limits defined by the standard deviation. The maximum error was 12.7 % for LO[*]=[*] 17.0  mm (α[*]=[*] 10 °). The reasons for this difference were already discussed. However, due to the more uniform stress distributions for the <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> (Figs.  9, 10), the under prediction is smaller, since the failure displacement of the CZM laws is not as preponderant as the cohesive strengths [32]. Also due to the typical shape of the stress distributions, the strong yet brittle Araldite® AV 138 is clearly the best choice since, under these conditions, the ductility becomes almost irrelevant for Pm.|$|R
