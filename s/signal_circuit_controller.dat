40|$|The {{usage of}} {{electrical}} power {{at home is}} something that always occurred in our life {{and it was a}} necessary to manage it in a systematic way to ensure the system operate in intelligent mode. In United State when users at home turn on the electrical appliances in peak time which contribute to the exceeding of limit power drop causing them to be charge in expensive rate. The purpose of this project is to design a control system at home to meet the objectives of monitoring the consumption’s rate of power, voltage level, current level, and turn on or off appliance through a computer. Methodology in implement this system could be categorized into software development and hardware design. The software develops based on graphical user interface in MATLAB 7. 1 which is interface with hardware that used MC 68 HC 11 as controller through serial communication. The hardware involves three stages which are <b>signal</b> conditioning <b>circuit,</b> <b>controller</b> and interfacing <b>circuit.</b> Operation of the hardware is started from <b>signal</b> conditioning <b>circuit</b> where voltage and current convert into voltage representation in range of 0 V to 5 V in order to fit the analog to digital converter (ADC) port at microcontroller. Voltage level of 240 Vrms need to be step down using voltage transformer and current measured by current transformer which is producing small voltage level and required amplification. Then microcontroller computes the power consumption and rms value of current and voltage and display at liquid crystal display (LCD). At the same time the microcontroller send the results of conversion of ADC to personel computer (PC) through serial communication. The application of organizing the energy could be seem when appliance also able to be control from GUI and also from external switch. Besides that, warning indicator at LCD exhibit when voltage and current level exceed certain limit and the limiting level could be determine from entering rms value at GUI. With the ability of manage of some certain characteristics of home’s electrical power supply it will produce a systematic system in organizing our energy...|$|R

40|$|PATHiPRED: {{prediction}} models {{using the}} activation status of stimulus-response <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits.</b> Abstract: <b>Signaling</b> pathways provide a formal {{representation of the}} processes by which the cell triggers actions in response to particular stimulus through a network of intermediate gene products. Consequently, sub-networks corresponding to stimulus-response circuits can directly be related to cell functionalities. Some recent pathway topology based methods focus particularly on the estimation of the activity of stimulus-response <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> from gene expression data [1, 2]. Here, we present PATHiPRED web tool that takes advantage of changes detected in the activity of stimulus-response <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> for predictive purposes. The activation status of elementary components of signaling pathways are rich-informative biomarkers that {{can be linked to}} specific cell functionalities and provide mechanistic explanations for the molecular basis of complex traits. A major challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases is to identify relevant alterations in the biological pathway activities and discover their relationship to the disease. Using stimulus-response <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> to distinguish between two classes, such as control and disease samples, or continuous variables, such as drug activity, would improve our understanding of complex phenotypes. PATHiPRED uses the probability of activation of stimulus-response <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> obtained with PATHiWAYS methodology [2] to compute a pathway-based classifier for either two classes or continuous variables.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that autocrine signaling through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) might be involved in generating or maintaining an intrinsic polarity in tissue cells, possibly via spatial localization of EGFR-mediated signaling. The difficulty of experimental investigation of autocrine signaling makes especially valuable an application of computational modeling for critical hypotheses about the dynamic operation of the underlying <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits,</b> both intracellular and extracellular. Toward this end, we develop and analyze here a spatially distributed dynamic computational model of autocrine EGFR signaling. Under certain conditions, the model spontaneously evolves into a state wherein sustained signaling is spatially localized on smaller than cell dimension, conferring a polarity to the otherwise nonpolar model cell. Conditions of a sufficiently large rate of autocrine EGFR ligand release and of a sufficiently small exogenous ligand concentration are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations of EGFR-mediated migration. Thus, computational analysis supports the concept that autocrine EGFR <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> could play a role in helping generate and/or maintain an intrinsic cell spatial polarity, possibly related to migration as well as tissue organization. We additionally offer particular suggestions for critical nodes in the EGFR <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> governing this self-organization capability...|$|R
