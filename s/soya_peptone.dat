40|$|Background: The {{optimization}} of bioprocess conditions towards improved {{growth profile}} and productivity yield is considered {{of great importance}} in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Peptones as efficient sources of nutrients have been studied for their effect on media development; however, their role on metabolic pathway is not well understood. Methods: In the present study, the effect of different concentration of peptones on a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line grown in three serum-free suspension cultures was determined. Six peptones of different origins and available amino acid profiles were investigated regarding their impact on cell growth, productivity, and metabolic pathways changes. Results: In optimized feeding strategies, increases of 136 % and 159 % in volumetric productivity (for a low-nutrient culture media) and 55 % (for a high-nutrient culture media) were achieved. Furthermore, particular sources of peptones with specific amino acid profile developed preferential results for each different culture medium. Two <b>peptones,</b> <b>SoyA</b> 2 SC and SoyE- 110, were the only hydrolysates that showed production improvement in all three media. Casein Peptone plus Tryptone N 1 and SoyA 3 SC showed different improved results based on their implemented concentration for each individual basal medium. Conclusion: The amino acid profile of peptones may provide clues to identify the most effective feeding strategies for recombinant CHO cells. Iran. Biomed. J. 19 (4) : 194 - 205, 201...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: A major {{objective}} in endodontic therapy is to disinfect the root canal system prior to obturation. This {{is because the}} residual root canal infection can sustain persistent or recurrent periapical disease. Hence, {{the use of an}} intracanal medicament between appointments helps in the elimination of bacteria that remain even after cleaning and shaping. The objective of this in vitro study is to compare the antibacterial efficacy of 10 % metronidazole gel, 2 % chlorhexidine (CHX) gel, and a combination of calcium hydroxide and 2 % CHX gel against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) using a culture technique. Materials and Methods: The study included 40 single-rooted, human permanent teeth, -extracted for periodontal or other reasons. Conventional access to the root canals was obtained using access preparation burs in a high speed handpiece. The working length was determined using the Ingle′s radiographic method and the canals were instrumented using a Step-back technique with K-files, up to size 40, at the apex and irrigated with 1 ml of 2. 5 % Sodium hypochlorite and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid gel. The root canals were filled with a sterile Casein <b>Soya</b> meal <b>peptone</b> solution (CSL) and autoclaved twice for 30 minutes at 121 °C. An inoculum of E. faecalis was injected into the canals using a sterile syringe and it was incubated aerobically at 37 °C for nine days. The specimens were then randomly divided into three experimental groups (10 % metronidazole gel, 2 % CHX gel, and a combination of calcium hydroxide and 2 % CHX gel) and one control group, each containing 10 samples. Following this, the canals were cleaned using an ultrasonically activated No. 15 K-file, along with sodium -hypochlorite irrigation. After medicament removal, each root canal was prepared manually with a new size 40 hedstrom file. The colony forming units per millimeter were determined by the standard laboratory methods. The obtained data was subjected to statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney test and the χ 2 test. Results: In our study, Group II (2 % CHX gel) showed significant reduction of E. faecalis. Group I (10 % metronidazole gel) showed minimal -reduction, and Group III (2 % CHX gel with calcium hydroxide) showed moderate -reduction. There was no -reduction in observed in Group IV (control group) patients. Conclusion: Our study -signifies that 2 % CHX gel showed substantial antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis. The -combination of calcium hydroxide and 2 % CHX gel also showed good -antimicrobial activity. Hence, the efficacy of 2 % CHX gel was greater than its -combination with -calcium hydroxide. The least effective drug against the microbes was metronidazole...|$|R

40|$|Rapid, {{sensitive}} and selective detection and identification of pathogens {{is required in}} the prevention and recognition of problems related to food security. Salmonella {{is one of the}} dangerous foodborne pathogens. The identification of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by Salmonella may contribute in providing a fast and accurate detection method for Salmonella in food samples. In this study, VOCs liberated by Salmonella strains have been identified and quantified via head space-solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-SPME GC/MS). The dominant chemical class of volatiles liberated from Salmonella strains was alcohol compounds. In addition, ester and ketone compounds were also detected. The most sensitive VOCs detected were ethyl octanoate (LOD = 62. 0 ng/mL and LOQ = 207 ng/mL) and ethyl decanoate (LOD = 66 ng/mL and LOQ = 219 ng/mL) with the lowest LOD and LOQ when using Rappaport-Vassiliadis <b>Soya</b> <b>peptone</b> (RVS) broth media and polar SPME fiber with polar GC column. The type of culture medium was found to affect the liberated VOCs. For example, 2 -heptanone was not detected when S. london and S. stanley were grown in TSB but they were detected and quantified when using BHI as growth media. Also, 1 -octanol was detected and quantified in all strains when Salmonella grown in TSB and BHI, and did not detected in all strains when RVS was used as growth media. The research has been extended to include the addition of specific enzyme substrates to the culture medium (RVS). The enzyme substrates are either commercially available or have been synthesised to allow exogenous VOC detection. The specific enzymes targeted in Salmonella were α-galactosidase, C- 8 esterase and pyrrolidonyl peptidase. The enzyme substrates used are phenyl α-D-galactopyranoside, 2 -chlorophenyl octanoate and L-pyrrollidonyl fluoroanilide respectively. All, except pyrrolidonyl peptidase, are known to give a positive response to Salmonella. This developed methodology was initially applied to pure cultures of S. stanley to evaluate the feasibility of the approach. The developed approach shows potential for future application in food samples to detect and identify Salmonella species in food samples of a level as low as 100 CFU /mL within a 5 h incubation at 37 ºC by the detection of the liberated VOCs. Subsequently the methodology was applied to a range of food samples (milk, cheese, eggs and chicken). It was found that all food samples were Salmonella free; however, false positive was detected due to the presence of other pathogens in the food samples. Inhibition of some of these pathogens in milk and cheese samples was achieved with the addition of 5 mg / L vancomycin and 10 mg / L of novobiocin. To improve the method specificity, it was necessary to deviate from the standard method and use Salmonella selective RVS broth in pre-enrichment step than using non selective one (BPW). This results in a successful detection of Salmonella contamination on milk samples and cheddar cheese samples. However, failed in detect Salmonella in other cheeses. Inhibition of resistant pathogens (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. Thermophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Enterococcus faecalis) using another combination of selective agents (vancomycin 10 mg /L, novobiocin 10 mg /L, erythromycin 0. 75 mg /L and lithium chloride 15 g/ L) failed. This study highlighted the benefits of the use of specific enzyme substrates along with antibiotics into Salmonella VOC analysis to improve the specificity of Salmonella detection method. The results of VOC analysis of specific enzymes inherent within Salmonella could be extended to develop a selective portable sensor approach to be used in food production...|$|E
