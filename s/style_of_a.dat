The south-west wing, 'behind' the original house, used the different architectural <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Victorian villa for the two-storey addition.

5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> master from those of his apprentices.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} art {{featured on}} the game's box art and instruction manual is in the <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comic book, and the characters are portrayed as toy dolls that come to life to fight.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings play with the voices in motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add the <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E

Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, provided financial incentives for the shoot.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was officially}} {{invested}} as Prince of Wales {{in a special}} ceremony at Caernarfon Castle on 13 July 1911. The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician David Lloyd George, Constable of the Castle and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Liberal government. Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony in the <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.|$|E
5|$|Fame was {{the last}} musical film to be {{produced}} by MGM, before the studio merged with United Artists in 1981. The film has been credited with revitalizing the teen musical subgenre by adding dramatic elements into its story, echoing 1950s melodramas. Its presentation of musical numbers in the <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> music video—through the use of quick cuts with multiple angles and crowded, kinetic frames—was {{a major influence on}} other 1980s films in the dance film genre, such as Flashdance (1983), Footloose (1984) and Dirty Dancing (1987). It also inspired the creation of many similar performing arts schools around the world—notably the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA)— and popularized the use of leg warmers.|$|E
