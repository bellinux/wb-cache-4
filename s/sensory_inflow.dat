40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine and the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor antagonist bicuculline reduced the rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep-specific inhibition of <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> via the dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT). These findings imply that the spinal release of glycine and GABA may be due directly to the REM sleep-specific activation of reticulospinal neurons and/or glutamate-activated last-order spinal interneurons. This study used in vivo microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis techniques to provide evidence for these possibilities. Microdialysis probes were stereotaxically positioned in the L 3 spinal cord gray matter corresponding to sites where maximal cerebellar-evoked field potentials or individual DSCT and nearby spinoreticular tract (SRT) neurons could be recorded. Glutamate, glycine, and GABA levels significantly increased during REM sleep by approximately 48, 48, and 14 %, respectively, compared with the control state of wakefulness. In contrast, dopamine levels significantly decreased by about 28 % during REM sleep compared with wakefulness. During the state of wakefulness, electrical stimulation of the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (NRGc) at intensities sufficient to inhibit DSCT neuron activity, also significantly increased glutamate and glycine levels by about 69 and 45 %, respectively, but not GABA or dopamine levels. We suggest that the reciprocal changes in the release of glutamate, glycine, and GABA versus dopamine during REM sleep contribute to the reduction of <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> to higher brain centers via the DSCT and nearby SRT during this behavioral state. The neural pathways involved in this process likely include reticulo- and diencephalospinal and spinal interneurons...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper investigates how the {{efficiency}} and robustness of a skilled rhythmic task compete {{against each other in}} the control of a bimanual movement. Human subjects juggled a puck in 2 D through impacts with two metallic arms, requiring rhythmic bimanual actuation. The arms kinematics were only constrained by the position, velocity and time of impacts {{while the rest of the}} trajectory did not influence the movement of the puck. In order to expose the task robustness, we manipulated the task context in two distinct manners: the task tempo was assigned at four different values (hence manipulating the time available to plan and execute each impact movement individually); and vision was withdrawn during half of the trials (hence reducing the <b>sensory</b> <b>inflows).</b> We show that when the tempo was fast, the actuation was rhythmic (no pause in the trajectory) while at slow tempo, the actuation was discrete (with pause intervals between individual movements). Moreover, the withdrawal of visual information encouraged the rhythmic behavior at the four tested tempi. The discrete versus rhythmic behavior give different answers to {{the efficiency}}/robustness trade-off: discrete movements result in energy efficient movements, while rhythmic movements impact the puck with negative acceleration, a property preserving robustness. Moreover, we report that in all conditions the impact velocity of the arms was negatively correlated with the energy of the puck. This correlation tended to stabilize the task and was influenced by vision, revealing again different control strategies. In conclusion, this task involves different modes of control that balance efficiency and robustness, depending on the context...|$|R
40|$|Movements are {{necessary}} to engage the world, but every movement results in sensorimotor ambiguity. Self-movements cause changes to <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> as well as changes in the positions of objects relative to motor effectors (eyes and limbs). Hence the brain needs to monitor self-movements, and one way this is accomplished is by routing copies of movement commands to appropriate structures. These signals, known as corollary discharge (CD), enable compensation for sensory consequences of movement and preemptive updating of spatial representations. Such operations occur with a speed and accuracy that implies a reliance on prediction. Here we review recent CD studies and find that they arrive at a shared conclusion: CD contributes to prediction {{for the sake of}} sensorimotor harmony...|$|E

The state estimator based on Kalman filtering is allowed {{to take into account the}} current feedback to compute the current state estimate. The optimal feedback control process is adapted accordingly. The resulting estimation error is smaller than the estimation error obtained when the current state must be predicted based on the last feedback signal, which reduces variability of the simulated trajectories.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies of}} human speech motor {{learning}} suggest that learning {{is accompanied by}} changes in auditory perception. But what drives the perceptual change?

Here, subjects participated in a speech motor-learning task involving adaptation to altered auditory feedback and they were subsequently tested for perceptual change. In two separate experiments, involving two different auditory perceptual continua, we show that changes in the speech motor system that accompany learning drive changes in auditory speech perception. Specifically, we obtained changes in speech perception when adaptation to altered auditory feedback led to speech production that fell into the phonetic range of the speech perceptual tests. However, a similar change in perception was not observed when the auditory feedback that subjects' received during learning fell into the phonetic range of the perceptual tests. This indicates that the central motor outflow associated with vocal sensorimotor adaptation drives changes to the perceptual classification of speech sounds...|$|E

The neurones' central projections {{in and around}} the medial ventral tract were examined with electron microscopy. Most synapses occur on axon collaterals which ramify through the neuropile around the tract where both input and output synapses were observed. Serial sectioning methods were used to determine the relative distribution of inputs and outputs which often lie in close proximity to one another on the axon terminals. The prosternai hair terminals contain agranular synaptic vesicles approximately 37 nm in diameter. Surrounding unidentified neuropilar profiles contain vesicles which are either statistically indistinguishable in size, or are larger, 45 nm diameter agranular vesicles. Neurones which are pre- or postsynaptic to labelled terminals generally contain vesicles of the second type.

40|$|Non-technical summary Neural {{activity}} {{in parts of}} the cerebral cortex related to movement oscillates at frequencies around 20 Hz. These oscillations are correlated with similar rhythms in contracting muscles {{on the opposite side of}} the body. In this work, we used an analysis method called directed coherence to investigate the direction of oscillatory coupling. We find that oscillations travel not only from cortex to muscle (as expected for a motor command), but also back from muscle to cortex (reflecting sensory input). This oscillatory loop may allow the cortex to measure features of the limb state, integrating <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> with the motor command. Abstract Corticomuscular coherence in the beta frequency band (15 – 30 Hz) has been demonstrated in both humans and monkeys, but its origin and functional role are still unclear. Phase–frequency plots produced by traditional coherence analysis are often complex. Some subjects show a clear linear phase–frequency relationship (indicative of a fixed delay) but give shorter delays than expected; others show a constant phase across frequencies. Recent evidence suggests that oscillations may be travelling around a peripheral sensorimotor loop. We recorded sensorimotor EEGs and EMGs from three intrinsic hand muscles in human subjects performing a precision grip task, and applied directed coherence (Granger causality) analysis to explor...|$|E
40|$|Performance of {{efficient}} and precise motor output requires proper planning of movement parameters {{as well as}} integration of sensory feedback. Peripheral sensory information is projected not only to parietal somatosensory areas but also to cortical motor areas, particularly the supplementary motor area (SMA). These afferent sensory pathways to the frontal cortices are likely involved in the integration of sensory information for assistance in motor program planning and execution. It is not well understood how and where sensory information from the limb contralateral to motor output is modulated, but the SMA is a potential cortical source as it is active both before and during motor output and is particularly involved in movements that require coordination and bilateral upper-limb selection and use. A promising physiological index of <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> to the SMA is the frontal N 30 component of the median nerve (MN) somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP), which is generated in the SMA. The SMA has strong connections with ipsilateral areas 2, 5 and secondary somatosensory cortex (S 2) as well as ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M 1). As such, the SMA proves a fruitful candidate to assess how sensory information is modulated across the upper-limbs during the various stages of motor output. This thesis inquires into how somatosensory information is modulated in both the SMA and primary somatosensory cortical areas (S 1) during the planning and execution of a motor output contralateral to sensory input across the upper-limbs, and further, how and what effect ipsilateral primary motor cortex (iM 1) has upon modulation of sensory inputs to the SMA...|$|E
40|$|The {{musculoskeletal}} redundancy of {{the body}} provides multiple solutions for performing motor tasks. We have proposed that the nervous system solves this unconstrained problem through the recruitment of motor modules or functional muscle synergies that map motor intention to action. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that trial-by-trial variations in muscle activation for multidirectional balance control in humans were constrained by a small set of muscle synergies. However, apparent muscle synergy structures could arise from characteristic patterns of sensory input resulting from perturbations or from low-dimensional optimal motor solutions. Here we studied electromyographic (EMG) responses for balance control {{across a range of}} biomechanical contexts, which alter not only the <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> generated by postural perturbations, but also the muscle activation patterns used to restore balance. Support-surface translations in 12 directions were delivered to subjects standing in six different postural configurations: one-leg, narrow, wide, very wide, crouched, and normal stance. Muscle synergies were extracted from each condition using nonnegative matrix factorization. In addition, muscle synergies from the normal stance condition were used to reconstruct muscle activation patterns across all stance conditions. A consistent set of muscle synergies were recruited by each subject across conditions. When balance demands were extremely different from the normal stance (e. g., one-legged or crouched stance), task-specific muscle synergies were recruited in addition to the preexisting ones, rather generating de novo muscle synergies. Taken together, our results suggest that muscle synergies represent consistent motor modules that map intention to action, regardless of the biomechanical context of the task...|$|E
40|$|Corticomuscular {{coherence}} {{has previously}} been reported between primary motor cortex (M 1) and contralateral muscles. We examined whether such coherence could also be seen from somatosensory areas. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from primary somatosensory cortex (S 1; areas 3 a and 2) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) area 5 simultaneously with M 1 LFP and forearm EMG activity in two monkeys during an index finger flexion task. Significant beta-band (~ 20 Hz) corticomuscular coherence was found in all areas investigated. Directed coherence (Granger causality) {{analysis was used to}} investigate the direction of effects. Surprisingly, the strongest beta-band directed coherence was in the direction from S 1 /PPC to muscle; it was much weaker in the ascending direction. Examination of the phase of directed coherence provided estimates of the time delay from cortex to muscle. Delays were longer from M 1 (~ 62 ms for the first dorsal interosseous muscle) than from S 1 /PPC (~ 36 ms). We then looked at coherence and directed coherence between M 1 and S 1 for clues to this discrepancy. Directed coherence showed large beta-band effects from S 1 /PPC to M 1, with smaller directed coherence in the reverse direction. The directed coherence phase suggested a delay of ~ 40 ms from M 1 to S 1. Corticomuscular coherence from S 1 /PPC could involve multiple pathways; the most important is probably common input from M 1 to S 1 /PPC and muscles. If correct, this implies that somatosensory cortex receives oscillatory efference copy information from M 1 about the motor command. This could allow <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> to be interpreted in the light of its motor context...|$|E

The normal diurnal distribution of feeding in the intact, freely feeding bird is described, as {{is the way in which}} this pattern may be altered by,a. surgical manipulation which removes much of the <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> from the trigeminal nerve. On the basis of the observation of the effect of this sensory trigeminal nerve section in the doves, an alternative interpretion of the role of this nerve in the control' of feeding behaviour and food intake in birds to that presented in the literature, is offered. In line with this interpretation, it is shown that a manipulation of the physical nature of an offered food material will produce a change in the temporal patterning of food intake in a way similar to that brought about by trigeminal nerve section, and that the past feeding experience of a bird has an effect on the probability that nerve section will produce a noticeable disruption in gross food intake. The fine structure of feeding behaviour is described to demonstrate the principle that the feeding control system of these birds acts so that future needs are anticipated, and it is shown that environmental cues giving information about future deprivation are used by them to feed in advance of such deprivation. In addition, the feeding behaviour of the birds in a continiousy fixed ratio operant situation is described, to show how the means of observing a behaviour can alter the pattern of that behaviour, and also how this alteration can give information about the operation of the underlying control system...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} source separation procedure (FSS) {{was applied}} to identify {{the activities of the}} primary sensorimotor areas (SM 1) devoted to hand control. FSS adds a functional constraint to the cost function of the basic independent component analysis, and obtains source activity all along different processing states. Magnetoencephalographic signals from the left SM 1 were recorded in 14 healthy subjects during a simple sensorimotor paradigm [...] galvanic right median nerve stimuli intermingled with submaximal isometric thumb opposition. Two functional sources related to the sensory flow in the primary cortex were extracted requiring maximal responsiveness to the nerve stimulation at around 20 and 30 ms (S 1 a, S 1 b). Maximal cortico-muscular coherence was required for the extraction of the motor source (M 1). Sources were multiplied by the Euclidean norm of their corresponding weight vectors, allowing amplitude comparisons among sources in a fixed position. In all subjects, S 1 a, S 1 b, M 1 were successfully obtained, positioned consistently with the SM 1 organization, and behaved as physiologically expected during the movement and processing of the sensory stimuli. The M 1 source reacted to the nerve stimulation with higher intensity at latencies around 30 ms than around 20 ms. The FSS method was demonstrated to be able to obtain the dynamics of different primary cortical network activities, two devoted mainly to <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow,</b> and the other to the motor control of the contralateral hand. It was possible to observe each source both during pure sensory processing and during motor tasks. In all conditions, a direct comparison of source intensities can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecordings {{from the}} central {{branches}} of single identified dactyl sensory afferent (DSA) neurons in a crayfish in vitro preparation were performed to study modifications of the sensory message occurring before the first central synapse. These afferents comprised hairs and force-sensitive mechanoreceptors with phasic and phasotonic response characteristics in the terminal segment (dactyl) of the crayfish leg. More than one afferent spike size was often observed in intracellular recordings from these afferents, thus indicating the presence of electrical coupling between the central processes of DSA fibers. Additionally, in identified DSA fibers with large spike sizes, primary afferent depolarizations (PADs) of up to 15 mV were observed, which sometimes triggered antidromic spikes in the afferent. Nevertheless, PADs were clearly inhibitory, because they shunted the afferent spikes. They exhibited the following properties. First, each PAD was preceded by an afferent spike from a neighboring hair, indicating that the PADs had a sensory rather than central origin. Second, PADs could follow high frequencies of afferent discharges without failure, a property suggestive of monosynaptic connections, but because PAD latencies varied by +/- 0. 5 ms {{it is more likely}} that they were mediated by a disynaptic pathway. Third, although PADs were evoked in an extremely reliable manner, their amplitude varied in a quantal manner. Most unitary PADs were the result of the release of < 12 quanta, the mean quantal content lying between 4 and 5; quantal size was large, approximately 1 mV. Fourth, PADs showed facilitation in some fibers, whereas in others they became much smaller when occurring at brief intervals. We suggest that PADs may be an efficient and parsimonious way to limit <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> in space and time, allowing the crayfish to identify precisely both weak and strong mechanical stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining {{equilibrium}} {{is basically}} a sensorimotor integration task. The central nervous system continually and selectively weights and rapidly integrates sensory inputs from multiple sources, and coordinates multiple outputs. The weighting process {{is based on the}} availability and accuracy of afferent signals at a given instant, on the time-period required to process each input, and possibly on the plasticity of the relevant pathways. The likelihood that <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> changes while balancing under static or dynamic conditions is high, because subjects can pass from a dark to a well-lit environment or from a tactile-guided stabilization to loss of haptic inflow. This review article presents recent data on the temporal events accompanying sensory transition, on which basic information is fragmentary. The processing time from sensory shift to reaching a new steady state includes the time to (a) subtract or integrate sensory inputs, (b) move from allocentric to egocentric reference or vice versa, and (c) adjust the calibration of motor activity in time and amplitude to the new sensory set. We present examples of processes of integration of posture-stabilizing information, and of the respective sensorimotor time-intervals while allowing or occluding vision or adding or subtracting tactile information. These intervals are short, in the order of 1 - 2 s for different postural conditions, modalities and deliberate or passive shift. They are just longer for haptic than visual shift, just shorter on withdrawal than on addition of stabilizing input, and on deliberate than unexpected mode. The delays are the shortest (for haptic shift) in blind subjects. Since automatic balance stabilization may be vulnerable to sensory-integration delays and to interference from concurrent cognitive tasks in patients with sensorimotor problems, insight into the processing time for balance control represents a critical step in the design of new balance- and locomotion training devices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent {{evidence}} indicates that during the sleep-waking cycle the forebrain and the cerebellum show parallel changes of their operating capabilities and suggest that cooperation between these two structures plays a different role in the different behavioral states. In particular, {{a high degree of}} cerebro-cerebellar cooperation is expected in waking and in paradoxical sleep when enhanced information processing within the cerebellum and the cortex is associated with effective reciprocal cerebro-cerebellar signal transmission. We first speculate that during waking, a state in which a wide range of behaviors is produced by the interaction with the external world, the cerebellum might assist the cortex to develop the neural dynamic patterns which underlie behaviors and that this could be accomplished via cerebellar modulation of both short- and long-range cortical synchronization. In particular, we propose that the cerebellum might favour the automatic triggering of the patterns already acquired, when requested by the context, as well as the acquisition of novel patterns, when found to be of adaptive value, and might even modulate the access to consciousness of brain operations, if producing unpredicted results, by regulating pattern complexity. This proposal is based on the experimental evidence that oscillatory activity may flow within the cerebro-cerebellar loops and that stimulation or lesion of the cerebellar structures affects cortical synchronization. Then we report evidence indicating that during paradoxical sleep, when brain activation occurs in the absence of <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> and motor output, cerebro-cerebellar cooperation mainly favours consolidation of newly acquired waking patterns and/or savings of old patterns from disruption possibly through a non-utilitarian replay process. Finally, we propose that cerebro-cerebellar cooperation weakens during slow wave sleep, given that in this sleep state neuronal activity and excitability decrease both in the cerebellum and in the forebrain and cerebello-cortical signal transmission is at least partially gated at the thalamic level...|$|E
40|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains have a cerebellum, {{and most}} of them have one or more additional structures that are histologically similar to the cerebellum. The cerebellum-like structures include the medial octavolateral nucleus in most aquatic vertebrates; the dorsal octavolateral nucleus in many aquatic vertebrates with an electrosensory system; the marginal layer of the optic tectum in rayfinned fishes; electrosensory lobes in the few groups of advanced bony fish with an electrosensory system; the rostrolateral nucleus of the thalamus in a few widely scattered groups of bony fish; and the dorsal cochlear nucleus in all mammals except monotremes. All of these structures receive topographically organized sensory input in their deep layers. Purkinje-like cells receive the sensory input near their cell bodies. These cells extend apical dendrites up into the molecular layer where they receive synaptic input from parallel fibers. The cerebellum itself can be included within this characterization by considering the climbing fiber as at least in part a conveyor of sensory information and by recalling that climbing fibers in more basal vertebrates terminate on smooth dendrites close to the soma. Physiological findings from three different systems suggest the hypothesis that cerebellum-like structures remove predictable features from the <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow.</b> Phylogenetic homology can explain the similarities across different taxa for some types of cerebellum-like structures, but similarities within other types cannot be explained in this way. Moreover, phylogenetic homology cannot explain the similarities among different types of cerebellum-like structures. Evolutionary convergence provides the best explanation for all these similarities that cannot be explained by homology. The convergence is almost surely constrained by the availability of a genetic-developmental program for creating cerebellum-like circuitry and by the need within many different systems for the type of information processing that cerebellum-like circuitry can provide...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the adaptation of}} balancing behavior during a continuous, predictable perturbation of stance consisting of 3 -min backward and forward horizontal sinusoidal oscillations of the support base. Two visual conditions (eyes-open, EO; eyes-closed, EC) and two oscillation frequencies (LF, 0. 2 Hz; HF, 0. 6 Hz) were used. Center of Mass (CoM) and Center of Pressure (CoP) oscillations and EMG of Soleus (Sol) and Tibialis Anterior (TA) were recorded. The time course of each variable was estimated through an exponential model. An adaptation index allowed comparison {{of the degree of}} adaptation of different variables. Muscle activity pattern was initially prominent under the more challenging conditions (HF, EC and EO; LF, EC) and diminished progressively to reach a steady state. At HF, the behavior of CoM and CoP was almost invariant. The time-constant of EMG adaptation was shorter for TA than for Sol. With EC, the adaptation index showed a larger decay in the TA than Sol activity {{at the end of the}} balancing trial, pointing to a different role of the two muscles in the adaptation process. At LF, CoM and CoP oscillations increased during the balancing trial to match the platform translations. This occurred regardless of the different EMG patterns under EO and EC. Contrary to CoM and CoP, the adaptation of the muscle activities had a similar time-course at both HF and LF, in spite of the two frequencies implying a different number of oscillation cycles. During adaptation, under critical balancing conditions (HF), postural muscle activity is tuned to that sufficient for keeping CoM within narrow limits. On the contrary, at LF, when vision permits, a similar decreasing pattern of muscle activity parallels a progressive increase in CoM oscillation amplitude and the adaptive balancing behavior shifts from the initially reactive behavior to one of passive riding the platform. Adaptive balance control would rely on on-line computation of risk of falling and <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow,</b> while minimizing balance challenge and muscle effort. The results from this study contribute to the understanding of plasticity of the balance control mechanisms under posture-challenging conditions...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{attempting}} {{to relate the}} abnormalities of the frontal N 30 components of the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown contradictory results. We recorded the frontal and parietal SEPs to median nerve stimulation in 2 groups of PD patients: a group of 17 patients presenting the wearing-off phenomenon, {{and a group of}} 10 untreated PD patients. The results were compared with a group of 13 healthy volunteers of the same age and with a group of 10 non-parkinsonian patients. All parkinsonian and non-parkinsonian patients were studied before ("off" condition) and after a subcutaneous injection of apomorphine ("on" condition). The gating effects of a voluntary movement (clenching of the hand) on the SEPs were also studied for the wearing-off group of PD patients (in states off and on) in comparison with the healthy subjects. At rest and in the off condition the amplitude of the frontal N 30 was significantly reduced in the 2 groups of PD patients. We demonstrate that the movement gating ability of the PD patient is preserved in spite of the reduced amplitude of the frontal N 30. This result suggests that the specific change in the frontal N 30 in PD is not the consequence of a continuous gating of the <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow</b> by a motor corollary discharge. Clinical motor improvement induced by apomorphine was associated with a significant enhancement of the frontal N 30 wave. In contrast, the subcortical P 14 and N 18 waves and the cortical N 20, P 22, P 27 and N 45 were not statistically modified by the drug. Apomorphine infusion did not change the absolute reduced voltage of the N 30 reached during the movement gating. While the frontal N 30 component of the non-parkinsonian patients was significantly lower in comparison to healthy subjects, this wave did not change after the apomorphine administration. In the wearing-off PD patient group the frontal N 30 increment was positively correlated with the number of off hours per day. This specific apomorphine sensitivity of the frontal N 30 was interpreted as a physiological index of the dopaminergic modulatory control exerted on the neuronal structures implicated in the generation of the frontal N 30.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to gain insight into spinal sensory regulation during locomotion. To this end, I developed a novel in vitro spinal cord-hindlimb preparation (SCHP) composed of the isolated in vitro neonatal rat spinal cord oriented dorsal-up with intact hindlimbs locomoting on a custom-built treadmill or instrumented force platforms. The SCHP combines the neural and pharmacological accessibility of classic in vitro spinal cord preparations with intact sensory feedback from physiological hindlimb movements. thereby expanding our ability to study spinal sensory function. I then validated {{the efficacy of the}} SCHP for studying behaviorally-relevant, sensory-modulated locomotion by showing the impact of sensory feedback on in vitro locomotion. When locomotion was activated by serotonin and N-methyl D-aspartate, the SCHP produced kinematics and muscle activation patterns similar to the intact rat. The mechanosensory environment could significantly alter SCHP kinematics and muscle activitation patterns, showing that sensory feedback regulates in vitro spinal function. I further demonstrated that sensory feedback could reinforce or initiate SCHP locomotion. 	Using the SCHP custom-designed force platform system, I then investigated how presynaptic inhibition dynamically regulates sensory feedback during locomotion and how hindlimb mechanics influence this regulation. I hypothesized that contralateral limb mechanics would modulate presynaptic inhibition on the ipsilateral limb. My results indicate that contralateral limb stance-phase loading regulates ipsilateral swing-phase <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow.</b> As contralateral stance-phase force increases, contralateral afferents act via a GABAergic pathway to increase ipsilateral presynaptic inhibition, thereby inhibiting sensory feedback entering the spinal cord. Such force-sensitive contralateral presynaptic inhibition may help preserve swing, coordinate the limbs during locomotion, and adjust the sensorimotor strategy for task-specific demands. 	This work has important implications for sensorimotor rehabilitation. After spinal cord injury, sensory feedback {{is one of the few}} remaining inputs available for accessing spinal locomotor circuitry. Therefore, understanding how sensory feedback regulates and reinforces spinally-generated locomotion is vital for designing effective rehabilitation strategies. Further, sensory regulation is degraded by many neural insults, including spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, resulting in spasticity and impaired locomotor function. This work suggests that contralateral limb loading may be an important variable for restoring appropriate sensory regulation during locomotion.

40|$|The spinal {{circuitry}} {{underlying the}} generation of basic locomotor synergies has been described in substantial detail in lampreys and the cellular mechanisms have been identified. The initiation of locomotion, on the other hand, relies on supraspinal networks and the cellular mechanisms involved {{are only beginning to}} be understood. This review examines some of the findings relative to the neural mechanisms involved in the initiation of locomotion of lampreys. Locomotion can be elicited by sensory stimulation or by internal cues associated with fundamental needs of the animal such as food seeking, exploration, and mating. We have described mechanisms by which escape swimming is elicited in lampreys in response to mechanical skin stimulation. A rather simple neural connectivity is involved, including sensory and relay neurons, as well as the brainstem rhombencephalic reticulospinal cells, which act as command neurons. We have shown that reticulospinal cells have intrinsic membrane properties that allow them to transform a short duration sensory input into a long-lasting excitatory command that activates the spinal locomotor networks. These mechanisms constitute an important feature for the activation of escape swimming. Other sensory inputs can also elicit locomotion in lampreys. For instance, we have recently shown that olfactory signals evoke sustained depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons and chemical activation of the olfactory bulbs with local injections of glutamate induces fictive locomotion. The mechanisms by which internal cues initiate locomotion are less understood. Our research has focused on one particular locomotor center in the brainstem, the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). The MLR is believed to channel inputs from many brain regions to generate goal-directed locomotion. It activates reticulospinal cells to elicit locomotor output in a graded fashion contrary to escape locomotor bouts, which are all-or-none. MLR inputs to reticulospinal cells use both glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission; nicotinic receptors on reticulospinal cells are involved. MLR excitatory inputs to reticulospinal cells in the middle (MRRN) are larger than those in the posterior rhombencephalic reticular nucleus (PRRN). Moreover at low stimulation strength, reticulospinal cells in the MRRN are activated first, whereas those in the PRRN require stronger stimulation strengths. The output from the MLR on one side activates reticulospinal neurons on both sides in a highly symmetrical fashion. This could account for the symmetrical bilateral locomotor output evoked during unilateral stimulation of the MLR in all animal species tested to date. Interestingly, muscarinic receptor activation reduces sensory inputs to reticulospinal neurons and, under natural conditions, the activation of MLR cholinergic neurons will likely reduce <b>sensory</b> <b>inflow.</b> Moreover, exposing the brainstem to muscarinic agonists generates sustained recurring depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons through pre-reticular effects. Cells in the caudal half of the rhombencephalon appear to be involved and we propose that the activation of these muscarinoceptive cells could provide additional excitation to reticulospinal cells when the MLR is activated under natural conditions. One important question relates to sources of inputs to the MLR. We found that substance P excites the MLR, whereas GABA inputs tonically maintain the MLR inhibited and removal of this inhibition initiates locomotion. Other locomotor centers exist such as a region in the ventral thalamus projecting directly to reticulospinal cells. This region, referred to as the diencephalic locomotor region, receives inputs from several areas in the forebrain and is likely important for goal-directed locomotion. In summary, this review focuses on the most recent findings relative to initiation of lamprey locomotion in response to sensory and internal cues in lampreys...|$|E
