[...] The earliest example of this used double-crossover (DX) complexes as the basic tiles, each containing four <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> designed with sequences that caused the DX units to combine into periodic two-dimensional flat sheets that are essentially rigid two-dimensional crystals of DNA. [...] Two-dimensional arrays have been made from other motifs as well, including the Holliday junction rhombus lattice, and various DX-based arrays making use of a double-cohesion scheme.

2500|$|Unlike other methods, {{cassette}} mutagenesis {{need not}} involve primer extension using DNA polymerase. [...] In this method, {{a fragment of}} DNA is synthesized, and then inserted into a plasmid. It involves the cleavage by a restriction enzyme at a site in the plasmid and subsequent ligation {{of a pair of}} complementary oligonucleotides containing the mutation in the gene of interest to the plasmid. Usually, the restriction enzymes that cut at the plasmid and the oligonucleotide are the same, permitting <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> of the plasmid and insert to ligate to one another. [...] This method can generate mutants at close to 100% efficiency, but is limited by the availability of suitable restriction sites flanking the site that is to be mutated.|$|E

50|$|Blunt-end ligation, however, is {{much less}} {{efficient}} than <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> ligation, typically the reaction is 100X slower than sticky-end ligation. Since blunt-end does not have protruding ends, the ligation reaction depends on random collisions between the blunt-ends and is consequently much less efficient. To compensate for the lower efficiency, the concentration of ligase used is higher than <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> ligation (10x or more). The concentration of DNA used in blunt-end ligation is also higher to {{increase the likelihood of}} collisions between ends, and longer incubation time may also be used for blunt-end ligations.|$|R

50|$|In {{recombinant}} DNA technology specific restriction endonucleases {{are used}} that will isolate a particular gene and cleave the sugar phosphate backbones {{at different points}} (retaining symmetry), so that the double stranded restriction fragments have single stranded ends. These short extensions, called <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> can form hydrogen bonded base pairs with complementary <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> on any other DNA cut with the same enzyme (such as a bacterial plasmid).|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} creating recombinant DNA typically {{involves the use}} of plasmids in the host bacteria. The plasmid contains a genetic sequence corresponding to the recognition site of a restriction endonuclease, such as EcoR1. After foreign DNA fragments, which have also been cut with the same restriction endonuclease, have been inserted into host cell, the restriction endonuclease gene is expressed by applying heat, or by introducing a biomolecule, such as arabinose. Upon expression, the enzyme will cleave the plasmid at its corresponding recognition site creating <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> on the plasmid. Ligases then joins the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> to the corresponding <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> of the foreign DNA fragments creating a recombinant DNA plasmid.|$|E
5000|$|Controlling {{the optimal}} {{temperature}} {{is a vital}} aspect of performing efficient recombination experiments involving the ligation of cohesive-ended fragments. Most experiments use T4 DNA Ligase (isolated from bacteriophage T4), which is most active at 37 Â°C. [...] However, for optimal ligation efficiency with cohesive-ended fragments ("sticky ends"), the optimal enzyme temperature needs to be balanced with the melting temperature Tm of the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> being ligated, the homologous pairing of the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> will not be stable because the high temperature disrupts hydrogen bonding. A ligation reaction is most efficient when the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> are already stably annealed, and disruption of the annealing ends would therefore result in low ligation efficiency. The shorter the overhang, the lower the Tm.|$|E

50|$|The {{higher the}} ligase concentration, {{the faster the}} rate of {{ligation}}. Blunt-end ligation is much less efficient than <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> ligation, so a higher concentration of ligase is used in blunt-end ligations. High DNA ligase concentration {{may be used in}} conjunction with PEG for a faster ligation, and they are components often found in rapid ligation kits.|$|R

5000|$|DNA ends {{refer to}} the {{properties}} of the end of DNA molecules, which may be <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> (cohesive ends), blunt ends or in other forms. The concept is used in molecular biology, especially in cloning or when subcloning inserts DNA into vector DNA.

50|$|PCR usually generates blunt-ended PCR products, but {{note that}} PCR using Taq {{polymerase}} can add an extra adenine (A) to the 3' {{end of the}} PCR product. This property may be exploited in TA cloning where {{the ends of the}} PCR product can anneal to the T end of a vector. TA ligation is therefore a form of <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> ligation. Blunt-ended vectors may be turned into vector for TA ligation with dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) using terminal transferase.|$|R
50|$|Restriction enzymes, such as EcoRI, {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{molecular}} genetics techniques including cloning, DNA screening and deleting sections of DNA in vitro. Restriction enzymes, like EcoRI, that generate <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> of DNA are often used to cut DNA prior to ligation, as the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> make the ligation reaction more efficient. EcoRI can exhibit non-site-specific cutting, known as star activity, depending on the conditions present in the reaction. Conditions that can induce star activity when using EcoRI include low salt concentration, high glycerol concentration, excessive amounts of enzyme present in the reaction, high pH and contamination with certain organic solvents.|$|E

50|$|The {{cut-and-paste}} transposition {{mechanism of}} class II TEs {{does not involve}} an RNA intermediate. The transpositions are catalyzed by several transposase enzymes. Some transposases non-specifically bind to any target site in DNA, whereas others bind to specific target sequences. The transposase makes a staggered cut at the target site producing <b>sticky</b> <b>ends,</b> cuts out the DNA transposon and ligates it into the target site. A DNA polymerase fills in the resulting gaps from the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> and DNA ligase closes the sugar-phosphate backbone. This results in target site duplication and the insertion sites of DNA transposons may be identified by short direct repeats (a staggered cut in the target DNA filled by DNA polymerase) followed by inverted repeats (which are important for the TE excision by transposase).|$|E

50|$|DNA {{computers}} {{have also been}} constructed using the concept of toehold exchange.

40|$|Electron {{flow through}} DNA films {{provides}} an excellent means for mutation detection. Recently, thiol-terminated DNA monolayers deposited on gold electrodes {{have been used to}} detect mismatches by solution electrochemistry. In this method, single stranded thiolated DNA has been linked to a gold electrode and then hybridized with a complementary test strand to form duplexes. The DNA-coated electrode was then exposed to an intercalator and a potential difference was applied to push charge through the DNA. Duplexes with single base pair mismatches showed minimal charge flow while charge flow through wild type, matched, duplexes was uninhibited. Our research focuses on developing a more efficient and elegant apparatus for such mutation detection. Presently, each film may be used for only one test. However, through our research, we hope to develop a method which would allow for multiple tests using a single film. In this procedure, thiol-terminated DNA duplexes with a 2 Ì 7 <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> 2 Ì 7 are linked to a gold electrode. Test duplexes with a complementary 2 Ì 7 <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> 2 Ì 7 can then be hybridized to the monolayer for mutation detection and then de-hybridized after experimentation. Other duplexes can then be hybridized to the same film for further detection...|$|R
