5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. <b>Shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E

Watson, after preliminary work with genetically simpler model organisms such as E. coli, S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. <b>Shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> and gene discovery methods pioneered by Craig Venter—and fueled by the financial promise of gene patents with Celera Genomics— led to a public–private sequencing competition that ended in compromise with the first draft of the human DNA sequence announced in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> (see below) {{to show that}} 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed {{that there are more}} than a thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E

The preparation of the <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequence</b> clones is, in fact, a biological experiment. It determines which segments of the genome can be cloned into Escherichia coli and which cannot. By analyzing the complete set of sequences from such an experiment, {{it is possible to}} identify genes lethal to E. coli. Among this set are genes encoding restriction enzymes which, when active in E. coli, lead to cell death by cleaving the E. coli genome at the restriction enzyme recognition sites. By analyzing <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequence</b> data sets we show that this is a reliable method to detect active restriction enzyme genes in newly sequenced genomes, thereby facilitating functional annotation.

5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of the Human Genome Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequencing,</b> in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA from nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E

25|$|For {{much of its}} history, the {{technology}} underlying <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> was the classical chain-termination method or 'Sanger method', {{which is based on}} the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication. Recently, <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> has been supplanted by high-throughput sequencing methods, especially for large-scale, automated genome analyses. However, the Sanger method remains in wide use, primarily for smaller-scale projects and for obtaining especially long contiguous DNA sequence reads (>500 nucleotides). Chain-termination methods require a single-stranded DNA template, a DNA primer, a DNA polymerase, normal deoxynucleosidetriphosphates (dNTPs), and modified nucleotides (dideoxyNTPs) that terminate DNA strand elongation. These chain-terminating nucleotides lack a 3'-OH group required for the formation of a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides, causing DNA polymerase to cease extension of DNA when a ddNTP is incorporated. The ddNTPs may be radioactively or fluorescently labelled for detection in DNA sequencers. Typically, these machines can sequence up to 96 DNA samples in a single batch (run) in up to 48 runs a day.|$|E
25|$|In bioinformatics, {{sequence}} assembly {{refers to}} aligning and merging fragments from a longer DNA sequence {{in order to}} reconstruct the original sequence. This is needed as DNA sequencing technology cannot read whole genomes in one go, but rather reads small pieces of between 20 and 30000 bases, depending on the technology used. Typically the short fragments, called reads, result from <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> genomic DNA, or gene transcript (ESTs).|$|E

25|$|Whole {{transcriptome}} <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> (WTSS) is {{the latest}} in gene expression studies, using next generation sequencing (NGS) to quantify RNA in samples on a high throughput scale. As biology trends toward using RNA-seq over microarray analysis in evaluating the transcriptome, so does degradomics. The field adapts the approach to analyzing the presence and quantity of transcripts of proteases, their substrates, and their inhibitors. While developed microarrays remain a major workhorse in studying gene expression in degradomics, its limitations of cross hybridization and dynamic range issues suggest RNA-seq will take a larger role as costs decrease and analysis improves.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Shotgun</b> <b>{{sequencing}}</b> is a sequencing method {{designed for}} analysis of DNA sequences longer than 1000 base pairs, {{up to and including}} entire chromosomes. It is named by analogy with the rapidly expanding, quasi-random firing pattern of a shotgun. Since this method can only be used for fairly short sequences (100 to 1000 base pairs), longer DNA sequences must be broken into random small segments which are then sequenced to obtain reads. Multiple overlapping reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing several rounds of this fragmentation and sequencing. Computer programs then use the overlapping ends of different reads to assemble them into a continuous sequence. [...] <b>Shotgun</b> <b>sequencing</b> is a random sampling process, requiring over-sampling to ensure a given nucleotide is represented in the reconstructed sequence; the average number of reads by which a genome is over-sampled is referred to as coverage.|$|E

The diploid, transcriptionally silent micronucleus undergoes meiosis and fertilization during sexual reproduction and determines the genotype of the progeny; in contrast, the expressed macronucleus contains many copies of hundreds of small chromosomes, determines the cell's phenotype, and is inherited only through vegetative reproduction.

We have analyzed the latest assembly (v 4. 0) of the fugu genome and show that, like the Anopheles genome, the fugu nuclear genome does not contain mitochondrial pseudogenes. Fugu assembly v 4. 0 contains a single scaffold representing the near complete sequence of the fugu mitochondria. The “recent” Numts identified by the previous study in fugu assembly v 2. 0 are in fact <b>shotgun</b> <b>sequences</b> of mitochondrial DNA that were misassembled with the nuclear sequences, whereas the “ancient” Numts appear {{to be the result of}} spurious matches.
