[...] Written colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in online chat rooms and instant messaging, although for formal written communications Cantonese speakers still normally use Vernacular Chinese. To a lesser degree Hokkien is used in a similar way in Taiwan and elsewhere, although it lacks the level of standardization seen in Cantonese.

2500|$|Japanese stroke order: Prescribed {{mostly in}} modern Japan. The <b>standard</b> <b>character</b> <b>set</b> of the MEXT is the Jōyō kanji, which {{contains}} many characters reformed in 1946. The MEXT lets editors freely prescribe a character's stroke order, which all should [...] "follow commonsensical orders which are widely {{accepted in the}} society". This standard diverges from the traditional stroke order in that {{the two sides of}} the grass radical (...) are joined, and written with three strokes. Also, this standard is influenced by semi-cursive script, leading to some vertical strokes to precede intersecting horizontal strokes if the vertical stroke does not pass through the lowest horizontal stroke, as in 隹 and 生. 必 is written with the top dot first, while the traditional stroke order writes the 丿 first.|$|E

2500|$|Consequently, {{relying on}} {{language}} markup {{across the board}} as an approach is beset with two major issues.

In addition to the <b>standard</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Kyūjitai Japanese and Shinjitai Japanese, there also exist [...] "ancient" [...] forms of characters that are of interest to historians, linguists and philologists.|$|R

No governmental standard matches traditional stroke orders completely. The differences between the governmental standards and traditional stroke orders arise from accommodation for schoolchildren who may be overwhelmed if the rules about stroke orders are too detailed, or if there are too many exceptions.

25|$|Such {{conversion}} is {{not always}} done {{in accordance with the}} <b>standards</b> for <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> and encodings.

Smart quote features also often fail to recognise situations when a prime rather than an apostrophe is needed; for example, incorrectly rendering the latitude 49°53′08″ as 49°53’08".|$|R
