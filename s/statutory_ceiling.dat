50|$|In January 2013, the {{platinum}} coin law received widespread {{media attention}} when Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and Laurence Tribe, a prominent constitutional {{law professor at}} the Harvard School of Law, endorsed a proposal to use the law to mint a trillion dollar coin. The idea was proposed as a way to neutralize Republican threats to block an increase in the <b>statutory</b> debt <b>ceiling</b> thereby causing the nation to default on its debt. Diehl was widely cited in the media as an expert on the issue, debunking criticism of the proposal and its legality under U.S. coinage law and its constitutionality.|$|R
5000|$|A lowered {{credit rating}} {{can result in}} investors {{demanding}} higher interest rates or more difficulty raising funds in global financial markets. On August 5, 2011, S&P {{made the decision to}} give a first-ever downgrade to U.S. sovereign debt, lowering the rating one notch to a [...] "AA+" [...] rating, with a negative outlook. [...] S&P stated that [...] "we lowered our long-term rating on the U.S. because we believe that the prolonged controversy over raising the <b>statutory</b> debt <b>ceiling</b> and the related fiscal policy debate indicate that further near-term progress containing the growth in public spending, especially on entitlements, or on reaching an agreement on raising revenues is less likely than we previously assumed and will remain a contentious and fitful process." ...|$|R
5000|$|Garrett Epps counter-argued {{that the}} President {{would not be}} usurping Congressional power by invoking Section 4 to declare the debt ceiling unconstitutional, because the debt ceiling exceeds Congressional authority. He called it {{legislative}} [...] "double-counting," [...] as paraphrased in The New Republic, [...] "because Congress already appropriated the funds in question, it is the executive branchs duty to enact those appropriations." [...] In other words, given Congress has appropriated money via federal programs, the Executive is obligated to enact and, therefore, fund them, but the debt ceilings limit on debt prevents the executive from carrying out the instructions given by Congress, on the constitutional authority to set appropriations; essentially, to obey the <b>statutory</b> debt <b>ceiling</b> would require usurping congress constitutional powers, and hence the statute must be unconstitutional.|$|R
40|$|Latest data {{confirm that}} the economy while not yet turning around toward an upswing remains rather well {{protected}} against risks of recession. Sluggishness on major foreign markets in the West is partly offset by lively demand from neighbouring Eastern countries; also, exports to Germany {{are still on the}} rise. Domestic demand remains firm with construction and tourism being the most buoyant sectors.

5000|$|Findings: (1) In June 2005, 14 {{percent of}} total {{purchases}} by 340B entities exceeded 340B ceiling prices, resulting in total overpayments of $3.9 million. (2) The largest overpayments were due to prices that did not follow HRSA's [...] "penny price" [...] policy in situations to which the <b>statutory</b> 340B <b>ceiling</b> price calculation yielded a negative number. (3) Low-volume entities, manufacturers, and wholesalers were associated with higher rates of overpayments. (4) Inaccuracies in HRSA's ceiling prices limit HRSA's ability to monitor 340B program compliance.Recommendations: (1) HRSA should improve its oversight of the 340B program to ensure that entities are charged at or below the 340B ceiling price. (2) HRSA should provide technical assistance regarding 340B program implementation to all participating entities, manufacturers, and wholesalers. (3) HRSA should publish guidelines regarding its penny price policy. (4) To accurately calculate 340B ceiling prices, HRSA should obtain data on consistent unit of measure and package size.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{political}} brinksmanship {{of recent}} months highlights {{what we see}} as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed. The <b>statutory</b> debt <b>ceiling</b> {{and the threat of}} default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy. Despite this year's wide-ranging debate, in our view, the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge, and, as we see it, the resulting agreement fell well short of the comprehensive fiscal consolidation program that some proponents had envisaged until quite recently. Republicans and Democrats have only been able to agree to relatively modest savings on discretionary spending while delegating to the Select Committee decisions on more comprehensive measures. It appears that for now, new revenues have dropped down on the menu of policy options. In addition, the plan envisions only minor policy changes on Medicare and little change in other entitlements, the containment of which we and most other independent observers regard as key to long-term fiscal sustainability." ...|$|R
30|$|The German {{health care}} system is also {{organized}} according to Bismarckian principles: workers in dependent employment are required to participate in the national Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) system. Workers with an income above the <b>statutory</b> insurance <b>ceiling</b> (about two times average wages) may stay in the statutory system or take out private health insurance. Tenured civil servants have their own schemes, supplemented by private insurance. Statutory sickness funds (Krankenkassen) cover about 88 [*]% of the German population and finance about 57 [*]% of health care costs (figures for 2006; Müller and Böhm 2009, p.  38). Like pensions, the institutional structure of the {{health care system}} has remained fairly stable since the end of the nineteenth century (Stone 1980; Alber 1992; Immergut 2009). Statutory benefits are financed by payroll contributions divided evenly between workers and employers (up to the contribution ceiling). Dependent spouses and children are included in the insurance coverage of the wage earner in dependent employment. Until recently, corporatist health care actors were responsible for central features of health care decision-making and implementations. The sickness funds set their own contribution rates, and the powerful Associations of SHI Physicians (Kassenärztliche Vereinigungen) negotiated payments with the sickness funds, as did hospitals.|$|R
40|$|Recent events {{raise the}} {{question}} of whether two near-failures in what scholars call the 2 ̆ 2 Fiscal Constitution 2 ̆ 2 may plunge the government into paralysis or chaos. In October 2013, a lapse in congressional appropriations shut the government down for two weeks. The shutdown furloughed hundreds of thousands of federal employees. It caused some agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service (2 ̆ 2 IRS 2 ̆ 2), virtually to close their doors and to curtail their services. Simultaneously, and potentially even more devastating, the House of Representatives (alternatively 2 ̆ 2 House 2 ̆ 2) firmly refused during an extremely tense countdown to raise the <b>statutory</b> debt <b>ceiling</b> of the government. When the government hits that ceiling, it cannot borrow any more money. The government cannot meet all of its program obligations-like Social Security-without borrowing. As a result, once the debt ceiling is reached, the government may be unable to meet its debt interest obligations, causing it to default on the national debt. The nation would face calamity. Nonetheless, tremendous national pressure failed to budge recalcitrants in the House until, with the utmost reluctance, the House finally held a vote on October 17 to allow borrowing, just one day before the government would have hit the debt ceiling...|$|R
40|$|In August 2011, Congress and the President {{narrowly}} averted {{economic and}} political catastrophe, agreeing at the last possible moment to authorize a series of increases in the national debt ceiling. This respite, unfortunately, was merely temporary. The amounts of the increases in the debt ceiling that Congress authorized in 2011 were only sufficient to accommodate the additional borrowing that would be necessary {{through the end of}} 2012. In an economy that continued to show chronic weakness [...] weakness that continues to this day [...] the federal government would predictably continue to collect lower-than-normal tax revenues and to make higher-than-normal expenditures, which meant that the debt would necessarily grow over time. Because {{there is no reason to}} believe that the annual budget will be balanced after 2012 [...] indeed, because that would be an affirmatively bad idea, even if the economy were to return to full employment [...] everyone knew that the debt ceiling would have to be raised by the beginning of 2013, to accommodate economic reality as the country continues to try to return to prosperity. As soon as the agreement temporarily averting the crisis was reached in 2011, however, the two top Republican leaders in Congress announced that they planned to demand additional spending cuts every time in the future that the debt ceiling needed to be increased. Their strategy appears to be based on the assumption that reaching the debt ceiling would, as a matter of course, require the president to cut spending in order to keep total borrowing under the statutory limit. If that were a correct reading of the Constitution, the president would in each case be forced to choose between inflicting severe and immediate austerity on the country at the moment the ceiling was reached [...] making spending cuts adequate to reduce total spending, so that it would match the tax revenues flowing into the Treasury [...] and accepting less severe austerity in the immediate term, by agreeing to cut spending by larger amounts in the future as the “price” of allowing borrowing to rise in the immediate term, with concomitantly smaller spending cuts up front. We addressed the debt ceiling standoff in an article published in the Columbia Law Review earlier this year: How to Choose the Least Unconstitutional Option: Lessons for the President (and Others) from the Debt Ceiling Standoff (hereinafter “How to Choose”). We argued there that it is incorrect to assume that the president can, or should, reduce authorized spending if the federal government reaches its <b>statutory</b> debt <b>ceiling.</b> Instead, we argued that the president should faithfully carry out the exact levels of spending and taxes that are required by the duly enacted budget of the United States [...] even if doing so requires him to exceed the debt ceiling [...] by issuing Treasury bonds in amounts sufficient to finance the difference between the levels of spending and taxation that Congress has authorized. As this follow-up essay is being published, in late December 2012, the President and congressional Republicans are in the midst of budget negotiations that may hinge on whether our argument was correct [...] that the president has a duty under the Constitution to set aside the debt ceiling, if the moment of truth comes. Unfortunately, none of the participants in the negotiations has offered any public indication that they even understand the nature of the problem that the president would face, much less how to resolve that problem, should Congress refuse to raise the debt ceiling. We argue here that the President should make it clear, as soon as possible, that the debt ceiling is not, and cannot legally be used as, a cudgel with which Congress can force him to renegotiate the federal budget. If the President does not do so now, the problem will continue to arise in the future, every time the debt level grows (as it should, in a growing economy which offers continuing opportunities for public investment) above the arbitrary dollar limit that Congress might set. Therefore, the President 2 ̆ 7 s best course is to make clear that the debt ceiling must always give way to the wishes of Congress, as expressed through the budget of the United States...|$|R
