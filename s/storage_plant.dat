5|$|It was {{initially}} intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor {{condition of the}} roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn {{made it difficult to}} find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse and a cold <b>storage</b> <b>plant.</b> Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946.|$|E
5|$|I./LG 1 {{abandoned}} Boscombe Down and bombed Southampton instead. No. 238 Squadron {{had been}} detailed to intercept, but the fighter escort was too strong and the bombers were not diverted from their course. Several warehouses were destroyed {{and a cold}} <b>storage</b> <b>plant</b> was also knocked out. All fires were under control by dusk. One III./LG 1 dropped its bombs by RAF Middle Wallop Sector Station by mistake. Only Andover airfield was hit, and it was used for bomber operations, not fighters. III./LG 1 lost two Ju 88s. The 13 Ju 88 Gruppen (Groups) had lost six destroyed and many damaged. They had escaped lightly. The bombing succeeded in destroying a bicycle factory, a furniture warehouse and a refrigerated meat depot. Luftwaffe intelligence had not identified the Southampton Spitfire factory—on the waterfront near the docks—as an important target. Poor intelligence suggested it was a bomber factory. Only later, in September, was it attacked and severely damaged. However, even then the Germans were unaware of the damage inflicted to Spitfire production. The factory would later be broken up and production dispersed.|$|E

The paper concentrates on programs that are used for controlling an existing generation system consisting of thermal power units and pumped hydro <b>storage</b> <b>plants,</b> therefore they should be solved in real time.

One of these problems is still a large scale multistage problem and it handles with pumped hydro <b>storage</b> <b>plants</b> only. In this paper, this problem is investigated down to the smallest details. The objective function for this problem is a linear function but stochastic. Using the special structure of the constraints, a solution method based on a subset of descent directions was developed.
