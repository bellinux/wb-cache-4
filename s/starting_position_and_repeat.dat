(roll the R to enunciate fiercely) / when clapping feet and hands, eyes, hands, and feet should be at the same height - feet and hands meet at the same level as your eyes; and at this point your bottom is all that is touching the floor / {{it is important that the}} back is kept absolutely straight / try to achieve an angle of 45 degrees to the floor, but NOT by bending your back - bending the back will result in injury! / relax back into the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{movement}} is performed {{lying on the}} back on a bench, starting weights extended above the chest, meeting at the midsagittal plane. The arms are lowered through an arc passing through the transverse plane, terminating when the arm is roughly parallel to the floor, then returning to the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeating.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{proportions}} {{of each of}} the links in the mechanism are defined to optimize the linearity of the foot for one-half of the rotation of the crank. The remaining rotation of the crank allows the foot to be raised to a predetermined height before returning to the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeating</b> the cycle. Two of these linkages coupled together at the crank and one-half cycle out of phase with each other will allow the frame of a vehicle to travel parallel to the ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{inverted}} fly (also {{known as}} a bent-over lateral raise, reverse fly or rear delt fly) works the posterior deltoid. This movement {{is the opposite of}} a chest fly. The exercise is performed with the torso parallel to the ground, facing down, with the hands in front of the face. Arms are moved through the transverse plane in an arc until parallel to the ground (or the limit of the range of motion of the shoulder is reached), then returned to the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeated.</b>|$|R

50|$|Black retreats their rook to its <b>start</b> <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> White {{continues}} {{moving the}} king to safety.|$|R
5000|$|Slingshot lunge: Also {{called a}} front leg pass, {{this is a}} {{backward}} lunge, circling the bell around the front leg, returning to the standing <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeating.</b>|$|R
50|$|Performed like a Classic Push Up, {{except one}} hand is placed {{forward of the}} normal <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> one hand is placed {{slightly}} behind.|$|R
5000|$|... 1932: Fred Frame {{wins the}} race from 27th <b>starting</b> <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> is the eighth {{different}} {{leader of the}} race, a record at the time.|$|R
50|$|For castling, {{the king}} <b>start</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> end <b>position</b> are recorded: for white, 5131 (queenside) and 5171 (kingside); for black, 5838 (queenside) and 5878 (kingside).|$|R
5000|$|When a {{resource}} fork is accessed, data including the <b>start</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> {{length of the}} resource data and resource map is read in from the header.|$|R
50|$|Murray records {{these two}} <b>starting</b> <b>positions,</b> <b>and</b> writes {{as if the}} players could choose the <b>starting</b> <b>positions</b> of their kings and bishops and knights and rooks. It is not known if the game had an initial {{setting-up}} stage like in sittuyin.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1952, Sweikert ran {{his first}} [...] "Indy 500" [...] race. He entered at the 32nd <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> ran for 77 laps in the McNamara Special car.|$|R
50|$|Hutcherson {{completed}} 1,521 laps (2974.7 miles) in his NASCAR career. He {{averaged a}} 16th place <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> an estimated average finish of 25th. His NASCAR career earnings totaled $52,645.|$|R
50|$|In May 1956, at {{his final}} {{return to the}} Indianapolis 500, Sweikert began in the 10th <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> came in for a 6th-place finish, with the team's D-A Lubricant roadster.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, {{he passed}} Warren Livingston on the depth chart {{for the right}} cornerback <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> {{finished}} with 5 interceptions. In 1969, he lost his starting job to Phil Clark.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Exercises that {{strengthen}} the knee joints and the hamstrings include prone knee flexion. Where the knee flexes {{all the way}} back to the rear end, hold for about 10 seconds, then slowly lower to original <b>position</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{algorithm}} {{finds the}} minimum value, swaps {{it with the}} value in the first <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeats</b> these steps {{for the remainder of}} the list. It does no more than n swaps, and thus is useful where swapping is very expensive.|$|R
50|$|If a mal {{lands on}} a station {{occupied}} by the opponent's team, the opponent's mal {{is removed from the}} course and returned to the <b>starting</b> <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> the current player is allowed to cast again.|$|R
5000|$|Commonly, {{the mass}} tends to {{overshoot}} its <b>starting</b> <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> then return, overshooting again. With each overshoot, some {{energy in the}} system is dissipated, and the oscillations die towards zero. This case is called underdamped.|$|R
50|$|In 1996 he {{regained his}} <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> teamed with Sanders to form {{one of the}} strongest corner combos in the NFL. That season, he had 5 interceptions and {{established}} a career-high with 18 passes defensed.|$|R
25|$|Neti pots are {{typically}} made of metal, glass, ceramic or plastic. They rely on gravity, along with head <b>positioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> practice {{in order to}} rinse the outer sinus cavities. Typically they have a spout attached near the bottom, sometimes with {{a handle on the}} opposite side.|$|R
50|$|In 1978 {{with the}} {{emergence}} of Tony Hill, he lost his <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> was traded to the Chicago Bears, in exchange for a 5th round draft choice in 1979 and a 3rd round draft choice in 1980.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, codebooks {{were only}} used {{each day to}} set up the rotors, their ring {{settings}} and the plugboard. For each message, the operator selected a random <b>start</b> <b>position,</b> let's say WZA, and a random message key, perhaps SXT. He moved the rotors to the WZA <b>start</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> encoded the message key SXT. Assume the result was UHL. He then set up the message key, SXT, as the <b>start</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> encrypted the message. Next, he transmitted the <b>start</b> <b>position,</b> WZA, the encoded message key, UHL, and then the ciphertext. The receiver set up the <b>start</b> <b>position</b> according to the first trigram, WZA, and decoded the second trigram, UHL, to obtain the SXT message setting. Next, he used this SXT message setting as the <b>start</b> <b>position</b> to decrypt the message. This way, each ground setting was different and the new procedure avoided the security flaw of double encoded message settings.|$|R
50|$|On 30 December 2009, Catania {{confirmed}} {{the transfer of}} Pesce back to Ascoli on a loan deal {{until the end of}} the season. In his six-month loan spell in the Serie B, Pesce quickly re-gained his <b>starting</b> <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> made 22 appearances, for the club.|$|R
50|$|Following its inaugural {{running in}} 2017, it was {{announced}} that the second Pegasus World Cup in 2018 would be contested for a higher purse of $16 million, with $1 million from each of the 12 <b>starting</b> <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> an additional $4 million contributed by the Stronach Group.|$|R
50|$|Hartline won the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> didn't give Newton much {{playing time}} in 2010 while he watched Hartline have a {{highlight}} reel season. Much of Newton's playing time {{came in the}} game against Eastern Kentucky University, and in the Birmingham Bowl against Pittsburgh (Hartline was out due to suspension).|$|R
50|$|Later in the day, Howdy Holmes {{squeezed}} {{onto the}} front row with a run of 207.977 mph. It put him in second <b>starting</b> <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> bumped Rick Mears {{to the outside of}} the front row. Rookie Michael Andretti out-qualified his father, and would line up in 4th position (Mario qualified 6th).|$|R
50|$|Piquet's form {{continued}} in Turkey, where {{he won the}} feature race from pole. Hamilton was second, and in the sprint, Hamilton recovered well from early spin to take 2nd place, while Piquet {{had to settle for}} 5th. Andreas Zuber took advantage of his front row <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> won the race.|$|R
5000|$|A {{busy day}} saw 27 cars qualify. Rick Mears {{returned}} from his 1984 leg injuries to qualify 10th. Danny Sullivan put his car {{in the field in}} 8th. No driver from 1911-1984 had ever won the race from 8th <b>starting</b> <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> it was often nicknamed the dreaded [...] "8-ball spot." ...|$|R
50|$|Levine {{competed in}} 1 ARCA Racing Series Event in 2016, the Twilight 150 {{presented}} by Unique Pretzels at the New Jersey Motorsports Park. Driving for the Mason Mitchell Motorsports {{team in the}} No. 98 car sponsored by Revant Optics, he qualified in the 3rd <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> finished the race in 5th place.|$|R
50|$|The {{individual}} {{starts in}} an all-fours position, then lifts one knee {{off the ground}} and swings the knee out to the side as far as possible, maintaining the bent knee at a 90-degree angle. The leg is then returned to the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> the exercise is then performed with the other leg.|$|R
50|$|The {{individual}} {{starts in}} {{a standing position}} with the feet together. Bending at the waist, one leg is raised in the air while the hand reaches for the floor. The leg is lowered to the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> the body returned to the upright <b>position.</b> The leg <b>and</b> back should stay straight at all times during the exercise.|$|R
25|$|In January, redshirt sophomore {{defensive}} end Aaron Maybin {{announced that he}} was skipping his final two seasons of eligibility and declared for the 2009 NFL Draft. Junior {{defensive end}} Maurice Evans, despite losing his <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> <b>and</b> playing time to Maybin due to a three-game suspension for marijuana possession, also declared for the draft.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the school's girls' {{basketball}} team {{was stripped of}} their 2004 and 2005 state championship titles, and barred from playing in the 2007 tournament after it had been revealed coaches participated in illegal recruiting. Six Sealth Ladyhawks players had been enticed to transfer to the school with promises of <b>starting</b> <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> college scholarships.|$|R
