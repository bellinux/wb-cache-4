5|$|The storm {{brought the}} {{heaviest}} rainfall totals to Dhofar in 30years, causing flooding and creating rivers in wadis, or typically dry riverbeds. Several people drowned after their vehicles were <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the flooding. The storm caused locally heavy damage, totaling $25million (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|Although Bolaven {{struck the}} Ryukyu Islands as a {{powerful}} typhoon, damage was less than expected. Relatively few buildings were damaged or destroyed across the region. The most significant effects stemmed from heavy rains, amounting to , that caused flash flooding and landslides. One person drowned on Amami Ōshima after being <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> a swollen river. In mainland Japan, two people drowned after being <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> rough seas. In South Korea, 19 people {{were killed by the}} storm. Many buildings were damaged and approximately 1.9million homes were left without power. Losses in the country reached ₩420billion (US$374.3million), the majority of which was due to destroyed apple orchards. Significant damage also took place in North Korea where at least 59 people were killed and 50 others were reported missing. Additionally, 6,700 homes were destroyed. Offshore, nine people drowned after two Chinese vessels sank.|$|E

5|$|Realignment of the River Glaven {{means the}} ruins are {{now to the}} north of the river embankment, and {{essentially}} unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the stream.

5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E

Shanshan is also credited with US$4.9million worth of net losses in the third financial quarter for IPC Holdings, Ltd.|$|E
5|$|While Erika's {{precursor}} disturbance {{was moving}} across Florida, it dropped heavy rainfall. In south Texas, Erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60mph (80 to 95km/h) along with light rain, causing minor and isolated wind {{damage in the}} state. In northeastern Mexico, Erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flooding. There, two people were killed when their vehicle was <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was only}} a Category 1 hurricane, Charley caused {{significant}} damage in southern Jamaica. Saint Elizabeth Parish sustained the worst damage. About 750 farmers reported damage, and at one point, flooding isolated 30 families. The only fatality in Jamaica occurred after a man attempted to rescue a family but was <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> flood waters. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed to flooded regions. Days later, officials allocated roughly $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) to repair damaged roads. Residents in areas that sustained severe agricultural losses also requested assistance from the government.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} {{developed}} {{very close to}} shore, it only briefly traveled west-northwest before making landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico early on June 29 as a weak tropical storm. It continued inland, producing heavy rain over the state of Veracruz until dissipating over the mountains of San Luis Potosí late on June 29. Hundreds of homes were damaged, and several towns, including Naranjos and Chinampa, about 60miles (95km) south of Tampico, were severely flooded, but the only reported fatalities were the two occupants of a car that was <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> floodwaters in Naranjos.|$|E
5|$|Five people drowned {{after their}} cars were <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> floodwaters {{while trying to}} cross a flooded stream. The floods also damaged 4,000-6,000 homes and {{buildings}} and significantly disrupted water and communications {{for an extended period}} of time. The hurricane's storm surge damaged many boats and yachts in ports along the peninsula's coast, most of them beyond repair. Minor beach erosion was reported at San Felipe, Baja California. As a result, the Baja California Sur municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé were declared national disaster areas. 6,000 people were affected and total damage from the storm was $100 million.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains for {{the outer}} bands of Hurricane Beta, amounting up to 3in (76mm), caused {{flooding}} and landslides in Panama. At least 256 people {{were affected by}} the storm and 52 homes were damaged; however, {{the cost of the}} damages is unknown. At least 50hectares (124acres) of rice fields were flooded across the country. One person, a young girl, was killed after the boat she was on sank amid rough seas. Both her parents escaped the sinking ship. Two other people drowned after being <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the swollen Chagres River and two others were reported missing.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the storm}} {{weakened}} considerably from its peak intensity, damage {{was much less}} than initially anticipated. In all, damages from the storm amounted to 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD). Three people {{were killed by the}} storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control of his car and crashed into a ditch, and the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell in a ditch near his home. Two 11-year-old boys, initially reported as missing, were later found in a ditch after being <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> flood waters.|$|E
5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} preceding {{the development of}} Bertha produced rough surf and rip currents along the Florida coastline. In Perdido Key State Recreation Area, two children were swimming in an unguarded area when they <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the currents. Their grandfather attempted to rescue them, but drowned in the rough waters. Another family rescued the two children. The large circulation of Bertha produced light rainfall across Florida, with Pensacola and Destin reporting 2.75inches. Extreme southern portions of Alabama received over 3inches (75mm) of rain from the storm, while western Dauphin Island reported over 5inches (125mm).|$|E

A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be <b>swept</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the gardens dates from 1699 when a design by George London was laid out, with fountains added a few years later. A model for a summer house by the carpenter and architect William Thornton was approved by Sir Abstrupus in 1700. This formal plan was <b>swept</b> <b>away,</b> probably <b>by</b> William Danby during his landscaping programme in the 1760s {{that resulted in the}} present English landscape garden. In the next years five lakes were dug out.|$|R
