40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Studies of {{diet and}} {{depression}} have {{focused primarily on}} individual nutrients. AIMS: To examine the association between dietary patterns and depression using an overall diet approach. METHOD: Analyses were carried on data from 3486 participants (26. 2 % women, mean age 55. 6 years) from the Whitehall II prospective cohort, in which two dietary patterns were identified: 'whole food' (heavily loaded by vegetables, fruits and fish) and 'processed food' (heavily loaded by <b>sweetened</b> <b>desserts,</b> fried food, processed meat, refined grains and high-fat dairy products). Self-reported depression was assessed 5 years later using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, participants in the highest tertile of the whole food pattern had lower odds of CES-D depression (OR = 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 56 - 0. 99) {{than those in the}} lowest tertile. In contrast, high consumption of processed food was associated with an increased odds of CES-D depression (OR = 1. 58, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 2. 23). CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged participants, a processed food dietary pattern is a risk factor for CES-D depression 5 years later, whereas a whole food pattern is protective...|$|R

5000|$|A soufflé (...) is a baked egg-based dish which {{originated}} in early eighteenth century France. It {{is made with}} egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients {{and served as a}} savory main dish or <b>sweetened</b> as a <b>dessert.</b> The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb souffler which means [...] "to breathe" [...] or [...] "to puff".|$|R
25|$|In Tunisia, {{it is made}} mostly spicy with harissa {{sauce and}} served with almost everything, {{including}} lamb, fish, seafood, beef and sometimes in southern regions, camel. Fish couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with octopus, squid or other seafood in hot, red, spicy sauce. Couscous in Tunisia is served on every occasion; it is also served in some regions (mostly during Ramadan), <b>sweetened</b> as a <b>dessert</b> called masfouf.|$|R
5000|$|Italian ice (also {{known as}} water ice in Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley) is a <b>sweetened</b> frozen <b>dessert</b> made with fruit (often from concentrates, juices or purées) or other natural or {{artificial}} food flavorings, similar to sorbet. Water ice is not shaved ice that is flavored; rather, {{it is made}} by the same process by which ice cream is made: freezing the ingredients while mixing them. Italian ice is similar to sorbet, but differs from American-style sherbet in {{that it does not}} contain dairy or egg ingredients, though it may contain egg white. Common flavors include blue raspberry, cherry, lemon, mango, orange, strawberry, and watermelon, with numerous other flavors available. It is believed to be derived from the Sicilian granita, a related dessert which may have been brought by immigrants to the United States.|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleThe diets and physical activity behaviors of American children and adolescents need improvement. Eighty-six percent of young children consume a <b>sweetened</b> beverage or <b>dessert</b> daily [1] and over 80 % of 4 - 18 -year-old children do not meet recommendations for fruit or vegetable intakes [2]. Additionally, 8 - 18 -year-old children watch an adolescents do not meet physical activity recommendations [4]. The negative impact of these concerning trends is illus-trated, in part, by the increasing prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents [5]. Interventions aimed at improving children’s eating and physical activity behaviors have focused on a number of contexts within which youth spend their time, including homes [6], schools [7], and community-based organiza-tions [8].

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were (1) to {{optimize}} the formulation of a prebiotic chocolate dairy dessert and assess the extent to which sensory properties were affected by adding different concentrations of prebiotics (inulin and fructooligosaccharides) combined with different levels of xanthan and guar gums, and (2) to analyze the ideal and relative sweetness of prebiotic chocolate milk <b>dessert</b> <b>sweetened</b> with different artificial and natural sweeteners. Acceptability was evaluated by 100 consumers using a 9 -cm hedonic scale, and the level of sample creaminess was evaluated using a 9 -point just-about-right (JAR) scale. Data were subjected to a multivariate regression analysis and fitted to a model provided by response surface methodology. The optimal concentrations were 7. 5 % (wt/wt) prebiotic and 0. 20 % (wt/wt) gum (guar and xanthan, in a 2 : 1 ratio). The ideal sweetness analysis revealed that the ideal concentration of sucrose was 8. 13 %. The relative sweetness analysis showed that Neotame (NutraSweet Corp., Chicago, IL) had the highest sweetening power compared with the prebiotic chocolate dairy dessert containing 8 % sucrose, followed by sucralose, aspartame, and stevia. The study of sweetness in this product is important because consumers desire healthier functional products with no added sugar...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{established}} association between liking for fat and fat intake, {{little is known}} about the association between liking for fat and intake of specific nutrients or food groups. We investigated the association between dietary intake and liking for fat, fat-and-sweet and fat-and-salt. Liking scores were constructed using a validated preference questionnaire administered to 41, 595 French adults participating in the Nutrinet-Santé study. Dietary data were collected using web-based 24 [*]h records. Relationships between liking and dietary intake were assessed using linear regression adjusted for age and energy intake. Results are expressed in percentage difference of intake between individuals with low liking and those with high liking. Compared with participants with low liking for fat, individuals with a strong liking for fat had higher intakes of total energy (+ 10. 1 % in women (W); + 8. 4 % in men (M)), fats (W: + 7. 3 %; M: + 10. 0 %), saturated fats (W: + 10. 8 %; M+ 15. 4 %), meat (W: + 13. 0 %; M: + 12. 6 %), butter (W: + 34. 0 %; M: + 48. 1 %), <b>sweetened</b> cream <b>desserts</b> (W: + 14. 8 %; M: + 21. 1 %) and croissant-like pastries (W: + 27. 2 %; M: + 36. 9). They also consumed lower quantities of omega- 3 fatty acids (W: - 6. 2 %;M: - 6. 0 %), fiber (W: - 16. 4 %; M: - 18. 9 %), fruits (W: - 28. 8 %; M: - 29. 5 %), vegetables (W: - 16. 4 %; M: - 19. 7 %) and yogurt (W: - 12. 1 %; M: - 14. 8 %). Participants with high liking for fat-and-salt had higher intakes of total energy, sodium and alcoholic beverages and lower consumption of total and simple carbohydrates and fruit and vegetables than persons with high liking for fat-and-sweet. Our study contributes to the understanding of liking as a determinant of dietary intake. It highlighted that increased liking for fat, especially fat-and-salt liking, was associated with a lower intake of healthy foods, such as fruit and vegetables. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
