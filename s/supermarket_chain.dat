5|$|However, {{the plans}} were {{abandoned}} in April 2003 {{due to the}} club {{not being able to}} raise adequate funds. Following this, plans were made to move to Kirkby, just outside the city, in a joint venture with the <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain</b> Tesco. The scheme was greatly divisive amongst supporters and local authorities, but was rejected in late November 2009 following a decision by Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several miles, NY33 runs {{parallel}} to the Thruway and very close to it, with both roads visible from the other. Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain</b> headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E

50|$|Price {{stickiness}} {{is extremely}} common among large <b>supermarket</b> <b>chains</b> and prices, especially for commodities, {{tend not to}} vary much between them. Many of the supermarkets monitor price changes in other <b>supermarket</b> <b>chains</b> and vary their prices accordingly until they reach the point where any further decrease in their price will affect profits.|$|R
5|$|In 1947 Agnew {{graduated}} as Bachelor of Laws {{and passed}} the Maryland bar examination. He started his own law practice in downtown Baltimore, but was not successful, and {{took a job as}} an insurance investigator. A year later, he moved to Schreibers, a <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain,</b> where his main role was that of a store detective. He stayed there for four years, a period briefly interrupted in 1951 by a recall to the army after the outbreak of the Korean War. He resigned from Schreibers in 1952, and resumed his legal practice, specializing in labor law.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{began in}} August 2000, when John Purnell, director {{of security for}} Tesco, the United Kingdom's largest <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain,</b> was telephoned by a newsagent in Bournemouth, Dorset, who had discovered a copy of an extortion letter left on his shop's photocopier. The letter demanded that Tesco give away Clubcards, modified for use in cash machines, in the Bournemouth Daily Echo. Over the following days, Dorset Police received two other letters, threatening to send bombs to Tesco customers if the demands were not met.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch {{programs}} to include dolphin and whale meat brought about much controversy. An estimated 150kg (330lbs) of dolphin meat was served in Taiji school lunches in 2006. In 2009, dolphin meat was taken off school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of dolphin and whale meat sold at supermarkets {{most likely to be}} providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain</b> in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves.|$|E

5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story {{on the front page}} of the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain</b> painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The {{technician}} {{who did the}} research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain</b> Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E
5|$|In Albany, New York, a disk jockey named Bryan Jackson helped {{organize}} a relief effort for the Texas town {{of the same}} name, with sponsorship from radio station WOKO and a local <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain.</b> After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane was loaded with the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due to calls saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. After what was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy of errors, the flight {{was funded by the}} Defense Department and was able to take off. In addition, a sheriff dispatch in the Texas town mentioned that aid was possibly being sent from several other towns with the same name as well as from other Texas towns like Abilene.|$|E

5|$|On 8 September 2011 Trafalgar Square staged International Paralympic Day, {{hosted by}} Rick Edwards, Ade Adepitan and Iwan Thomas, to {{coincide}} with a visit to London by representatives of the IPC. The event celebrated the Paralympic Games, showcasing and demonstrating the 20 sports that would feature during the Games (with some sessions also made inclusive to people with hearing disabilities). It also featured appearances by Paralympic athletes Oscar Pistorius, Ellie Simmonds and Sascha Kindred, and the unveiling of a bronze statue of Pistorius by Ben Dearnley. British Prime Minister David Cameron and London's mayor Boris Johnson also appeared. Two days later on 10 September, <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain</b> Sainsbury's and Channel 4 presented Sainsbury's Super Saturday, a family event at Clapham Common. The event featured showcases of Paralympic sports, and a concert featuring pop music acts including Nicola Roberts, Olly Murs, The Wanted, Will Young, Pixie Lott, Dappy, Sugababes, The Saturdays, Chipmunk and Taio Cruz.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{government}} established several {{incentives for}} E85 flex-fuel vehicles. These include a fuel duty rebate on E85 fuel of 20 p per liter, until 2010; a £ 10 to 15 {{reduction in the}} vehicle excise duty (VED); and a 2% annual company car tax discount for flex-fuel cars. Despite {{the small number of}} E85 pump stations available, limited to the Morrisons <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain</b> stations, most automakers offer the same models in the UK that are available in the European market. In 2005 the Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel became the first flexible-fuel car sold in the UK, though E85 pumps were not opened until 2006. Volvo now offers its flexifuel models S80, S40, C30, V50 and V70. Other models available in the UK are the Ford C-Max Flexi-Fuel, and the Saab models 9-5 and 9-3 Flex-Fuel Biopower, and the new Saab Aero X BioPower E100 bioethanol.|$|E
5|$|RNC is {{the home}} of the first {{football}} academy for visually impaired players. The Football Academy was officially opened in August 2008 by former England footballer Sir Trevor Brooking and offers visually impaired students the opportunity to include football as part of their study programme with a view to playing the game at a national level. The college {{is the home}} of the England blind football team, which is supported by the Football Association and coached by former professional footballer Tony Larkin. The game is played as a five-a-side match using a ball filled with ballbearings to enable players to hear its position. Teams consist of four blind players and a sighted goalkeeper who offers directions along with the coach and a sighted guide behind the opposition goalpost. RNC is helping to develop a national blind football league. In 2010 RNC hosted the World Blind Football Championship at its campus. The tournament got under way on Saturday 14 August with the opening match between England and Spain, and was won by Brazil following a 2–0 win against Spain in the final on 22 August. Members of England's blind football team travelled to Los Angeles in November 2011 to promote the sport in the United States, and took part in a day's training with former England captain David Beckham. The trip was organised by <b>supermarket</b> <b>chain</b> Sainsbury's as part of their sponsorship deal with the footballer.|$|E
