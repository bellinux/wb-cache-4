50|$|A <b>sound</b> <b>baffle</b> is a {{construction}} or device which reduces the strength (level) of airborne sound. Sound baffles are a fundamental tool of noise mitigation, {{the practice of}} minimizing noise pollution or reverberation. An important type of <b>sound</b> <b>baffle</b> is the noise barrier constructed along highways to reduce sound levels at properties in the vicinity. Sound baffles are also applied to walls and ceilings in building interiors to absorb sound energy and thus lessen reverberation.|$|E

50|$|Trans is {{the twelfth}} studio album by Canadian {{musician}} and singer-songwriter Neil Young, released on December 29, 1982. Recorded and released during his Geffen {{era in the}} 1980s, its electronic <b>sound</b> <b>baffled</b> many Neil Young fans upon its initial release—a Sennheiser vocoder VSM201 features prominently in six of the nine tracks.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} {{techniques}} rely upon materials science applications of constructing <b>sound</b> <b>baffles</b> or using sound-absorbing liners for interior spaces. Industrial noise control is really a subset of interior architectural control of noise, with emphasis upon specific methods of sound isolation from industrial machinery and for protection of workers at their task stations.|$|R
50|$|As a result, the Goochland County Public Schools {{received}} {{the new school}} bus. Her idea was to install <b>sound</b> <b>baffles</b> in the ceilings of school bus bodies to help reduce driver distraction. Compact forms of such equipment were later developed in the 1980s by Wayne and other bus manufacturers when diesel engines (and their greater noise) became commonplace.|$|R
50|$|The Mosquito was {{released}} to the mainstream market in 2005, through Stapleton's company Compound Security Solutions. The current device has two settings: the high frequency sound targeted at youth, and another that can be heard by everyone. The range of the sound is 140 ft with the <b>sound</b> <b>baffle,</b> and 200 ft without. It requires a 24-volt DC or 15-volt AC power supply.|$|E
50|$|Soundproofing is {{any means}} of {{reducing}} the sound pressure {{with respect to a}} specified sound source and receptor. There are several basic approaches to reducing sound: increasing the distance between source and receiver, using noise barriers to reflect or absorb the energy of the sound waves, using damping structures such as <b>sound</b> <b>baffles,</b> or using active antinoise sound generators.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1900s, {{scientists}} {{have been aware of}} the utility of certain types of interior coatings or baffles to improve the acoustics of concert halls, theaters, conference rooms and other spaces where sound quality is important. By the mid-1950s, Bolt, Beranek and Newman and a few other U.S. research organizations were developing technology to address sound quality's design challenges. This design field draws on several disciplines including acoustical science, computer modeling, architecture and materials science. <b>Sound</b> <b>baffles</b> are also used in speaker cabinets to absorb energy from the pressure created by the speakers, thus reducing cabinet resonance. In 1973, Pearl P. Randolph, a school bus driver in Virginia, won a new school bus in a national contest held by Wayne Corporation for the suggestion that <b>sound</b> <b>baffles</b> be installed in the ceiling of school buses. In 1981, they were first made mandatory by the state of California.|$|R
50|$|Designing {{special-purpose}} rooms {{has more}} exotic challenges, since these rooms may have requirements for unusual {{features such as}} concert performance, sound studio recording, lecture halls. In these cases reverberation and reflection must be analyzed in order to not only quiet the rooms, but to prevent echo effects from occurring. In these situations special <b>sound</b> <b>baffles</b> and <b>sound</b> absorptive lining materials may be specified to dampen unwanted effects.|$|R
5000|$|The solotone mute (labeled by Humes and Berg as the [...] "cleartone" [...] mute), {{also called}} a mega-mute, is {{shaped like a}} long {{straight}} mute, and includes <b>sound</b> <b>baffles</b> inside the mute that accentuate treble frequencies. It is rarely written for today but was common in jazz ensemble music written between 1930 and 1950. The most trademark use of the solo-tone mute was in Tommy Dorsey's trombone solo in [...] "Song of India", recorded January 1, 1937.|$|R
50|$|Practice mutes, {{also known}} as Whispa, whisper, or hotel mutes, are similar to {{straight}} mutes in appearance, but have a solid ring of cork that prevents air from escaping from the bell like a Harmon mute. There are <b>sound</b> <b>baffles</b> inside the mute, and tiny holes in {{the sides of the}} mute that allow air to escape silently. These mutes are extremely quiet and are rarely used in performance. They are usually used for privacy and to avoid disturbing bystanders during practice sessions.|$|R
50|$|Environmental {{noise is}} the {{accumulation}} of all noise present in a specified environment. The principal sources of environmental noise are surface motor vehicles, aircraft, trains and industrial sources. These noise sources expose millions of people to noise pollution that creates not only annoyance, but also significant health consequences such as elevated incidence of hearing loss and cardiovascular disease. There {{are a variety of}} mitigation strategies and controls available to reduce sound levels including source intensity reduction, land use planning strategies, noise barriers and <b>sound</b> <b>baffles,</b> time of day use regimens, vehicle operational controls and architectural acoustics design measures.|$|R
5000|$|The glass {{walls of}} the {{facility}} also {{play an important role}} in heating and regulating the temperature of the building: the glass panels have reflective coatings that control the entry of heat into the building, and are made up of two panes separated by a pocket of air which, along with the air between the glass panels and the interior <b>sound</b> <b>baffling,</b> are meant to help insulate the building and preserve energy. [...] According to Calvin Frost, chairman of the Channeled Resources Group, Kenyon students placed a high value on ecological friendliness when sharing their attitudes about the KAC.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Lifeguard was introduced, Wayne held a {{nationwide}} contest soliciting ideas to improve school bus safety, {{with a new}} Lifeguard school bus as the grand prize. The winning entry was submitted by a school bus driver in Goochland County, Virginia, whose district received the new school bus. Her idea was to incorporate <b>sound</b> <b>baffles</b> in the ceiling of school bus bodies to help reduce driver distraction. Compact forms of such equipment were later developed used by Wayne and other school bus manufacturers when diesel engines (and their greater noise) became more widely available in conventional-style school buses (like the Lifeguard) in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The Peterborough studio {{opened in}} a single office in Broadway Court, rented from Peterborough Development Corporation, the body {{responsible}} for the city's expansion as a New Town. The broadcasting equipment was two Studer tape recorders, a four-channel mixer and two microphones, which were placed on a table surrounded by mobile <b>sound</b> <b>baffles.</b> Ian Cameron, the first broadcaster from there the day Radio Cambridgeshire opened, realised {{at the last moment}} that the wall behind the temporary studio abutted the office block's lavatories and asked the staff in Cambridge to listen while he flushed the cistern. Nothing could be heard and the broadcast went ahead without fear of others in the office block inadvertently disturbing it.|$|R
5000|$|In English-speaking {{versions}} of the game, Shulk is voiced by Adam Howden. He was given {{instructions on how to}} portray Shulk, largely that he should have a neutral English accent, intelligent, [...] "not [...] ", and fierce when necessary. Howden was never given a full-script of the game, something done on purpose so that he could more realistically sound surprised at the game's various plot-twists. He was, however, informed of the story progression shortly before he would have to voice it, as to not have him <b>sound</b> <b>baffled</b> all the time either. Shulk's dialogue was continually revised throughout the sessions, in efforts to make it more natural sounding, though Howden would still listen and study the Japanese version of the game to capture the same emotions as said version.|$|R
500|$|Grohl's garage was {{equipped}} with microphones, <b>sound</b> <b>baffles</b> on the garage door and behind the drums to prevent sound leakings, and a carpet under the drum kit {{to make it sound}} less [...] "loud and bright". To reduce the cymbal bleed, the microphones were rearranged and the crash cymbal was traded for a [...] "shorter-decay Zildjian cymbal with holes drilled in it". A room next to the study was turned into an isolation booth to record the vocals. For the recording itself a makeshift control room was built inside a tent on the backyard, and a system of two cameras and a television provided the communication between the garage and the control room. The equipment was the same the band employed to record the albums There Is Nothing Left to Lose and One by One at Grohl's former house in Alexandria, Virginia.|$|R
40|$|Noise {{reverberation}} in micro distillery tasting rooms {{can interfere}} with speech communication and negatively impact the acoustic quality of live music. Noise reverberation was characterized in a tasting room in Butte, MT by calculated and quantified methods. <b>Sound</b> absorbing <b>baffles</b> were then installed {{in an effort to}} reduce reverberation and improve room acoustics. The overall reverberation time and speech interference level were decreased by measureable amounts that corresponded with an increase in overall absorption in the space. Reverberation time decreased from 0. 85 seconds to 0. 49 seconds on average. As shown by a customer survey given before and after the installation, the customer experience was also improved {{as a result of the}} <b>sound</b> absorbing <b>baffles.</b> Other distilleries or breweries may benefit by applying similar sound reverberation assessment and control methods in spaces where customers frequent...|$|R

5000|$|After Paracelsus-Bad, {{the line}} {{continues}} under Lindauer Allee to Lindauer Allee station, {{the only one}} on the U8 to have outside platforms. After a long curve, the U8 is running under the S-Bahn. The location of the next station requires a long walk to transfer between the two. There was also disagreement concerning the name of this station: the S-Bahn station at this point was called Wittenau (Kremmener Bahn), to distinguish it from Wittenau (Nordbahn) (which is now Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm) to match the U-Bahn station). The U-Bahn station was to be called Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik after the psychiatric clinic. This was a mouthful that was only slowly accepted. On the S-Bahn, to this day [...] "Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik" [...] is announced but the shorter [...] "Karl-Bonhoeffer-Klinik" [...] appears on signs. The subway line then continues under the clinic. To minimise disturbance, this stretch of tunnel was excavated using a shield, and rubber <b>sound</b> <b>baffling</b> was also needed. This attracted repeated criticism from those who would have preferred open tunnelling with shoring up of buildings. Other problems also arose during construction of this stretch of line: the Brandenburg sand made work particularly difficult and numerous oversized boulders (glacial erratics) caused delays.|$|R
5000|$|After moving {{briefly to}} Los Angeles and New York City before {{returning}} to Massachusetts, in early 1998 the band signed with New York City-based Indie label Royalty Records (now defunct) and recorded tracks at Slaughterhouse Studios in Hadley, Massachusetts with Mark Alan Miller (Dinosaur Jr., Pernice Brothers) and Jon Marshall Smith (Joey Ramone, Murphy's Law), for an album to be called Retarder (after a type of <b>sound</b> <b>baffling</b> used in the studio). When the band delivered the album and its cover artwork several weeks later, Royalty refused to release the album with its band-designed cover art, and agreed to sell the master tapes back to the band. The band later signed to TVT Records and the album was remixed at Avatar Studios by Kevin Shirley (Iron Maiden, Rush), who also produced two additional tracks, [...] "Too Much Is Never Enough" [...] and [...] "We Like To Drink And We Like To Play Rock And Roll". The band began touring in North America and Europe with bands including Motörhead, Nashville Pussy, The Headstones, The Black Halos, Chevelle, and California stoner rock band Fu Manchu, {{as well as with}} the heavy metal bands Dokken, Great White, Sebastian Bach, Dio, Anthrax, and Def Leppard. Retarder was released on TVT in 2000.|$|R
50|$|In the tweeter market, the AMT competes against electrostatic, {{ribbon and}} {{electrodynamic}} tweeters. While apparently very {{good as a}} mid-tweeter or full tweeter, the AMT is not commonly employed in lower frequency speakers. This is due mainly to the AMT's characteristics of a dipole sound radiator, which makes enclosure in traditional speaker cabinets difficult without sacrificing sound quality or employing <b>sound</b> reflex <b>baffles.</b> Crossover points are design decisions (depending on the model ESS was using a cut-off frequency of 12 db at 800 Hz, 1 kHz, {{or in the case}} of the smaller air-motion transformer unit, 2.4 kHz).|$|R
60|$|The Elizabeth and the Infanta, leading side by side, {{were almost}} {{abreast of the}} fort before their shadowy bulks and the soft gurgle of water at their prows were {{detected}} by the Spaniards, whose attention until that moment had been all on the other side. And now there arose on the night air such a <b>sound</b> of human <b>baffled</b> fury as may have resounded about Babel at the confusion of tongues. To heighten that confusion, and to scatter disorder among the Spanish soldiery, the Elizabeth emptied her larboard guns into the fort as she was swept past on the swift ebb.|$|R
5000|$|In {{describing}} a 2000 New York Public Theater performance of Antony and the Johnsons at Joe's Pub, a reviewer for Brainwashed discussed the single of this song stating that [...] "since nothing is quite as fascinating as horror, I found myself returning repeatedly to [...] "Cripple and the Starfish", {{and to my}} utter surprise discovered that I was hooked." [...] That same year a reviewer for The Wire praised the song's emotional impact by saying that it <b>sounds</b> [...] "as <b>baffling</b> and as upsetting in its fuller CD context" [...] as it did as a single.|$|R
5000|$|Cooper's albums {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the 1980s have been referred to by Cooper as his [...] "blackout albums" [...] because he cannot remember recording them, owing to the influence of illicit substances. Flush the Fashion, Special Forces, Zipper Catches Skin and DaDa saw a gradual commercial decline, with the last two not denting the Billboard Top 200. Flush the Fashion, produced by Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker, had a thick, edgy new wave musical <b>sound</b> that <b>baffled</b> even longtime fans, though it still yielded the US Top 40 hit [...] "Clones (We're All)". Special Forces featured a more aggressive but consistent new wave style, and included a new version of [...] "Generation Landslide". His tour for Special Forces marked Cooper's last time on the road for nearly five years; it was not until 1986, for Constrictor, that he toured again. 1982's Zipper Catches Skin was a more pop punk-oriented recording, containing many quirky high-energy guitar-driven songs along with his most unusual collection of subject matters for lyrics. 1983 marked the return collaboration of producer Bob Ezrin and guitarist Dick Wagner for the haunting epic DaDa, the final album in his Warner Bros. contract.|$|R
50|$|Inconel {{is often}} {{encountered}} in extreme environments. It {{is common in}} gas turbine blades, seals, and combustors, as well as turbocharger rotors and seals, electric submersible well pump motor shafts, high temperature fasteners, chemical processing and pressure vessels, heat exchanger tubing, steam generators and core components in nuclear pressurized water reactors, natural gas processing with contaminants such as H2S and CO2, firearm <b>sound</b> suppressor blast <b>baffles,</b> and Formula One, NASCAR, NHRA, and APR, LLC exhaust systems. It is also used in the turbo system of the 3rd generation Mazda RX7, and the exhaust systems of high powered rotary engined Norton motorcycles where exhaust temperatures reach more than 1,000 degrees C. Inconel is increasingly used in the boilers of waste incinerators. The Joint European Torus and DIII-D (fusion reactor) tokamaks vacuum vessels are made in Inconel. Inconel 718 is commonly used for cryogenic storage tanks, downhole shafts and wellhead parts.|$|R
5000|$|From a {{technological}} standpoint, the Black Ark {{was at the}} low end in comparison to the international music recording standards of its day. The studio's legendary reputation stems from the innovative production techniques employed by Perry to create <b>sounds</b> that <b>baffled</b> his contemporaries, and which have continued {{to be a source of}} amazement to later generations of music producers. An example of Perry's inventive style was his ability to overdub layers of sound effects and instrumentation on each recording track of a basic 4-track machine, with such precise timing and in such a way that the resulting sound would destroy the competition from Jamaica's other top producers using the latest 16-track mixing consoles. Perry once buried microphones at the base of a palm tree and thumped it rhythmically to produce a mystifying bass drum effect and his drum booth at the Black Ark was for a time surrounded with chicken wire to further his distinctive sound. Many of his songs are layered with a variety of subtle effects created from broken glass, ghastly sighs and screeches, crying babies, falling rain and cow noises. While it was thought to believe that Perry recorded the [...] "mooing" [...] noises from actual cows, it was actually the baritone voice of Watty Burnett through a tin foil laced cardboard tube that produced the cow-like noises. These and other notable recording techniques helped define the Black Ark sound, as well as Lee Perry's creative legacy.|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the state-of-the-art in silencer measurements the draft standard DIN EN 31 820, 'Acoustics - measurement of silencer in situ', describes supplementary flow measurements and the evaluation of insertion and transmission loss data under consideration of field corrections proposed {{for a number of}} cases listed in a matrix of application conditions. For verification of the concept and practicable implementation in the standard, measurements have been carried out on numerous silencers. Results from silencer measurements are compared to manufacturers' data and to calculated values. Inconsistencies of theoretical data presented in the literature and the practical need for consideration of additional parameters gave rise to the evaluation and further development of theoretical models on sound propagation in fibrous absorbers, on the attenuation in rectangular and circular ducts lined with non-isotropical material, and on pressure loss and regenerated <b>sound</b> in parallel <b>baffle</b> silencers. The results have been implemented in a new issue of the guideline VDI 2567, 'Noise control by silencers', {{in order to reduce the}} gap existing between theory, laboratory data and field performance of silencers.

40|$|At present, new {{buildings}} are frequently built by thermally active concrete ceilings {{due to the}} requirements of thermal comfort and energy saving. Thus <b>sound</b> absorbers (sails, <b>baffles)</b> are installed below the ceiling in order not to deteriorate thermal efficiency. This frequently collides with architectural design asking for planar surfaces. A periodic arrangement of sound-absorbent strips in concrete ceilings shows higher sound absorption than is to be expected from surface-averaged sound absorption. This is well known, since the ceiling behaves like an acoustic phase grating. The challenge for acoustic consultants is to design periodic ceiling structures {{in a way that the}} sound absorption is adequate to keep thermal losses as low as possible. Based on the socalled Rayleigh expansion, frequently published so far, a simple model was derived to predict sound absorption at normal, oblique and field incidence. The model was validated by means of measurements and calculations for two types of absorbers: a micro-perforated resonator and a porous absorber made of recycled glass. The measured and computed results comply at normal incidence, whereas discrepancy between measurements and calculations is clearly higher at field incidence. It is assumed that this behavior is mainly due to the edge effect. The findings of a demonstration project in situ are: sound absorption achieved by means of periodic strips in concrete ceilings is adequate for usual office use, thermal losses are very low, but implementation at the construction site requires further improvement. Part of this text was previously published in the proceedings of INTER-NOISE 2008...|$|R
