40|$|It {{has long}} {{been one of the}} most {{important}} problems in the practice of medicine to solve a riddle of rheumatoid factor, an agglutinating activating factor. This paper is a serological approach to rheumatoid factor. Although several <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> have been widely performed in differentiating rheumatoid arthritis been widely performed in differentiating rheumatoid arthritis from the similar disease and the specificity of <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> is still in dispute, comparative studies of these <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> and mutral relations between these reactions and the forms of rheumatoid arthritis are not yet enough and clearly discussed. Comparison of three <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> (RA-test, Waaler-Rose Reaction, modified Waaler-Rose Reaction) and paper electrophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis were simultaneously performed as to approximately 250 cases of sera obtained from the patients of rheumatoid arthritis and similar disease. The results were summarized as follows : 1) Three <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> showed various strength-degree of agglutination, regardless of the form and symptom of rheumatoid arthritis, classified according to the diagnostic criteria of the American Rheumatoid Association. This fact suggested that rheumatoid factor would be made up of multiple components. 2) Inhibition tests of three <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> demonstrated non-significant inclination notwithstanding the nature of α-globulin (7 S α-globulin or 19 S α-globulin), but the difference in activating strength of rheumatoid factor was observed in each serum. 3) Paper electrophoresis of the patients 2 ̆ 7 sera showed an increase in a_ 1 -and α_ 2 -globulin levels, and corresponding to this increase, characteristic precipitation lines, β_ 2 M and α_ 2 M, were observed in immunoelectrophoresis...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the cross immunological relationship that exists between two closely related types of group B hemolytic streptococci. Overlapping <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> have recently been shown by the work of many investigators to occur with somewhat more frequency than was formerly supposed. They have been observed between both related and unrelated bacterial species since the early investigations of Gruber and Durham and others (1), who studied particularly the Gram-negative bacilli. Among the Gram-positive cocci, however, knowledge of such complicating immunological relationships is more recent, while chemical studies, necessary for a true understanding of the mechanism underlying these <b>serological</b> <b>reactions,</b> are still in the initial stages.

40|$|Serological {{techniques}} and restriction enzyme cleavage patterns of total DNA {{were used to}} differentiate strains of Agrobacterium spp. Forty-five wild-type and plasmid-cured Agrobacterium strains were tested by immunodiffusion and immunofluorescence against polyclonal antisera to a crude ribosome preparation from Agrobacterium strains K 84, U 11, B 6, A 323, NT 1, and C 58. In immunodiffusion gels, these antisera reacted only with water-phenol extracts of the homologous strain, producing a single, strain-specific precipitin line. In contrast, when the same antisera were used in immunofluorescence staining, cross-reactions occurred with {{a limited number of}} heterologous Agrobacterium strains. However, the cross-reacting heterologous cells fluoresced generally less brightly than the homologous cells. When the EcoRI-digested DNA profiles from the same Agrobacterium strains were compared, 34 distinct cleavage patterns were observed. The DNA profiles were the same for all strains sharing a common chromosomal background and correlated with the strain-specific <b>serological</b> <b>reaction.</b> The presence or absence of plasmid DNA did not alter the strain-specific <b>serological</b> <b>reaction</b> or the DNA cleavage patterns. Both the <b>serological</b> <b>reaction</b> and the restriction enzyme digestion of total DNA were complementary to each other.

40|$|Guaroa virus (GROV), a {{segmented}} {{virus in}} the genus Orthobunyavirus, {{has been linked}} to the Bunyamwera serogroup (BUN) through cross-reactivity in complement fixation assays of S segment-encoded nucleocapsid protein determinants, and also to the California serogroup (CAL) through cross-reactivity in neutralization assays of M segment-encoded glycoprotein determinants. Phylogenetic analysis of the S-segment sequence supported a closer relationship to the BUN serogroup for this segment and it was hypothesized that the <b>serological</b> <b>reaction</b> may indicate genome-segment reassortment. Here, cloning and sequencing of the GROV M segment are reported. Sequence analysis indicates an organization similar to that of other orthobunyaviruses, with genes in the order GNâ€“nsmâ€“gC, and mature proteins generated by protease cleavage at one, and by signalase at possibly three, sites.

40|$|Whereas {{the usual}} <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> involve {{the use of}} highmolecular antigens of unknown constitution, a method has been {{described}} in a previous paper (1) which permits of the application of <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> to compounds of simple chemical composition.

40|$|Five cases (three {{children}} {{and two young}} women) of sterile inflammatory arthritis are described, each preceded by a streptococcal infection.

The diagnosis of a definite recent streptococcal infection is sometimes difficult as throat swabs may be negative and the diagnostic <b>serological</b> <b>reaction</b> missed unless antibodies to multiple antigens (particularly antistreptolysin O and DNAase B) are tested.

40|$|During {{the last}} four years, an {{increasing}} number of cattle herds were classified positive by brucellosis screening tests in areas of Belgium and France free of the disease. No clinical symptom of brucellosis was reported in these animals and no Brucella abortus strains were isolated. After two years, no brucellosis outbreak was registered in all of the herds concerned. On this basis, all the <b>serological</b> <b>reactions</b> observed were classified as false positive. An ELISA using Yersinia Outer membrane Proteins (YOPs) as antigens was developed in order to discriminate between a Yersinia enterocolitica O: 9 infection and a Brucella abortus infection.
