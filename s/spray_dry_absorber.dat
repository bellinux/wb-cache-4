40|$|Based on the {{previous}} years` studies concerning the efficiency of SO{sub 2 } removal by spray dryers with high sulfur coal flue gas, the work for year five included investigations of lime dissolution rates at different slaking conditions and with the effect of additives. The prominent additives that have significant effects on lime dissolution rates were tested with the mini pilot <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> <b>absorber</b> to see their effects on <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> desulfurization applications. The mechanisms of these additive effects along with the properties of hygroscopic additives have been discussed and incorporated into the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> desulfurization model ``SPRAYMOD-M. `` Slaking conditions are very important factors in producing high quality lime slurry in <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> desulfurization processes. At optimal slaking conditions, the slaked lime particles are very fine (3 - 5 {mu}m) and the slaked lime has high BET surface areas which are beneficial to the desulfurization. The slaked lime dissolution rate experiments in our study are designed {{to determine how much}} lime can dissolve in a unit time if the initial lime surface area is kept constant. The purpose of the dissolution rate study for different additives is to find those effective additives that can enhance lime dissolution rates and to investigate the mechanisms of the dissolution rate enhancement properties for these additives. The applications of these additives on <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> desulfurization are to further verify the theory that dissolution rate is a rate limiting step in the whole <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> desulfurization process as well as to test the feasibility of these additives on enhancing SO{sub 2 } removal in spray dryers...|$|R

Dissolution and triboelectric charging was also conducted. The {{results showed that the}} <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM alone, without GLU produced some PXM form II (DSC results) with no enhancement in solubility relative to that of the parent PXM. XRPD results also showed the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process to decrease the crystallinity of GLU and solid dispersions produced. The presence of GLU improved the dissolution rate of PXM. <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM: GLU at a ratio of 2 : 1 had the most improved dissolution. The <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process generally yielded PXM-GLU spherical particles of around 2. 5 µm which {{may have contributed to the}} improved dissolution. PXM showed a higher tendency for charging in comparison to the carrier GLU (- 3. 8 versus 0. 5 nC/g for untreated material and - 7. 5 versus 3. 1 nC/g for <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> materials). <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> GLU demonstrated higher charge densities than untreated PXM and untreated GLU, respectively. Regardless of PXM:GLU ratio, all <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM:GLU solid dispersions showed a negligible charge density (net-CMR: 0. 1 – 0. 3 3 nC/g). <b>Spray</b> <b>drying</b> of PXM:GLU solid dispersions can be used to produce formulation powders with practically no charge and thereby improving handling as well as dissolution behaviour of PXM...|$|R

M. smegmatis that are <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> from stationary phase, subjected to accelerated temperature stress conditions, regrown to stationary phase, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> again, and resubmitted to this same process four consecutive times, display, on the fourth <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> iteration, an approximate ten-fold increase in stability during accelerated temperature stress testing, surviving up to 105 days. Microarray tests revealed significant differences in genetic expression of M. smegmatis between log phase and stationary phase conditions, between naïve (non spray-dried) and multiply cycled dried M. smegmatis (in log and stationary phase), and between M. smegmatis in the dry powder state following a single <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> operation and after four consecutive <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> operations. These differences, and other phenotypical differences, point to the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway as a probable pathway contributing to bacteria survival in the spray-dried state and suggests strategies for <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> {{that may lead to}} significantly greater room-temperature stability of mycobacteria, including mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the current TB vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Objective(s) : This {{study was}} {{performed}} aiming {{to investigate the}} effect of particle engineering via <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> of hydroalcoholic solution on solid states and physico-mechanical properties of acetaminophen.   Materials and Methods: <b>Spray</b> <b>drying</b> of hydroalcoholic solution (25 % v/v ethanol/water) of acetaminophen (5 % w/v) {{in the presence of}} small amounts of polyninylpyrrolidone K 30 (PVP) (0, 1. 25, 2. 5 and 5 % w/w based on acetaminophen weight) was carried out. The properties of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> particles namely morphology, surface characteristics, particle size, crystallinity, dissolution rate and compactibility were evaluated. Results: <b>Spray</b> <b>drying</b> process significantly changed the morphology of acetaminophen crystals from acicular (rod shape) to spherical microparticle. Differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) studies ruled out any polymorphism in <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> samples, however, a major reduction in crystallinity up to 65 %, especially for those containing 5 % w/w PVP was observed. <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> acetaminophen particles especially those obtained in the presence of PVP exhibited an obvious improvement of the dissolution and compaction properties.

Gallic acid, used as chemical marker, was quantified by HPLC in the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders. Carrageenan-induced inflammatory and allodynic responses in the mouse paw were used as pharmacological models. Quantitative and qualitative differences among chemical composition of different herb parts were observed. The oral administration of leaves or leaves plus stems <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the carrageenan-induced allodynic effect (42 ± 5 and 54 ± 3 %, respectively). Additionally, the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves significantly reduced carrageenan-induced paw oedema (35 ± 6 %). The <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of roots, stems, or the mixture of leaves, stems and roots (100 mg/kg, p. o.) did not exhibit antiallodynic or antioedematogenic effect in the same model. In conclusion, differences in the chemical composition of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders from P. niruri are reflected in their in vivo pharmacological actions. Despite of a direct relationship of anti-inflammatory and antiallodynic effects with the gallic acid content had been observed, especially in the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves, the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves plus stems showed to be more effective, suggesting a synergic effect between their constituents...|$|R

Methods: The sCT-CS-NPs were prepared by the ionic gelation method using sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking polyion. Inhalable dry powders were obtained by co-spray drying aqueous dispersion of sCT-CS-NPs and mannitol. sCT-CS-NPs co-spray dried powders were characterized with respect to morphology, particle size, powder density, aerodynamic diameter, protein integrity, in vitro release of sCT, and aerosolization. The plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration of sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders to the rats was also determined. Results: sCT-CS-NPs were able to be incorporated into mannitol forming inhalable microparticles by the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process. The sCT-CS-NPs/mannitol ratios and <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process affected the properties of the microparticles obtained. The conformation of the secondary structures of sCTs was affected by both mannitol content and <b>spray</b> <b>dry</b> inlet temperature. The sCT-CS-NPs were recovered after reconstitution of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders in an aqueous medium. The sCT release profile from <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders was similar to that from sCT-CS-NPs. In vitro inhalation parameters measured by the Andersen cascade impactor indicated sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders having promising aerodynamic properties for deposition in the deep lung. Determination of the plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration to rats revealed that the inhalable sCT-CS NPs <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders provided higher protein absorption compared to native sCT powders.

40|$|The use {{of growth}} {{promoting}} and therapeutic antibiotics in piglet feed {{has been a}} concerning subject {{over the last few}} decades because of the risk of generating antimicrobial resistance that could be transferred to humans. As a result, many products have been proposed as potential alternatives to the use of antibiotics, and among these, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma {{is considered one of the}} most promising. However, there have been concerns about its biosafety, particularly during periods of emergence or re-emergence of swine diseases in different regions of the world, such as the recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak in North America. The objectives of this paper are to review recent publications about the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pig diets, the possible mechanisms of action of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma, and the existing evidence related to the biosafety of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> animal plasma.

The excipients investigated were lactose, polyethylene glycol 4000, polyethylene glycol 20, 000, polyethylene oxide 300, 000 and chitosan. The drugs investigated were bendroflumethiazide, salbutamol sulphate, salbutamol base, ipratropium bromide monohydrate, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. The methods of analysis used to characterise the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> systems were powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Energy dispersive X-ray analysis was performed on some samples to determine the presence of certain elements. The effect of co-spray drying lactose with PEG 4000 on the recrystallisation rate of lactose was studied under differing temperature and humidity conditions. Release studies were performed on BFMT/PEG 4000 systems to assess the effect of the modification of the solid-state properties on the dissolution behaviour of BFMT present in the BFMT/PEG co-spray dried composites. Twin stage impinger (TSI) experiments were carried out on systems which had potential for inhalation therapy. Lactose, chitosan, BFMT, salbutamol sulphate and budesonide <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> alone were X- ray amorphous.

40|$|Microalgae are {{exponentially}} growing {{aquatic organisms}} that perform photosynthesis very efficiently. As such, they can realize {{a much higher}} production per square meter than traditional agricultural plants. Furthermore, they are poor in structural polysaccharides and richer in proteins and lipids. Microalgae have a characteristic lipid composition, with fatty acids often differing from those in higher animal and vegetable organisms. They are also rich in carotenoids. In order to use microalgal biomass in food or feed, processing and storage is required. However, these steps can alter the chemical composition of the microalgae. Lipids can be oxidized, lipolysis can occur, carotenoids can be broken down. Therefore, short-term storage of fresh algae was compared to direct lyophilization and <b>spray</b> <b>drying.</b> Furthermore, the influence of different storage times (14 and 35 days) at different temperatures (- 20 °C, 4 °C, 20 °C) was investigated on the vacuum packed lyophilized and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae. The same tests were performed on not vacuum packed lyophilized and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae stored at 4 °C. Total lipid content, EPA content, FFA content, carotenoid content and oxidation were studied parameters. It could be concluded that lyophilization or <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> {{have no effect on}} total lipid content. Storage of the lyophilized and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae neither has an effect on total lipid content. Two days of storage of the fresh microalgal paste at 4 °C gives formation of FFAs which leads to a lower total lipid content. Lyophilized microalgae are more susceptible to lipolysis than <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae, leading to more FFAs upon longer storage. <b>Spray</b> <b>drying</b> leads to loss of carotenoids, but further storage does not lower the carotenoid content further.

40|$|Purpose. Drying of nanosuspensions {{can cause}} destabilization of the particles, leading to {{irreversible}} aggregation. In order to prepare an effective solid dosage form for a nanosuspension, {{it is imperative}} that the spray-dried nanoparticles should go back to their original particle size when reconstituted in an aqueous system. This case study examines impact of various formulation and processing parameters on redispersibility of the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> nanoparticles. Methods. Nanosuspensions were prepared using the microprecipitation–homogenization process. <b>Spray</b> <b>drying</b> of nanosuspensions was achieved using a lab-scale Buchi spray dryer. Results. Formulation components appeared to have the most significant impact on redispersibility of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> particles. Absence of surface charge led to particles that could not be redispersed. On the other hand, charged particles stabilized with an appropriate sugar led to <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders that were flowable and easily redispersible. Dissolution testing showed the presence of two phases—a lag phase that represented dispersion of the loose aggregates, and dissolution of the dispersed nanoparticles. Conclusions. Nanosuspensions of a poorly soluble drug could be <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> to obtain flowable powders that could be easily redispersed. These optimized powders also showed significantly improved dissolution rates as compared to the micronized drug, or unoptimized nanosuspensions.

40|$|Celecoxib, a {{selective}} COX- 2 inhibitor, exhibits poor water solubility, dissolution and flow properties. Thus, {{the aim of}} the present study was to improve the solubility and dissolution rate of celecoxib by preparing crystals by <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> technique using pluronic F 127. Celecoxib crystals were produced by <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> using TBA and water as co-solvent system to enhance solubility and dissolution rate. The prepared crystals were evaluated for solubility and in-vitro dissolution. The prepared formulations were characterized by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Dissolution profile of the prepared <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> crystals was compared with recrystallized sample and pure sample. <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> crystals exhibited decreased crystallinity. The solubility and dissolution of the crystals were significantly improved compared with recrystallized sample and pure sample of celecoxib. The solubility of crystals was found to be three fold more than the pure celecoxib and dissolution of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> crystals showed 76 % release in 60 min while pure sample shows 35 % release in 60 min. Consequently, from the above result it can be concluded that <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> crystals of celecoxib are a useful technique to improve the solubility and dissolution of poorly water soluble drug like celecoxib...|$|R

50|$|Industrial scale <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> {{has been}} around since {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century. It can only be used to dry liquids, as they are sprayed into hot air of up to 575 °F. That way, the heated air mixes with the {{atomized}} liquid and evaporates the moisture within. The solids are recovered as powder. The most common application of <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> is powdered milk. The major disadvantage of <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> is that the high temperatures being used in the process often compromise the flavor, color, texture and bioactivity of the dried product.|$|R
