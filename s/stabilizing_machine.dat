40|$|This paper {{describes}} a combined mathematicalgraphical approach for optimum tool path planning {{in order to}} improve machining efficiency. A methodology has been used that <b>stabilizes</b> <b>machining</b> operations by adjusting material removal rate in pocket milling operations while keeping cutting forces within limits. This increases the life of cutting tool and reduces the risk of tool breakage, machining vibration, and chatter. Case studies reveal the fact that application of this approach could result in a slight increase of machining time, however, a considerable reduction of tooling cost, machining vibration, noise and chatter can be achieved in addition to producing a better surface finish...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) process model is critical in control system for <b>stabilizing</b> <b>machining</b> process and improving productivity. A two order AR model was firstly proposed for the process, but the deduced formulation of the model parameter estimates is proved biased. An instrumental variable approach is then proposed to correct the biased estimates. This approach was completed by two interactive Kalman filters. One filter provides instrumental variables, namely gap state estimates, through the latest estimated parameters; while the other uses the gap state estimates to recursively estimate a two order auto- regressive (AR) model parameters. The two Kalman filters by way of interactively supporting each other forms a new feasible way of online modeling an EDM process...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Mathematical {{models for}} the doubly-fed machine are presented. The {{properties}} of the machine with rotor excitation as supplied by a power converter with voltage source character are reviewed. The peculiar torque-speed characteristic of the machine in this operating mode {{and its effect on}} the stability of the machine are presented. A strategy to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>machine</b> by speed feedback is discussed. With rotor excitation supplied by a converter in current source mode, the developed torque is found to be independent of slip. Conditions for stable operation are given. The goal of this thesis is to find a control strategy which effectively <b>stabilizes</b> the <b>machine</b> by simple and practical means. Two stabilizing feedback control strategies are investigated. An analysis is presented, showing that the <b>machine</b> can be <b>stabilized</b> through either of these control strategies. They lead to the possibility of securing stability through a practical and convenient feedback of the machine speed. This feedback only involves an amplifier with fixed gain, independent of load conditions and machine slip...|$|R
40|$|While {{historically}} hydrogen {{has been}} considered an impurity in titanium, when used as a temporary alloying agent it promotes beneficial changes to material properties that increase the hot-workability of the metal. This technique known as thermohydrogen processing was used to temporarily alloy hydrogen with commercially pure titanium sheet {{as a means of}} facilitating the friction stir welding process. Specific alloying parameters were developed to increase the overall hydrogen content of the titanium sheet ranging from commercially pure to 30 atomic percent. Each sheet was evaluated to determine the effect of the hydrogen content on process loads and tool deformation during the plunge phase of the friction stir welding process. Two materials, H- 13 tool steel and pure tungsten, were used to fabricate friction stir welding tools that were plunged into each of the thermohydrogen processed titanium sheets. Tool wear was characterized and variations in machine loads were quantified for each tool material and weld metal combination. Thermohydrogen processing was shown to beneficially lower plunge forces and <b>stabilize</b> <b>machine</b> torques at specific hydrogen concentrations. The resulting effects of hydrogen addition to titanium metal undergoing the friction stir welding process are compared with modifications in titanium properties documented in modern literature. Such comparative analysis is used to explain the variance in resulting process loads {{as a function of the}} initial hydrogen concentration of the titanium...|$|R

The feasibility of influencing the dynamic fluid film coefficients (stiffness and damping) by means of a controllable fluid injection into opposed bearing recesses is investigated. By controlling the pressure and flow injection using servo control systems, it is possible to obtain significant modifications of active hybrid forces, which can be useful while reducing vibration and <b>stabilizing</b> rotating <b>machines...</b>|$|R

ZETA {{was by far the}} largest fusion device of its era, and equipped with all of the latest equipment. At the time, almost all fusion research was classified, so progress on ZETA was generally unknown outside the labs working on it. However, in 1956 the walls started to come down, and when they visited ZETA at Harwell, US researchers became aware that they were about to be trumped.

When the device was fired, this field added to the one created by the current in the plasma. The result was that the formerly straight magnetic field was twisted into a helix, which the particles followed as they travelled around the tube {{under the influence of the}} current. A particle near the outside of the tube that would want to kink outward would travel along these lines until it found itself on the inside of the tube, where its outward-directed motion would bring it back into the centre of the plasma.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} world, modern power system networks, being a {{complicated}} combination of generators, transmission lines, transformers, circuit breakers and other devices, {{are more vulnerable}} to various types of faults causing stability problems. Among these faults, transient fault {{is believed to be}} a major disturbance as it causes large damage to a sound system within a certain period of time.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the subject of flying {{vehicles}} propelled by flapping wings, also known as ornithopters, has been an area of interest because of its application to micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). These miniature vehicles seek to mimic small birds and insects to achieve never before seen agility in flight.

50|$|Etienne Oehmichen {{experimented with}} {{rotorcraft}} designs in the 1920s. Among the six designs he tried, his helicopter No.2 had four rotors and eight propellers, all {{driven by a}} single engine. The Oehmichen No.2 used a steel-tube frame, with two-bladed rotors {{at the ends of}} the four arms. The angle of these blades could be varied by warping. Five of the propellers, spinning in the horizontal plane, <b>stabilized</b> the <b>machine</b> laterally. Another propeller was mounted at the nose for steering. The remaining pair of propellers functioned as its forward propulsion. The aircraft exhibited a considerable degree of stability and increase in control-accuracy for its time, and made over a thousand test flights during the middle 1920s. By 1923 it was able to remain airborne for several minutes at a time, and on April 14, 1924 it established the first-ever FAI distance record for helicopters of 360 m. It demonstrated the ability to complete a circular course and later, it completed the first 1 km closed-circuit flight by a rotorcraft.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The {{exceptional}} {{feature of}} the brushless doubly-fed machine {{is the lack of}} need for frequent replacement of brushes. The inherent instability of this machine has to be overcome for its application in adjustable speed drives and variable speed generation systems. Specific objectives were: to study the characteristics of the machine pertinent to its application in adjustable speed drives and variable speed generation systems, to develop a stabilizer depending {{on the nature of the}} instability. The brushless doubly-fed machine was found to be unstable over much of the useful operating range.

The situation is complicated first by Wolverine's team, which comes through the portal to take Kurt back to their reality, and then by Dazzler and her team of X-treme X-Men, who seem keen to close the portal. As Xavier of the X-treme X-Men uses his powers to try and close the portal three huge monsters emerge from it. Xavier tries to tell them they mean no harm but one of the monsters kills him and dissolves his body to absorb its energy. As it does so, it grows slightly bigger.|$|R
40|$|A fast {{feedback}} {{system based on}} concepts of modern control theory has been implemented in the CEBAF Control System to <b>stabilize</b> various <b>machine</b> parameters. The continuous wave operation of CEBAF requires that parameters such as beam energy and position are stabilized against fast fluctuations. The beam energy must be stabilized against fast gradient and phase fluctuations in the RF accelerating system. This fast {{feedback system}} currently operates at 60 Hz rate and is integrated with EPICS. The mathematical model of the system for various feedback loops is expressed in state space formalism. The design of control law and simulation of closed-loop system response is performed using MatlabTM and SimulinkTM. This paper describes the process of designing control algorithms, implementation of the fast feedback system and operational experience with this system at CEBAF. The performance of this feedback system, while operating at much higher rates with high closed loop gain, can be enhanced by continually performing on-line identification of the system from the input and output data. System identification {{is the process of}} developing or improving an analytically derived mathematical representation of a physical system using experimental data.

Electron bunches from 20 pC to 1 nC will be produced with a length of a few ps in the RF gun and compressed by three orders of magnitude in three bunch compressor (BC) stages. European XFEL is designed to operate at 10 Hz delivering bunch trains with up to 2700 bunches separated by 222 ns. The high intra-bunch train repetition rate offers the unique possibility of <b>stabilizing</b> the <b>machine</b> with an intra-bunch train feedback, which puts in turn very high demand on fast longitudinal diagnostics. Two different systems will be installed in several positions of the machine. Five bunch compression monitors (BCM) will monitor the compression factor of each BC stage and used for intra-bunch train feedbacks.

40|$|The {{handbook}} {{does not}} attempt to define a single “best ” system for any site. Instead, it presumes that readers {{need to be aware}} of the key factors that influence the probability of achieving success with any given combination of equipment and site characteristics. Readers will then use their own judgement to evaluate the merits of the various options. The information in the handbook should be considered only as part of an overall process for equipment selection which will vary from company to company. To improve their productivity, loader-forwarders are used to great advantage with other machines such as grapple yarders and skidders, especially when working around sensitive zones. The loader-forwarders can travel close to the sensitive zones, extract the logs without encroaching on the protected areas, and place the logs in a more advantageous position for the primary equipment to reach. This technique can be more economical for the overall system. Excavators are highly mobile machines that can traverse a wide variety of terrain. The grapple can be used to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>machine</b> on steep ground to minimize the danger of overturning. Since there is only one worker with the machine, the hazard to other personnel is low. Sideslope and soil type govern the limit to safe operation. The maximum sideslope for using a loader-forwarder is about 25 – 35 %, especially if the sideslope is uniform. For more broken terrain, loader-forwarders can operate on steeper terrain, provided that they can travel and work safely on an acceptable route through the steep ground. Loader-forwarders cannot work safely on thin soils overlaying bedrock because of the danger of sliding. However, the hazard can be reduced by using flotation mats. The sliding hazard is aggravated with snowfall...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCryogenic {{machining}} of porous tungsten is {{an effective}} method to achieve as-machined porous surfaces. Dispenser cathodes, which are high performance electron emitting devices, rely on the (surface) porosity of porous tungsten for their functionality. Conventional (dry, flood, MQL) machining results in unwanted smearing of surface pores and {{requires the use of}} a plastic infiltrant to <b>stabilize</b> pores during <b>machining.</b> Previous studies have shown the ability of PCD tools to achieve controlled micro-fracture which occurs only at low cutting speeds (vc∼ 10 - 20 m/min) along with cryogenic cooling. This study investigates the influence of cryogenic pre-cooling time and depth of cut on the attainable surface morphology of porous tungsten. Negative rake cermet tool inserts were used to demonstrate the ability of non-diamond tools to achieve similar results. Three cryogenic pre-cooling times (60, 120 and 180 s) are compared to establish their relative effectiveness in enabling the infiltrant-free cryogenic machining of porous tungsten with the objective of achieving maximum surface porosity. It is found that increased pre-cooling time increases the as- machined surface porosity and significantly alters the deformation mechanism during machining. Lastly, a qualitative relationship between the chips generated during the cryogenic machining and as-machined surface porosity is laid out...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{analysis}} {{and control of}} delayed systems {{are becoming more and}} more research topics in progress. This is mainly due to the fact that the delay is frequently encountered in technological systems. This can affect their significantly operations. Most control command laws are based on current digital computers and delays are intrinsic to the process or in the control loop caused by the transmission time control sequences, or computing time. The delay may affect one or more states of the considered system. It may also affect the establishment of the command. Several studies have investigated the stability of delay systems under the assumption that the delay is a variable phenomenon; such variation is considered to be bounded or limited to facilitate analysis of the system. In this study we propose a modelling of delayed system by using the multimodels and switched system theory. The analysis of stability is based on the use of second Lyapunov method. The issued stability conditions are expressed as Bilinear Matrix Inequalities impossible to resolve. Thats why we propose the same original relaxations to come over this difficulty, an example of induction machine is given to illustrate over approach. Approach: We propose to use the control theory developed for switched systems to synthesis a control laws for the stabilisation of delays system. Results: We <b>stabilize</b> the induction <b>machine</b> around many operating points despite the non linearities. Conclusion: The developed method is less conservative and less pessimistic than the used classical methods...|$|R
40|$|Modular tooling {{provides}} an approach for molders to manufacture multiple different plastic parts during one molding cycle, and to quickly exchange mold cavities according to dynamic production needs. However, {{the capability of}} modular and family tooling to mold parts of very different geometries to tight specifications has been limited by the inability to individually control the flow rate and pressure of the melt {{in each of the}} cavities. Axiomatic design principles were applied to the injection molding process to add control parameters that enable the spatial and dynamic decoupling of multiple quality attributes in the molded part. The developed system, Dynamic Feed, enables the direct controllability of the melt at different locations in a mold. An experimental investigation of the inter-cavity dependencies of a modular tool using Dynamic Feed control is presented. The results show that part weight and overall part dimension are controlled by the individual command pressure to each cavity and the material’s melt temperature. The weight and dimensions of a particular cavity appear independent of the control pressures set to fill the other cavity inserts. This was demonstrated to the extent that weight and dimension showed independence from a deliberate short shot condition in the hardest to fill part. There may be a minor synergistic effect of adjacent cavity pressure and the intentional shorting of alternate parts, but this would need to be confirmed with additional experimentation.
