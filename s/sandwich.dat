5|$|A grilled Italian sausage <b>sandwich</b> {{was sold}} in 1992 and was served with onions and peppers or parmigiana style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. As part of the company's BK Dinner Baskets {{promotion}} in 1993, the chain introduced a grilled meatloaf <b>sandwich</b> with ketchup and onions in the United States. In 2013, Burger King sold a bratwurst <b>sandwich</b> in a regional limited time offering in the US states of Wisconsin and Illinois. The <b>sandwich</b> featured a bratwurst manufactured by Johnsonville Foods, raw onion and yellow mustard. Despite being discontinued, versions of the steak <b>sandwich</b> have been re-released several times since the 1970s. The BK Dinner baskets featured a steak <b>sandwich,</b> and in 2003 Burger King New Zealand introduced the Big Bloke Steak <b>Sandwich</b> which was almost identical to the 1979 <b>sandwich.</b>|$|E
5|$|As noted, the Big King <b>sandwich</b> was {{introduced}} to compete directly with the McDonald's Big Mac <b>sandwich.</b> It joins a group of sandwiches from other vendors that are designed as counters to the more well-known McDonald's <b>sandwich.</b> This includes the Big Shef <b>sandwich</b> originally from now-defunct chain Burger Chef and occasionally produced as a LTO from current trademark owner Hardees.|$|E
5|$|Other LTO {{products}} {{sought to}} expand existing product lines with new base ingredients. The company's 1992 offering, a Meatloaf Specialty <b>Sandwich,</b> was introduced {{as part of}} a push into limited table service. Other LTO variants in its Specialty <b>Sandwich</b> line included an Italian sausage <b>sandwich</b> served in one of three ways: with onions and peppers; parmigiana-style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce; or with all four ingredients. Steak sandwiches were made from steak fillets or later, restructured beef. Other offerings were a ham and cheese <b>sandwich</b> with mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato, and a veal parmigiana <b>sandwich.</b>|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish <b>sandwich</b> offering in North America. Burger King's original fish <b>sandwich,</b> introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish <b>sandwich</b> made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken <b>sandwich</b> in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken <b>sandwich,</b> and renamed the product the Ocean Catch <b>sandwich.</b> When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The <b>sandwich</b> was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big Fish in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The International Chicken Sandwiches {{line was}} {{introduced}} in 1988 and {{is a group of}} three sandwiches with different toppings that are associated with cuisine from various international regions. The Italian Chicken <b>Sandwich</b> is a chicken parmigiana <b>sandwich</b> with marinara sauce and mozzarella, the French Chicken <b>Sandwich</b> is a Chicken Cordon Bleu <b>sandwich</b> with ham and Swiss cheese, and the American Chicken <b>Sandwich</b> has mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and American cheese. Similar regional inspired sandwiches included the Philly Chicken <b>Sandwich,</b> which was a chicken version of a Philly cheesesteak <b>sandwich</b> made with red and green bell peppers, onions and cheese, and the Hawaiian BK Chicken with mayonnaise, lettuce, bacon, American cheese and pineapple sold in New Zealand.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. By {{contrasting}} the two finite models, {{a practical}} finite element computational model of X-cor <b>sandwich’s</b> compressive modulus was proposed. Through numerical analysis the X-cor <b>sandwich’s</b> stress field and compressive modulus were achieved {{and the effects}} of changing Z-pin’s radius, density, angle and volume fraction to the X-cor <b>sandwich’s</b> compressive modulus were analyzed. The numerical analysis results indicate that as the Z-pin’s angle increases the X-cor <b>sandwich’s</b> compressive modulus decreases, as the Z-pin’s radius, density and volume fraction increase the X-cor <b>sandwich’s</b> compressive modulus increases. Through the computation of finite model the influencing trends of X-cor <b>sandwich’s</b> parameters are achieved and the rationality of the proposed finite model is verified...|$|R

5|$|The company {{introduced}} its first broiled chicken <b>sandwich,</b> the BK Broiler, in 1990. The <b>sandwich</b> included a dill-ranch mayonnaise and was {{served on a}}n oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK Broiler into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed {{the name of the}} <b>sandwich</b> to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. <b>sandwich.</b> The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled <b>sandwich</b> line in 2003, the BK Baguette line. The chicken <b>sandwich,</b> served on a fresh cooked baguette roll, and came in several varieties, all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat. They were sold in the United States at one time, but are now sold only in the European market. The failed Baguette line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill <b>sandwich.</b>|$|E

5|$|While most of {{the line}} has since been discontinued, the company's Original Chicken <b>Sandwich</b> is still offered in North America, Europe and other markets. The ham and cheese <b>sandwich</b> was a {{regional}} offering, however it was reintroduced nationally in the United States as the Yumbo <b>Sandwich</b> in November 2014. The Yumbo name refers to a smaller snack based <b>sandwich</b> from the 1970s and early 1980s which was a heated ham and cheese <b>sandwich</b> served on a smaller, hamburger roll. The Long Fish was discontinued and the Whaler fish <b>sandwich</b> was reintroduced in 1983, while the Steak Burger <b>sandwich</b> was discontinued altogether.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the deformation theory of <b>sandwiched</b> singularities in terms of ffi -constant deformations of plane curves, and a divisor of points on it.

The topology of a smoothing can be described completely {{in terms of the}} associated picture. Introduction <b>Sandwiched</b> singularities belong to the simplest class of rational surface singularities. A surprisingly large number of geometerically relevant singularities can be given the structure of a <b>sandwiched</b> singularity: cyclic quotient singularities, or more generally rational singularities with a reduced fundamental cycle are <b>sandwiched.</b> In all these cases, the <b>sandwiched</b> structure is not given naturally, and in fact, it usually happens that there are many 1 different ways to get a <b>sandwiched</b> representation.

5|$|In 2004, BK {{introduced}} its BK Baguette line of <b>sandwiches</b> designed {{to replace the}} Chicken Whopper. The <b>sandwiches</b> were introduced {{at the insistence of}} the new CEO, former Darden Restaurants executive Bradley (Brad) Blum, shortly after the company was acquired by TPG Capital in 2002. The <b>sandwiches</b> were designed to be a lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 or fewer calories. The line was a health conscious oriented product that got its taste from ingredients instead of fat. They were formally introduced in 2004 as its BK Baguette line of <b>sandwiches,</b> that replacing the Chicken Whopper <b>sandwiches.</b>|$|R

The <b>sandwiches</b> usually have the crusts removed, and are cut into small segments, either as triangles or fingers (also known as tea <b>sandwiches).</b> Biscuits are not usually served.|$|R
5|$|After {{the initial}} testing period, the <b>sandwich</b> was renamed the Big King {{and added to}} the {{national}} menu {{at the end of}} the summer of 1997the first major product introduction since the company added its BK Broiler chicken <b>sandwich</b> in 1990. Unlike the Double Supreme, the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac had, and the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75% more beef claim. However, the new <b>sandwich</b> was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. The <b>sandwich</b> was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the <b>sandwich.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken <b>sandwich</b> was {{introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This <b>sandwich</b> was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the <b>sandwich</b> was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the <b>sandwich</b> had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E
5|$|Fool's Gold Loaf is a <b>sandwich</b> {{made by the}} Colorado Mine Company, a {{restaurant}} in Denver, Colorado.

The sandwich's connection to Elvis Presley {{is the source of}} its legend and prolonged interest. According to The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley, it was the focus of a midnight <b>sandwich</b> run by Elvis Presley and his friends. Taking his private jet from Graceland, Presley and his friends purchased 30 of the sandwiches and spent two hours eating them and drinking Perrier and champagne before flying home. The story became legend and the <b>sandwich</b> became the subject of continued media interest and part of numerous cookbooks, typically focused around Presley's love of food.|$|E
