40|$|This paper {{analyses}} scalar scattering and diffraction from ensembles of coaxial axi-symmetric {{closed or}} open screens that are arbitrarily shaped. Plane wave and complex point source excitations are {{examined in the}} frequency domain by the semi-analytic Method of Regularisation. The Dirichlet boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation is reduced analytically to a well-conditioned coupled infinite system of algebraic equations. This system is then effectively solved by a truncation method with any pre-specified accuracy, strictly depending on the truncation number. Applications related to plane wave excitation include accurate studies of coupled cavity resonators, of open cavities with insertions and of configurations where targets lie in the shadow zone. Our investigation employing beam-like excitation focuses on the accurate analysis of a front-fed parabolic reflector antenna. The tapered illumination is simulated by a complex-point source, supported by a back plate. The maximum permissible extent of the <b>supporting</b> <b>back</b> plate that does not unduly compromise {{the operation of the}} reflector antenna is determined. Numerical results based on the solution and related field plots are presented and discussed. 2 page(s...|$|E

40|$|High-power {{density and}} {{efficiency}} resulting from elimination of rotor windings and reduced magnetic-flux losses {{have made the}} rare earth permanent magnet (PM) motor a leading candidate for the Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies (FCVTs) traction drive motor. These traction drives are generally powered by radial-gap motors, having the magnets on or embedded in a rotating cylinder separated from the inside surface of a slotted cylindrical stator by an annular gap. The two main types of radial-gap PM rotors are those with magnets mounted {{on the surface of}} a <b>supporting</b> <b>back</b> iron, called PM surface mounted (PMSM) motors, and those with magnets mounted in slots in the rotor, called interior PM (IPM) motors. Most early PM motor research was on the PMSM motor, which was thought to have an inherently low stator inductance. A low stator inductance can lead to currents dangerously exceeding rated current as the back-emf across the inductance increases with speed; consequently, part of the attempted solution has been to increase the stator inductance to reduce the rate of current rise. Although analysis suggested {{that there should be no}} problem designing sufficiently high stator inductance into PMSMs, attempts to do so were often not successful and a motor design was sought that would have a higher intrinsic inductance. Commercial research at Toyota has focused on IPM motors because they can achieve a high-saliency ratio, which helps them operate over a high constant power speed ratio (CPSR), but they are more difficult to fabricate. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) position has been to continue research on brushless direct current (dc) motors (BDCMs) because of ease of fabrication and increased power output. Recently there has been a revival of interest in a fractional-slot PMSMs [15] made with concentrated windings because they possess three important features. First, they can increase the motor's inductance sufficiently to reduce the characteristic current to value of the rated current, which will enable them to operate at high CPSR. This feature also limits short-circuit fault currents. Second, their segmented structure simplifies assembly problems and is expected to reduce assembly costs. Third, the back-emf waveform is nearly sinusoidal with low cogging. To examine in depth this design ORNL entered into a collaborative agreement with the University of Wisconsin to build and test a 6 kW laboratory demonstration unit. Design, fabrication, and testing of the unit to 4000 rpm were completed during FY 2005. The motor will be sent to ORNL to explore ways to control its inverter to achieve higher efficiency during FY 2006. This paper first reviews the concept of characteristic current and what is meant by optimal flux weakening. It then discusses application of the fractional-slot concentrated winding technique to increase the d-axis inductance of a PMSM showing how this approach differs from an integral-slot motor with sinusoidal-distributed windings. This discussion is followed by a presentation of collaborative analyses and comparison with the University of Wisconsin's measured data on a 6 kW, 36 -slot, 30 -pole motor with concentrated windings. Finally ORNL presents a PMSM design with integral-slot windings that appears to meet the FreedomCAR Specifications, but has some disadvantages. Further collaboration with the University of Wisconsin is planned for FY 2006 to design a motor that meets FreedomCAR specifications...|$|E
40|$|The thesis explores issues {{relating}} to the secondary music examination curriculum in Hong Kong between 1998 and 2009. In 1998 the number of candidates taking ABRSM and TCL examinations was 50406 but HKALE and HKCEE, the candidate numbers were 18 at AL and 231 at CE level. This thesis seeks to explore reasons {{for the lack of}} interest and uptake by secondary school students of government music exams through an examination of the curriculum and proposed changes to it during the last 10 years. This research, therefore, arises to study music education 1998 – 2009 and in particular to focus on proposed “developments” for 2002 and 2005 both of which were rejected. By 2010 the AL examination had been cancelled and the CE remains unchanged. The thesis explores the marginalization of an area of the school curriculum. After a brief introduction to the research, chapter 2 gives a broad overview of education policy and curriculum development in secondary school music education in Hong Kong. Seven Education Commission Reports concerned with music education policy in secondary schools are examined. Chapter 3 is a more detailed study of music education and the music curriculum in secondary schools in Hong Kong in which some significant studies and surveys in the field are studied. The S. S. M. C. report provides a useful and <b>supporting</b> <b>back</b> up to avoid any double work. In addition, the way in which music is covered and operated in the curriculum in different cultural environments (using the examples of England and Wales and Singapore) has been examined. Chapter 4 discusses the issues raised from the research. Based on the information found, one of the main issues for this research is that the secondary school music teacher has the key role for a successful revolution in Hong Kong secondary music education. Chapter 5 considers the hypotheses and methodologies. The research methods used are direct description with a simple statistical approach. Research methods used for this study include 5 -Likert scales, summarizing content and constant comparative analysis. Furthermore, some tables, figures and documents are provided as a supplement. Chapter 6 examines the data analysis. The results of this research are compared to the results of related researches in section 3. 3. Feedback from target secondary school principals, music teachers, students and representative persons in the field is collected and reported. Chapter 7 is the analysis of findings and discussion. The key finding {{is that most of the}} secondary school music teachers in Hong Kong do not encourage their students to take the HKCEE / HKALE music examinations. This study finds that, as music is neglected at schools, it is reaching a weak position in Hong Kong secondary schools, and its curriculum is threatened. Chapter 8 gives the conclusions, recommendations for further research, limitations and significance of the study in terms of the principal theme. This is the first time any study has investigated the problem concerning secondary school music education in Hong Kong during the years from 1998 to 2009. The answer to the final question raised from this research, whether the Arts Education curriculum being introduced in 2005 is a good substitute for the subject, is still uncertain at this moment.

40|$|Abstract: Absorbed power {{characteristics}} of seated human subjects under fore-aft (x-axis) and lateral (y-axis) vibration are investigated through measurements of dynamic interactions {{at the two}} driving-points formed by {{the body and the}} seat pan, and upper body and the backrest. The experiments involved: (i) three <b>back</b> <b>support</b> conditions (no <b>back</b> <b>support,</b> and <b>back</b> <b>supported</b> against a vertical and an inclined backrest); (ii) three seat pan heights (425, 390 and 350 mm); and three magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 m/s 2 rms acceleration) of band limited random excitations in 0. 5 – 10 Hz frequency range, applied independently along the x- and y- axes. The force responses, measured at the seat pan and the backrest are applied to characterize total energy transfer reflected on the seat pan and the backrest. The mean responses suggest strong contributions due to <b>back</b> <b>support,</b> and direction and magnitude of vibration. In the absence of a <b>back</b> <b>support,</b> the seat pan responses dominated in lower frequency bands centered at 0. 63 and 1. 25 Hz under both directions of motion. Most significant interactions of the upper body against the <b>back</b> <b>support</b> was observed under fore-aft vibration. The addition of <b>back</b> <b>support</b> caused the seat pan response to converge to a single primary peak near a higher frequency of 4 Hz under x-axis, with only little effect on the y-axis responses.

40|$|The <b>back</b> <b>support</b> is an {{integral}} wheelchair component for appropriate seating position and trunk support. Compared to sling <b>back</b> <b>supports,</b> rigid <b>back</b> <b>supports</b> provide improved postural support and better function. As such, many clinicians expect rigid <b>back</b> <b>supports</b> to be more comfortable. However, rigid <b>back</b> <b>supports</b> are often reported to be uncomfortable and difficult to adjust or reposition while the user is seated in the chair. In order to address complaints of discomfort, it may be important to evaluate {{the relationship between the}} contour of the <b>back</b> <b>support</b> and the shape of an individual’s back. Further, difficulty with adjustment could be addressed by designing a mechanism to increase ease of use. The specific aims of this dissertation are to 1) evaluate perceived comfort among wheelchair users using both sling and rigid <b>back</b> <b>supports,</b> 2) use digital anatomic scanning technology to evaluate the backs of wheelchair users in order to classify types of back shapes and compare to <b>back</b> <b>support</b> shapes corresponding levels of comfort, and 3) create a commercial ready prototype of an attachment that increases ease of adjustment – the LightWeight Durable Adjustable Composite (LWDAC) <b>back</b> <b>support</b> bracket. To achieve aim 1, participants were asked to answer survey questions related to level of comfort of the <b>back</b> <b>supports</b> on their personal wheelchair. The questionnaire study shows that the higher discomfort ratings among rigid <b>back</b> <b>support</b> users with tetraplegia may be due to suboptimal shape, fit, adjustment or user experiences. The back scanning study demonstrates that wheelchair users have varying back contours, and commercial products {{may not be able to}} provide proper support to fit every individual. The disparity between the shape of the shell and the shape of an individual wheelchair users’ back may result in skin breakdown which is a serious concern. In accordance with findings from previous aims, a commercial-ready prototype the LWDAC <b>back</b> <b>support</b> bracket was developed and evaluated by wheelchair users traversing activities of daily living courses. Participants reported positive impressions of the prototype and the findings of this study assist in establishing areas for improved comfort and heightened function for manual wheelchair users...|$|R

Two-way repeated measure design assessing lumbar <b>back</b> <b>support</b> tension and submaximal trunk extension moments on trunk muscle electromyographic activity. Background. Biomechanical studies on lumbar <b>back</b> <b>supports</b> often use electromyography (EMG) {{to assess the}} aect on trunk muscle activity. However, the lumbar <b>back</b> <b>support</b> may alter the electromyographic signal by changing the electrode–muscle distance. Methods. Subjects performed trunk extensions at three static submaximal extension moment levels (25 %, 50 % and 75 % MVC) while stabilized at the hips and shoulders, with the <b>back</b> <b>support</b> tensioned to three dierent tightness levels (44. 5, 66. 7 and 89. 0 N) {{as well as a}} no-back support condition. Results. Statistical analysis failed to find a significant eect (P 6 0 : 05) of lumbar <b>back</b> <b>support</b> tension on the average normalized EMG across the 10 trunk muscles sampled. Conclusions. For static experimental tasks, as long as electrodes are protected from direct contact with the <b>back</b> <b>support,</b> studies assessing the eect of lumbar <b>back</b> <b>supports</b> on the trunk muscles via EMG during static tasks are not subject to confounding due to dierences in tensions across subjects. Relevance The {{results of this study suggest}} that variable tensions from previous studies for static exertions with lumbar <b>back</b> <b>supports</b> do not significantly alter the pick-up volume of protected electrodes.
