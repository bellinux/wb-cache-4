Gold and <b>silver</b> <b>cyanide</b> were used as adsorbates in order to quantify the inhibition of mass transfer to activated carbon caused by these effects. Adsorption tests were carried out when prior contact between the carbon and the foulant was followed by gold or silver adsorption, as well as the simultaneous adsorption of gold or silver and the foulant species. These tests were performed in a batch stirred tank reactor and a packed column. UV-spectrophotometry showed that the organics were all adsorbed fairly irreversibly. The Freundlich-type multicomponent isotherm was applied successfully to describe the equilibrium adsorption capacity of gold or silver {{in the presence of a}} single organic foulant. At low organic loadings on the carbon, the reduction in the rate of adsorption of metal cyanides appeared to be a kinetic influence, and could be caused by pore blocking.

40|$|A novel gas rnembrane-ion {{exchange}} process (GM-IX) {{is described}} to treat metal plating wastewaters containing zinc cyanide and recover usable forms of zinc and cyanide. The process uses a strongly basic {{anion exchange resin}} to selectively concentrate the metal cyanides from dilute plating wastes. Following exhaustion, the resin is regenerated under acidic conditions. The metal cyanide complexes are broken down {{as a result of}} HCN production under these acidic conditions, and the acidic regenerant containing the HCN is recirculated through a gas rnenbrane module that is supplied with a caustic stripping solution. Volatile HCN migrates across the gas perneable membranes to be absorbed and neutralized in the NaOH solution. The products of the process include concentrated sodium cyanide solution containing some excess sodium hydroxide, and concentrated acidic zinc sulfate solution that can be treated by an electrowinning process to recover zinc metal and a reusable acid for regeneration. Results of mass transfer studies indicate that the rate of HCN transfer across the gas permeable membrane is rapid and complete. The transfer is largely limited by diffusion within the lumen of the hollow fibers but also is influenced by the reaction rate of HCN with base outside the fibers. The gas permeable membrane provides the basis for effective separation and recovery of cyanide from zinc and cadmium plating wastes. Initial ion exchange is necessary to concentrate dilute metal cyanide solutions such as rinsewaters, but if the wastewater is already concentrated, only acidification is required. Th e zinc cyanide precipitate formed in the resin during regeneration was found to be Zn(CN) 2 (s), Recovery of cyanide from acidified zinc and cadmium cyanide solution is fast and complete when the solution pH is sufficiently acidic to convert the cyanide to the HCN form; above pH 2. 0 the rate of cyanide recovery was slowed by the 1 ow percentage of HCN present at equilibrium. In concentrated zinc cyanide solutions such as may be encountered during regeneration a lower pH is required to convert all the complexed cyanide to HCN. To achieve good regeneration, a strong acid solution and sufficient contact time must be provided to ensure complete cyanide removal. A kinetic model interfaced with a chemical equilibrium model successfully predicted the rate of cyanide recovery as a function of operating pH. Agreement between the predicted and the observed cyanide recovery rates indicated that the dissolution rates of Zn(CN) 2 (s), does not appear to limit the cyanide recovery rate. Rather, the rate is controlled by the cyanide speciation equilibria. Solutions containing copper and <b>silver</b> <b>cyanides</b> are Iess readily treated. The use of organic acids to catalyze the breakdown of these metal cyanides may aid these less tractable solutions.
