Sea of Swords covers the companions' search for Wulfgar's lost magical warhammer, Aegis-fang, and the reunion of the group after an extended separation.|$|E
5|$|It {{is crucial}} for these {{definitions}} that edges are only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many spine crossings.|$|E

As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E
5|$|More {{active at}} night {{than during the}} day when it is usually buried in sediment, the bluntnose {{stingray}} is a predator of small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. This species is aplacental viviparous, in which the unborn young are nourished initially by yolk, and later histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by their mother. Females give birth to 1–6 pups every May after a gestation period of 11–12 months, most of which consists of a period of arrested embryonic development. The venomous tail <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bluntnose stingray is potentially dangerous to unwary beachgoers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is widely distributed, common, and minimally threatened by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|As {{the size}} of the AEF grew, the {{division}} was placed under command of I Corps in July. When the Aisne-Marne campaign began shortly thereafter, the division, under I Corps was placed under command of the French Sixth Army protecting its east flank.

On 12 August it was pulled from the lines near Toul to prepare for the next offensive. The division was then a part of the offensive at St. Mihiel, during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. The division then moved in position for the last major offensive of the war, at Meuse-Argonne. This campaign was the last of the war, as an armistice was signed shortly thereafter. During World War I the 26th Division spent 210 days in combat, and suffered 1,587 killed in action and 12,077 wounded in action. The division returned to the United States and was demobilized on 3 May 1919 at Camp Devens, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Often found {{lying on}} the bottom buried in sediment, the roughtail {{stingray}} is a generalist predator that feeds {{on a variety of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos receiving nourishment initially from yolk, and later from histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. In the northwestern Atlantic, females bear an annual litter of 4–6 young in fall and early winter, after a gestation period of 9–11 months. By contrast, in the Mediterranean there is evidence that females bear two litters of 2–6 young per year after a gestation period of only four months. Rays in the northwestern Atlantic are also larger at birth and at sexual maturity than those from the Mediterranean. The venomous tail <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roughtail stingray is potentially dangerous to humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern overall and in the northwestern Atlantic, where it is not commercially utilized. However, in the Mediterranean and southwestern Atlantic it is subject to heavy fishing pressure and has been assessed as Near Threatened.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus Gyrocotyle {{are quite}} common {{intestinal}} parasites of chimaerids. As {{far as we}} now know, each parasite species is restricted to one host species. In each host species, however, a second and much rarer species of Gyrocotyle may occur besides the common one. The common species are systematically related to each other, {{and so are the}} rare ones. In the present paper two species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> rare species are described. Their existence has been known already for a long time, but, for different reasons, they have never been recognized as separate species. DEFINITION OF SOME TERMS Ι. Spines. — We recognize two types <b>of</b> <b>spines</b> in <b>the</b> genus Gyrocotyle, viz., the urna-type and <b>the</b> confusa-type. In <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urna-type the general shape is stubby, irregular and asymmetrical, and the distal portion is stout and blunt (fig. 5). In <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confusa-type, the general shape is elegant, regular and symmetrical, and the distal portion is slender, gradually tapering, and pointed (fig. 2 - 4). In <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urna-type the points that project beyond the skin are twice as wide as in <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> comparable dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confusa-type, which is even striking when specimens are studied under a low-power stereomicroscope. 2. Lateral ruffles. — All species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subgenus Amphiptyches have lateral ruffles. A complicated type, with a great dorsoventral amplitude and with a few to many secondary undulations, can be distinguished from a simple type, generally with a small dorsoventral amplitude and without secondary undulations. 3. Rosette. — All species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus Gyrocotyle have a rosette, i. e. ...|$|R
