5|$|The {{proportion}} of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, <b>small</b> <b>molecules,</b> and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E
5|$|The inter{{membrane}} {{space is}} {{the space between}} the outer membrane and the inner membrane. It is also known as perimitochondrial space. Because the outer membrane is freely permeable to <b>small</b> <b>molecules,</b> the concentrations of <b>small</b> <b>molecules,</b> such as ions and sugars, in the intermembrane space is the same as in the cytosol. However, large proteins must have a specific signaling sequence to be transported across the outer membrane, so the protein composition of this space is different from the protein composition of the cytosol. One protein that is localized to the intermembrane space in this way is cytochrome c.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{was once}} thought to be a simple {{solution}} of molecules, the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include concentration gradients of <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> such as calcium, large complexes of enzymes that act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and carboxysomes that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{some plants}} use fatty acid derivates, amino acids and even {{peptides}} as defenses. The cholinergic toxine, cicutoxin of water hemlock, is a polyyne {{derived from the}} fatty acid metabolism. β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid as simple amino acid {{is used by the}} sweet pea which leads also to intoxication in humans.

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies.

5|$|Once {{the model}} of a molecule's {{structure}} has been finalized, it is often deposited in a crystallographic database such as the Cambridge Structural Database (for <b>small</b> <b>molecules),</b> the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) (for inorganic compounds) or the Protein Data Bank (for protein structures).

5|$|Solid ionic {{compounds}} {{have long}} been used as paint pigments, and are resistant to organic solvents, but are sensitive to acidity or basicity. Since 1801 pyrotechnicians have described and widely used metal-containing ionic compounds as sources of colour in fireworks. Under intense heat, the electrons in the metal ions or <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> can be excited. These electrons later return to lower energy states, and release light with a colour spectrum characteristic of the species present.|$|E
5|$|Transmembrane {{proteins}} {{can also}} serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> and ions. The membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse. Membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to enter and exit the cell. Many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion; for example, potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for {{only one of the}} two ions.|$|E

5|$|Antibody mimetics are organic {{compounds}} that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics {{such as the}} Affimer and the DARPin have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{activity}} occurs along a protein's active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to {{this site}} and blocking its activity, {{under the assumption}} that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain allosteric sites which, when bound to by <b>small</b> <b>molecules,</b> can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
50|$|In the pericyclic {{transition}} state, a <b>small</b> <b>molecule</b> donates two electrons to the ring. The reaction {{process can}} be shown using two different geometries. The <b>small</b> <b>molecule</b> can approach in a linear or non-linear fashion. In the linear approach, the electrons in the orbital of the <b>small</b> <b>molecule</b> are pointed directly at the π-system. In the non-linear approach, the orbital approaches at a skew angle. The π-system's ability to rotate as the <b>small</b> <b>molecule</b> approaches is crucial in forming new bonds. The direction of rotation will be different depending on how many π-electrons are in the system. Shown below is a diagram of a two-electron fragment approaching a four-electron π-system using frontier molecular orbitals. The rotation will be disrotatory if the <b>small</b> <b>molecule</b> approaches linearly and conrotatory if the molecule approaches non-linearly. Disrotatory and conrotatory are sophisticated terms expressing how the bonds in the π-system are rotating. Disrotatory means opposite directions while conrotatory means the same direction. This is also depicted in the diagram below.|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{discovery}} of aspirin, <b>small</b> <b>molecule</b> therapeutics have been widely prescribed to treat inflammation and pain. Aspirin and several <b>small</b> <b>molecule</b> NSAIDs are known to inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase- 1 (COX- 1) and - 2 (COX- 2). Despite the success of NSAIDs to treat inflammatory disorders, {{the development of a}} clinically useful <b>small</b> <b>molecule</b> NSAIDs with decreased side effect profiles is an ongoing effort. The recent discovery and development of selective COX- 2 inhibitors was a step toward this direction. Emerging trends are represented by the progress in the development of hybrid agents such as nitric oxide donor-NSAIDs (NO-NSAIDs) and dual COX/lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors. This review focuses on the recent advances in the rational design of <b>small</b> <b>molecule</b> NSAIDs in therapy...|$|R
5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum cofactor, where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} {{to have some}} of the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a shear modulus, but like any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.|$|E
5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of <b>small</b> <b>molecules</b> with the bilayer.|$|E

Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. <b>Small</b> <b>molecules</b> have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Small-molecule and {{macromolecular}} crystallography {{differ in}} the range of possible techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. <b>Small</b> <b>molecules</b> generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.|$|E
