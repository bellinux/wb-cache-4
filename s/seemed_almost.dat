5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} Empire have been praised by historians. According to George Ostrogorsky, Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: Under his rule, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces, Andronikos's reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. The aristocrats were infuriated against him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, while the Emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{reversion}} to {{a socialist}} command economy <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> impossible. Russia ended 2006 with its eighth straight year of growth, averaging 6.7% annually since {{the financial crisis}} of 1998. Although high oil prices and a relatively cheap ruble initially drove this growth, since 2003 consumer demand and, more recently, investment have played a significant role. Russia is well ahead of most other resource-rich countries in its economic development, with {{a long tradition of}} education, science, and industry.|$|E

25|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} home season in 1999–2000, taking his first Test five-for against Zimbabwe in Jamaica. Two months later, after {{setting up a}} tight win over Pakistan, he and Franklyn Rose <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> ready to succeed Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh. But both fell away during the 2000 tour of England, where King {{was said to be}} troubled by a heel injury. An introverted character and a genuine No. 10, King was a forgotten man for four years, until he was recalled for the home series against South Africa in 2004–05, when a raft of leading players were sidelined by a contract dispute.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{military}} spending in Germany exceeded 10% of GNP (higher {{than any other}} European country at the time). Military investment also exceeded civilian investment from 1936 onwards. Armaments dominated government expenditures on goods and services. That year also represented {{a turning point for}} German trade policy. World prices for raw materials (which constituted the bulk of German imports) were on the rise. At the same time, world prices for manufactured goods (Germany's chief exports) were falling. The result was that Germany found it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance of payments. A large trade deficit <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> inevitable. But Hitler found this prospect unacceptable. Thus Germany, following Italy's lead, began to move away from partially free trade in the direction of economic self-sufficiency.|$|E
25|$|Hence Halbertsma {{expected}} to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> within his grasp, but each time it slipped away. His sharp pen probably {{played a role in}} this, but there were other reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of Belgium, which at that time had just seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded. That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the University of Leiden, was scant consolation to him. In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced {{on the edge of a}} burn-out for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed over yet again, he went through a deep crisis. It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, that he seems to have achieved a state of mental composure.|$|E

25|$|The {{first human}} {{clinical}} trial was unsuccessful. Banting was insufficiently qualified {{to participate and}} felt sidelined. By the winter of 1922, {{he was certain that}} all Macleod's colleagues were conspiring against him. Collip threatened to leave because of the strained atmosphere, but the encouragement of others who saw the potential of their research prevented escalation of the conflict. In January 1922, the team performed the first successful clinical trial, on 14-year-old Leonard Thompson, and it was soon followed by others. Although all the team members were listed as co-authors of their publications, Banting still felt overlooked, because Macleod took over the coordination of clinical trials and the acquisition of larger amounts of extract. Macleod's presentation {{at a meeting of the}} Association of American Physicians in Washington, D.C., on 3 May 1922 received a standing ovation, but Banting and Best refused to participate in protest. At that time, demonstrations of the method's efficiency drew huge public interest, because the effect on patients, especially children, who until then were bound to die, <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> miraculous. The pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly & Co. took over mass production, but without an exclusive license, as the patent was transferred to the British Medical Research Council to prevent exploitation.|$|E
25|$|Rick McCosker (127, his maiden Test century) and Ian Chappell (192) took Australia to 280/1 {{at the end}} of {{the first}} day, setting up a total of 532/9. In reply, Barry Wood (30), John Edrich (12 from 98 balls) and David Steele (39 from 106 balls) {{painstakingly}} defied the Australians as England reached 78/1, but following the dismissals of Wood and Edrich, Jeff Thomson and Max Walker combined to reduce England to 147/8; only the tail-end efforts of Chris Old (25 not out) and John Snow (30) enabled England to reach an eventual total of 191 all out. Chappell asked England to follow on; with two-and-a-half days of a six-day Test remaining, defeat <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> inevitable. Still further resistance from Edrich (96) and Steele (66) saw England close the fourth day on 179/1; after Lillee dismissed both in quick succession the following morning, England continued to resist. Bob Woolmer (149, his maiden Test century) defied Australia for more than eight hours, sharing partnerships of 122 with Graham Roope (77) and 151 with Alan Knott (64) as England held out for 14 hours to reach 522/5. Only a spell of medium pace from Doug Walters eventually conquered England's lower order. In the limited remaining time, Australia reached 40/2. Chappell announced his retirement from the captaincy {{at the end of}} the match.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, {{the field}} {{continued}} to evolve, although in large measure, {{on a local}} level. In the broader scheme of things the term 'ambulance service' was replaced by 'emergency medical service' to reflect the change from a transportation system to a system that provides actual medical care. The training, knowledge base, and skill sets of both paramedics and emergency medical technicians (both competed for the job title, and 'EMT-Paramedic' was a common compromise) were typically determined by what local medical directors were comfortable with, what {{it was felt that}} the community needed, and what could actually be afforded. There were also tremendous local differences in the amount and type of training required, and how it would be provided. This ranged from in-service training in local systems, through community colleges, and ultimately even to universities. During the evolution of paramedicine, a great deal of both curriculum and skill set {{was in a state of}} constant flux. Permissible skills evolved in many cases at the local level, and were based upon the preferences of physician advisers and medical directors. Treatments would go in and out of fashion, and sometimes, back in again. The use of certain drugs, Bretylium for example, illustrate this. In some respects, the development <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> faddish. Technologies also evolved and changed, and as medical equipment manufacturers quickly learned, the pre-hospital environment was not the same as the hospital environment; equipment standards that worked fine in hospitals could not cope well with the less controlled pre-hospital environment.|$|E

500|$|In 1919–21 he {{commanded}} Poland's forces in six border wars that shaped {{the nation of}} Poland. His forces <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> defeated in the Polish-Soviet War when they fought the battle for Warsaw in August 1920. In the [...] "miracle on the Vistula," [...] they routed five Russian armies and saved Poland. In 1923, with the government dominated by his opponents, particularly the National Democrats, he withdrew from active politics. Three years later, he returned to power with the May 1926 coup d'état, and became the strongman (in practice a military dictator) of Poland. From then {{until his death in}} 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs.|$|E
500|$|In {{an end of}} {{the year}} review, British {{magazine}} Q said [...] "It could all have been so different. As the London 2012 Summer Olympics approached, the tide of scepticism <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> irreversible. There was the heavy-handed sponsorship, the draconian security, the ticketing problems, the ballooning budget, and the lurking fear that the Opening Ceremony might be, in director Danny Boyle's pungent description, 'shite'. It took less than four hours on the night of Friday 27 July to turn the whole country around. [...] Not only was the ceremony demonstrably not shite, it was the most surprising, moving, spectacular cultural event this country had ever seen...modern Britain, in all its berserk, multi-faceted glory." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} its {{technical}} capabilities, Nike-X still shared one seemingly intractable problem that had first been noticed with Zeus. Facing an ABM system, the Soviets would change their targeting priorities to maximize damage, by attacking smaller, undefended cities for instance. Another solution was to drop their warheads just outside {{the range of the}} defensive missiles, upwind of the target. Ground bursts would throw enormous amounts of radioactive dust into the air, causing fallout that would be almost as deadly as a direct attack. This would make the ABM system essentially useless unless the cities were also extensively protected from fallout. Those same fallout shelters would save many lives on their own, {{to the point that the}} ABM <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> superfluous. While reporting to Congress on the issue in the spring of 1964, McNamara noted: ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Purple Piano Project" [...] {{was given}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews by critics. Jenna Mullins of E! Online called it [...] "a perfect season-starter of an episode". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon appreciated that it tackled {{some of the}} show's biggest problems, such as the surfeit of central characters and their previously un-addressed ages. He was particularly pleased that the episode focussed on typical high school life, rather than the adult characters or more serious issues. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle approved of the [...] "clear trajectory" [...] {{set out for the}} characters, and noted that he looked forward to seeing their various storylines develop. Though AOLTV Crystal Bell worried that clarfiying the teenagers' ages could result in the younger characters being overlooked in future episodes, she was glad that the premiere saw the show return to its roots: [...] "underdogs, show tunes and Sue Sylvester". A similar sentiment was expressed by Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times, who was hopeful that renewed focus on the core characters would lead to [...] "a great year". The Huffington Post Amy Lee observed that [...] "Glee has a tendency to oscillate between sappy and nasty, sometimes without any warning", and then noted that [...] "The Purple Piano Project" [...] was more tonally balanced than the majority of the second season. Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times deemed the episode [...] "admirably straightforward", unmarred by the sentimentality and inconsistencies which plagued previous episodes. His praised was tempered, however, and he wrote, [...] "I wouldn't {{go so far as to}} call the episode good, it was oddly lifeless and the stakes <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> nonexistent at times. It has the feel of a show rediscovering itself, but, all things considered, Ryan Murphy and Co. handled the task relatively well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stevens {{contracted}} tuberculosis in 1969 and {{was close}} to death {{at the time of}} his admittance to the King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, West Sussex. He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of convalescence. During this time Stevens began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, [...] "to go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> as if I had my eyes shut." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the birds}} <b>seemed</b> <b>almost</b> an afterthought the ornithologist John Gould took {{them on and}} was quick to notice the {{significance}} of specimens from the Galápagos Islands. He startlingly revealed at the next meeting on 10 January that what Darwin had taken to be wrens, blackbirds and slightly differing finches were [...] "a series of ground finches which are so peculiar" [...] as to form [...] "an entirely new group" [...] of 11 species. The story of {{what we now call}} [...] "Darwin's finches" [...] was covered by the daily newspapers, though Darwin was in Cambridge and did not get details at this stage.
