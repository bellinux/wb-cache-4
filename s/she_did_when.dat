5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> she was younger as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They {{get married and have}} two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E
25|$|Kngwarreye {{went through}} many {{different}} individual styles in her short {{career as a}} professional painter. In 1992, she began to join the dots into lines with parallel horizontal and vertical stripes, representing rivers and terrain, in many different colours. She began using larger brushes than previously. Her later paintings were based on much larger dots than the finer, more intricate work which <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> she started.|$|E
60|$|The weeping girl {{covers her}} hand with kisses and says what shall <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> what shall <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> they are separated! Her {{mistress}} kisses {{her on the}} cheek and makes no other answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Frank, {{the first}} {{question}} of all is--How is my mother? What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> I was missing? It must have been awful for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's poor Mammy!" [...] said Eva. [...] "She does {{love the}} Bible so much, and wishes {{so she could}} read! And what will <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> I can't read to her?" ...|$|R
25|$|King {{notes that}} the {{eighteenth-century}} definition for “publisher” could also mean “bookseller.” King is uncertain whether Haywood produced the books and pamphlets that she sold (as Spedding indicates) or {{if she was a}} bookseller, especially for Haywood’s early productions. Haywood sometimes collaborated on publishing matters in order to share the costs, as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> she collaborated with Cogan on the publication of The Virtuous Villager. In any case, Haywood was most certainly a bookseller {{due to the fact that}} there were a great number and variety of works “to be had” at the Sign of Fame that did not bare her imprint.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, Martin and Lyon asked Gittings {{to start}} a chapter in New York City, which <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> less than a dozen women responded to her notice in the Mattachine Society {{newsletter}} asking for [...] "all women in the New York area {{who are interested in}} forming a chapter of the DOB" [...] on September 20, 1958. Gittings served as the chapter's first president for three years commuting to New York from Philadelphia twice a month.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] was filmed in October 1994 at the San Antonio Amtrak station. Produced by Summit Productions, the video {{was directed by}} Sean Roberts. Shooting took four days to complete. Jack Morgan was the on-set photographer, and Diego Aguilar produced the video. Selena wore the same dress that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> she won a Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Album in 1994. Veronica Flores, {{a reporter for the}} San Antonio Express-News, was asked to make a cameo appearance as a wedding guest. American model Freddie Martinez portrayed Selena's love interest after auditioning for the role in San Antonio.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly I {{was filled}} with the thought of her and a great longing for her. What would <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> {{realised}} our immense disaster? What would <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> How would <b>she</b> take it? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....|$|R
60|$|Dorinda winked {{her eyes}} as <b>she</b> always <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was doubtful.|$|R
500|$|As part of Why Not? with Shania Twain, she {{arranged}} a session with music producer David Foster, hoping to collaborate on [...] "Today Is Your Day". Although she felt skeptical, Twain visited vocal coach Eric Vetro {{to prepare for}} her session with Foster. Twain and Vetro executed vocal exercises to loosen up the tension and tightness in her vocal chords. [...] "The goal is to free up, to let go. She has {{to take all of}} that tension and tightness that she's been feeling for so long, and transform it to free herself from it. And to start singing from her heart again, the way <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> she was a little girl, when she started," [...] Vetro stated. He also opined that Twain was ready to return to her music career. Twain learned beneficial vocal techniques and appreciated Vetro's understanding of her psyche.|$|E
500|$|Danielle {{was killed}} off minutes after {{revealing}} her true identity to Ronnie, dying in her mother's arms. Although different outcomes to the storyline were considered, Santer explained that Danielle dying best preserved Ronnie's status as EastEnders [...] "tragic heroine character". Treadwell-Collins felt that to allow Ronnie {{to have her}} daughter, the [...] "one thing that is key to her character" [...] would serve to progressively weaken her character, and Santer agreed that while it may initially be touching, ultimately the relationship would become boring. The scene in which Danielle dies was filmed during winter, but as it was set in early April, snow had to be cleared away from the set before filming could commence. A body double {{was used for the}} moment Danielle was run over. Although sad to leave, Crace felt that the story's conclusion was the right one, and was glad that Ronnie and Danielle finally shared a brief moment in the end, explaining: [...] "It was so important that that tender moment was finally found, because that's all people wanted. It's all Danielle wanted, and it's all Ronnie wants." [...] Crace concluded: [...] "I think Danielle will leave quite a big mark on the Square and on the people in the Square – probably a bigger mark than <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> she was alive.|$|E
2500|$|Maud's mother Matilda {{frequently}} {{spent the}} winter at their house, as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> Maud and Frank were residents of Aberneen. Maud cherished her mother's visits, especially when Frank traveled for his job. During this time, Maud discontinued attending the Episcopal Church, instead choosing {{to have her}} boys go to the West Side Ethical Culture Sunday School. She and Frank agreed with Matilda's spiritualist beliefs. Matilda favorably commented that the new school was where [...] "morality and not religion is taught".|$|E
60|$|Sometimes, though, Tommy felt uneasy. It {{was plain}} {{to be seen}} that Bessie had set her heart on that doll. And what would <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> the doll was sold, as would {{probably}} happen soon? Tommy thought Bessie would feel awful sad, {{and he would be}} responsible for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{refuse to}} go. My place {{is in this}} house. Neither Lady Janet nor you can get over the plain facts. All I asked was to be confronted with her. And what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> came into the room? She fainted {{at the sight of}} me." ...|$|R
50|$|Isabel has a {{enemy in}} her own home, her cousin Alejandra (Nailea Norvind), who hates Isabel. Alejandra wants to harm Isabel, and <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> seduces Rodrigo and Isabel finds them. Isabel knows that her father would kill Alejandra if he realizes about this incident, so Isabel remains silent.|$|R
2500|$|After {{returning}} to Canada, Rodríguez became {{very active in}} her community. [...] She was {{the chair of the}} Writers' Union of Canada's Union Racial Minority Writers Committee and Social Justice Taskforce, as well as being {{a founding member of the}} Aquelarre Collective, a feminist group responsible for the production of Aquelarre Magazine. [...] The purpose of this magazine was to provide a voice to the community of exiled Chileans. In 1997, she published the book and a body to remember with in Vancouver, and in the same year published in Chile the Spanish version of the book De Cuerpo Entero. She has continued teaching as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> she was in Chile, conducting courses at Langara College, the University College of the Fraser Valley, and, beginning in January 2009, as an adjunct professor of Spanish and writer in residence at the University of British Columbia. Recently, she worked at the Department of Education at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, along with being an Adult Literacy Consultant, working with the First Nations people of Canada. Rodríguez has been a correspondent for Radio Canada International since 1990, discussing cultural, social, political and economic news in Canada on a show entitled [...] "Canadá en las Américas".|$|E

50|$|Sonia {{grows up}} under her mother's strict control and guidance, {{and the love}} of her grandparents, who {{encourage}} her to visit India, which <b>she</b> <b>does.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> returns, she announces that she has met her soul-mate in Amar, who she is going to invite to Britain, where they will marry.|$|R
6000|$|Without {{understanding}} his mood, they withdrew, {{leaving him}} alone. His mind {{went back to}} Bertha. [...] "What will <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> finds me gone? She will not be scared at first. She will wire to stop me; but no matter--before she can reach me, I'll be high in the hills." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{will she}} do?' cried Siegmund, 'What will <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> I am gone? What {{will become of}} her? Already she has no aim in life; then she will have no object. Is it any good my going if I leave her behind? What an inextricable knot this is! But what will she do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{looked in}} there for a moment," [...] Harry said, [...] "as I passed. Mother looks as hale and hearty as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> I left, and so do you, dad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{to be sure}} <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>when</b> they locked her {{up because}} she wouldn't tell lies to please them. How did you get out, Kittens? What jolly good fun it must have been!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was {{as happy}} as ever she could be," [...] said Lydia. [...] "There's no doubt about its being all right, mamma. She looked just as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> she got the letter from him before." ...|$|E
6000|$|Marguerite {{clings to}} the jewels, and accepts the young man's arm for a {{moonlight}} promenade. And <b>when</b> it <b>does</b> enter into her innocent head that he and she have walked that shady garden long enough, what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> has said good-bye and shut the door? She opens the ground-floor window and begins to sing! ...|$|R
60|$|Now, how is it, thought Felix, {{that any}} one who loves the new as <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> <b>when</b> it's made of matter, will not even look at it when it's made of mind? And, while the little machine buzzed about his head, he {{proceeded}} to detail to her {{the facts of the}} state of things that existed at Joyfields.|$|R

6000|$|It was Mrs. Clavering who {{suggested}} to Mr. Saul {{that perhaps he}} would like to see Fanny. This <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> her story had been told, and he was preparing to leave her. [...] "Certainly, if she will come to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{had told}} her of this Chicago. Nobody could tell her of it, indeed, for no one else saw it as <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> <b>When</b> Mason spoke again his voice was very low and gentle. He began to {{comprehend}} {{the soul of the}} girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't exactly know. We {{came away}} before <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> the breeze fell, but her second {{engineer}} seemed quite confident {{he could bring}} her along at seven or eight knots. He wasn't sure whether his high-pressure engine would stand anything more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, lord, and {{we might}} set a springe to catch this bird so rare and shy, and though she'd flutter, flutter, flutter, and peck, peck, peck, what could <b>she</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you {{smoothed}} her plumage with your loving hand, and a priest was waiting to say the word that should cause her to forget her doubts and that merchant bumpkin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt <b>she</b> <b>does.</b> <b>When</b> once a {{woman is}} married she should be {{regarded}} as having thrown off her allegiance to her own sex. She is sure to be treacherous at any rate in one direction. Not that Lady Chiltern can tell anything of me that might not be told to all the world as far as I am concerned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{she means}} to leave?" [...] says the Sergeant. [...] "What is <b>she</b> to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> leave? Sad, sad! The poor {{creature}} has got no {{friends in the}} world, except you and me." ...|$|R
