5|$|Several {{more recent}} studies have raised the {{possibility}} that the dinosaur was omnivorous and used its tusks for prey killing during an occasional hunt. In 2000, Paul Barrett suggested that the shape of the premaxillary teeth and the fine <b>serration</b> of the tusks are reminiscent of carnivorous animals, hinting at facultative carnivory. Muntjacs, in contrast, lack <b>serration</b> on their tusks. In 2008, Butler and colleagues argued that the enlarged tusks formed early {{in the development of the}} individual, and therefore could not constitute sexual dimorphism. Combat with conspecifics thus is an unlikely function, as enlarged tusks would be expected only in males if they were a tool for combat. Instead, feeding or defence functions are more likely. It has also been suggested that Heterodontosaurus could have used its jugal bosses to deliver blows during combat, and that the palpebral bone could have protected the eyes against such attacks. In 2011, Norman and colleagues drew attention to the arms and hands, which are relatively long and equipped with large, recurved claws. These features, in combination with the long hindlimbs that allowed for fast running, would have made the animal capable of seizing small prey. As an omnivore, Heterodontosaurus would have had a significant selection advantage during the dry season when vegetation was scarce.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson and Suwannee points, {{found in}} Florida and the Southeastern United States, {{are similar to}} the Golondrina in shape and age. The Dalton point, found in the central United States, shares a similar outline and basal corner auriculation with Golondrina, which may imply that {{they are part of a}} series. Identification is made by {{examination}} of the blade edgesâ€”Golondrina exhibits much less <b>serration.</b> The Meserve type has also been known to cause confusion, as it is considered a resharpened variant of the Plainview and Golondrina types.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each <b>serration</b> was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.|$|E
5000|$|Kubuli <b>serrations</b> - <b>Serrations</b> {{placed in}} a knife blade, {{alternating}} from both left and right sides of the blade, forming two rows of <b>serrations</b> that are not collinear. [...] As a result, Kubuli <b>serrations</b> move the material to be cut {{from side to side}} as the cut is being made.|$|R
50|$|The slide <b>serrations</b> on the 1902 {{sporting}} model initially {{continued the}} sixteen milled plunge <b>serrations</b> {{on each side}} as featured in the model 1900. The 1902 Sporting Models looked {{very much like the}} Model 1900, however all vestiges of the 1900 sight safety had disappeared. At approximately serial 8000 around April 1905, these <b>serrations</b> were changed to a more modern look of twenty instantly discernible cut <b>serrations</b> as they did not plunge into the slide but cut down to the bottom. The position of the cuts was relatively short lived as the cut <b>serrations</b> were moved {{to the back of the}} frame. Certain deductions for the 1902 sporting model can be made: Front milled plunge <b>serrations,</b> number made about 3,725 (1,444 high spur hammer/2,281 stub hammer) (approx); front cut <b>serrations,</b> only about 500? made (all round hammer); rear cut <b>serrations</b> 3,002 made (2,811 stub hammer/191 low spur hammer).|$|R
50|$|<b>Serrations</b> are not {{required}} to cut tomatoes - a sharp straight blade works - but the <b>serrations</b> allow the knife to cut tomatoes and other foods even when dull. The reason for this being most of the cutting takes place in the <b>serrations</b> themselves. Some knives have <b>serrations</b> on both sides allowing easy slicing for both left-handed and right-handed users. Bread knives and steak knives are similarly serrated.|$|R
5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double <b>serration</b> on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy birch more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E
25|$|A. R. Jacobsen {{published}} {{a description of}} a dentary referred to Saurornitholestes with tooth marks. The specimen was preserved in the Dinosaur Park Formation. Although a specific identification cannot be made, the shape of the preserved <b>serration</b> marks implicate a juvenile individual of one of the formation's tyrannosaurids, like Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, or Aublysodon. All of the marks on the jawbone seem to have been left by the same animal because the <b>serration</b> marks all share the same morphology.|$|E
25|$|The Super Hornet {{also makes}} {{considerable}} use of panel joint <b>serration</b> and edge alignment. Considerable {{attention has been}} paid to the removal or filling of unnecessary surface join gaps and resonant cavities. Where the F/A-18A-D used grilles to cover various accessory exhaust and inlet ducts, the F/A-18E/F uses perforated panels that appear opaque to radar waves at the frequencies used. Careful {{attention has been paid}} to the alignment of many panel boundaries and edges, to direct reflected waves away from the aircraft in uniformly narrow angles.|$|E
25|$|William Abler studied tyrannosaur tooth biomechanics. He {{concluded}} that the <b>serrations</b> on tyrannosaur teeth did not function like the <b>serrations</b> on a saw blade. Instead he thought the <b>serrations</b> may have caught pieces of rotting meat inside them, sustaining bacterial colonies that make its bite likely to transmit deadly infections to potential prey items. Similar use of decaying meat trapped in tooth <b>serrations</b> as a vector for infected prey had been reported in monitor lizards.|$|R
50|$|Also, dromaeosaurines are {{distinguished}} from velociraptorines, {{in having a}} low DSDI ratio; i.e., their teeth have equal-sized <b>serrations,</b> on both the posterior and on the anterior edges. By contrast, velociraptorines often have larger <b>serrations</b> on the posterior side of the tooth, than the anterior, or no <b>serrations</b> on the anterior side at all.|$|R
50|$|The {{anterior}} {{section of}} the radula is usually shorter than the posterior section but in some species they are subequal in length, the lumen of the radular tooth is wide, a basal spur is present, the barb is short, and the blade is long and extends along most of the anterior {{section of the}} radular tooth. <b>Serrations</b> are usually in multiple rows {{with one or two}} rows of large <b>serrations</b> and rows of smaller <b>serrations</b> on either side, although <b>serrations</b> can be in a single row in juveniles or small specimens.|$|R
25|$|Dental {{findings}} are frequently used {{to differentiate between}} various theropods and to further inform cladistic phylogeny. Tooth morphology and dental evolutionary markers are prone to homoplasy and disappear or reappear throughout history. However, megalosaurids have several specific denture conditions that differentiate them from other basal theropods. One dental condition present in Megalosauridae is multiple enamel wrinkles near the carinae, the sharp edge or <b>serration</b> row of the tooth. Ornamented teeth and a well-marked enamel surface also characterize basal megalosaurids. The ornamentation and well-marked surface appears in early megalosaurids but disappears in derived megalosaurids, suggesting that the condition was lost over time as megalosaurids grew in size.|$|E
25|$|Digestive system: The {{mouth is}} a minute {{transverse}} slit {{in the front}} of the cephalic disc. The jawss are large, but imperfectly cornified. The jaws are angular and minutely, irregularly serrate. They are composed of numerous minute prismatic rods. On the margin many of these rods are transverse and project slightly, forming a minute <b>serration.</b> The radular sack is small. The radula has the formula 12.1.1.1.12. The central tooth is a simple flat triangular plate. The single lateral tooth is well differentiated from the marginal teeth, from which it is separated by a considerable space, and points in the opposite direction. The marginal teeth are slender, elongate, curved rod-like bodies somewhat expanded at the base. They decrease in size gradually from the second or third marginal, which is slightly larger than the first, outwards.|$|E
500|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} a single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 251, {{as a possible}} [...] deciduous anterior (i.e., not p4 or dp4, the deciduous version of p4) lower premolar of Ferugliotherium. It is minuscule, with a length of 0.85mm and width of 0.5mm (assuming the tooth is oriented correctly). It bears two serrations (small projections) {{at the tip of}} the crownâ€”one around the middle of the crown and the other at what may be the back of the crown, where it is highest. Two prominent ridges descend from each <b>serration</b> towards the front down the sides of the tooth. No roots are preserved, but the rounded surface of the lower side of the tooth suggests they may have been resorbed, which would indicate that the tooth is deciduous. Krause and colleagues suggested that the tooth may have been the frontmost premolar, whether deciduous or permanent. However, Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte wrote that this tooth does not match the partial jaw MACN Pv-RN 975, which has no alveoli in front of p4, and Pascual and colleagues agreed in 1999 that the tooth probably does not belong to Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no <b>serrations</b> since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started {{developing}} <b>serrations</b> and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel <b>serrations</b> that help it cut through flesh, and the same <b>serrations</b> {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle <b>serrations</b> similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race against its prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|R

The <b>serrations</b> on the trailing (posterior/distal) edge of the tooth are always larger than the leading (anterior/mesial) edge. The teeth are small, approximately 3-5 millimeters tall.

500|$|William Abler {{observed}} in 2001 that Albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble {{a crack in}} the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body, so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat, the tension could cause a purely crack-like <b>serration</b> to spread through the tooth. However, the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area, and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain. The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering. Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, [...] "impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity" [...] to wood they work.
