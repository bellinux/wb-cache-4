It was assumed that under close canopy, less water will reach the sporulating pods to spread the inoculum, however, rain drops from leaves and branches could also splash the inoculum to the surroundings. Infected pods laying on the ground or litter could also spread the inoculum, yet greater infection was observed on pods located under infected pods hanging on the tree compared to pods at the same level of infected pods. It was reported that splash of wind-blown droplets from the infected pods are also able to infect pods on different trees nearby ...|$|E

This review discusses the abilities and constraints of <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> in the context of plant biosecurity, and highlights the problems that need to be overcome before <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> can be routinely used for detection and eradication of plant pathogen incursions. To meet biosecurity requirements, <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> must be efficient, mechanically reliable and any spores captured must be rapidly identified and quantified. At present, there is significant variation in types of <b>spore</b> <b>traps,</b> and in the methods used to capture and identify <b>spores.</b> Standard <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> are generally inefficient for surveillance because they do not sample large volumes of air or capture samples that are representative of entire crop growing regions.

All sites are former forest {{land and the}} age of the trees was between 9 and 13 years. The study was implemented in August 2010, a month where spore dispersal should be great. The five sites were located in previously un‐thinned monocultures of hybrid larch. The spore load in the air was studied with the help of <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> from three different tree species; Norway spruce, Scots pine and hybrid larch. A total of 146 <b>spore</b> <b>traps,</b> evenly distributed in all five sites were analyzed. The <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> were exposed for three hours then brought back to the laboratory for incubation and analysis. The hybrid larch trees were randomly selected, cut down and every second stump was treated with Rotstop® S and the others were left as controls. No visible signs of infections were discovered. Roughly 60 days after felling and treatment, disc samples were collected for further analysis in lab. The study indicates an abundant amount of basidiospores of Heterobasidion spp. in the air. 63, 7 % of all <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> was infected with Heterobasidion spp. Most infections were found in Södra Rörum II, with 83 % infected <b>spore</b> <b>traps.</b> Out of 263 colonies, 61, 2 % of the isolations were infections of H. annosum and 38, 8 % were H. parviporum. Scots pine and hybrid larch were most attacked by H. annosum whilst Norway spruce was equally attacked by H. annosum and H. parviporum. The mean percentage of infected stumps for all five sites per tree species was; larch 52 %, Norway spruce 58 % and Scots pine 72 %. A total of 176 hybrid larch stumps were analyzed and 20 % were infected by Heterobasidion spp. Both H. annosum and H. parviporum were isolated from the hybrid larch stumps. 60 % of the isolations were H. parviporum and 40 % were H. annosum. Highest infection rate was found in Fulltofta and Klippan where 24 % of the stumps were infected. There is a significant difference of infection rate and infected area between treated stumps and un‐treated control stumps, where p < 0, 000 and p < 0, 024 respectively.

P. ramorum was detected in <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> at high levels under a sporulating host throughout the year at Benmore. Also, findings at sites where infected hosts had been removed before the study led {{to the conclusion that}} the low level <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> detect inoculum from soil splash. Rhododendron and Vaccinium bait plants were also infected with P. ramorum via soil splash at sites within Benmore where there was no sporulating host present. P. kernoviae was detected in <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> at Brodick throughout the year but only where there was a sporulating host overhead. P. kernoviae infected bait plants only where an infected host is overhead. Water baiting confirmed the presence of P. ramorum in two streams at Benmore but P. kernoviae was not detected using this method despite the large-scale P. kernoviae infection at Brodick. Inoculum continued to be detected in soil in areas of both gardens where infected hosts had been removed two years previously, confirming that both of these pathogens can survive in soil for a considerable period. A number of statistical models were produced to describe conditions required for P. ramorum sporulation and infection. Sporulation occurred during warmer and wetter conditions and infection of bait plants occurred in wet conditions and where an infected host is in close proximity. A statistical model was also used to produce a P. ramorum risk map, uniquely at the garden scale, to enable garden managers at Benmore to visualise the areas most at risk within their garden. The findings of this study have clear management implications for the control of disease establishment and spread within the garden setting...|$|R

Flight Assist System The Flight Assist System (FAS) is a demonstrator project assisting Ergon Energy in development of the research outcome of a three-year CRC-SI project which focused on business improvement applications for Ergon Energy. The outcome of the CRC-SI project was a proposal for an advanced airborne vegetation management system that would save AUD$14 million per year. To commercialise the research outcomes, Ergon decided to launch the Remote Observation, Automated Modelling & Economic Simulation (ROAMES) project of which FAS is an essential component. ROAMES has since been divested to Fugro Spatial Solutions. Smart Skies Project The Smart Skies Project is a leading edge research program exploring {{the research and development}} of future technologies that support the efficient utilisation of airspace by both manned and unmanned aircraft. It focused upon the exploration and development of three key enabling aviation technologies - an automated separation management system capable of providing separation assurance in complex airspace environments; sense-and-act systems for manned and unmanned aircraft capable of collision avoidance of dynamic and static obstacles; and a mobile aircraft tracking system utilising a cost-effective radar and dependent surveillance systems. Airborne Powerline Inspection Technology Improvements The three year CRC-SI project 6.07 for Spatial information Business improvement applications at Ergon Energy focussed on precision guidance of aircraft over powerlines, asset and vegetation detection using LiDAR imagery, and detection and classification of tree species. The project was successfully completed in 2010 and provided the fundamental basis for the FAS project.

Careful examination of these failed to reveal typical arthrospores or Fusarium macrospores despite substantial recoveries of corresponding growth in culture. Correlations in the occurrence patterns of arthrospore-forming and non-sporulating colonies {{with those of}} Coprinus and ‘other basidiospores’ (excluding Ganoderma) were noted...|$|E
40|$|Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is an {{invasive}} fungal species {{causing the}} most serious disease of ashes (Fraxinus spp.) in Europe—ash dieback. The biology of this fungus is not totally elucidated, neither its relation to the saprophytic species Hymenoscyphus albidus, native in Europe. Our study {{is focused on the}} description of seasonal spore dispersal of both fungi and its relation to meteorological conditions, which is needed for more precise and effective control of the disease. For this experiment one long time infected mixed forest in the SE Czech Republic was chosen. A seven-day automatic volumetric <b>spore</b> <b>trap</b> and a weather station were installed to continuously sample the aerospora from April to October 2014. In seven periods a rotating arm <b>spore</b> <b>trap</b> was also used to obtain 48 -h air samples to compare the efficiency of these two types of air samplers. Air samples were evaluated solely by qPCR with a very low detection limit. Results show co-occurrence of inoculum of both fungi throughout the entire sampling period with peak levels in August. The origin of the inoculum sampled in the periods without apothecia is discussed. Air-inoculum occurrence of both fungi is significantly correlated with each other, suggesting their coexistence in this forest...|$|E
40|$|The {{airborne}} inoculum of Fusarium circinatum Nirenberg & O’Donnell, the fungal pathogen causing Pine Pitch Canker (PPC), {{is one of}} {{the main}} means of spread of the disease in forest stands and forest nurseries. Since this world-wide known pathogen was introduced in Europe, its biology in this newly infested area still remains scarcely known. To shed more light on this topic, we set up an experiment on a naturally PPC infested forest of Monterey pine in Galicia (NW Spain) with the following two goals: (i) to describe the seasonal spore dispersal pattern during one year of regular sampling and (ii) to assess the spatial spore dispersal pattern around the infested plot. Portable rotating arm <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> were used and complemented with meteorological measurements. The abundance of F. circinatum spores in the samples was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with a hydrolysis probe. The results showed almost permanent occurrence of the air inoculum throughout the whole year, being detected in 27 of the 30 samplings. No clear temporal trends were observed, but a higher air inoculum was favoured by previous lower air temperatures and lower leaf wetness. Conversely, neither rainfall nor air humidity seemed to have any significant importance. The spatial spread of the inoculum was noted to be successful up to a distance of 1000 m in the wind direction, even with winds of just 5 m·s− 1. Our study shows that rotating arm <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> combined with qPCR may be an efficient tool for F. circinatum detection...|$|R
40|$|Stemphylium vesicarium is {{the causal}} agent of brown spot of pear, an {{important}} disease reported in pear-growing areas of Europe. The pathogen {{is able to}} colonize pear leaf debris and dead tissues of herbaceous plants and produce abundant ascospores and conidia {{that are capable of}} infecting pear trees. Inoculum monitoring in pear orchards is mainly achieved through <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> and species identification is based on conidial morphology, but the similarities on conidial traits among species of Stemphylium make correct identification difficult. In this work a total of thirty-seven Stemphylium isolates from pear orchards were characterized at the morphological, pathogenic, and molecular level. Correspondence among ITS and gpd sequences and morphological traits were evaluated. Species identification based exclusively on morphological data was not feasible. Combined morphological and molecular data were necessary for unambiguous identification of isolates in the S. vesicarium species group. Only isolates identified as S. vesicarium were pathogenic on pear. The study revealed that several species of Stemphylium coexist in pear orchards with S. vesicarium, the causal agent of BSP, and that combined morphological and molecular data are needed to differentiate them. Consequently, direct measurements of the airborne inoculum using volumetric <b>spore</b> <b>traps</b> may overestimate the actual pathogen populationThis research {{was supported in part by}} grants from Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (AGL 2006 - 04987 /AGR and AGL 2009 - 09829 /AGR) of Spain; Comissio Interdepartamental de Recerca i Tecnologia from the Generalitat de Catalunya (2009 SGR 00812) and BR 10 / 17 from the University of Giron...|$|R
