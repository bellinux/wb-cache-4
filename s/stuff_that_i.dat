I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say that I do it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun for me to sing about those times and the crazy <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> used to do, and the crazy <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field.

25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E

500|$|In 1981 Hanneman, who {{was working}} as a {{telemarketer}} at the time, met Kerry King, when King was auditioning for a southern rock band called [...] "Ledger". King remembered: [...] "As I was leaving, I saw Jeff just kinda standing around playing guitar, and he was playing <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was into, like Def Leppard's 'Wasted' and AC/DC and Priest". After the try-out session, the two guitarists started talking and playing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs. Slayer was born when King asked [...] "Why don't we start our own band?", to which Hanneman replied [...] "...Fuck yeah!".|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh admired Fishburne's {{ability to}} portray an {{emphatic}} and assertive figure in previous films. To Fishburne, Cheever was a [...] "smart", [...] "competent" [...] physician who often epitomized a [...] "voice of reason". Once he conferred with W. Ian Lipkin, a virologist {{and professor at}} Columbia University, the character's complexities were nonexistent for the actor. Fishburne stated, [...] "The personal <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have as Ellis Cheever was telling my fiancée, soon-to-be wife, Sanaa Lathan, {{to get out of}} town, to leave, to pack up, to not talk. That's really easy. Any human being in that situation is going to do that, I think." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{extended}} {{and ran for}} 90minutes, {{as opposed to the}} usual 60minutes. Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting down our episodes. Even when we write them, and then in the editing room we're always throwing away <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really love to get it down to time. [...] It will be just really interesting content-wise for us [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|There {{were also}} charges of racism, {{due to his}} portrayals of blacks and Hispanics. Baker denied those charges, and {{pointed out that the}} protagonist later {{realized}} that the blacks were also gay and the Latina [...] "was just a sweet old woman putting {{up with a lot of}} (<b>stuff)</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't even imagine." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I just wanted to explore the conflicts between gays and Latinos and gays and blacks ... the real feelings [...] misapprehensions of each other. I realized it wouldn't all be nice and politically correct. If blacks (and Latinos) want my respect, they have to deal with their own homophobia. I'm not playing guilty liberal anymore".|$|E
500|$|Guggenheim {{says while}} it would've {{been a lot}} easier to use one format, it would not have had the same impact. [...] "Each format has its own feel and texture and touch. For the {{storytelling}} of what Gore’s memory was like of growing up on the farm, some of this 8mm <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shot is very impressionistic. And for some of his memories of his son’s accident, these grainy black-and-white stills... have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi-def HD that we shot. Every format was used to its best potential. Some of the footage of Katrina has this blown-out video, where the [...] is just blasted, and it looks real muddy, but that too has its own kind of powerful, impactful feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|I was {{surprised}} I got that call 'cause of our {{differences in the}} audiences we hit, but I'm always up for challenges and trying something new ... She described what her album is about and then she sent me some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things. Once I saw that's the vibe she wanted, I still had to make it sound like the way my beats thump and stuff but still give her the atmosphere she's trying to bring out on the singing side.|$|E
500|$|Selena Gomez cited Stripped as an {{inspiration}} for her second studio album Revival, saying [...] "That’s {{one of my favorite}} albums and that was kind of what I started off Revival as, some sort of story. I mean, that album for her was incredible — 'Beautiful', 'Can’t Hold Us Down', all of that — that’s the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love," [...] she said. [...] "That was an album, that was complete on my record. I have 'Rise', 'Survivors', 'Revival', 'Kill Em With Kindness'. My stuff is full on, it's an album, it's a piece, it's something that I'm proud of." [...] In an interview with People, Demi Lovato said that her sixth studio album Tell Me You Love Me was inspired by Stripped. She said, [...] "I grew up listening to Christina Aguilera. She was one of my idols growing up". [...] "I think it was her breakout album that really transformed her into the icon that she is today," [...] explained Lovato. [...] "So that inspired me, she really inspired this album. I was even inspired by the black and white artwork!" ...|$|E
500|$|Burt Reynolds makes a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "The Man from Jupiter", as the love interest of Malory Archer. His guest appearance was formally announced in October 2011. Prior to his appearance, Reynolds was referenced in several episodes of the series. Series creator Adam Reed opined: [...] "I {{think the only}} person on the planet who's a bigger fan of Burt Reynolds than me is Sterling Archer. Archer constantly tries to imitate Burt and always raves about Burt's movies and all-around awesomeness. So to have Burt recording voice-overs for the show was just amazing." [...] After receiving the episode's script from Reed, Reynolds made several edits; while editing the script of the episode, Reynolds added {{a scene in which}} Sterling reveals that his career choice was largely influenced by his films. [...] "We sent him the script beforehand and he noted the script up pretty good. But it was all to make it more self-deprecating." [...] Reed, a fan of Reynolds, said that working with him was a great experience. [...] "It was such a surreal experience being in the room with Burt Reynolds, my childhood hero," [...] he affirmed. [...] "Just hearing him read the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wrote, it was pretty great." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regina Spektor, Randy Newman and Arcade Fire did {{ultimately}} submit {{material to}} the project, albeit later than expected. In an October 2011 interview published in Rolling Stone, Gabriel said, [...] "I've sort of given up waiting for the others ... So now <b>I</b> think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might try to find three or four other people to cover my <b>stuff</b> so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can make an album out of that, and then get that out next year in some form." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{presented}} {{herself at}} the counter in the waiting-room. [...] "I'll trouble you, young woman, {{for a glass of}} ale." [...] She returned to Alban in a better humor. [...] "It's not bad <b>stuff,</b> <b>that!</b> When <b>I</b> have said my say, I'll have a drop more--just to wash the taste of Mr. Mirabel out of my mouth. Wait a bit; I have something to ask you.

500|$|Dexters writing staff began {{meeting in}} March 2008 to {{brainstorm}} {{ideas for the}} third season's storylines. Writer Clyde Phillips said that, when the writers decided to open season 3 with the revelation of Rita's pregnancy, [...] "we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he {{has spent most of}} his adult life taking lives." [...] They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter's relationship to be [...] "the central arc of the season", according to Hall. Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel. Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before. He said, [...] "They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me, that it would be <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't done before, and they've really given me a shot. They've delivered the goods." [...] In regard to Dexter's abandonment of Harry's Code, Hall said that [...] "That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season." [...] Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season's twelve episodes. When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an innocent person, show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so, they were [...] "protecting the character". He thought that it was [...] "very important for the show that he does kill people who deserve it". Phillips said that [...] "We don't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn't deserve it out of impulse or something, but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, he moved north to Hollywood to attend the Musicians Institute, {{completing}} the one-year course {{at the age of}} 19. Buckley later told Rolling Stone Magazine the school was [...] "the biggest waste of time", but noted in an interview with Double Take Magazine that he appreciated studying music theory there, saying, [...] "I was attracted to really interesting harmonies, <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would hear in Ravel, Ellington, Bartók." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with IGN in June 2013, [...] Blomkamp said, [...] "I {{really want to make}} a District 9 sequel. I genuinely do. The problem is I have a bunch of ideas and <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to make. I'm relatively new to this – I'm about to make my third film, and now the pattern that I'm starting to realise is very true is that you lock yourself into a film beyond the film you're currently working on. But it just doesn't work for me." [...] Referring to a potential sequel, Blomkamp said [...] " [...] want to make District 10 at some point".|$|E
5000|$|Liu {{has studied}} various religions, such as Buddhism, Taoism and Jewish mysticism. She has stated, [...] "I'm into all things spiritual—anything {{to do with}} {{meditation}} or chants or any of <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> <b>I</b> studied Chinese philosophy in school. There's something in the metaphysical <b>that</b> <b>I</b> find very fascinating." ...|$|R
60|$|So it was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{reached the}} Marquesas the {{possessor}} {{of a real}} man's size thirst. And in the Marquesas were several white men, a lot of sickly natives, much magnificent scenery, plenty of trade rum, an immense quantity of absinthe, but neither whisky nor gin. The trade rum scorched the skin off one's mouth. I know, because I tried it. But I had ever been plastic, and I accepted the absinthe. The trouble with the <b>stuff</b> was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to take such inordinate quantities in order to feel the slightest effect.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't, sir. You {{know every}} whaler carries an axe {{to cut the}} line if necessary, and I was able to split their skulls as they crawled in before they could get fairly on {{to their feet and}} use their paws. I was getting very weak with scurvy towards the end; {{but as soon as the}} snow melted plants began to shoot, and I was able to collect green <b>stuff,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was nearly well by the time I was picked up." ...|$|R
2500|$|By the mid-1980s, Jourgensen parted {{ways with}} George and signed to Sire Records. Jourgensen {{performed}} mostly solo for Ministry's next LP, Twitch (1986), which sold well, {{but was still}} considered to be [...] "underground". The music was danceable electronic music, but was not pop music, and the sound was harsher and more aggressive than what Ministry had recorded before. According to Jourgensen, [...] "Twitch was <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was doing before With Sympathy came out. Some of that stuff was already {{four or five years}} old, but the record company didn't want to use it, so...". Much of the new sound was created with the use of digital sampling and the input of producer Adrian Sherwood.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were also}} charges of racism, {{due to his}} portrayals of blacks and Hispanics. Baker denied those charges, and {{pointed out that the}} protagonist later {{realized}} that the blacks were also gay and the Latina [...] "was just a sweet old woman putting {{up with a lot of}} (<b>stuff)</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't even imagine."

2500|$|While {{promoting}} his debut album, Everyday Robots, {{in an interview}} with NME, Albarn said: [...] "I can definitely see another Gorillaz-esque record at some point, yeah. That will almost definitely happen. I could put a Gorillaz record out next week; I’ve got enough <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven’t finished. The only thing really that defines a Gorillaz record in my head is when I just play most of it on keyboards. I’ve just been in Paris with Jamie Hewlett. There are points in everyone's relationship where they fall out with people that they're close to and then they reconcile, hopefully, and actually, you know, the relationship's probably in a healthier place as a result of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|He hinted, [...] "Before {{you showed}} me those places today, I'd {{already made up}} my mind <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> built the new house we used to talk about, I'd fix it the way you wanted it. I'm pretty {{practical}} about foundations and radiation and <b>stuff</b> like <b>that,</b> but <b>I</b> guess I don't know a whole lot about architecture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} go and tell the mate to bring along <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> {{mentioned}} before I left. You can easily carry the stuff between you. I'll build the fire and, {{with the aid of}} your son, watch the two prisoners." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] was sequenced as {{the final}} track on Revolver, which EMI's Parlophone label issued on 5 August 1966. In his design for the LP cover, Klaus Voormann drew {{inspiration}} from the song, recognising the need for artwork that would capture the Beatles' new direction and the avant-garde aspect of the recording. Voormann later said that he found [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] "frightening", adding that it was [...] "so {{far away from the}} early Beatles <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> even <b>I</b> myself thought, well, the normal kind of Beatles fan won't want to buy this record. But they did." ...|$|R
