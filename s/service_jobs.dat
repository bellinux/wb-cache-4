5|$|The {{population}} was highly {{supportive of the}} war efforts. The political left supported the war (unlike World War I, which Socialists opposed.) The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked. Anti-Communist sentiment has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God. Likewise the Quakers, with a strong base near Richmond, generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, but {{the federal government was}} much less hostile than before. The churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. Goshen College set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public <b>Service</b> <b>jobs.</b> Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public <b>Service</b> <b>jobs</b> to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.|$|E
5|$|The {{governments of}} the islands in the {{predicted}} path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses. In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996, which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began. In Puerto Rico, fishermen secured their boats {{in preparation for the}} storm. Also on the island, citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in Anguilla enacted a plan that would turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50mph (80km/h). As a precaution, authorities on Saint Martin enacted a curfew for all but those in <b>service</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Washington has a growing, diversified {{economy with}} an {{increasing}} percentage of professional and business <b>service</b> <b>jobs.</b> The gross state {{product of the}} District in 2010 was $103.3billion, which would rank it No. 34 compared to the 50 states. The gross product of the Washington Metropolitan Area was $435billion in 2014, making it the sixth-largest metropolitan economy in the United States. Between 2009 and 2016, GDP per capita in Washington, D.C has consistently ranked on the very top among US states. In 2016, at $160,472, its GDP per capita is almost three times as high as that of Massachusetts, which ranked {{second place in the}} country. As of June 2011, the Washington Metropolitan Area had an unemployment rate of 6.2%; the second-lowest rate among the 49 largest metro areas in the nation. The District of Columbia itself had an unemployment rate of 9.8% during the same time period.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1938, the Kingdom of Hungary, {{under the}} regency of Miklós Horthy, passed {{a series of}} anti-Jewish {{measures}} modeled on the so-called Nuremberg Race Laws enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, {{reducing the number of}} Jews in government and public <b>service</b> <b>jobs,</b> and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, Kalman Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the Axis powers in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also to look in on members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He soon learned to speak Hungarian, and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to Budapest. Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company. In this capacity Wallenberg also made several business trips to Germany and Occupied-France {{during the early years of}} World War II. It was during these trips that Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove quite valuable to him later.|$|E

25|$|Approximately 60.0% of the state's {{population}} lives within the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area and 40.0% in {{the remainder of}} the state, which {{is a result of the}} migration of jobs from farming, mining, and logging, prevalent in the 19th century, to the current concentration in professional, office, and <b>service</b> <b>jobs,</b> concentrated in the metropolitan areas.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model where people {{differ in their}} altruistic {{preferences}} and can serve the public interest in two ways: by making donations to charity and by taking a public <b>service</b> <b>job</b> and exerting effort on the job. Our theory predicts {{that people who are}} more altruistic are more likely to take a public <b>service</b> <b>job</b> and, for a given job, make higher donations to charity. Comparing equally altruistic workers, those with a regular job make higher donations to charity than those with a public <b>service</b> <b>job</b> by a simple substitution argument. We subsequently test these predictions using the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, which contains data on self-reported altruism, sector of employment, and donations to charity for more than 7, 500 workers. We find support for most of our predictions...|$|R

25|$|The {{services}} sector also employs {{a significant percentage}} of females and, possibly, for similar reasons. <b>Service</b> <b>jobs</b> such as culinary arts, retail, and administrative work, similar to agriculture, is low-skill, low-paying labor-intensive work. Many bodies are needed to complete generally basic routine tasks. Accordingly, they are more suited to women in developing countries as higher-paying jobs may require a specificity of skills beyond those of the general female laborer and in countries with gender biases.|$|E
25|$|Resentment also rose {{within the}} Greek Cypriot {{community}} because Turkish Cypriots {{had been given}} a larger share of governmental posts than the size of their population warranted. In accordance with the constitution 30% of civil <b>service</b> <b>jobs</b> were allocated to the Turkish community despite being only 18.3% of the population. Additionally, the position of vice president was reserved for the Turkish population, and both {{the president and vice president}} were given veto power over crucial issues.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{suburban}} infrastructure evolved {{during an}} age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels, {{which has led to}} transportation-dependent systems of living. Zoning reforms that allow greater urban density as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation. The use of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy, as many Americans now work in <b>service</b> <b>jobs</b> that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day.|$|E
25|$|Globalization allows {{corporations}} to outsource manufacturing and <b>service</b> <b>jobs</b> from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities {{with the most}} competitive wages and worker benefits. Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While {{it is true that}} free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually agricultural productions. Larger countries often subsidize their farmers (e.g., the EU's Common Agricultural Policy), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.|$|E
