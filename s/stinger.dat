5|$|Starting in the 1980s, the <b>Stinger</b> and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air {{missiles}} and the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missile were evaluated for use upon the AH-64. The <b>Stinger</b> was initially selected; the U.S. Army was also considering the Starstreak air-to-air missile. External fuel tanks {{can also be}} carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access; these mountings {{can be used to}} secure externally personnel for emergency transportation. <b>Stinger</b> missiles are often used on non-U.S. Apaches, as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies. The AH-64E initially lacked the ability to use the <b>Stinger</b> to make room for self-defense equipment, but the capability was re-added following a South Korean demand.|$|E

50|$|Bee <b>stings</b> {{differ from}} insect bites, and the venom or toxin of <b>stinging</b> insects is quite different. Therefore, the body's {{reaction}} to a bee <b>sting</b> may differ significantly from one species to another. In particular, bee <b>stings</b> are acidic, whereas wasp <b>stings</b> are alkali. So the body's {{reaction to a}} bee <b>sting</b> may be very different than {{to that of a}} wasp <b>sting.</b>|$|R
5|$|Queen {{and worker}} {{bumblebees}} can <b>sting.</b> Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's <b>sting</b> lacks barbs, so the bee can <b>sting</b> repeatedly without injuring itself; {{by the same}} token, the <b>sting</b> is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may <b>sting</b> in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and <b>sting</b> the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.|$|R
5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch. The <b>stinger</b> is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to the insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 <b>Stinger</b> air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight <b>Stinger</b> missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E
5|$|SummerSlam (2003) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and presented by Stacker 2's YJ <b>Stinger.</b> It took place on August24, 2003, at the America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona. It was the 16th annual SummerSlam event and starred wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands.|$|E
40|$|<b>STING</b> is an {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) -associated transmembrane protein that turns on and quickly turns off downstream signaling as it translocates from the ER to vesicles. How <b>STING</b> signaling is attenuated during trafficking remains poorly understood. Here, {{we show that}} trafficking-mediated <b>STING</b> degradation requires ER exit and function of vacuolar ATPase complex. Late-stage <b>STING</b> vesicles are sorted to Rab 7 -positive endolysosomes for degradation. Based on analysis of existing structures, we also identified the helix amino acid 281 (aa 281) – 297 as a motif required for trafficking-mediated <b>STING</b> degradation. Immuno-electron microscopy (EM) reveals the size and clustering of <b>STING</b> vesicles and topology of <b>STING</b> on the vesicle.  Importantly, blockade of trafficking-mediated <b>STING</b> degradation using bafilomycin A 1 specifically enhanced cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) -AMP (cGAMP) -mediated immune response and anti-tumor effect in mice. Together, our findings provide biochemical and imaging evidence for <b>STING</b> degradation by the lysosome and pinpoint trafficking-mediated <b>STING</b> degradation as a previously unanticipated therapeutic target for enhancing <b>STING</b> signaling in cancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|Bee <b>sting</b> {{is rarely}} seen because bee <b>sting</b> {{occurs when the}} beehive is distracted. All cases of bee <b>stings</b> are not fatal. Careful removal of <b>stings</b> from the wound without {{squeezing}} to prevent venom spread into the wound is essential. Multiple bee <b>stings</b> fo r a single human being is not always fatal if treated immediately. In our case, {{there are more than}} 1000 bee <b>stings</b> to a human being, who survived with immediate treatmen...|$|R
50|$|Female euglossines have a {{powerful}} <b>stinging</b> apparatus. However, bee <b>stings</b> are rare as they are solitary and do not zealously protect their nests. Males, on the other hand, do not have <b>stings.</b> <b>Stings</b> give females an evolutionary advantage over males. As a defense mechanism, the <b>stinging</b> apparatus explains the sex ratio {{in favor of the}} females.|$|R
5|$|The Toyota War {{attracted}} considerable {{interest in}} the United States, where {{the possibility of using}} Habré to overthrow Gaddafi was given serious consideration. As part of the Reagan Administration's support for his government, Habré, during a visit to Washington, received a pledge of US$32 million worth of aid, including <b>Stinger</b> anti-aircraft missiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} side-scrolling shoot 'em up and {{revolves}} around the protagonist, Lieutenant Dale Hawkins, recovering caches of hidden <b>Stinger</b> missiles from Arab terrorists in Oman. The game features {{a total of five}} levels with varying locations and begins with allocating five lives to the player. The main objective of the game is to locate and place time bombs on boxes containing <b>Stinger</b> missiles, in which the player is required to escape before the time runs out. The enemies featured in the game are Arab terrorists; the player must neutralise them by shooting them with their selected weapon, which is a handgun by default. Other weapons available in the game include machine guns, rocket launchers, and a flamethrower, which are only accessible through finding hidden crates.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Rosey and The Hurricane (with Super Stacy) {{defeated}} The Heart Throbs (Antonio and Romeo) in a match taped for Sunday Night Heat. The first match that aired was between Carlito and Shelton Benjamin for the Intercontinental Championship. After {{back and forth}} action, Carlito removed the padding {{from one of the}} turnbuckles. Benjamin then hit his head on the exposed metal while performing a <b>Stinger</b> splash. Carlito pinned Benjamin with a roll-up, allowing Carlito to retain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5000|$|Wasps have stingers, {{and their}} <b>sting</b> hurts. Some {{people are very}} {{sensitive}} to wasp <b>stings,</b> and wasp <b>stings</b> can be fatal.|$|R
50|$|Hornets have <b>stings</b> {{used to kill}} prey {{and defend}} hives. Hornet <b>stings</b> are more painful to humans than typical wasp <b>stings</b> because hornet venom {{contains}} a large amount (5%) of acetylcholine. Individual hornets can <b>sting</b> repeatedly; unlike honey bees, hornets and wasps do not die after <b>stinging</b> because their stingers are not barbed and are not pulled out of their bodies.|$|R
40|$|Stimulator of {{interferon}} genes (<b>STING,</b> {{also known}} as MITA and ERIS) is critical in protect-ing the host against DNA pathogen invasion. However, the molecular mechanism underly-ing the regulation of <b>STING</b> remains unclear. Here, we show that PPM 1 A negatively regulates antiviral signaling by targeting <b>STING</b> in its phosphatase activity-dependent man-ner, and in a line with this, PPM 1 A catalytically dephosphorylates <b>STING</b> and TBK 1 in vitro. Importantly, we provide evidence that whereas TBK 1 promotes <b>STING</b> aggregation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, PPM 1 A antagonizes <b>STING</b> aggregation by dephos-phorylating both <b>STING</b> and TBK 1, emphasizing that phosphorylation is crucial for the effi-cient activation of <b>STING.</b> Our findings demonstrate a novel regulatory circuit in which <b>STING</b> and TBK 1 reciprocally regulate each other to enable efficient antiviral signaling acti-vation, and PPM 1 A dephosphorylates <b>STING</b> and TBK 1, thereby balancing this antiviral signal transduction.

5|$|Several wrestlers {{were injured}} at the show. Abyss {{suffered}} several serious cuts {{to his left}} arm, while Sabu had cuts on his arms, legs, and face. Both wrestlers required several stitches after their match. A.J. Styles busted his lip during his title defense, requiring stitches, while Samoa Joe dislocated his jaw. Raven busted his lip but no stitches were required. Jeff Jarrett suffered a bad cut to his forehead during the main event. Lastly, James Storm {{was diagnosed with a}} neck <b>stinger.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is powered}} by a pair of uprated T700-GE-701C engines. The forward fuselage was expanded to accommodate new systems to improve survivability, navigation, and 'tactical internet' communications capabilities. In February 2003, the first Block II Apache was delivered to the U.S. Army, featuring digital communications upgrades. The Japanese Apache AH-64DJP variant is based on the AH-64D; it can be equipped with the AIM-92 <b>Stinger</b> air-to-air missiles for self-defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Ocean Software, {{in which they were}} renowned for creating video games related to their respective films. Navy SEALS focuses on Hawkins recovering caches of <b>Stinger</b> missiles from Arab soldiers in the Middle East. The game received positive reviews upon release, with critics mainly praising the graphics, presentation and challenging gameplay. However, criticism was directed at the ZX Spectrum port, which received disapproval over its monochrome graphics.|$|E
50|$|Although {{for most}} people a bee <b>sting</b> is painful but {{otherwise}} relatively harmless, in people with insect <b>sting</b> allergy, <b>stings</b> may trigger a dangerous anaphylactic reaction that is potentially deadly. Additionally, honey bee <b>stings</b> release pheromones that prompt other nearby bees to attack.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{positive}} results at the preclinical stage, vadimezan failed in human clinical trials. Studies {{have demonstrated the}} reason for the inefficacy. Vadimezan was shown to target the <b>STING</b> pathway, however, this effect is mouse specific; it has no effect on human <b>STING.</b> A single amino acid difference at position 162 (S162A) of the cyclic-dinucleotide-binding site of <b>STING</b> makes mouse <b>STING</b> sensitive to the drug, whereas human <b>STING</b> remains insensitive.|$|R

5|$|Amato (Bruce Willis) is an {{international}} arms dealer who the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been tracking, as they believe Amato is planning the sale of FIM-92 <b>Stinger</b> missiles stolen from a military arms depot. The FBI agrees to allow Metro-Dade to conduct the surveillance as its equipment was in place first. Crockett and Tubbs watch Amato's abusive relationship with his wife Rita (Katherine Borowitz). When Rita attempts to hire a hitman to kill Amato, Crockett intercepts the call and meets with her, arranging her help in their case in return for her safety. She explains that she has tried to leave Amato before, but he hired thugs to rape her divorce lawyer's wife to scare her into place.|$|E
5|$|By June 1991, Banovina {{declared}} {{itself a}} part of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina (SAO Krajina), and the Serb–Croat conflict began to escalate. Clashes peaked in late July, when Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive codenamed Operation <b>Stinger.</b> It was primarily aimed at the Croat-populated villages between Dvor and Hrvatska Kostajnica, and the police station in the town of Glina. The offensive was successful in securing Glina, and prompted the withdrawal of Croat forces from the Una River valley south and west of Hrvatska Kostajnica on 27 July. During the fighting, 12 Croatian policemen and 20 civilians were killed.|$|E
5|$|During the November 11, 2006, {{game against}} Kansas State, McCoy {{suffered}} a <b>stinger</b> shoulder injury while rushing {{for a touchdown}} on the opening drive against Kansas State. Snead came in and played {{the remainder of the}} game. The Longhorns fell behind by as much as 21 points before Snead brought them back to within 3, finally falling in an upset by the Wildcats 45–42. There was speculation that Snead might be the starter for the final regular season game, because it was unknown whether McCoy would return for the Longhorns season closer against rival Texas A on November 24, 2006. However, McCoy was cleared to play the game against the Aggies.|$|E
50|$|Minor <b>stings</b> {{can last}} {{for an hour or}} two. However, severe <b>stinging</b> {{can last for}} months. First aid for the <b>sting</b> is to apply wax hair-removal strips and then yank them off to remove the hairs. Dendrocnide <b>stings</b> have been known to kill dogs and horses that have brushed against them.|$|R
25|$|A {{quick and}} easy remedy for nettle <b>stings</b> is to rub bracken on the {{affected}} area. The juice it releases alleviates the <b>sting,</b> and bracken often grows near <b>stinging</b> nettle.|$|R

5|$|Jack jumper ants are {{primarily}} active {{during the day}} and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodland and dry open forests, surrounded by gravel and sandy soil, which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas. They prey on small insects and use their barbless <b>stinger</b> to kill other insects by injecting venom. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper. The average worker has a life expectancy of over one year. Workers are gamergates, allowing them to reproduce with drones, whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant {{is a part of the}} Myrmecia pilosula species complex; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Like all insects, wasps {{have a hard}} {{exoskeleton}} {{which protects}} their three main body parts, the head, the mesosoma (including the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen) and the metasoma. There is a narrow waist, the petiole, joining {{the first and second}} segments of the abdomen. The two pairs of membranous wings are held together by small hooks and the forewings are larger than the hind ones; in some species, the females have no wings. In females there is usually a rigid ovipositor which may be modified for injecting venom, piercing or sawing. It either extends freely or can be retracted, and may be developed into a <b>stinger</b> for both defence and for paralysing prey.|$|E
40|$|Bee <b>sting</b> {{represent}} an uncommon cause of death. Bee <b>stings</b> are a common, painful and rarely injury. Most literature regarding the immediate treatment of bee <b>stings</b> {{states that the}} <b>sting</b> should be scraped off, perhaps with a knife blade, credit card, or fingernail and never plucked out by pinching with forceps or one`s fingers. To assay the venom injected by a bee <b>sting,</b> we measured {{the area of the}} weal achieved its maximum size approximately 10 min after <b>sting.</b> Ten min after each <b>sting</b> was administered, this observer measured the maximum and minimum diameters of the raised portion of the weal, using a digital caliper. Increased venom dose led to larger weal sizes. Weal area was approximately a log_linear of dose. We showed that the <b>sting</b> weal bioassay we used is well correlated with the quantity of venom received by the subject...|$|R
5000|$|Many people {{consider}} a <b>sting</b> from a bullet ant {{to resemble the}} sensation of getting shot. Justin Schmidt, an entomologist who developed the Schmidt <b>sting</b> pain index, described it as [...] "pure, intense, brilliant pain...like walking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch nail embedded in your heel," [...] and considers the <b>sting</b> from a bullet ant {{to be the most}} painful insect <b>sting</b> he has experienced. The pain from bullet ant <b>stings</b> can last for many hours, even up to 24 hours. Both the immense pain and the duration of the <b>sting</b> are due to the effects of poneratoxin. In addition to the infamous pain, symptoms of <b>stings</b> from bullet ants (as well as <b>stings</b> from other ants of the genus Paraponera as well as the genus Dinoponera) include fever, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, lymphadenopathy and cardiac arrhythmias.|$|R
30|$|Both PLpro-TM and <b>STING</b> are membrane-bound {{proteins}} that are {{anchored to the}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane with the transmembrane (TM) domain (Huang et al., 2012; Ouyang et al., 2012; Shang et al., 2012; Shu et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2012), and the TM domains at the N-terminus of <b>STING</b> {{were found to be}} indispensable for IRF 3 activation in vitro (Tanaka and Chen, 2012). Our recent study demonstrated that coronavirus PLpros negatively regulate antiviral innate immune response by disruption of STING-mediated signaling (Sun et al., 2012). In this study, we further addressed which <b>STING</b> domains are required for the interaction between <b>STING</b> and PLpro-TM. We constructed a series of deletion mutants of <b>STING,</b> as described in Fig.  3 C. The association of <b>STING</b> mutants with PLpro-TM was assessed by co-transfection of PLpro-TM and each of the <b>STING</b> mutants into HEK 293 T cells. We found that the association between <b>STING</b> and PLpro-TM was completely abolished when 4 TM domains at the N-terminus of <b>STING</b> were deleted (Fig.  3 D, lanes 5 and 8). Partial deletion of TM domains or the C-terminal helicase domain did not affect the interaction between <b>STING</b> and PLpro-TM (Fig.  3 D, lanes 4, 6, and 7). These findings indicate that PLpro-TM interacts with <b>STING</b> through the TM domains.|$|R
