40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} root-synthesized ABA in regulating growth and stomatal behaviour under well-watered conditions, isogenic wild-type (WT) and ABA-deficient flacca (flc) tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) were reciprocally and self-grafted just below the cotyledonary node. Since flc <b>scions</b> had lower leaf water potentials due to higher transpiration rates, a subset of all graft combinations was grown under a shoot misting treatment to minimize differences in shoot water status. Misting did not alter the relative effects of the different graft combinations on leaf area. WT <b>scions</b> had the greatest leaf area and lowest whole plant transpiration rate irrespective of the rootstock, implying that shoot ABA biosynthesis was sufficient to account for a WT shoot phenotype. In WT <b>scions,</b> the rootstock {{had no effect on}} detached leaf ethylene evolution or xylem concentrations of ABA or the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC). In flc <b>scions,</b> although the WT rootstock suppressed stomatal conductance of individual leaves, there was no detectable effect on whole plant transpiration rate. However, leaf area of flc/WT (scion/rootstock) plants increased 1. 6 -fold compared to flc self-grafts. WT rootstocks increased xylem ABA concentration in flc <b>scions</b> (relative to flc self-grafts) up to 3 -fold, and resulted in xylem ACC concentrations and detached leaf ethylene evolution similar to WT <b>scions.</b> Since the WT rootstock normalized shoot ethylene relations but only partially restored the leaf area of flc <b>scions</b> (relative to that of WT <b>scions),</b> shoot ABA biosynthesis can directly promote leaf area via an unknown, ethylene-independent, mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} were investigated {{under which the}} development cycle in winter rape could be markedly reduced by grafting. <b>Scions</b> from non vernalized seedlings were grafted onto stock plants beginning their generative phase. Winter rape plants vernalized under natural field conditions and spring rape plants in the initial generative phase were used as stock. Best results were obtained by grafting <b>scions</b> from plants at the stage of 4 leaves, i. e. after 3 weeks of growth, onto winter rape stock. With such <b>scions</b> the effectiveness of graftings was high and seed crops were obtained 170 days earlier than under natural field conditions of growth and 80 days earlier than under artificial conditions. <b>Scions</b> grafted onto winter rape stock produced more siliques than those on spring rape. Grafting of <b>scions</b> after cutting off their apical meristems allowed formation of side shoots and consequently resulted in higher yields of siliques; the formation of siliques, however, was delayed by about 10 days as compared to grafts with apical meristems...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{silencing}} is {{a mechanism}} of gene regulation by sequence specific RNA degradation and {{is involved in}} controlling endogenous gene expression and defense against invasive nucleic acids such as viruses. RNA silencing has been proven to be transmitted between <b>scions</b> and rootstocks through grafting, mostly using transgenic plants. It {{has been reported that}} RNA silencing of tobacco endogenous genes, NtTOM 1 and NtTOM 3, that are required for tobamovirus multiplication, resulted in high resistance against several tobamoviruses. In the present study, we examined the graft transmission of RNA silencing for conferring virus resistance to non-transgenic <b>scions</b> of the same and different Nicotiana species grafted onto rootstocks in which both NtTOM 1 and NtTOM 3 were silenced. Non-transgenic Nicotiana tabacum (cvs. Samsun and Xanthi nc) and N. benthamiana were used as <b>scions</b> for grafting onto the rootstocks silenced with both genes. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) of NtTOM 1 and NtTOM 3 was detected in both the <b>scions</b> and the rootstocks eight weeks after grafting. The leaves were detached from the <b>scions</b> and inoculated with several tobamoviruses. The virus accumulation was tested by ELISA and northern blot analysis. The viruses were detected in grafted <b>scions</b> at extremely low levels, showing that virus resistance was conferred. These results suggest that RNA silencing was induced in and virus resistance was conferred to the non-transgenic <b>scions</b> by grafting onto silenced rootstocks.

5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen years, Grannvale expands to hold {{dominion}} {{over the whole}} of Judgral, and Arvis turns Grannvale into an empire and styles himself emperor. He and Deirdre have twin children: Julius, the <b>scion</b> of Loptyr, and Julia, the <b>scion</b> of Naga. Manfroy uses the Loptyr tome to corrupt Julius and turn him into Loptyr's vessel, and Deirdre sacrifices herself to send Julia into hiding. Julius overthrows his father and turns the Empire into a tyrannical regime. At this point, Seliph comes out of hiding to protect a nearby village, revealing his long-hidden existence to Grannvale. Traveling across the lands of Jugdral, Seliph reunites with the long-hidden children of Sigurd's companions, including Julia. Making {{his way through the}} countries of Jugdral, he gains support from the surviving powers, and gradually frees Grannvale's conquered territories. Arvis is powerless to subvert his son's rule, and is killed in battle against Seliph. During the course of these battles, Julia is captured and Manfroy and Julius attempt to sacrifice her as her powers could banish Loptyr for good. Seliph manages to save her, and after defeating Manfroy and Julius in battle, Julia successfully banishes Loptyr, ending his rule for good and allowing Jugdral to recover from the recent conflicts. Seliph takes his rightful place on the throne as the emperor of Grannvale, and restores power to the surrounding countries with their respective heirs.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} was studied {{of transferring}} the flowering factor in winter rape from vernalized plants to plants in which generative development was not induced by cold treatment. In {{a series of}} grafts made under field conditions <b>scions</b> from non vernalized plants were grafted into stems of vernalized ones at the phase of bud and flower formation. Non vernalized <b>scions</b> adopted the ability to generative development from vernalized stock.

This dynasty, which ruled most of the western Deccan in South India is sometimes called the Kalyani Chalukya Dynasty after its royal capital at Kalyani (now Basavakalyan) and sometimes called the Later Chalukya Dynasty for its theoretical relationship to the 6th-century Chalukya dynasty of Badami. For a brief period (11621183), the Kalachuris of Kalyani, a dynasty of kings who had earlier migrated to the Karnataka region from central India and served as vassals for several generations, exploited the growing weakness of their overlords and annexed the Kalyani. Around 1183, the last Chalukya <b>scion,</b> Someshvara IV, overthrew the Kalachuris to regain control of the royal city.

His activities soon spurred the Confederacy to launch a nuclear attack against Korhal, wiping out its population; Mengsk swore vengeance, and formed a revolutionary group he called the Sons of Korhal. Years of open conflict successfully weakened Confederate control over the fringe worlds, during which he recruited followers such as Sarah Kerrigan, Jim Raynor and Edmund Duke. Raynor and Kerrigan grew uneasy with Mengsk's increasingly extreme methods, namely luring Zerg to attack Confederate targets, leading to Mengsk abandoning Kerrigan to the Zerg on the Confederate capital of Tarsonis (another reason for the latter was Kerrigan had been the assassin that murdered his father).
