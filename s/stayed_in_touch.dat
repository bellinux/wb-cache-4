5|$|When V-E Day {{arrived in}} early May 1945, Chappuis and his crewmates stayed in Asola for a week-long celebration. On {{the night the}} war ended, {{residents}} of Asola removed the seats from the town's theater for a victory ball. While two orchestras played onstage, the liberated townspeople toasted the Americans, and Chappuis danced with the Ugolinis' daughters. When Chappuis returned to the United States, he <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with the Ugolinis and sent them weekly food packages. Chappuis also <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with Comucci, the resistance leader who rescued him. In 1974, Chappuis returned to Italy to meet with Comucci {{for the first time}} in 20years. And in August 1975, Comucci and his wife traveled to Michigan to visit Chappuis.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard. Meanwhile, he <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with his philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made {{a great impact on}} Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm lens, is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E

Although Genie's mother later recalled that most of their conversations during this time were shallow in nature, they continued to get along very well.

500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1914, Holloway made his first visit to the US and then went to Buenos Aires and Valparaíso with the concert party The Grotesques. At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, he decided to return to England, but his departure was delayed for six weeks due to his contract with the troupe. [...] At the age of 25, Holloway enlisted in the Connaught Rangers in which he was commissioned as a subaltern in December 1915 [...] because of his previous training in the London Rifle Brigade.

[...] It was their sixth victory in the past seven and the fastest winning time since the 1949 race.

500|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} as a mass organization, formed around a core of prewar officers. Home Army soldiers fell into three groups.

The third, largest group were [...] "part-time members": [...] sympathizers who led [...] "double lives" [...] under their real names in their real homes, received no payment for their services, <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with their undercover unit commanders but were seldom mustered for operations, as the Home Army planned to use them only during a planned nationwide rising.|$|E

In 1942, the British Ambassador Miles Lampson marched into King Farouk's palace and ordered him to dismiss Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha for having pro-Axis sympathies. Nasser saw the incident as a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote, [...] "I am ashamed that our army has not reacted against this attack", and wished for [...] "calamity" [...] to overtake the British. Nasser was accepted into the General Staff College later that year. He began to form a group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments who supported some form of revolution. Nasser <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with the group's members primarily through Amer, who continued to seek out interested officers within the Egyptian Armed Force's various branches and presented Nasser with a complete file on each of them.|$|E

[...] Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black's decision and {{by the summer of}} 2004 the band had reunited. DreamWorks asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the Shrek 2 soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago's basement.
