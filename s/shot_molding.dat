Three Dimensional Molded Interconnect Devices (3 D-MID) has {{enormous}} potential for rationalization in both manufacturing {{process and the}} freedom to design of mechatronic products. Two <b>shot</b> <b>molding</b> {{is one of the most}} important and commonly used methods among the various MID manufacturing processes. Currently, there is a lack of effective design and simulation tools that can be used for MID with two <b>shot</b> <b>molding.</b> In this paper, an integrated product model using feature technology, some MID-specific design functions, and one special interface based on the API of Moldflow Plastics Insight (MPI) and the COM-Technology are presented. These developed product model, functions and interface increase the efficiency of the MID design process, and the design and simulation integrated environment also towards the rational and optimal design of MID products with two <b>shot</b> <b>molding...</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{large number}} of arms, {{including}} cannons and small arms, bowls and storage jars, surgical and carpentry tools, as well as wooden pieces of the hull and metal pieces from the rigging, have been recovered from the wreck. Arms on the ship included two bombardettas, fifteen versos (a type of breech-loading swivel gun), haquebuts, haquebuzes (a smaller type of arquebus), grenades, crossbows and quarrels, swords, daggers, breech chambers (powder cartridges) for the bombardetas and versos, <b>shot</b> <b>molds</b> and sheets of lead to be melted as needed to make shot. The wreck also contained many pot sherds {{from a variety of}} olive jars, escudillas (bowls) and lebrillos (basins) of styles typical of Spanish and Portuguese pottery of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Some more crudely made vessels of uncertain provenance were also found.|$|R
25|$|Cores {{are used}} for complex {{injection}} moldings in the fusible core injection molding process. First, a core is made from a fusible alloy or low melting temperature polymer. It is then placed inside the injection mold's dies and the plastic is <b>shot</b> into the <b>mold.</b> The molding is then removed from the mold with the core still in it. Finally, the core is melted or washed out of the molding in a hot bath.|$|R

The Indians had just fled, leaving seven hundred pounds of the flour, together with belting from the mill, mill files, baskets, bullets, lead, <b>shot</b> pouches, bullet <b>molds,</b> etc., {{all of which were}} burned, there being no means of packing them.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{microcellular}} ABS foams were studied. A {{series of}} injection molding samples {{defined by a}} design of experiments was carried out to analyze the effect of <b>shot</b> volume, <b>mold</b> temperature, and injection velocity on the morphology, mechanical properties, and surface roughness of microcellular samples. A predominant influence of shot volume on the cell structure and tensile properties was evidenced. Higher cell densities and narrower cell size distributions were obtained at lower injection volume. However, elastic modulus and tensile strength were improved by increasing the shot size. The effect of mold temperature and injection velocity was secondary. Higher levels of mold temperature and injection rate provided finer cell morphologies, but their effects on the elastic modulus and tensile strength were negligible. The decrease in shot volume and increase in gas content led to poor surface quality, whereas it was greatly improved by raising both mold temperature and injection velocityPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} that result from these long development times and high costs is making accurate cores repeatably. This is extremely important because the core {{is an integral part}} of the mold, so essentially each shot is into a new mold cavity. Another difficulty is keeping the core from melting when the plastic is <b>shot</b> into the <b>mold,</b> because the plastic is approximately twice the melting temperature of the core material. A third difficulty is the low strength of the core. Hollow plastic cores can collapse if too much pressure is used in the shot plastic. Metal cores (with low melting temperatures) are solid so they cannot collapse, but are only 10% as strong as steel cores so they can distort. This is especially a problem when molding manifolds, because the waviness of the core can be detrimental to the airflow within the runners.|$|R
40|$|Microcellular injection-molding {{technology}} {{is capable of}} producing lightweight polymeric products. The foam morphology {{is determined by the}} injection-molding parameters, and it has been observed that depending on the parameter variations, the cell structure may exhibit substantial morphological differences through the entire section along the melt flow direction of the injected part. The effects of varying injection-molding parameters on foam morphology and thermal mechanical properties of a multiphase ethylene-propylene block copolymer (EPBC) were tested on 5 -mm plaque specimens using a constant temperature profile. It has been found that injection speed does not {{have a significant effect on}} the thermal-mechanical properties of the foam, whereas <b>shot</b> volume and <b>mold</b> temperature do have a significant influence. Low shot volume produces uniform density cellular structures and larger cores, whereas lower mold temperatures help maintain small cell sizes. Furthermore, the effect of the copolymerâ€™s crystalline phase on foam morphology has been observed. This study identifies the achievable foam morphologies and the thermal-mechanical performance of cellular molded EPBC parts. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Injection molding is {{a widely}} {{employed}} manufacturing process in modern industry for mass production of plastic parts. Of the various parameters that {{affect the quality of}} injection molded products, the pressure and temperature distribution within the mold cavity are the most critical factors, as improper setting of the filling pressure or cooling speed may lead to defects such as sinks, flashes, or short <b>shots.</b> With increasing <b>mold</b> complexity and the related high cost to structurally modify the mold for sensor accommodation, the ability to integrate multiple, miniaturized sensors within the mold cavity for on- line, multi-point pressure and temperature distribution measurement while minimizing mold structure modification becomes highly attractive to the industry. ^ This thesis presented the design of a self-energized, acoustic wireless sensing methodology for the simultaneous measurement of pressure and temperature right at the mold cavity, within one sensor package. The sensor harvests energy from the pressure variation of the polymer melt during the injection molding process, and utilizes ultrasonic pulses as the carrier to wirelessly transmit pressure and temperature information through the injection mold. A significant advantage of the designed sensing method is that it avoids drilling through-holes in the injection molds or holding plates, which are costly to implement but necessary for installing traditional wired sensors, thereby allowing multiple sensors to be embedded within a complicated mold structure to improve the observability of the polymer state during the injection molding processes. ^ Research conducted in this thesis addresses four aspects of the complete solution: (1) Design of a dual-parameter modulation method suited for injection molding environment, (2) Structural optimization of the energy harvesting component, known as a piezoceramic stack, for a minimal volume of the stack while maintaining the minimum Signal-to-Noise Ratio required for reliable signal reception, (3) Design of a multi-layer ultrasound transmitter for effective transmission of the ultrasonic pulses through injection mold steel, and (4) The investigation of signal propagation within the mold cavity and the optimal localization of the receiver to obtain maximum signal strength on the back surface of the injection mold. ^ The developed sensing methodology was systematically evaluated through experiments using a sensor prototype on a Milacron T 100 injection molding machine. States of the melt at multiple locations in the mold cavity were retrieved from the sensor data to provide real- time process feedback for the machine controllers. This information will enable the development and widespread implementation of state variable control algorithms for injection molding to reduce the time required for process set-up and stabilization, and improve part quality and consistency. The energy harvesting and signal modulation mechanisms developed from this research provide a new means to power sensors for the condition monitoring and health diagnosis of dynamic systems and processes in a broad range of applications. ...|$|R
