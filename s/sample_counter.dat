40|$|Background: This {{qualitative}} study explores experiences of living without regular immigration status {{and implications for}} health security among irregular migrants in Toronto. Irregular migrants include those who lack secure status in Canada, including visitors who overstay visas; refugee claimants awaiting status determination; and failed claimants remaining in the country without authorization, awaiting deportation or following alternative procedures when judicial appeal is impossible. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} irregular migrants recruited at a downtown community health centre. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using grounded theory and qualitative analytical techniques. The theoretical framework employed anthropological metaphors of liminality and examined psychosocial factors associated with stress. Findings: Experiences of the study <b>sample</b> <b>counter</b> popular assumptions about irregular immigrants. The majority of study participants came to Canada to escape violence as well as lack of economic opportunity in home countries in Latin America, and most have trie...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to use dual-isotope lymphoscintigra-phy in healthy volunteers and women with breast cancer–re-lated {{lymphedema}} (BCRL) to detect and quantify transport of radiolabeled protein from a subcutaneous injection depot to local blood vessels as a potential mechanism of protection against edema resulting from treatment to the axilla. Methods: A total of 29 subjects and 18 women with a history of BCRL received bilateral subcutaneous injections of human IgG (HIgG) in the second dorsal web space of each hand, 99 mTc-HIgG on one side and 111 In-HIgG on the other. In 8 further healthy sub-jects, epinephrine was administered with the labeled HIgG.

Actual sampling time of data can be determined using a fast counter as a variable. Variations in the sampling time can be examined using consecutive <b>sampled</b> <b>counter</b> values to construct jitter values. Difference in sampling time between variables can be observed by reading the same counter value from different server channels. In this study the timing accuracy of one specific OPC server is considered and reliability of variable values assessed. Accuracy of the time stamp provided by the OPC server is evaluated and network and CPU load monitored. Tests are conducted using different settings at both server and client side. According to the results the timing accuracy and variable reliability varies depending on the server and client settings.

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of highly multithreaded architectures, an effective performance monitoring system must reflect the interaction between {{a large number of}} concurrent events, and associate the overall effect of individual events and inefficiencies to the operations in the application source code. The state-of-the-art performance counters in highly multithreaded graphic processors currently do not provide this level of precision. Although fine-grained <b>sampling</b> of performance <b>counters</b> after each source-level operation could potentially achieve the desired precision, the high frequency of sampling required will likely cause too much distortion to the actual application behavior and make the <b>sampled</b> <b>counter</b> values inaccurate. In this thesis, I present a novel software-based approach for monitoring the memory hierarchy performance in highly multithreaded general-purpose graphics processors. The proposed analysis is based on memory traces collected for small snapshots of application execution. A trace-based memory hierarchy model with a Monte Carlo experimental methodology generates statistical bounds of performance measures in the presence of nonuniform thread interleaving and data sharing in a highly multithreaded execution environment. The statistical approach overcomes the classical problem of disturbed execution timing due to instrumentation. The approach scales well as I deploy a minimal sampling technique to reduce the trace generation overhead and model simulation time. The proposed scheme also keeps track of individual memory operations in the source code and can quantify the amount of their contribution to detrimental effects on memory system performance. A cross-validation of the model results shows close agreement with the values read from the hardware performance counters on an NVIDIA Tesla C 2050. I later use the predicted memory hierarchy performance statistics in an analytical model to identify performance characteristics of a kernel and its expected execution time. To account for the systematic error present in the predictions, I approximate the error function and express a range of potential true execution times for each predicted value...|$|R

40|$|The program PROCSCAN was {{developed}} to monitor the profile of an executable image during execution. The purpose is to identify the routines where a program is spending most of its time. Thus PROCSCAN {{can be a very}} useful first step in program optimization. PROCSCAN <b>samples</b> the program <b>counter</b> of the executing image and compares its value to a table of entry point addresses in order to determine which subroutine is executing. The table of subroutines in the image is generated by the program SCANEXE (NPO- 17298), which is included with this program, but is also available from COSMIC as a separate package. The output from PROCSCAN is a sorted histogram of subroutines versus time spent in each subroutine.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sampling is {{inevitable}} in epidemiological studies involving large cohorts. Designs such as case-cohort <b>sampling</b> and <b>counter</b> matching were originally developed in semi-parametric settings where {{individuals with a}} common base line hazard are followed over {{time in order to}} detect relationships between disease and exposure. Even when design performance is favorable when measured by asymptotic relative efficiency against situations where full cohort data is available, the use of sampling designs raises questions about their absolute efficiency. In addition, many sampling designs developed in the semi-parametric setting can be implemented in studies having no time dependence, and the usual martingale methods and counting process techniques can no longer be used in the study of estimator properties. In their place, to analyze the frequency matching design, local central limit theorems for independent but not identically distributed Bernoulli random variables must be developed, which by conditioning, allows for the study of asymptotic estimator properties. The analysis also provides results about the high correlation structure in the sampling proportional to size type scheme known as rejective sampling...|$|R
