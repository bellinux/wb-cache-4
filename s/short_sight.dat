25|$|In {{spite of}} <b>short</b> <b>sight</b> he was {{becoming}} very well known as a gentleman rider, and on 10 October 1868 actually won three races in one day at the Melbourne Hunt Club steeplechase meeting. He rode with great patience and judgment, but his want of good sight was always a handicap. He began riding for money but was not fortunate and {{had more than one}} serious fall. He sold his business and left Ballarat in October 1868 and came to Melbourne and eventually found lodgings at 10 Lewis Street, Brighton. He had succeeded in straightening his financial affairs and was more cheerful. He made a little money out of his racing and {{became a member of the}} Yorick Club, where he was friendly with Marcus Clarke, George Gordon McCrae, and a little later Henry Kendall. On 12 March 1870 Gordon had a bad fall while riding in a steeplechase at Flemington Racecourse.|$|E

[...] Tall and elegant, {{he was known as}} an upright and attacking opening batsman. He missed the {{opportunity}} to play during the Second World War. [...] His <b>short</b> <b>sight</b> prevented him from joining the Armed Forces.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{was tall}} and {{handsome}} (see portrait prefixed to The Laureate of the Centaurs). But he stooped and held himself badly, partly {{on account of his}} <b>short</b> <b>sight.</b> He was shy, sensitive and, even before he was overwhelmed with troubles, inclined to be moody. After his head was injured at Ballarat he was never the same man again, and subsequent accidents aggravated his condition. Any suggestion that drink was a contributing cause may be disregarded. Sir Frank Madden, who was with him the day before his death, said that he was then absolutely sober, [...] "he never cared for it [...] and so far as I know seldom took it at all". The Rev. Tenison Woods in his [...] "Personal Reminiscences" [...] said [...] "Those who did not know Gordon attributed his suicide to drink, but I repeat he was most temperate and disliked the company of drinking men".|$|E
40|$|We model an {{assurance}} {{game played}} within a population with {{two types of}} individuals – short-sighted and foresighted. Foresighted people have a lower discount rate than <b>short</b> <b>sighted</b> people. These phenotypes interact with each other. We define the persistent interaction of foresighted people with other foresighted people as a critical element of civilization while the interaction of <b>short</b> <b>sighted</b> people with other <b>short</b> <b>sighted</b> people as critical {{to the failure of}} civilization. We show that whether the <b>short</b> <b>sighted</b> phenotype will be an evolutionary stable strategy (and thus lead to the collapse of civilization) depends on the initial proportion of <b>short</b> <b>sighted</b> people relative to people with foresight as well as their relative discount rates. Further we explore some comparative static results that connect the probability of the game continuing and the relative size of the two discount rates to the likelihood that civilization will collapse...|$|R

A great thing in my favour is that I can generally manage {{to get at the}} pith of a thing, while most people can do nothing but sniff in a hopeless sort of way at the rind. Of course you have noticed that in me, Connie. I sometimes regret that I am not a barrister, for I possess the qualities that lead to success in that profession. At the same time it is a profession that has a very narrowing effect on the mind--the issues are really in most cases so paltry. Your barrister never can be a statesman; he has looked at things so closely, to study the little details, that his eagle vision has changed into the <b>short</b> <b>sight</b> of the owl.

Meta met them with outstretched hands and a face beaming with welcome. [...] "I told you I should get my way!" [...] she said triumphantly, and, after her warm greeting, she looked with some respect at the face of the Miss May who was so very clever. It certainly was not what she expected, not at all like either of the four sisters she had already seen--brown, sallow, and with that sharp long nose, and the eager eyes, and brow a little knit by the desire to see as far as she could. It was pleasanter to look at Flora.|$|E

So he took the neatest little header into the water, and started off to see for himself; and, when he came near, the ball turned out to be four or five {{beautiful}} creatures, many times larger than Tom, who were swimming about, and rolling, and diving, and twisting, and wrestling, and cuddling, and kissing and biting, and scratching, in the most charming fashion that ever was seen. And if you don't believe me, you may go to the Zoological Gardens (for I am afraid that you won't see it nearer, unless, perhaps, you get up at five in the morning, and go down to Cordery's Moor, and watch by the great withy pollard which hangs over the backwater, where the otters breed sometimes), and then say, if otters at play in the water are not the merriest, lithest, gracefullest creatures you ever saw.|$|E

More obvious, more prominent, shone on by the full light of the large window, were the occupants of the benches just before me, of whom some were girls of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, some young women from eighteen (as it appeared to me) up to twenty; the most modest attire, the simplest fashion of wearing the hair, were apparent in all; and good features, ruddy, blooming complexions, large and brilliant eyes, forms full, even to solidity, seemed to abound.

Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon <b>short</b> <b>sight</b> and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her." ...|$|E

It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she {{would not be allowed to}} remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's <b>short</b> <b>sight,</b> he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself." ...|$|E
