It was the first to offer <b>sandwich</b> <b>courses.</b> Pharmacy and naval architecture departments were established in 1921 and 1922 respectively. The Pharmacy Department began as a single bench in the Chemistry Department, but soon grew to become the largest in the country. From 1930, some students in the Faculty of Applied Science read for degrees of the University of Durham. In 1930, a Mining Department was established and pharmacy students could read for the Bachelor of Pharmacy degree of the University of London. Sunderland was also recognised by London University as a centre for its BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) degree in 1934.|$|E

50|$|A {{sandwich}} {{degree is}} a course {{specific to the}} UK, a four-year undergraduate course - if it's part of a bachelor's degree - or - if it's part of a master's degree - a five-year postgraduate course in which students undertake a placement year, or internship in industry; normally after the second year at university. During 1989 in the United Kingdom, about 20% {{of the students in}} higher education were on <b>sandwich</b> <b>courses.</b>|$|E

50|$|At {{university}} level, {{work experience}} is often offered between {{the second and}} final years of an undergraduate degree course, especially in the science, engineering and computing fields. Courses of this nature are often called <b>sandwich</b> <b>courses,</b> with the work experience year itself known as the sandwich year. During this time, the students on work placement {{have the opportunity to}} use the skills and knowledge gained in their first two years, and see how they are applied to real world problems. This offers them useful insights for their final year and prepares them for the job market once their course has finished. Some companies sponsor students in their final year at university with the promise of a job {{at the end of the}} course. This is an incentive for the student to perform well during the placement as it helps with two otherwise unwelcome stresses: the lack of money in the final year, and finding a job when the University course ends.|$|E

Not only did the courses grow numerically and attract larger numbers of students but the philosophy and practice associated with them developed in significant ways. The causes of this new interest were not obvious; they were in part social and economic, but the growth was helped, if not occasioned, by a change in educational outlook of some technical colleges and by the active suppor...|$|E

40|$|Combining work {{experience}} with degree-level study {{is seen as}} a key differentiator for securing employment upon graduation in a competitive employment market. The positive benefits of <b>sandwich</b> <b>courses,</b> where up to twelve months is spent working in industry, are widely acknowledged in academic literature though data analysis tends to focus on cohorts in single subject areas with course-based factors possibly influencing outcomes. This paper explores the benefits of work placements on a cross-cohort basis with an institutional level study empirically analysing over three academic years the outcomes for placement students in comparison to non-placement students. The study found that completing a sandwich work placement is associated with improved academic performance in the final year of study. Placement students {{are also more likely to}} secure appropriate graduate-level work and higher starting salaries upon completion of their degree in comparison to non-placement students...|$|E
40|$|The {{employment}} {{market for}} graduates is competitive with employers requiring appropriate work experience {{in addition to}} academic qualifications. <b>Sandwich</b> <b>courses,</b> where {{up to a year}} is spent in industry, provide an opportunity for structured work experience to be gained alongside studying. Benefits of placements include improved academic performance and the development of transferable skills to increase employability. This paper evaluates the impact of placements on academic performance and graduate employment among management students. Analysing performance data and graduate destinations data, results indicate that management students completing a placement are more likely to perform better academically with improvements in their personal grades between year 2 and the final year. Additionally, a qualitative themed analysis of student experiences indicates placement students feel more confident in engaging with the graduate recruitment process, with a better understanding of their personal skills and an ability to articulate their experience in relation to the workplace...|$|E

40|$|Whether or not {{education}} at the higher level can be integrated with practical experience has preoccupied educationalists in Europe and North America for a considerable time. There are some disciplines in which the existence of laboratory practice or simulated work experience {{can be used to}} assist the process of learning-by-doing quite efficiently. In other areas, learning from experience may be best carried out in the employment environment itself. Historically, in the UK this was the pattern for the traditional professions of law, accountancy, medicine and architecture. More recently in the UK, <b>sandwich</b> <b>courses,</b> predominantly a 'new' university contribution to higher education, have been developed to give students a balance between academic theory and practical professional experience.

40|$|Much of the {{research}} into Higher Education {{and its role in}} work-based learning, and especially in supporting undergraduate students on placements, has focussed on longer term internships and <b>sandwich</b> <b>courses.</b> Research has also concentrated on subject areas that have traditionally been associated with the above; for example Business, Health, and Engineering. By contrast, the aim {{of this study was to}} gather data from students on a much shorter period of placement categorised as a ‘short project’ (Brennan and Little, 1996). In addition the data recovered was from students studying within the social sciences paradigm, undertaking an undergraduate degree in Education Studies (not teacher training). The social sciences and humanities more generally have not been discussed to any great extent within the context of research on placement or work-based learning; the subject area of Education Studies is not covered little by previous research. The results suggest that even a relatively short period of structured placement can be of significant benefit to students and provide them with an opportunity to assess their career direction and gain valuable experience. The paper also considers to what extent this type of placement can be applied to other subject areas within Higher Education...|$|E

The MITB is typically a <b>sandwich</b> <b>course</b> of two distinct horizontals targeted at providing a holistic view and understanding of both technology and management alike.

A five-year course used to exist {{in a similar fashion}} to the United States, but the 1960s saw the introduction of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>course</b> and a split of the B.Arch. into a 3-year BA (Hons.) degree (or in some cases BSc) followed by a year working in practice, after which a 2-year MA, PG-DipArch, M.Arch. or B.Arch. is completed. A further year of work completes the student's education upon the passing of Part III final examinations (See below). Registration as an architect is then permissible by the Architects Registration Board. Many UK universities offer postgraduate programs by coursework and research in architecture and related fields such as landscape architecture, planning, and urban design.|$|R
