5|$|In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Roman Catholic leanings, {{evidenced}} {{by the use of}} pre-Reformation Latin texts for his motets and his 1606 conviction for recusancy, Peerson's position {{at the heart of the}} Anglican establishment confirms the overall esteem in which he was held.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was {{published}} by Random House. The tale's rhyming verse accompanies illustrations by the author, and follows a disagreeable character called the Grinch and his attempts to thwart the arrival of Christmas by stealing the gifts, trims, and other trappings of the holiday from the happy Whos of Whoville. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attempts, Christmas arrives all the same.|$|E

5|$|In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{athletic}} {{record and}} remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired {{a reputation as}} a clumsy, likable, and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.|$|E
5|$|In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{relatively}} small stature, , he excelled in the air, {{due to his}} heading accuracy and elevation. Renowned for his bending shots, {{he was also an}} accurate free-kick taker, and penalty taker, although he often refrained from taking penalties, stating that he believed it to be a cowardly way to score.|$|E

5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E
5|$|Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; their shared liberal ideology {{led them to}} seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> conservative militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies {{as a result of}} his ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick III would move to liberalize the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he {{invested}} {{large sums}} of money in the hobby. Murphy had a gambling habit that left his finances in a poor state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.|$|E

It was not that he saw or felt any hope connected with the circumstance; but it was grateful to the jealous covetousness of unlimited love thus to learn that no other ears had heard the sweet confessions that were denied its own.|$|R

Dominik had been working on the project for five years, but was unable to find an actor to portray Read. Only after Read himself suggested Bana, having seen him perform a skit on television, did Dominik consider him for the part.|$|E
5|$|In 85, Agricola was {{recalled}} to Rome by Domitian, {{having served}} {{for more than}} six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era. Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania. The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{opted to}} remain in Madrid for the 2015–16 season as he sought {{to break into the}} first team under new club manager Rafa Benítez. However, he found {{competition}} for places tough and was limited to just 1252 minutes of football across all competitions under Benítez and his successor, Zinedine Zidane. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lack of game time, Jesé still managed to contribute 6 goals and 8 assists for the season and was a regularly used as back-up in the team's triumphant 2015–16 UEFA Champions League campaign.|$|E

5|$|Kiprusoff {{was offered}} {{a spot on the}} Finnish team for the 2002 Winter Olympics, but {{declined}} citing a desire to focus on his professional career in North America. Kiprusoff was named the starting goaltender for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and earned a shutout against the Czech Republic. He posted four wins and a tie, including a second shutout, and a 1.18 GAA to lead the upstart Finns into the championship game against Canada. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 30 saves, the Finns were defeated by Canada 3–2. Kiprusoff did not play his best game in the final, according to Finland Head Coach Raimo Summanen, though he expressed pride in his team's effort.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Puff's {{friendliness}} {{toward other}} characters varies. She sympathizes with the short-tempered Squidward Tentacles, and considers {{him to be}} the prime example of an outstandingly good driver. Patrick, who has attended Mrs. Puff's class multiple times, is treated with respect by her in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> slow-wittedness (Patrick is an expert driver and has passed every time he appears, usually re-appearing in the school after losing his license in some way). Of all the residents of Bikini Bottom, she is closest to SpongeBob. While she normally dreads having to drive with SpongeBob, she often acts as a motherly figure towards him.|$|E
5|$|Ten men {{received}} {{votes on}} the first vice-presidential ballot. Mississippi's John A. Quitman had the most support with 59 votes. Eight state delegations – {{with a total of}} 55 votes – voted for Breckinridge in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> refusal of the nomination, making him the second-highest vote getter. Kentucky cast its 12 votes for Boyd, bringing his third-place total to 33 votes. Seeing Breckinridge's strength on the first ballot, large numbers of delegates voted for him on the second ballot, {{and those who did not}} soon saw that his nomination was inevitable and changed their votes to make it unanimous.|$|E

5|$|The 2008–09 {{season was}} a {{frustrating}} one for Phaneuf, as he recorded a career-low 11 goals and 47 points, and his poor plus-minus rating of –11 led fans to question his defensive commitment. His poor season and high salary {{also led to}} speculation that Phaneuf might be traded. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> struggles, Phaneuf averaged 26 minutes and 31 seconds of ice time per game, the fourth highest in the League. He missed {{the final game of}} the Flames' 2009 Stanley Cup playoff Western Quarter-final series against the Chicago Blackhawks with broken ribs, after battling a hip injury during the regular season. Flames management defended Phaneuf, claiming that the injuries he battled affected his play.|$|E
5|$|The French colonial {{administration}} recognised tribal leaders; they {{arranged to}} have Houphouët go to school at the military post in Bonzi, not far from his village, in order to prepare for his future as a leader, despite strenuous objections from relatives, especially his great-aunt Yamousso. In 1915, he {{was transferred to the}} école primaire supérieure (secondary) at Bingerville in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family's reluctance to have him go to boarding school. The same year, at Bingerville, Houphouët converted to Christianity; he considered it a modern religion and an obstacle to the spread of Islam. He chose to be christened Félix.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{failed in}} <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> qualities and the {{widespread}} support he had gained, which brought him control {{of most of}} the empire. Lemerle holds that several factors played a role in his defeat: the Asian themes he did not subdue supplied reinforcements to Michael; Thomas's fleet performed badly; and the Bulgarian offensive diverted him away from the capital and weakened his army. But the most decisive obstacles were the impregnable walls of Constantinople, which ensured that an emperor who controlled Constantinople could only be overthrown from within the city.|$|E
