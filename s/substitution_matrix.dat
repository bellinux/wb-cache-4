5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a <b>substitution</b> <b>matrix</b> assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler <b>substitution</b> <b>matrix,</b> wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the <b>substitution</b> <b>matrix</b> may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the case of a local alignment.|$|E
5|$|Motif finding, {{also known}} as profile analysis, is a method of {{locating}} sequence motifs in global MSAs that is both a means of producing a better MSA and a means of producing a scoring matrix for use in searching other sequences for similar motifs. A variety of methods for isolating the motifs have been developed, but {{all are based on}} identifying short highly conserved patterns within the larger alignment and constructing a matrix similar to a <b>substitution</b> <b>matrix</b> that reflects the amino acid or nucleotide composition of each position in the putative motif. The alignment can then be refined using these matrices. In standard profile analysis, the matrix includes entries for each possible character as well as entries for gaps. Alternatively, statistical pattern-finding algorithms can identify motifs as a precursor to an MSA rather than as a derivation. In many cases when the query set contains {{only a small number of}} sequences or contains only highly related sequences, pseudocounts are added to normalize the distribution reflected in the scoring matrix. In particular, this corrects zero-probability entries in the matrix to values that are small but nonzero.|$|E

Thus, the improvement of <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> increases accuracy of homology searches. Generally, <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> are derived from aligned sequences whose relationships are known, and gap costs are determined by trial and error. To discriminate relationships more clearly, we are encouraged to optimize the <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> from statistical viewpoints using both positive and negative examples utilizing Bayesian decision theory.

40|$|Introduction <b>Substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> are {{commonly}} used in sequence alignment or homology searches. They are the essential component in the detection of structure, function and evolutionary relationships between protein sequences. <b>Substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> derived from structural superposition of homologous pairs of proteins provide the best performance, {{and it has been}} shown that amino acid substitutions are indeed constrained by the structural environment, each environment displaying a distinct substitution pattern. One of the most reliable and popular tool for sequence-structure homology recognition, FUGUE, is based on environment-dependent matrices [1]. The FUGUE <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> are deduced from a classification into 64 empirically selected 3 D environments.

25|$|Determine the <b>substitution</b> <b>matrix</b> {{and the gap}} penalty scheme. A <b>substitution</b> <b>matrix</b> assigns {{each pair}} of bases or amino acids a score for match or mismatch. Usually matches get {{positive}} scores, whereas mismatches get relatively lower scores. A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals. In addition, {{it is also a}} good practice to try different combinations of substitution matrices and gap penalties.|$|E
25|$|Different base substitutions or {{amino acid}} substitutions can have {{different}} scores. The <b>substitution</b> <b>matrix</b> of amino acids is usually {{more complicated than}} that of the bases. See PAM, BLOSUM.|$|E
25|$|Each PAM matrix has twenty {{rows and}} twenty columns — one {{representing}} {{each of the}} twenty amino acids translated by the genetic code. The value in each cell of a PAM matrix {{is related to the}} probability of a row amino acid before the mutation being aligned with a column amino acid afterwards. From this definition, PAM matrices are an example of a <b>substitution</b> <b>matrix.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{adequacy}} of <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> to model evolutionary relationships between amino acid sequences can be numerically evaluated by checking the mathematical property of triangle inequality for all triplets of residues. By converting substitution scores into distances, one can verify that a direct path between two amino acids is shorter than a path {{passing through a}} third amino acid in the amino acid space modeled by the matrix. If the triangle inequality is not verified, the intuition is that the evolutionary signal is not well modeled by the matrix, that the space is locally inconsistent and that the matrix construction was probably based on insufficient biological data. Previous analysis on several <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> revealed {{that the number of}} triplets violating the triangle inequality increases with sequence divergence. Here, we compare matrices which are dedicated to the alignment of highly divergent proteins. The triangle inequality is tested on several classical <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> as well as in a pair of “complementary ” <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> recording the evolutionary pressures inside and outside hydrophobic blocks in protein sequences. The analysis proves the crucial role of hydrophobic residues in <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> dedicated to the alignment of distantly related proteins...|$|R

50|$|Since protein {{sequences}} need {{to maintain}} a stable structure, a residue’s substitution probabilities are largely determined by the structural context of where it is found. As a result, <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> are trained for structural contexts. Since context information is encoded in transition probabilities between states, mixing mutation probabilities from <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> weighted for corresponding states achieves improved alignment qualities when compared to standard <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices.</b> CS-BLAST improves further upon this concept.

25|$|One {{motivation}} for local alignment is {{the difficulty of}} obtaining correct alignments in regions of low similarity between distantly related biological sequences, because mutations have added too much 'noise' over evolutionary time {{to allow for a}} meaningful comparison of those regions. Local alignment avoids such regions altogether and focuses on those with a positive score, i.e. those with an evolutionarily conserved signal of similarity. A prerequisite for local alignment is a negative expectation score. The expectation score is defined as the average score that the scoring system (<b>substitution</b> <b>matrix</b> and gap penalties) would yield for a random sequence.|$|E
25|$|The {{algorithm}} {{was first}} proposed by Temple F. Smith and Michael S. Waterman in 1981. Like the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm, {{of which it}} is a variation, Smith–Waterman is a dynamic programming algorithm. As such, it has the desirable property that it is guaranteed to find the optimal local alignment with respect to the scoring system being used (which includes the <b>substitution</b> <b>matrix</b> and the gap-scoring scheme). The main difference to the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is that negative scoring matrix cells are set to zero, which renders the (thus positively scoring) local alignments visible. Traceback procedure starts at the highest scoring matrix cell and proceeds until a cell with score zero is encountered, yielding the highest scoring local alignment. Because of its cubic computational complexity in time and quadratic complexity in space, it often cannot be practically applied to large-scale problems and is replaced in favor of less general but computationally more efficient alternatives such as (Gotoh, 1982), (Altschul and Erickson, 1986), and (Myers and Miller 1988).|$|E

40|$|Pairwise {{sequence}} alignment is used {{to compare}} the sequence of nucleotides or protein with the aims of inferring structural, functional and evolutionary relationships. The main reason of sequence alignment is to find an optimal alignment. The most used method in research and have been certify to produce an optimal sequence alignment are dynamic programming methods Smith-Waterman for local alignment. Based from the previous research, scoring schemes in dynamic programming can be improved by using <b>substitutions</b> <b>matrices</b> and introduction of gap in alignment with gap penalty function. The reasons are to optimize result of alignments with perpetuate biology concept like evolution changes in molecular structures caused by mutation. Today, no general theory guides the selection of <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> and gap penalties for local sequence alignment. Because of that, this project will implement dynamic programming method Smith-Waterman with different parameter of <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> and gap penalty function in scoring schemes. <b>Substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> that will be used are BLOSUM 45, BLOSUM 62 and BLOSUM 80.

Intensive comparison will be done to test the efficiency and determine the effective <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> and gap penalty parameter for sequence alignment. 27 sets of data protein sequences categorized by length and percentage similarity identity will be used for sequence alignment.

50|$|Many {{specialized}} <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> {{have been}} developed that describe the amino acid substitution rates in specific structural or sequence contexts, such as in transmembrane alpha helices, for combinations of secondary structure states and solvent accessibility states, or for local sequence-structure contexts. These context-specific <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> lead to generally improved alignment quality at some cost of speed but are not yet widely used. Recently, sequence context-specific amino acid similarities have been derived that do not need <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> but that rely on a library of sequence contexts instead. Using this idea, a context-specific extension of the popular BLAST program has been demonstrated to achieve a twofold sensitivity improvement for remotely related sequences over BLAST at similar speeds (CS-BLAST).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Pairwise {{sequence}} alignment is {{a central}} problem in bioinformatics, which forms the basis of various other applications. Two related sequences {{are expected to have}} a high alignment score, but relatedness is usually judged by statistical significance rather than by alignment score. Recently, it was shown that pairwise statistical significance gives promising results as an alternative to database statistical significance for getting individual significance estimates of pairwise alignment scores. The improvement was mainly attributed to making the statistical significance estimation process more sequence-specific and database-independent. In this paper, we use sequence-specific and position-specific <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> to derive the estimates of pairwise statistical significance, which is expected to use more sequence-specific information in estimating pairwise statistical significance. Experiments on a benchmark database with sequence-specific <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> at different levels of sequence-specific contribution were conducted, and results confirm that using sequence-specific <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> for estimating pairwise statistical significance is significantly better than using a standard matrix like BLOSUM 62, and than database statistical significance estimates reported by popular database search programs like BLAST, PSI-BLAST (without pretrained PSSMs), and SSEARCH on a benchmark database, but with pretrained PSSMs, PSI-BLAST results are significantly better.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{most common}} <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> {{currently}} used (BLOSUM and PAM) {{are based on}} protein sequences with average amino acid distributions, thus they do not represent a fully accurate substitution model for proteins characterized by a biased amino acid composition. This problem has been addressed recently by adjusting existing matrices, however, to date, no empirical approach has been taken to build matrices which offer a substitution model for comparing proteins sharing an amino acid compositional bias. Here, we present a novel procedure to construct series of symmetrical <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> to align proteins from similarly biased Plasmodium proteomes. Results We generated <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> by selecting from the BLOCKS database those multiple alignments with a compositional bias {{similar to that of}} P. falciparum and P. yoelii proteins. A novel 'fuzzy' clustering method was adopted to group sequences within these alignments, showing that this method retains more complete information on the amino acid substitutions when compared to hierarchical clustering. We assessed the performance against the BLOSUM 62 series and showed that the usage of our matrices results in an improvement in the performance of BLAST database searches, greatly reducing the number of false positive hits. We then demonstrated applications of the use of novel matrices to improve the annotation of homologs between the two Plasmodium species and to classify members of the P. falciparum RIFIN/STEVOR family. Conclusion We confirmed {{that in the case of}} compositionally biased proteins, standard BLOSUM matrices are not suited for optimal alignments, and specific <b>substitution</b> <b>matrices</b> are required. In addition, we showed that the usage of these matrices leads to a reduction of false positive hits, facilitating the automatic annotation process. </p...|$|R
