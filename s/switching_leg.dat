40|$|Practical {{switching}} devices have finite turn-on and turn-off times. Normally a blanking time is added between the turn-off and turn-on of switches {{to avoid a}} short circuit during switching. This blanking time results in a current dependent voltage error of the pulse width modulated output of a converter. Topologies based on only one active device in series with a freewheeling diode, like the opposed current converter, do not need blanking time, and the output voltage distortion is greatly improved but not absent. This paper focuses on the harmonic distortion due to nonideal components in the opposed current converter <b>switching</b> <b>leg</b> and compares different modulation strategies. It is shown that the opposed current converter <b>switching</b> <b>leg</b> can be linearized by proper selection of its components. Furthermore, by applying the right modulation strategy {{it is possible to}} achieve a double effective switching frequency, as with unipolar switching, while maintaining constant common mode voltage at the output, as for bipolar switching...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective is to}} determine the effectiveness of orthogonal variants of teaching 5 th- 7 th graders physical exercises. Materials and methods. The participants in the research were boys of the 5 th grade (n =  32), 6 th grade (n =  40), 7 th grade (n =  52). To achieve the tasks set, the research used the following methods: analysis of scientific and methodological literature; pedagogical testing, pedagogical observation, timing of educational tasks; pedagogical experiment, medical and biological research methods; methods of mathematical statistics, methods of mathematical experiment planning. In order to achieve the objective set, the research has studied the effect of different variants of the educational process structure, namely: the number of repetitions (х 1) and rest intervals (х 2) when learning the technique of performing physical exercises. The research has conducted a complete factor experiment of type 22. According to the experiment plan, the 5 th- 7 th graders were divided into training groups. In total, there were 12 experimental groups organized. Research results. The analysis of the regression equations shows that the teaching of physical exercises to the 5 th- 7 th-grade boys is mostly influenced by rest intervals between repetitions (х 2). The number of repetitions (х 1) has somewhat less influence. The interaction of these factors is insignificant when teaching physical exercises and becomes much more influential only when teaching a <b>switch</b> <b>leg</b> pull-over exercise (х 1 х 2). Conclusions. To increase the effectiveness of teaching 5 th- 7 th graders physical exercises, it is necessary to shorten rest intervals between repetition to 60 s and {{to reduce the number of}} repetitions to six.

50|$|Using a left lead leg on {{the bends}} allows the hurdler to run {{closer to the}} inside of the lane and cover a shorter distance. Additionally, if the left leg is used for the lead, then the athlete's upper body can be leaned to the left, making it easier to bring the trail leg through. Additionally, an athlete {{hurdling}} with a right leg lead around the bends must take care that they do not inadvertently trail their foot or toe around the hurdle rather than passing over the top, which would lead to a disqualification from the race. Depending on the height and strength of the athlete, men work toward a stride pattern of 13 to 15 steps between each hurdle, and women work toward a stride pattern of 15 to 17. This does not include the landing step from the previous hurdle. Weaker athletes will typically hold a longer step pattern throughout the race so that they do not bound or reach with each step, which also results in a loss of speed. These patterns are ideal because it allows the hurdler to take off from their predominant leg throughout the race without <b>switching</b> <b>legs.</b> However, fatigue from the race will knock athletes of their stride pattern and force runners to <b>switch</b> <b>legs.</b> At an early age, many coaches train their athletes to hurdle with both legs. This is a useful skill to learn since as a runner tires, their stride length may decrease, resulting in the need either to add a stutter stride, or to take a hurdle on the other leg.The 400 metre hurdles is a very physically demanding race. It requires intense training to get the endurance, speed and technique needed to compete.|$|R

40|$|Blanking time, also {{referred}} to as dead-time, is one of the dominant sources of output current and voltage distortion in pulse-width modulated power amplifiers. Extensive studies are known on elimination, minimization, and compensation of the effect. Most techniques achieve a reduction of the distortion but are not capable of completely removing it. Topologies like the opposed current converter do not require dead-time and therefore do not suffer from this nonlinear effect. In order to ensure continuous conduction mode, opposed current converters require bias current that normally flows through the output filter inductors. This paper presents an alternative approach where the bias current is supplied from additional current controlled <b>switching</b> <b>legs.</b> A modulation strategy is proposed and guidelines are given for the design of the inductive components. Finally the inductor volume of the proposed topology is compared to the opposed current converter equal showing that both topologies are comparable with respect to volume of the passive components...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new hysteresis current regulation {{strategy for the}} neutral point clamped and flying capacitor (FC) three-level inverters. The strategy uses the measured average of the <b>switched</b> phase <b>leg</b> output voltage to adjust the controller hysteresis band as the load back EMF varies to maintain a near constant phase <b>leg</b> <b>switching</b> frequency. The phase leg switchings are then fine tuned to a fixed frequency clock to further improve frequency regulation. Next, the zero-crossings of the measured phase leg average voltages are used to select between positive and negative switched output voltage levels, so that only one hysteresis current regulator {{is required for the}} full inverter switched output voltage range. For the FC inverter, a state machine is then added to select between redundant switching states to maintain balanced capacitor voltages. Finally, the controller is extended to a three-phase system by subtracting the common mode interacting current from the total phase leg current error before making any switching decision. The resulting controller achieves a line-to-line harmonic performance that is very close to open-loop phase disposition pulse width modulation, while retaining all of the dynamic benefits of hysteresis current regulation...|$|R
