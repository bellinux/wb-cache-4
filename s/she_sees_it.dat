5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. <b>She</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E

When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as an opportunity to file for divorce and continue her affair with Harry Pfarrer, a deputy U.S. Marshal. She copies her husband's financial records and other files, including the draft memoir, and gives them to her lawyer.|$|E
500|$|Cusack {{states that}} the Church [...] "must be accorded {{the status of a}} {{functional}} equivalent of religion, at the very least, if not 'authentic' religion". <b>She</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "arguably a legitimate path to liberation", citing its culture jamming and activism against commercialism. Kirby posits that the Church is a religion masquerading as a joke, rather than the reverse: in her view, it is a spiritual manifestation of a cultural shift toward irony. Alberts believes that there is broad agreement that the Church is fundamentally a different type of group than religions that date to antiquity; he prefers to use the term [...] "fake religion" [...] to describe the group. He sees it, along with Discordianism, as {{part of a group of}} [...] "popular movements that look and feel like religion, but whose apparent excess, irreverence and arbitrariness seem to mock religion". Knight characterizes the Church as [...] "at once a postmodern spoof of religion and a viable system in its own right".|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to what she has to say. Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look.|$|E

"It's {{a simple}} trick, but an {{effective}} one, and the associations it conjures – heaviness and lightness, earth and heaven, death and life – are thought-provoking and manifold [...] Whiteread's Monument, as light and gleaming as the plinth {{is dark and}} squat, {{is the only one}} of the four commissioned pieces to allude directly to the plinth's defining emptiness. <b>She</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> not as a space to be filled, but as an absence to be acknowledged, and she does it well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{initially}} operant {{behavior is}} emitted without an identified {{reference to a}} particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come {{under the control of}} stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced. Such stimuli are called [...] "discriminative stimuli." [...] A so-called [...] "three-term contingency" [...] is the result. That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment. Thus, a rat may be trained to press a lever only when a light comes on; a dog rushes to the kitchen when it hears the rattle of its food bag; a child reaches for candy when <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> on a table.|$|E
2500|$|Cheryl David (Cheryl Hines) – Cheryl is Larry's long-suffering wife (and later, ex-wife), {{who often}} expresses {{annoyance}} with his behavior, even in situations beyond his control. She often {{serves as a}} voice of reason for him and helps define the social guidelines {{that he may have}} overlooked. While her adventures never lead her far off from Larry, she has various activities outside day-to-day married life, including an acting stint, and, more sustainably, being an advocate of environmental issues, including becoming a member of and fundraiser for the NRDC. Her affection for Larry has been tested, even resulting in her leaving him for a time; upon learning that he had put together the Seinfeld reunion just {{to have a chance to}} get back with her, <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as a sign of their [...] "belong together" [...] but soon decides to file for divorce when Larry concentrates on a coffee stain incident rather than the fact that they are back together, refusing yet again to listen to her. They divorce in the season-eight premiere episode.|$|E

2500|$|Despite a mixed {{critical}} reception, a DVD {{edition of}} Armageddon {{was released by}} The Criterion Collection, a specialist film distributor of primarily arthouse films that markets what it considers to be [...] "important classic and contemporary films" [...] and [...] "cinema at its finest". In an essay supporting the selection of Armageddon, film scholar Jeanine Basinger, who taught Michael Bay at Wesleyan University, states that the film is [...] "a work of art by a cutting-edge artist who {{is a master of}} movement, light, color, and shape—and also of chaos, razzle-dazzle, and explosion". <b>She</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as a celebration of working men: [...] "This film makes these ordinary men noble, lifting their efforts up into an epic event." [...] Further, she states that in the first few moments of the film all the main characters are well established, saying, [...] "If that isn't screenwriting, I don't know what is". The film was also released by Touchstone Home Entertainment on standard edition Blu-ray disc in 2010 with only a few special features.|$|E
2500|$|Pakistani lawyer Sundas Hoorain {{has said}} that women in pre-Islamic Arabia had a much higher {{standing}} than they got with Islam. [...] She describes a free sex society in which {{both men and women}} could have multiple partners or could contract a monogamous relationship per their will. [...] She thus concludes that the Muslim idea of monogamy being a post-Islamic idea is flawed and biased and that women had the right to contract such a marriage before Islam. [...] She also describes a society in which succession was matrilineal and children were retained by the mother and lived with the mother's tribe, whereas in Shariah law, young children stay with their mother until they reach the age of puberty, and older children stay with their father. [...] Hoorain also cites problems with the idea of mass female infanticide and simultaneous widespread polygamy (multiple women for one man), as <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as an illogical paradox. [...] She questions how it was possible for men to have numerous women if so many females were being killed as infants.|$|E
2500|$|Julia Fish (born 1950) is an American {{artist whose}} {{paintings}} have a deceptive simplicity. She paints in oil on stretched rectangular canvases of varying size. By means of close observation of everyday subjectsleaves {{of a tree}} seen through a window, a section of floor tiles, an old fashioned light fixture she makes, as one critic says, [...] "quiet, abstract manifestations of observed realities." [...] She is a studio artist who paints not what she sees in an instant but rather what she observes continuously, day after day. The result, she says, {{is not so much}} temporal as durational. [...] Her paintings compress many instances of observation so as to become, as <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "a parallel system to a lived experience." [...] The paintings lack spacial orientation and, as a critic says, can [...] "be described as both highly realistic and abstract without compromising either term." [...] In 2008, Alan G. Artner, writing in the Chicago Tribune, said [...] "This is work of small refinements and adjustments. The world of everyday things generates it, but Fish's qualities of seeing and touch elevate the things to a plane on which they leave behind their humble character." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marking 200 {{years after}} this novel was published, Paula Byrne, {{author of a}} {{biography}} of Jane Austen, wrote a perspective on it, a novel she loves, while aware that Mansfield Park is not generally viewed as <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it.</b> The subtitle to Byrne's article was [...] "Ignore its uptight reputation – Mansfield Park, published 200 years ago this month, seethes with sex and explores England’s murkiest corners". The title of the novel and the family estate may well reflect Lord Mansfield, whose decision as Lord Chief Justice in a court case led {{to the end of}} slavery in Britain itself, and the name of Aunt Norris may be drawn from Robert Norris, the opposite of the judge, as Norris was [...] "an infamous slave trader and a byword for pro-slavery sympathies." [...] Sir Thomas Bertram's home, Mansfield Park, was [...] "a newly built property, a house erected on the proceeds of the British slave trade." [...] It is not an old structure like the one belonging to Rushworth, or the estate homes described in other of Austen's novels, like Pemberley in Pride and Prejudice or Domwell Abbey in Emma. Byrne finds this novel bold in its humour, containing [...] "Austen’s filthiest joke, when she makes a pun about sodomy in the Navy: “My home at my uncle’s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of Rears and Vices, I saw enough. Now, do not be suspecting me of a pun, I entreat.”" [...] She posits that the heroine Fanny Price is [...] "the filter through which we view the mesmerising Crawfords", the Londoners who bring their lively, seductive ways to the countryside. She finds this novel to be [...] "pioneering because it is a novel about meritocracy." [...] The novel is an exploration of the role of parents in raising their children and forming their moral characters, as shown by Sir Thomas in his changing view of his niece: he first feels that she is not on the same level as his daughters, but at the end, he acknowledges her advantages in starting from hardship in her parents' home, recognizing his failings in guiding his own daughters. [...] "At the centre of the book is a displaced child with an unshakeable conscience. A true heroine." ...|$|E
