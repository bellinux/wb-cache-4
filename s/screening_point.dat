40|$|In {{this paper}} we will examine {{passenger}} actions and {{activities at the}} security screening points of Australian domestic and international airports. Our findings and analysis provide a more complete understanding of the current airport passenger security screening experience. Data in this paper is comprised of field studies conducted at two Australian airports, one domestic and one international. Video data was collected by cameras situated {{either side of the}} security <b>screening</b> <b>point.</b> A total of one hundred and ninety-six passengers were observed. Two methods of analysis are used. First, the activities of passengers are coded and analysed to reveal the common activities at domestic and international security regimes and between quiet and busy periods. Second, observation of passenger activities is used to reveal uncommon aspects. The results show that passengers do more at security screening that being passively scanned. Passengers queue, unpack the required items from their bags and from their pockets, walk through the metal-detector, re-pack and occasionally return to be re-screened. For each of these activities, passengers must understand the procedures at the security <b>screening</b> <b>point</b> and must co-ordinate various actions and objects in time and space. Through this coordination passengers are active participants in making the security checkpoint function – they are co-producers of the security screening process...|$|E

Previous {{studies have shown that}} if an electron beam from the stellar surface is accelerated to energies high enough to create electron-positron pairs, the required electric field parallel to the magnetic field lines is too strong to be screened out by the produced pairs. We argue here that if non-relativistic protons are supplied from the magnetosphere to flow towards the stellar surface, they can provide an anode to screen out such a strong electric field.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the optimal cut-off points of the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS), to screen for and diagnose Internet addiction among adolescents in the community by using the well- established diagnostic criteria of Internet addiction. This survey of 454 adolescents used screening (57 / 58) and diagnostic (63 / 64) cut-off points of the CIAS, a self-reported instrument, based on the results of systematic diagnostic interviews by psychiatrists. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve revealed that CIAS has good diagnostic accuracy (89. 6 %).

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} container shipping transportation {{viewed as}} an interdependent security system. The methodological background {{is the use of}} game-theory in the investigation of how interdependence affects individual choices about security expenditures in so-called interdependent systems (IDS problems). Any agent's incentive to adopt security measures depends on the actions of others because of the negative externalities created among them. In this context, we examine security questions in container transportation and more specifically we focus on investments in container checking systems at ports, considering the currently much debated 100 % scanning requirement of containers destined to USA. It is obvious, that in such analysis there is a demand to balance the cost of investing in (installing) and operating such a system and the reduction in the risk of a potential damage from a ""dangerous"" container from a security point of view. A transferred ""dangerous container"", which may pass through another agent / port (<b>screening</b> <b>point),</b> introduces an additional dimension of risk. Useful suggestions are reached from such a treatment of the subject and policy dimensions emerge, such as the potential need for coordinating mechanisms among ports. © 2010 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between the curriculum-based measurement Maze task and the Standardized Test for the Assessment of Reading (STAR-R) and California Standards Test (CST) scores. Participants included 1, 479 sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students across three public middle schools in an urban school district in southern California. The results indicated a significant correlation between Maze scores in the winter and in the spring, but failed to find a significant correlation between fall Maze screening scores and CST standard scores. Similarly, the second inquiry examined the magnitude of the relationship between STAR-R scores and the scores on the CST. This analysis revealed that STAR-R standard scores are significantly correlated to CST standard scores at all three <b>screening</b> <b>points.</b> Additional analysis showed significant differences in the above relationships between grade levels with a general trend of increased correlation values from Grade 6 to Grade 8 for the majority of <b>screening</b> <b>points.</b> Lastly, a diagnostic accuracy analysis and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed low to moderate levels of reliability and sensitivity for both measures in predicting CST scaled score classification...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSome {{automatic}} {{methods have}} been proposed to identify keratoconus from corneal maps; among these methods, neural networks {{have proved to be}} useful. However, the identification of the early cases of this ocular disease remains a problem from both a diagnostic and a <b>screening</b> <b>point</b> of view. Another problem is whether a keratoconus screening must be performed taking into account both eyes of the same subject or each eye separately; hitherto, neural networks have only been used in the second alternative. In order to examine the differences of the two screening alternatives in terms of discriminative capability, several combinations of the number of input, hidden and output nodes and of learning rates have been examined in this study. The best results have been achieved by using as input the parameters of both eyes of the same subject and as output the three categories of clinical classification (normal, keratoconus, other alterations) for each subject, a low number of neurons in the hidden layer (lower than 10) and a learning rate of 0. 1. In this case a global sensitivity of 94. 1 % (with a keratoconus sensitivity of 100 %) in the test set as well as a global specificity of 97. 6 % (98. 6 % for keratoconus alone) have been reached...|$|E
40|$|Dirk de Korte, 1 Jan H Marcelis 2 1 Department of Product and Process Development, Sanquin Blood Bank, Amsterdam, 2 Department of Microbiology, St Elisabeth Hospital, Tilburg, the Netherlands Abstract: The {{introduction}} {{of a combination of}} interventions during collection of whole-blood or platelet concentrates has been successful in lowering the degree of bacterial contamination in the final product, the platelet concentrate, by 50 %– 75 %. These interventions were improved donor questionnaires, best-practice skin disinfection, and diversion of first blood volume. These interventions have reduced the number of bacteria present in the platelet concentrates. In combination with screening for bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates with a culture method, the degree of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection has been reduced significantly. Due to the very low initial bacteria counts upon collection of the products, the need for improved sensitivity of early screenings tests or highly selective point-of-issue tests remains. The latter should be rapid and easy to perform. An alternative approach might be the implementation of pathogen-inactivation methods for cellular blood products {{to reduce the amount of}} pathogens. However, these methods are costly, and so far not proved to be cost-effective, especially in countries with an already-low incidence of transfusion-transmitted infections by viruses, parasites, or bacteria.

40|$|AIMS—To {{assess the}} {{reliability}} of the hand held automated refractor Retinomax in measuring astigmatism in non-cycloplegic conditions. To assess the accuracy of Retinomax in diagnosing abnormal astigmatism in non-cycloplegic refractive screening of children between 9  and 36  months.  METHODS—Among 1205  children undergoing a non-cycloplegic refractive screening with Retinomax, 299  (25 %) had repeated non-cycloplegic measurements, 302  (25 %) were refracted under cycloplegia using the same refractor, and 88  (7 %) using retinoscopy or an automated on table refractor. The reproducibility of non-cycloplegic cylinder measurement was assessed by comparing the cylindrical power and axis values in the 299  repeated measurements without cycloplegia. The influence of the quick mode on cylinder measurement was analysed by comparing the cylinder and axis value in 93  repeated measurements without cycloplegia where normal mode was used in one measurement and quick mode in the other. Predictive values of the refractive screening were calculated for three different thresholds of manifest astigmatism (⩾ 1. 5, ⩾ 1. 75, and ⩾ 2 D) considering as a true positive case an astigmatism ⩾ 2 D under cycloplegic condition (measured by retinoscopy, on table, or hand held refractor).  RESULTS—The 95 % limits of agreement between two repeated manifest cylinder measurements with Retinomax attained levels slightly less than plus or minus 1  D.  The 95 % limits of agreement for the axis were plus or minus 46 °. The comparison of non-cycloplegic measurements in the quick and normal mode showed no significant difference and 95 % limits of agreement plus or minus 0. 75  D.  The mean difference between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic cylinder values measured by Retinomax reached 0. 17  D and was statistically significant. Manifest thresholds of ⩾ 1. 5 D, ⩾ 1. 75 D, ⩾ 2 D cylinder value diagnosed 2  D of astigmatism under cycloplegia respectively with 71 - 84 %, 59 - 80 %, 51 - 54 % of sensitivity (right eye-left eye) and 90 - 92 %, 95 %, 98 % of specificity.  CONCLUSION—Without cycloplegia, Retinomax is able to measure cylinder power with the same reproducibility as cycloplegic retinoscopy. No significant difference was found in the cylinder values obtained with the quick and the normal modes. Therefore, the quick mode of measurement is recommended as it is more feasible in children. No difference, which is significant from a <b>screening</b> <b>point</b> of view, exists between the non-cycloplegic and the cycloplegic cylinder value (< 0. 25 D). Retinomax diagnoses abnormal astigmatism (⩾ 2 D) in a non-cycloplegic refractive screening at preschool ages with 51 - 84 % sensitivity rates and 98 - 90 % specificity rates, depending on the chosen threshold of manifest astigmatism. If 2  D of manifest astigmatism is chosen as a positive test, the positive predictive value of the screening reaches 81 - 84 % and the negative predictive value 91 - 90 % (right eye-left eye).    Keywords: non-cycloplegic refractive screening; astigmatism; hand held infrared automated refractor; Retinoma...|$|E
