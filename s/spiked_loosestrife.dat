50|$|Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) is a {{flowering}} plant {{belonging to the}} family Lythraceae. It {{should not be confused}} with other plants sharing the name loosestrife that are members of the family Primulaceae. Other names include <b>spiked</b> <b>loosestrife,</b> or purple lythrum.|$|E
40|$|Description: Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) is an {{emergent}} {{aquatic plant}} that usually grows on moist or saturated soils. A mature, well established plant often grows up to 10 {{feet tall and}} 5 feet wide. Each plant can contain 30 - 50 herbaceous stems that arise from a common rootstock. The purple-magenta colored, five to six petalled flowers grow on long <b>spikes.</b> Purple <b>loosestrife</b> seed production depends on plant age, size and vigor. A 4 - 5 year old plant with 30 stems can reportedly produce an estimated 2, 700, 000 seeds. Seed maintains viability of over 80 percent for at least 3 years. Impacts: Purple loosestrife is native to Eurasia and was first discovered in the Puget Sound region in 1929. Impacts on native vegetation have been dramatic. It is a vigorous competitor and can crowd other vegetation including native species. In {{a short period of}} time it will completely dominate a site. When purple loosestrife invades irrigation systems, economic losses to agriculture can exceed $ 2. 6 million annually. Control Options: Thurston County’s Integrated Pest Management emphasizes cultural, biological, and manual control methods to keep pests and vegetation problems low enough to prevent damage. The goal of Thurston County’s pesticide use policy is to minimize the use of pesticides by utilizing and providing information about the most effective control options that are available and practical. ► Cultural / Habitat Purple Loosestrife is now a quarantined species (a plant that is forbidden to be sold or transported) in Washington State. However, it was once sold and intentionally planted as a landscape and garden ornamental. It is still introduced occasionally as a component in wildflower seed mixtures. Review the ingredients of wildflower mixes to prevent accidental introduction, and avoid using those with unidentified seed components entirely. To prevent plants from spreading from known infestations, carefully clean vehicles and boats, boots, clothing, and pets after visiting infested areas. (Lythrum salicaria L) ► Manual / Mechanical Cutting, mowing or digging purple loosestrife is only partly effective. These methods can prevent seed production, but plants will likely re-sprout. Using this technique may also be difficult due the issue of access to the site in aquatic and wetland areas. Flowers should be carefully clipped and double bagged to prevent spreading seeds to new areas...|$|R
