5|$|This film is {{important}} for being the debut of Marguerite Snow, who {{would become one of}} the most important actresses for the company. In an interview by Johnson Briscoe, Snow said that her career as an actress was an accidental one. A girl friend of hers suggested <b>she</b> <b>come</b> to the studio to see how motion pictures are made. There at the studio, Edwin Thanhouser asked her if she wanted to be in the film. Snow accepted and she took part in the production until the director asked them to go outside to shoot another scene. Snow then protested about going outside in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home. A week later she received a phone call and ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage. Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company, The Baseball Bug.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, a {{previously}} unknown crypt was discovered when a tourist on a self-guided tour through the cemetery {{fell through the}} ground into {{what appeared to be}} a stairway leading to a crypt. The stairway had been covered with a piece of slate which eventually gave way due to advanced age. (The tourist was not hurt, nor did <b>she</b> <b>come</b> into contact with any human remains.) The crypt is reported to be 8 by 12 feet and is structurally intact. It is possibly the resting place of Jonathan Armitage, a Boston selectman from 1732 to 1733. Officials from the City of Boston announced in May, 2011 a $300,000 refurbishment project designed to repair and restore the historic site, including widening paths in the cemetery and providing new observation sites. $125,000 will be provided by the Freedom Trail Foundation and the city will pay the rest.|$|E
25|$|In November 1856 Jung Bahadur Rana {{sent the}} Governor-General of India a letter {{which he had}} intercepted from Duleep Singh to Jind Kaur, {{suggesting}} that <b>she</b> <b>come</b> to England. The letter was dismissed as a forgery. However, shortly afterwards Duleep Singh commissioned Pundit Nehemiah Goreh to visit Kathmandu on his behalf {{and find out how}} his mother was managing. This attempt was also doomed to failure and the Pundit was forbidden to contact the Maharani. Duleep Singh then decided to go himself, using the pretext of a tiger shoot in Bengal. In 1860 he wrote to the British Resident in Kathmandu, enclosing his letter in one from Sir John Login so {{that it would not be}} intercepted or dismissed as a forgery. The Resident reported that the Rani had 'much changed, was blind and had lost much of the energy which formerly characterised her.' The British decided that she was no longer a threat and on 16 January 1861 she was permitted to join her son at Spence's Hotel, in Calcutta. At the time several Sikh regiments were returning home via Calcutta at the end of the Chinese war. The presence of Sikh royalty in the city gave rise to demonstrations of joy and loyalty. The hotel was surrounded by thousands of armed Sikhs and the Governor-General, Lord Canning, requested Duleep Singh, as a favour, to leave for England with his mother by the next boat.|$|E

500|$|Lemmie Quinn, foreman of {{the metal}} room, testified that he spoke briefly with Frank {{in his office at}} 12:20. Frank had not {{mentioned}} Quinn when the police first interviewed him about his whereabouts at noontime on April 26. Frank had said at the coroner's inquest that Quinn arrived less than ten minutes after Phagan had left his office, and during the murder trial said Quinn arrived hardly five minutes after Phagan left. According to Conley and several experts called by the defense, it would have taken at least thirty minutes to murder Phagan, take the body to the basement, return to the office, and write the murder notes. By the defense's calculations, Frank's time was fully accounted for from 11:30a.m. to 1:30p.m., except for eighteen minutes between 12:02 and 12:20. Hattie Hall, a stenographer, said at trial that Frank had specifically requested that <b>she</b> <b>come</b> in that Saturday and that Frank had been working in his office from 11:00 to nearly noon. The prosecution labeled Quinn's testimony as [...] "a fraud" [...] and reminded the jury that early in the police investigation Frank had not mentioned Quinn.|$|E

Rome inspired her to begin writing the unfinished novel Valerius, the Reanimated Roman, where the eponymous hero resists the decay of Rome and the machinations of [...] "superstitious" [...] Catholicism. The writing of her novel was broken off when her son William died of malaria. Shelley bitterly commented that <b>she</b> <b>come</b> to Italy to improve her husband's health, and instead the Italian climate had just killed her two children, leading her to write: [...] "May you my dear Marianne never {{know what it is}} to lose two only and lovely children in one year-to watch their dying moments-and then at last to be left childless and forever miserable". To deal with her grief, Shelley wrote the novella The Fields of Fancy, which became Matilda dealing with a young woman whose beauty inspired incestuous love in her father, who ultimately commits suicide to stop himself from acting on his passion for his daughter, while she spends the rest of her life full of despair about [...] "the unnatural love I had inspired". The novella offered a feminist critique of a patriarchal society as Matilda is punished in the afterlife though she did nothing to encourage her father's feelings.|$|E

Brandishing a copy of The Gulag Archipelago, Davidson remarks that its author, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, did not need to use Google to search for the book's subtitle. The professor then asks Isabelle what thumbs used to be for before smartphones, making a punning reference to the French children's story Hop-o'-My-Thumb. He then proceeds to deliver an impromptu lecture on the ideas of Jacques Ellul, such as the abdication of individual rights and responsibilities to the state, a situation that Ellul declared to be the triumph of Adolf Hitler. Abruptly a car drives up, a man gets out and, speaking in German, he accosts Josette, who has been standing nearby.

2500|$|On 3April 1937, Puyi's younger {{full brother}} Prince Pujie was proclaimed heir {{apparent}} after marrying Lady Hiro Saga, a distant cousin to the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. The marriage had been politically arranged by Shigeru Honjō, a {{general of the}} Kwantung Army. Puyi thereafter would not speak candidly {{in front of his}} brother and refused to eat any food provided by Lady Hiro Saga, believing that she was out to poison him. Puyi was forced to sign an agreement that if he himself had a male heir, the child would be sent to Japan to be raised by the Japanese. Puyi initially thought that Lady Saga was a Japanese spy, but came to trust her after the Sinophile Saga discarded her kimono dresses for cheongsam dresses and she repeatedly assured him that <b>she</b> <b>come</b> to the Salt Tax Palace because she was Pujie's wife, not because she was a spy.
