5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
25|$|Arizona State did score {{one more}} {{touchdown}} {{later in the}} fourth quarter, making the score its final 35–23. In a game which Rudy Carpenter was sacked 9 times, it <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> fitting that the last {{play of the game}} was a sack as time ran out.|$|E

25|$|India {{ended the}} day with 252 on the board {{for the loss of}} 4 wickets. Laxman had scored a masterful hundred, an unbeaten 109 and giving him company was the woefully out of form Dravid on 7. India were still {{trailing}} by 20 and while Laxman may have given India some joy, it <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> {{a matter of time before}} the inevitable happened.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the delays}} and {{setbacks}} Jackson returned with conclusive photographic {{evidence of the}} various western landmarks that had previously <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> a fantastic myth: the Grand Tetons, Old Faithful {{and the rest of}} the Yellowstone region, Colorado's Rockies and the Mount of the Holy Cross, and the uncooperative Ute Indians. Jackson's photographs of Yellowstone helped convince the U.S. Congress to make it the first national park in March 1872.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} {{partnership between}} Hawke and his Treasurer, Paul Keating, proved essential to Labor's success in government. The two men proved {{a study in}} contrasts: Hawke was a Rhodes Scholar; Keating left high school early. Hawke's enthusiasms were cigars, horse racing and all forms of sport; Keating preferred classical architecture, Mahler symphonies and collecting British Regency and French Empire antiques. Hawke was consensus-driven; Keating revelled in aggressive debate. Hawke was a lapsed Protestant; Keating was a practising Catholic. These differences, however, <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> to increase {{the effectiveness of their}} partnership, as they oversaw sweeping economic and social changes throughout Australia.|$|E

25|$|In 1903 and 1904, Hearne {{seemed to}} recover his skill, {{supporting}} a formidable Middlesex batting side {{to give them}} their first official County Championship in the former year, and heading the averages in 1904 with several outstanding performances on difficult wickets. In 1905 he still bowled well, but 1906 was an absolute disaster and it <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> {{a matter of time}} before Hearne was dropped. This opinion was barely dimmed by some great performances in late 1907 – recalling the vicious spin of the 1890s Hearne – and one superb performance against Yorkshire in 1908. By 1909, apart from a mechanical accuracy of length, there seemed nothing at all in Hearne's bowling.|$|E
25|$|Pietersen began 2009 with {{questions}} over his form, where many pundits viewed {{him to be}} in a slump. He was dismissed first ball in the first Test against the touring West Indies side dismissed by the full, swinging ball (a delivery which he seemed to struggle against), but in the second Test made a quick 49 before falling to an attacking shot. He then suffered what <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> a minor right Achilles injury and was subsequently ruled out of the ODI series, which England also won. In June 2009, Pietersen played in England's World Twenty20 warm-up match against Scotland, registering an unbeaten 53 in a six-wicket England victory. He also appeared in the news after accidentally hitting a 15-year-old school boy with a cricket ball from a straight-drive after the boy had bowled to him. Pietersen left the boy, from Suffolk, with a signed bat as compensation.|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of Padilla, Bishop Acuña lost {{popularity}} in favour of María Pacheco, Padilla's widow.

500|$|By October, Republicans {{shifted to}} a new issue: the tariff. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a [...] "tariff for revenue only", Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock {{presidency}} would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said [...] "the tariff question is a local question". [...] The answer <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> to reinforce the Republicans' characterization of him as ignorant of the issues. In the end, fewer than two thousand votes separated the two candidates, but in the Electoral College, Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155.|$|E
500|$|Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation both {{praised the}} story, with Famitsu saying it [...] "vividly portrays {{the fact that}} this is a deep, intense Final Fantasy experience, {{something}} beyond just a side story". Gaming website PlayStation LifeStyle's Heath Hindman was impressed by the darker presentation, calling it [...] "powerful and well done throughout", and was impressed with the characters despite some awkward introductory scenes. Erren Van Duine, writing for RPG Site, said that fans would appreciate the scale of the narrative, and praised the handling of the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. She did note that some plot points <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> included for the sake of convenience, and that the ending forced a second playthrough to see the whole story.|$|E
500|$|As an actress, {{she entered}} Broadway {{as a star}} on sheer talent and little training... she sang abroad for two summers, fully expecting that the next step would be the Metropolitan Opera. In {{politics}} after five months {{of working with the}} [...] Women's Division, it <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> natural that she head the state's organization and serve as Democratic National Committeewoman. Restless after three years in those positions, she saw the possibility of becoming a member of Congress as a logical next step. Only four years later, she felt ready to run for the Senate. But her lack of political experience and her inflexible stands on political issues, along with gender questions, eroded the support of the Democratic Party in 1950. What in fact may have hurt her the most is that for which she is most remembered—her idealism.|$|E

500|$|After the match, {{figures from}} each team were {{critical}} of the other team's play. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith criticised Brugge for their approach, saying [...] "It was a pathetic attitude. You never win anything like that." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley also criticised the Belgian team's tactics: [...] "It takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and Bruges only seemed {{to be concerned with}} keeping the score down. Bruges didn't come at us much – apart from one mistake in our defence, they never looked like scoring. But they were well organised at the back and {{it was a case of}} breaking them down. We controlled the game from start to finish." [...] Meanwhile, Club Brugge manager Ernst Happel was {{critical of the}} quality of the Liverpool team: [...] "Liverpool <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> a shadow of the side we played in the UEFA Cup final two seasons ago. I was disappointed with them, but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players." ...|$|E
500|$|Bassist Frank Zincavage met Iyall at the SF Art Institute; the two {{hit it off}} and {{discussed}} putting a band together. They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later, drawing inspiration from the [...] "burgeoning local punk and post-punk scenes". Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing {{with him in the}} Mommers and Poppers. [...] " [...] <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [...] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar." [...] Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine's Day in 1979. According to Iyall, the name Romeo Void referred to [...] "a lack of romance" [...] and came to mind after they saw a local magazine with the headline [...] "Why single women can't get laid in San Francisco." [...] The band practiced in Iyall's flat in Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. [...] "Even though I was going to the [...] so much, I also had criticisms: Everyone was leaning against the wall wearing black," [...] Iyall said. [...] "I guess we were considered new wave, but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors. [...] I was proud of being American Indian, so I purposely never bleached my hair blond." ...|$|E
500|$|On 26 July 1986, Hezbollah {{freed the}} American hostage Father Lawrence Jenco, {{former head of}} Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon. Following this, William Casey, head of the CIA, {{requested}} that the United States authorize sending a shipment of small missile parts to Iranian military forces {{as a way of}} expressing gratitude. Casey also justified this request by stating that the contact in the Iranian government might otherwise lose face or be executed, and hostages might be killed. Reagan authorized the shipment to ensure that those potential events would not occur. North used this release to persuade Reagan to switch over to a [...] "sequential" [...] policy of freeing the hostages one by one, instead of the [...] "all or nothing" [...] policy that the Americans had pursued until then. By this point, the Americans had grown tired of Ghobanifar who had proven himself a dishonest intermediary who played off both sides to his own commercial advantage. In August 1986, the Americans had established a new contact in the Iranian government, Ali Hashemi Bahramani, the nephew of Rafsanjani and an officer in the Revolutionary Guard. The fact that the Revolutionary Guard was deeply involved in international terrorism <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> to attract the Americans more to Bahramani, who was seen as someone with the influence to change Iran's policies. Richard Secord, an American arms dealer who was being used as a contract with Iran wrote to North: [...] "My judgement is that we have opened up a new and probably better channel into Iran". North was so impressed with Bahramani that he arranged for him to secretly visit Washington D.C and gave him a guided tour at midnight of the White House.|$|E

2500|$|By 1880 {{many were}} {{beginning}} to feel that katharevousa had outlived its usefulness, indeed {{that it might be}} distracting the nation from its real destiny. [...] In retrospect it <b>seemed</b> <b>only</b> natural that the fragile young state of 1830 should have clung to the Ancient Greek written tradition as a symbol of its national identity; but now, many were looking for the true soul of Greece in the actual language spoken by the people, and in the oral traditions and folk-songs of the country, rather than in the Ancient Greek glories of the far past.|$|E
