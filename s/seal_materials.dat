40|$|Surface {{sealings}} can be deformed {{by large}} irregular {{settlement of the}} waste. As a result cracks can occur, which influence the effectiveness and functionality of the sealing. So the self-repairing of mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> {{is an important factor}} when building a mineral surface sealing. Self-repairing means, that cracks will be closed by small soil-particles of mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> transported into the cracks by the water in the drainage-layer. An indispensable characteristic of construction is the geotextile directly below the mineral sealing-layer. The soil-particles will be kept back on the geotextile and the cracks can be closed. Different mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>materials</b> have been investigated respecting the self-repairing capacity, which is mainly dependent on the water balance, the mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> and the deformations. When there are large deformations a mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> with low plasticity is suitable, when there are smaller deformations, a mixed-grained mineral <b>sealing</b> <b>material</b> with fine-grained additives like Bentokies is suitable, because the self-repairing can be supported by swelling. By giving donation-material on the sealing-layer the self-repairing capacity can be improved. A comparison of a required permeability according to technical instructions with the permeability of a fissured mineral sealing after self-repairing shows, that the cracks in a self-repairing mineral surface sealing can be closed so that the permeability usually falls below the required permeability.

These plastics were first screened in four simulant mixed wastes. The liner materials were screened using specific gravity measurements and <b>seal</b> <b>materials</b> by vapor transport rate (VTR) measurements. For the screening of liner materials, Kel-F, HDPE, and XLPE were found to offer the greatest resistance to the combination of radiation and chemicals.

Regarding the evaluation criteria 'permeation rate and retention period' and {{the interdependence of}} the pollutants in the solute the diffusion processes are of complex nature. This presented research work deals with diffusion processes for different pollutants and retention abilities of many <b>sealing</b> <b>materials</b> considering real conditions in a landfill. In addition new <b>sealing</b> <b>materials</b> consisting of mixed-grained soils (gravel-sand-silt-mixture with Zeolithe and Bentonite as additives) were developed. The diffusion tests performed considering real conditions required more than 800 days. Test data were analysed by self developed numerical models (Code IDENT). Depending on the initial concentration, the diffusive permeation rate of one pollutant is influenced by impact of other pollutants dissolved in the same solution. The permeation rate of the investigated heavy metals Zn, Cd, Pd and Cu were clearly decreased. In consideration of real conditions in landfills, the retention of <b>sealing</b> <b>materials</b> is controlled by diffusion processes and can be acquired just by diffusion tests. Sorption determined by batch tests or shaking tests is not eligible to describe physical-chemical processes and quantity of really retarded pollutants by <b>sealing</b> <b>materials.</b> The retention can be fit best by comparison of the permeation rates {{in and out of}} the specimen.
