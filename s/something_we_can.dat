In other words, our works {{are a result of}} our salvation and the future judgement will show that. Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of good works than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual.|$|E
25|$|The Alexandrian {{contribution}} to Christian mysticism centers on Origen and Clement of Alexandria. Clement {{was an early}} Christian humanist who argued that reason {{is the most important}} aspect of human existence and that gnosis (not <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> attain by ourselves, but the gift of Christ) helps us find the spiritual realities that are hidden behind the natural world and within the scriptures. Given the importance of reason, Clement stresses apatheia as a reasonable ordering of our passions in order to live within God's love, which is seen as a form of truth. Origen, who had a lasting influence on Eastern Christian thought, further develops the idea that the spiritual realities can be found through allegorical readings of the scriptures (along the lines of Jewish aggadah tradition), but he focuses his attention on the Cross and on the importance of imitating Christ through the Cross, especially through spiritual combat and asceticism. Origen stresses the importance of combining intellect and virtue (theoria and praxis) in our spiritual exercises, drawing on the image of Moses and Aaron leading the Israelites through the wilderness, and he describes our union with God as the marriage of our souls with Christ the Logos, using the wedding imagery from the Song of Songs. Alexandrian mysticism developed alongside Hermeticism and Neoplatonism and therefore share some of the same ideas, images, etc. in spite of their differences.|$|E

The statue depicts Orr sprawled in mid-flight after scoring the goal. The unveiling {{was attended by}} many of Orr's past teammates. Orr spoke at the unveiling: [...] "This specific moment and time we celebrate with this statue is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all now nostalgically remember with fondness, together, each time we enter Boston Garden.

500|$|Playwright Horton Foote {{reportedly}} considered {{giving up}} on film writing, due to what he regarded as a poor adaption of his 1952 play The Chase into a 1966 film of the same name. Following what Foote saw as a far more successful adaption of his 1968 play Tomorrow in 1972, his interest in filmmaking was rekindled, {{under the condition that}} he maintain some degree of control over the final product. Foote said of this stage in his career, [...] "I learned that film really should be like theatre in the sense that in theatre, the writer is, of course, very dominant... If we don't like <b>something,</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> speak our minds.... It is always a collaborative effort.... But in Hollywood it wasn't so. A writer there has in his contract that you are a writer for hire, which means that you write a script, then it belongs to them." [...] This renewed interest in cinema prompted Foote to write Tender Mercies, his first work written specifically for the screen. In the view of biographer George Terry Barr, the script reflected [...] "Foote's determination to battle a Hollywood system that generally refuses to make such personal films." ...|$|E
500|$|Production of Spirited Away {{commenced}} in 2000 on {{a budget}} of ¥1.9 billion ($15 million). Disney invested 10% of the cost for the {{right of first refusal}} for American distribution. As with Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of 'stealing the show'. Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right. The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production started, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the [...] "eye-candy" [...] in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a [...] "pretty girl." [...] At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked [...] "dull" [...] and thought, [...] "She isn't cute. Isn't there <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do?" [...] As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel [...] "she will be a charming woman." ...|$|E

[...] Gilbert suggested an opera based on a theatrical company, which Sullivan rejected (though a version of it would be resurrected in 1896 as The Grand Duke), but he accepted an idea [...] "connected with Venice and Venetian life, and this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music.

[...] He also praised the performance of Tiffani Thiessen and the premise of the show. Bob Sassone of AOL TV commended the characters and the lead actors, including Bomer, DeKay, Garson, and guest star Diahann Carroll. His only complaint was the casting of Tiffani Thiessen, claiming that Elizabeth appeared too young to be married to Tim DeKay's character. Bryan Jones heavily praised the premiere, notably the [...] "stellar acting and strong characters." [...] However, he felt that Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen) had better chemistry with Neal than with her husband. Overall, he said, [...] " [...] us <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> watch and enjoy week after week."

2500|$|I Do Bidoo Bidoo {{is a dream}} {{project of}} Unitel Productions' big boss, Tony Gloria who is also behind {{successful}} movies like Working Girls and Crying Ladies. He also revealed that the film has been developed and finished for 5 years. The idea came up when he saw Mamma Mia! on the broadway more than 10 years ago. When Gloria noticed that the songs of APO were revived by various bands and became hits anew, he felt their songs would be great for a movie as it spans many generations, so he talked to APO member, Jim Paredes and signed them up to a contract. The contract expired two times before the project has been finalized. According to him, {{he knows that the}} Filipino audience is ready for this kind of musical extravaganza on the big screen, especially when the music comes very close {{to the heart of the}} Filipino just like the songs of Jim Paredes, Boboy Garovillo and Danny Javier who are collectively known as the Apo Hiking Society. Mr. Gloria, whose vision is shared, nurtured and upheld by Unitel’s new President Ms. Madonna Tarrayo, added, “I wanted to give back <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be proud of - for the Filipino, by the Filipino.” The film is written and directed by the award-winning Chris Martinez who ably used APO Hiking music to move the story forward and punctuate pivotal scenes with the same. He is the mind behind successful comedy films like Kimmy Dora and [...] "Ang Babae sa Septic Tank". The APO songs in the movie was rearranged by award-winning composer and musical director Vincent de Jesus. De Jesus was the musical director of hit movies Crying Ladies, La Visa Loca, Ang Babae Sa Septic Tank, Kimmy Dora and theater musicals Zsa Zsa Zaturnnah Ze Muzikal, Himala and Care Divas.|$|E
