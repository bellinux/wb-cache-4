We identify several clear periods in sunspot, 10 Be, and 14 C data as 1000, 500, 350, 200 and 100 years. We found that the periods of the first five spherical harmonics of the slow magnetic Rossby mode {{in the presence of}} a <b>steady</b> toroidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> of 1200 - 1300 G in the lower tachocline are in perfect agreement with the time scales of observed variations. The <b>steady</b> toroidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> can be generated in the lower tachocline either due to the <b>steady</b> dynamo <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> for low <b>magnetic</b> diffusivity or due to the action of the latitudinal differential rotation on the weak poloidal primordial <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> which penetrates from the radiative interior. The slow magnetic Rossby waves lead to variations of the <b>steady</b> toroidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the lower tachocline, which modulate the dynamo <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and consequently the solar cycle strength. This result constitutes a key point for long-term prediction of the cycle strength. According to our model, the next deep minimum in solar activity is expected during the first half of this century.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} the unsteady species transport for the growth of alloyed semiconductor crystals during the vertical Bridgman-Stockbarger process with a <b>steady</b> axial <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> During growth of alloyed semiconductors such as germanium-silicon (GeSi) and mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe), the solute’s concentration is not small, so that density differences in the melt are very large. These compositional variations drive compositionally driven buoyant convection, or solutal convection, in addition to thermally driven buoyant convection. These buoyant convections drive convective transport, which produces nonuniformities in the concentration in both the melt and the crystal. This transient model predicts the distribution of species in the entire crystal grown in a <b>steady</b> axial <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The present study presents results of concentration in the crystal and in the melt at several different stages during crystal growth...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{propose a}} {{magnetic}} compound fluid (MCF) {{as a new}} smart fluid. This fluid includes nm size magnetite and mm size iron particles in a solvent.

Moreover, the magnitude of the shear stress to the shear rate under <b>steady</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> can be larger than MRF by varying the compound rate of the MF and MRF. This report shows an experimental application of microscopic polishing with the MCF. We examined the surface roughness of flat titanium material to the attached rotating plate with 15 rpm under magnetic field. By comparing the roughness between the MCF and the MR, the polished plate is more uniformly over the plate with the MCF than the MR. Further the roughness of Ry and Ra are larger under fluctuating magnetic field than <b>steady</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The more effective polishing can be explained with the cluster model of particles...|$|E

The general field equations and boundary conditions are linearized and the equations of motion for an infinitely long circular rod are obtained for the particular electromagnetic field configurations considered. The torsional motion of a solid rod in a <b>steady</b> axial <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> with and without a steady electric field is considered. In the first case {{it is found that}} a pure torsional mode will not propagate. In the second case a pure torsional mode will propagate and its frequency equation is obtained.

The torsional motion of a hollow rod in a <b>steady</b> tangential <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> with and without a steady axial electric field is considered. Without the electric field the equations are completely uncoupled and the solution is the standard elastic one.

An important point is that, at the equilibrium state, the distribution of electric potential is essentially asymmetrical. To avoid the high voltage plasma oscillations the found equilibrium is used as the initial condition for further calculations with finite <b>steady</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The calculations show that the distribution of the electric field in the plasma duct remains asymmetrical.
