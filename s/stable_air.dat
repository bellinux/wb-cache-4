5|$|As {{it moved}} northward, Jeanne {{continued}} to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7inches (175mm) in southern Georgia. A cold front {{across the region}} caused the depression to accelerate northeastward, combining moisture from the Gulf of Mexico with cool and <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> over the Carolinas. This combination produced severe thunderstorms across the region, spawning six tornadoes in Georgia, eight in South Carolina, and eight in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of June23, Andres {{weakened}} to a tropical storm due to increasing wind shear, decreasing sea surface temperatures as it entered a more <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> mass. The system began to rapidly degenerate, as convection became dislocated from {{the center and the}} overall structure of Andres degraded. By 1200UTC on June24, the storm weakened into a tropical depression while situated roughly 100mi (155km) west of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Shortly after, the depression sharply turned north and degenerated into a trough of low pressure, no longer a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on August27 {{and reached the}} eastern Pacific on September7. Tracking westward, little development occurred until September18, when associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase. Following visible satellite trends, the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September19, while located about 1,200mi (1930km) west-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. In an environment of cool ocean temperatures and <b>stable</b> <b>air,</b> the depression failed to organize as it turned west-northwest. Associated deep convection dissipated, leading to degeneration into a remnant low by 0000UTC on September20. Performing a slow counter-clockwise loop, the remnant low dissipated five days later.|$|E

5|$|As Debbie {{approached}} the northern Gulf Coast, {{it failed to}} intensify, despite warm sea surface temperatures, abundant moisture, and an anticyclone aloft. In addition, the storm never developed good outflow, partially due to <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> related to Tropical Storm Hazel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. After maintaining peak winds for about 12hours, Debbie weakened due to cooler, drier air, deteriorating to a tropical depression on September29. That day, it turned to the northwest, passing {{just east of the}} Mississippi Delta. On September30, the circulation of Debbie dissipated just offshore Mississippi. Its remnants made landfall, accelerated northeastward, and were eventually absorbed by an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Located {{south of}} a mid-level ridge and the {{continuing}} gap wind event, the nascent depression moved slowly west-southwest on October20. Initial environmental conditions were modestly favorable, allowing for steady intensification. The depression achieved tropical storm status by 00:00UTC on October21; the National Hurricane Center (NHC) assigned it the name Patricia accordingly. Throughout much of October21, Patricia moved through a region of drier, more <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> and over relatively cool sea surface temperatures. Both of these factors served to delay intensification of the cyclone. The system unraveled substantially, with banding features dissipating and the low-level circulation becoming poorly defined. Once clear of the hindering factors, convection blossomed over Patricia late on October21 and a central dense overcast formed over the center. Simultaneously, the storm accelerated west-northwest.|$|E
5|$|On May24, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. The wave entered the eastern Pacific around June6 and shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase shortly thereafter. A broad {{area of low pressure}} formed {{a few hundred}} miles south of Acapulco, Mexico two days later. Following satellite evidence of a well-defined circulation and organized convective activity, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the disturbance to {{a tropical}} depression at 1200UTC on June11. After attaining winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1004mb (hPa; 29.65inHg), the depression began to traverse cooler waters and much more <b>stable</b> <b>air.</b> This caused all associated convection to fade away, and the depression degenerated to a non-convective remnant low at 0000UTC on June13. The remnant low continued northwest until dissipation by 0600UTC on June15.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa between late August16 and early August17. On August 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first noted the tropical wave as a potential area for development, associated with an area of disorganized convection about 300mi (480km) southwest of Cabo Verde. Environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for continued organization. Dry and <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> was an initial inhibiting factor in development, with deep convection waning on August20 and August21. However, the convection and circulation had become better defined by August21. By August23, the system had developed an elongated and poorly-defined circulation, as indicated by the Hurricane Hunters, though convention continued to expand. On the next day, the low pressure area crossed Guadeloupe into the Caribbean Sea while producing gale-force winds. By this point, the NHC noted that the system could develop into a tropical depression at any time, as the system was only lacking a well-defined circulation.|$|E
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{period of}} rapid deepening began early on September30 as a well-defined eye became clearly visible on satellite imagery. Ophelia intensified into a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h) by 0600UTC {{and became the}} season's third major hurricane—a Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale—twelve hours later. Cloud tops continued to cool in the system's eyewall late on October1, with cloud tops {{in the eye of}} the system warming. Ophelia intensified into a Category4 hurricane at 0000UTC on October2 and simultaneously attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 940mb (hPa; 27.76inHg) as it passed east of Bermuda. Weakening ensued the following day as the hurricane entered cooler sea surface temperatures and an environment characterized by significantly more <b>stable</b> <b>air.</b> Ophelia weakened below major hurricane intensity by 1800UTC and became a tropical storm for the final time by 0600UTC on October3. The system lost its tropical characteristics and was subsequently declared an extratropical cyclone four hours later while positioned just southwest of Newfoundland. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger weather system by the afternoon hours of the following day.|$|E
5|$|By August16, {{the forward}} motion of Ana began to increase, and the storm quickly entered {{a region of}} dry, <b>stable</b> <b>air.</b> By the afternoon, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission {{did not find any}} evidence of tropical storm-force winds, resulting in Ana being downgraded to a tropical depression. It was determined in post-storm analysis, that Ana had degenerated into a tropical wave shortly afterwards, and was no longer a tropical cyclone. Several hours later, the system redeveloped convection as it raced towards the west-northwest at 26mph (42km/h). Early on August17, radar imagery from Guadeloupe and San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a system without a closed, low-level circulation. Despite this, the NHC continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery. Later that day, a final reconnaissance plane flew into the storm and did not find a low-level circulation. Following this, the NHC stated that Ana had dissipated off the coast of Puerto Rico, despite having already degenerated into a tropical wave the previous day. The remnants of Ana were once more monitored for signs of regeneration, but land interaction with Hispaniola and Cuba spoiled the system's chances of redevelopment.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Cosme caused {{flooding}} {{along the}} Pacific coast of Mexico in June2013. The third named tropical cyclone of the 2013 Pacific hurricane season, the storm system formed from a tropical wave south of Manzanillo, Colima, on June23. The cyclone intensified into {{a tropical storm}} on June24, and soon after strengthened into a hurricane on June25. Early the following day, Cosme attained its peak intensity as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg). However, Cosme then began to encounter <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> and lower sea surface temperatures, causing the system to weaken to a tropical storm late on June26. The system continued to weaken and degenerated into a remnant low pressure surface trough about 690mi (1,110km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on June27. The remnants persisted until dissipating well east-southeast of the Hawaiian Islands on July1.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} Alvin can be {{attributed}} to a tropical wave that crossed Dakar, Africa on May9. The wave remained poorly organized as it moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea through mid-May. On May20, the disturbance crossed Central America and emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean, where convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—gradually began to increase over the well-defined center; this {{led to the formation of}} a tropical depression by 0000UTC on May27, approximately 345mi (555km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. Following designation, the depression was slow to organize as a result of moderate easterly shear; by 0000UTC on May29, however, the system had gained enough organization to be considered a tropical storm. After attaining its peak intensity with winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1003mb (hPa; 29.62inHg), increasingly <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> and higher wind shear caused Alvin to begin a weakening trend. At 0600UTC on May30, it weakened to a tropical depression, and by 0000UTC on June1, Alvin degenerated into a non-convective remnant low. The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation six days later.|$|E
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E

5|$|Later on June18, {{forecast}} models {{indicated that}} the system might rapidly degenerate prior to landfall. However, the NHC continued to forecast that the depression would attain tropical storm-status before landfall. Shortly after, the depression became increasingly disorganized as convection separated {{from the center of}} circulation due to increasing wind shear. <b>Stable</b> <b>air</b> ahead of the system inhibited the possibility of rapid development as warm waters supported intensification. By the morning of June19, the center of circulation was situated along the southern edge of deep convection, indicating that the depression was beginning to degenerate. Despite this, the NHC continued to anticipate intensification prior to landfall. Embedded within an easterly flow ahead of a mid-level trough, the storm turned towards the north-northeast and accelerated slightly. At 11:00am PDT (1800UTC), the depression reached its peak intensity with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1003mbar (hPa; 29.62inHg). Operationally, the depression was considered to be slightly stronger, having a minimum pressure of 1001mbar (hPa; 29.56inHg). Later that day, the depression began to degenerate into an open trough as it was situated underneath cirrus clouds instead of cumulonimbus clouds. Visible satellite imagery showed that the depression became increasingly ill-defined and the NHC estimated that the depression degenerated into a trough of low pressure near the Islas Marías during the afternoon of June19. The remnants of the depression were monitored by the United States Naval Research Laboratory for several more hours until the system moved inland over Sinaloa.|$|E

25|$|Storms {{developed}} across Louisiana and Mississippi {{during the}} morning and noon periods moving into Alabama with additional storms developing {{as far north as}} central and eastern Kentucky where a tornado watch was issued stretching down towards eastern Louisiana and later into Georgia. Multiple strong tornadoes affected Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama that evening, including an EF3 that severely damaged the town of Caledonia, Mississippi. More <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> farther east reduced the severe weather potential. Wintry weather including snow, sleet and freezing rain on the northern side of the storm was reported from Wisconsin to Maine on January 10–11. Overall, this outbreak killed four people and injured at least 62 others.|$|E
25|$|Haiyan, {{with its}} core {{disrupted}} by {{interaction with the}} Philippines, emerged over the South China Sea late on November 8. Environmental conditions ahead of the storm soon became less favorable, as cool <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> began wrapping into {{the western side of}} the circulation. Continuing across the South China Sea, Haiyan turned more northwesterly late on November 9 and through November 10 as it moved around the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge previously steering it westward. Rapid weakening ensued as Haiyan approached its final landfall in Vietnam, ultimately striking the country near Haiphong around 2100 UTC as a severe tropical storm. Once onshore, the storm quickly diminished and was last noted as it dissipated over Guangxi Province, China, on November 11.|$|E
25|$|Fog {{begins to}} form when water vapor {{condenses}} into tiny liquid water droplets {{suspended in the}} air.
