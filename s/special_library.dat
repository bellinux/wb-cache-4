The cost of constructing the new theatre, replacing their costumes and scenery lost in the fire and competitive pressure from the rival Duke's Company contributed to its decline. Eventually, in 1682, the King's Company merged with the Duke's. The 1674 Theatre Royal building contained a warren of rooms, including storage space and dressing rooms used by the management and performers, nearly seventy people in total, as well as some fifty technical staff members. Additionally three rooms were provided for scripts, including a library for their storage, a separate room for copying actors' parts and a <b>special</b> <b>library</b> for the theatre's account books, ledger books and music scores. This jumble of rooms often made communication among various departments difficult, a problem that Garrick corrected during his tenure as manager.

5000|$|<b>Special</b> <b>libraries</b> {{often have}} a more {{specific}} clientele than libraries in traditional educational or public settings, and deal with more specialized kinds of information.

Those that are open to the public may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection. Many <b>special</b> <b>libraries</b> are not open to the general public, though access may be requested for specialized research by request. <b>Special</b> <b>libraries</b> are also sometimes known as information centers. Some authors differentiate <b>special</b> <b>libraries</b> from information centers by defining the latter as having [...] "a very narrow scope." [...] They are generally staffed by librarians, although many librarians employed in <b>special</b> <b>libraries</b> are specialists in the library's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library. However, it is not uncommon for librarians at <b>special</b> <b>libraries</b> to have both a library science degree as well as a degree or experience of some type in the field their library specializes in as opposed to either only library science or field specific experience.|$|R
