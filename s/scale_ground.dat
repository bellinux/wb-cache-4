5|$|The Army is {{organised}} into three main elements which {{report to the}} Chief of Army; the Headquarters of the 1st Division, Special Operations Command and Forces Command. Headquarters 1st Division is responsible for high-level training activities and is capable of being deployed to command large <b>scale</b> <b>ground</b> operations. It {{does not have any}} combat units permanently assigned to it, though it commands units during training activities and the Land Combat Readiness Centre reports to the divisional headquarters. Most of the Army's units report to Forces Command, which is responsible for overseeing their readiness and preparing them for operations. This organisation came into effect during January 2011; before this time the Army's three regular brigades were permanently assigned to the Headquarters 1st Division.|$|E

50|$|The <b>scaled</b> <b>ground</b> cuckoo {{is a large}} ground-dwelling {{bird with}} sturdy legs and a long tail. It has a brown head, greenish-brown crest and a curved beak. The upper parts are dark brown, the tail blackish and the underparts pale tan. It has been claimed that it easily can be {{separated}} from the rufous-vented ground cuckoo by the lack of a dark chest band, but the variation in this feature in Amazonian rufous-vented ground cuckoos makes the features questionable. As a consequence, recent authorities commonly treat the <b>scaled</b> <b>ground</b> cuckoo as a subspecies of the rufous-vented ground cuckoo.|$|R

50|$|The rufous-vented ground cuckoo (Neomorphus geoffroyi) {{is a large}} {{terrestrial}} {{species of}} cuckoo in the family Cuculidae. It is found in humid primary forests from southern Nicaragua, through Costa Rica and Panama, into north-western Colombia. Another population occurs in the western and southern Amazon Basin of south-eastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northern Bolivia and Brazil, while a final population occurs in the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil. Much confusion exists over the exact limits of its distribution in the south-central Amazon, where the very similar <b>scaled</b> <b>ground</b> cuckoo occurs (the breast-markings typically used to separate the scaled and the rufous-vented ground cuckoos are known to vary clinally). Consequently, the <b>scaled</b> <b>ground</b> cuckoo has often been considered a subspecies of the rufous-vented ground cuckoo.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>scaled</b> <b>ground</b> cuckoo is a shy, secretive {{bird and}} is seldom seen. Its call is not known, but like other ground cuckoos, it {{sometimes}} resorts to bill-clicking. It is rare but probably under-recorded. Single birds or pairs move around together and it often follows the trails of army ants, [...] peccaries and primates.|$|R
30|$|To remedy this {{deficiency}} in the procedure, Vamvatsikos (2002) proposed the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) method.

The method is usually very complex and time consuming because of the complex nature of strong ground motions.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>scaled</b> <b>ground</b> cuckoo is {{uncommon}} and {{its range}} is fragmented. Its global population {{has not been}} estimated but its numbers {{are likely to be}} in decline.

50|$|North Vietnamese {{pressure}} against CIDG outposts at Dak Seang and Dak Sek, 20 and 45 kilometers {{north of}} Đắk Tô respectively, was {{the impetus for}} dispatching the 42nd ARVN Infantry Regiment into the area while the ARVN Airborne battalion moved to Dak Seang. On 4 August, the 1st of the 42nd encountered the North Vietnamese on a hilltop west of Dak Seang, setting off a three-day battle that drew in the South Vietnamese paratroopers. The 8th Airborne, along with U.S. Army advisers, was airlifted into a small unimproved air field next to the Special Forces camp at Dak Seang. The camp was under sporadic fire and probing ground attack by PAVN forces. This occurred when its Special Forces commander and a patrol failed to return and the camp received {{what appeared to be}} preparatory fire for a full <b>scale</b> <b>ground</b> attack by PAVN. The terrain was high mountains with triple canopy jungle. The importance of the Dak Seang camp was that it lay astride the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the main infiltration route of the PAVN into the South.|$|E

Combined with a multi-tier master-slave processor hierarchy employing dynamic task generation and self-scheduling we achieve a flexible and efficient parallel algorithm with excellent scalability...|$|R
40|$|Fenwei basin, China, {{composed}} by several sub-basins, has been suffering severe geo-hazards in last 60 years, including large scale land subsidence and small <b>scale</b> <b>ground</b> fissure, which caused serious infrastructure damages and property losses.
