40|$|Snake {{populations in}} the North American tallgrass prairie appear to be declining, yet data {{unavailability}} impedes the development of enhanced ecological understanding of snake species-habitat relationships and also hinders snake conservation efforts. This study addresses both issues for the snakes of Illinois in two steps. 	 In a two-year mark-recapture study at twenty-two sites within six northern Illinois prairie preserves, I investigated snake species-habitat relationships using habitat variables at three scales: microhabitat (10 km). A total of 120 snakes representing seven species was captured using drift fence arrays associated with funnel traps and <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>cover.</b> The low numbers and diversity of snakes captured, when compared to historic evidence, indicate that Illinois snake populations have declined. At the microhabitat scale, non-metric multidimensional scaling and Mantel tests revealed a relationship between snake species composition and elevation. At the landscape-scale, snake species composition varied along an agricultural-urban cover gradient. Classification and regression trees and maximum entropy models (Maxent) were used to identify the scales at which snake species-habitat relationships were strongest. Six of seven regression trees for individual snakes species contained habitat variables at the landscape scale. Important landscape characteristics included patch size, isolation, and land cover, metrics that strongly covary with habitat loss. Microhabitat features only appeared in the regression trees of two species and in three Maxent models. This study indicates that habitat loss has shaped the current distribution of snake species in Illinois's remnant prairies and that snake conservation efforts should emphasize the landscape-scale. Finally, I developed a risk ranking system based on natural and life history characteristics to assess the conservation status of Illinois's 38 snake species. Cluster analysis identified eight groups of snakes, similar in terms of risk factors, with high risk species sharing characteristics such as large body size, long life span, limited habitat breadth, and a high anthropogenic threat ranking. Here, I emphasize the need for basic demographic studies on snakes and suggest that ranking systems be used with population data (when available) and expert opinion to identify snake species of conservation concern in other regions.

40|$|Production {{technology}} for hybrid-lightweight-structures with aluminum foam core - Sub-project within the Cluster of Excellence MERGE MERGE {{is the one}} and only Federal Cluster of Excellence in the field of research and development of innovative key-technologies for lightweight structures in Germany. The main objective of the Cluster “Merge Technologies for Multifunctional Lightweight Structures” is to create lightweight and material-efficient components by merging currently separated production processes of different material groups. One focused topic is the development of lightweight-sandwich-composites made of metal foam and fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP). Because of their low density, high energy absorption capability, stiffness and strength and very good damping behavior metal foams are excellently suitable for lightweight structures. The combination of <b>metal</b> foam with <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>covers</b> as sandwich structure is already used in manifold applications. In order to enhance the level of lightweight construction in metal sandwich structures, the substitution of <b>metal</b> <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> with fiber-plastic composites provides an effective approach. By adapting the thickness of core and FRP layers in combination with high performance fibers and load specific design customized structural properties are possible to be to be realized. One key aspect is the bonding of both components. To find an optimal combination many experiments have been carried out to investigate the influence of various parameters, e. g. the modification of the metal foam surface and thermoplastics or the use of adhesive-agents. The permanent bonding of the sandwich components is realized in a pressing process. Therefore, the sandwich components need to be preheated. To increase the energy efficiency, a technology will be developed using the process heat of the foaming instead of additional preheating. For achieving a high functional density, the injection molding processes can be used to implement thermoplastic elements, e. g. stiffening rips or mounting interfaces, into these sandwich structures based upon metal foam cores...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the {{previous}} decades much {{attention has been}} given on an accurate material description, especially for simulations at the design stage of new models in the automotive industry. Improvements lead to shorter design times and a better tailored use of material. It also contributed to the design and optimization of new materials. The current description of plastic material behaviour in simulation models of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming is <b>covered</b> by a hardening curve and a yield surface. In this paper the focus will be on modelling of work hardening for advanced high strength steels considering the requirements of present applications. Nowadays work hardening models need to include the effect of hard phases in a soft matrix and the effect of strain rate and temperature on work hardening. Most material tests to characterize work hardening are only applicable to low strains whereas many practical applications require hardening data at relatively high strains. Therefore, physically based hardening descriptions are needed allowing reliable extensions to high strain values...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: APOLLONSOLAR’s New Industrial Cell Encapsulation (NICE) {{technology}} for the manufacturing of PV modules uses a ribbon of poly-isobutylene (PIB) {{around the perimeter of}} the module in order to seal the inside of the module from the outside atmosphere and provide environmental protection of the cells and interconnectors. The PIB sealing assures a very efficient and long term air/humidity tightness, allowing the establishment of an under pressure inside the module that is used to establish the electrical contact between solar cell busbars and interconnecting wires by pressure, thus avoiding the soldering of these contacts. High module fill factors and low series resistances have been regularly obtained with this type of electrical series connection by under pressure. In order to assure a module lifetime of at least 30 years it is therefore important to avoid degradation of the PIB sealing and associated losses of the under pressure inside the module. Although the gas and humidity tightness of NICE modules has been indirectly demonstrated by the positive degradation test results according to the IEC standard 61215, this work presents a method to directly measure gas leakage rates of the PIB sealing in contact with the materials typically found in NICE modules: Glass, <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> and <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>covered</b> with an organic electrical insulation coating. With a newly designed experimental set up the long term gas and humidity tightness of different sealing materials was evaluated by monitoring the under pressure in the closed volume of the experimental set up, under different conditions: room temperature, temperature cycles between- 40 °C and + 85 °C, elevated temperatures of + 85 °C at 85 % relative humidity and over an extended time cycle. The obtained results are very encouraging in that no under pressure loss occurred for two out of three tested sealing materials...|$|R

40|$|When {{this project}} started the experts of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming just began to discuss about the {{avoidance}} and reduction of lubrication. There were no papers or reports about this theme {{which could be}} used. As supplier in the automotive industry the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming companies are loaded with high costs. Since 1986 they couldn't enforce a price increase for their products, {{in the last years}} they even had to do a price reduction. On the other hand increased the costs for payment, material and energy. The survive of the companies and the places of employment is only possible when the processes in the companies will be permanent improved and rationalized. The production in a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming company uses every year until 10. 000 l of lubricant. It is necessary to buy, to transport and to storage the lubricants. More over the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> must be <b>covered</b> with the lubricants and the products, the machines and the area around the machines must be cleaned. At last the used lubricants must be disposed. Because of this reasons the use of lubricants entails high costs. So it was the target of the project to avoid or to reduce the use of lubricants. In co-operation with two <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming companies seven forming dies were chosen for experiments in the production. At first the conditions were registrated for this processes, that means the machine, the material, the lubricant, the amount of lubricant, the tool life time and the criterion for the die wear. After that the dies were covered with PVD hard coatings and several experiments were started to avoid or reduce the use of lubricants but at least with the same productivity. Before coating each part was forced to be lubricated with a different oil. In the first step after coating it was possible to use only one lubricant in each company. Additional it was possible in some cases to substitute a conventional drawing oil through a high-performance coolant in a concentration of 15 %. Beside the lubricant economization of 82 % there were other advantages: reduced washing and drying processes, avoidance of carrying drawing oil in the coolant of the following cutting processes and lower lubricant costs. Additional positive effects of the tool coating were increase of working speed, increase of tool life time, decrease of tool maintenance costs and increase of tool availability. It was not possible to realize the avoidance of lubricants but a considerable reduction of the use of lubricants were achieved. It is possible to transfer this results in other <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming companies. (orig.)
