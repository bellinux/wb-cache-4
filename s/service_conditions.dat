Birdwood wished to appoint two British generals to command the new divisions, but Senator Pearce opposed this, ordering that one be given to McCay. On 22 March 1916, McCay arrived back in Egypt to assume command of the 5th Division. He found that General Headquarters, Egyptian Expeditionary Force had ordered II Anzac Corps, of which the 5th Division was a part, to replace I Anzac Corps in the defence of the Suez Canal. Owing to a shortage of rolling stock, the 4th and 5th Divisions were ordered to undertake a three-day route march across the desert under <b>service</b> <b>conditions,</b> carrying their packs and weapons. This proved to be a greater test of staff and troops than anticipated, and many men dropped from thirst or exhaustion. Many of his men blamed McCay for subjecting them to such a humiliating and severe trial.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to compare Soil Conservation Service and Forest Service methods for determining range condition, to develop a method for determining range condition using plant frequency data and to develop range condition guides using Sorensen's coefficient of similarity. The final objective was to compare condition scores based on frequency data to Soil Conservation Service and Forest <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores. Loamy upland and sandy loam upland range sites in the Empire Valley and Santa Rita Experimental Range of southeastern Arizona were sampled. Three prominent soil series of upland range sites within the study area were selected for study. Within each soil series, areas of apparent high, medium and low levels of past and present livestock use were sampled at three locations. Soil profile descriptions were made for each of the 27 sample areas and soil characteristics were used to confirm soil series sampled. Plant communities were sampled by weight estimates, Parker 3 -step transects and 40 x 40 cm frequency plots. Forest Service and Soil Conservation <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores did not correlate well within the loamy upland or sandy loam upland range sites. Condition scores by both methods, especially for Forest Service data, are confounded with site potential. Cluster and factor analysis procedures identified plant groups associated with soil series, range site and sample location. Range condition was not identified as a criterion of plant group association. Sorensen's coefficient of similarity scores for frequency data based on a specific "high condition" reference area had a high coefficient of determination value when correlated with Soil Conservation <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores for loamy upland range sites. Forest <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores had a very low coefficient of determination value for the same comparison. Soil Conservation Service and Forest <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores compared to similarity scores for frequency data for the sandy loam upland range site had positive but low coefficient of determination. Sorensen's coefficient of similarity, using frequency data as an index of condition, can be used to develop a range site condition guide for a homogeneous range site...|$|R

25|$|Large {{number of}} Indian troops had begun {{arriving}} in Malayan peninsula and Singapore by 1941, {{as a part}} of defensive preparations for possible war with Japan. It was estimated that were some 37 000 Indian troops stationed in these areas, making up roughly about the 40 percent of the total military strength of the British forces. The British-Indian troops swelled from 200 000 to 900 000 between 1939 and 1941. However, these deployments were beset with a number of problems. The troops were too thinly, with insufficient resources and supplies in the Malay Peninsula and Singapore. Further, {{a large proportion of the}} British-Indian troops were very young recruits (as a result of the open recruitment policy of the British) who had very little or no combat training and experience, leading to anxiety amongst the British-Indian forces. Feelings of discrimination amongst British Indian soldiers, compared to the pay and <b>service</b> <b>conditions</b> for European soldiers crreated acrimony. Indiscriminate recruitment by the Indina government in order to maintain the numbers for its army, meant that it was no longer carefully curating its selection for the armed forces. By 1941, British abuse, both verbal and physical of the Indian soldiers was rampant.|$|E
25|$|Initially, R relied {{primarily}} on trained intelligence {{officers who were}} recruited directly. These belonged to the external wing of the Intelligence Bureau. In times of great expansion, many candidates {{were taken from the}} military, police and the Indian Revenue Service. Later, R began directly recruiting graduates from universities. However owing to allegations of nepotism in appointments, in 1983 R created its own service cadre, the Research and Analysis Service (RAS) to absorb talent from other Group A Civil Services, under the Central Staffing Scheme. Direct recruitment at Class I executive level is from Civil services officers undergoing Foundation course at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. At the end of the course, R conducts a campus interview. Based on a selection of psychological tests and the interview, candidates are inducted into R for a lien period of one year. During this period, they have an option of rejoining their parent service (if they wish to) after which they can be permanently absorbed into the Research and Analysis Service. Delhi-based security think tank Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses noted in one of its reports that R suffered from the 'tail-end syndrome' where the 'bottom of the entrance lists' of those qualifying the UPSC examinations were offered jobs. Additionally, recruitment is also by lateral deputation from the Officer corps of Armed Forces or Group A Civil Service Officers. The Civil and Defence Service Officers permanently resign their cadre and join the RAS. However, according to recent reports, officers can return to their parent cadre after serving a specific period in the agency if they wish to. Most of the secretaries have been officers from the IPS and other posts are held by IRS and IFS officers. R also employs a number of linguists and other experts in various fields. The <b>service</b> <b>conditions</b> of R officers are governed by the Research and Analysis Wing (Recruitment, Cadre and Service) Rules, 1975.|$|E

500|$|Other {{issues facing}} the RAN during Dowling's term as CNS were its relegation—since the {{beginning}} of the 1950s—to third place behind the other armed forces in terms of Federal budget allocations, its replacement by the RAAF as the country's first line of defence, and a shortage of manpower. Dowling himself considered [...] "separation from families, lack of houses, over employment, high wages and overtime payment in civvie street" [...] as the causes for the Navy's inability to attract and retain personnel; the Allison Report in 1958 resulted in various improvements to <b>service</b> <b>conditions,</b> which helped reduce wastage. The RANC had moved to Flinders Naval Depot in 1930, and Dowling was pleased to be able to oversee its return to Jervis Bay in 1958, the year before he relocated the office of the CNS to Canberra.|$|E
500|$|Once in France, the {{division}} joined XI Corps and {{was placed in}} reserve, relieving the 46th (North Midland) Division. The first casualties were soon suffered due to training accidents with grenades. The division was then temporarily split up and spent time attached to the Guards Division and 19th (Western) Division, to gain experience in trench warfare. It relieved the 19th (Western) Division and until the summer manned the front in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. It was rotated along the XI Corps sector, and spent time in Festubert, Givenchy, La Gorgue, Laventie and Neuve Chapelle. Units of {{the division}} took turns on the front line, maintained positions, conducted trench raids and were subjected to German bombardments, all of which allowed the men to gain experience of active <b>service</b> <b>conditions.</b> During this period Captain Goronwy Owen of the 15th RWF carried out a trench raid into no man's land, where he located a party of German soldiers who had just finished laying barbed wire.

500|$|After the deployment, {{the issues}} of {{appropriate}} <b>service</b> <b>conditions,</b> awards and recognition took many years to resolve. After serving the required 90-day period, contingent members were entitled to the Australian Service Medal (ASM) for non-warlike service. About 12 years after their return to Australia, the government changed {{the status of the}} operation; contingent members were eligible for the Returned from Active Service Badge, and their ASMs were upgraded to the Australian Active Service Medal (AASM). After the 2002 decision Major Nigel Catchlove wrote to the Army newspaper, calling it a [...] "pointless upgrade" [...] and saying it [...] "detracts from the award of the AASM to those who truly deserve it". In his letter, Catchlove compared the UNTAG operation to two subsequent operations: the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment deployment to Somalia during Operation Solace and the deployment of service personnel as part of the International Force for East Timor: [...] "both of those operations involved robust rules of engagement appropriate to the intervention of forces in UN-sanctioned, US or Australian-led multi-national coalitions. UNTAG by way of contrast was a classic peacekeeping operation led by the UN in a relatively benign environment where rules of engagement were focused only on force protection". Catchlove questioned the [...] "half-hearted approach to implementing this appalling decision" [...] in which eligible people must apply for the upgrade, saying this [...] "failed the test of commonsense".|$|E

2500|$|Enlisted {{personnel}} {{felt that}} their concerns about <b>service</b> <b>conditions</b> were not being considered by the navy. Following requests and demands for a formal channel through which sailors could express their grievances, the British Admiralty had approved the formation of lower-deck committees. New Zealand authorities had reluctantly agreed to this, but the committees were banned from considering or making proposals to the officers on the matters of pay, shipboard routine, or service conditions; the issues that affected the sailors the most. Of the 219 recommendations made by various committees to higher authorities, only 6 had been approved for consideration, and only 1 was implemented. The National Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy partially attributes the lack of concern for lower-deck welfare to the breakdown of chains of communication as divisional officers were demobilised, along with the broader disruption caused by demobilisation efforts.|$|E
2500|$|After {{discussing}} {{the causes of}} their dissatisfaction, those at the canteen meeting (which now included a number of sailors from Black Prince) decided to present a petition to the Naval Board with three demands: the new pay rates were to be made retrospective to 1 April 1946, lower-deck committees needed {{to be capable of}} addressing issues with pay and <b>service</b> <b>conditions,</b> and the sailors were not to be punished for their actions. Phipps noted the details of the petition, and left to communicate with the Naval Board. The bosun's pipe to resume work was sounded at 13:00, but the sailors decided that they would [...] "go on strike" [...] in protest instead. Although mutinying, the sailors remained calm and in control of their actions, and endeavoured to make clear that their problems were with the government, not the navy itself. When moving around the base, they had conducted themselves in an orderly and disciplined fashion, and those disembarking from Black Prince had saluted the White Ensign as required. They also took care to ensure their actions could not be attributed to external factors; for example, when one sailor consumed some rum with his lunch, he was encouraged to return to duty, so nobody could claim the mutineers were acting under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
