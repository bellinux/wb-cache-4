40|$|This dispute {{concerns}} {{the imposition of}} a definitive safeguard measure by the United States on imports of circular welded carbon quality line pipe ("line pipe”) from Korea (WTO DOC. WTO/DS 202 /AB/R). The measure was imposed following an investigation conducted by the US International Trade Commission (USITC). The USITC determined in a <b>safeguard</b> <b>investigation</b> initiated on 29 July 1999 that "circular welded carbon quality line pipe... is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or the threat of serious injury. ” In its investigation, the USITC identified a number of factors apart from increased imports that might have caused serious injury or threat of serious injury to the domestic line pipe industry. The Commission concluded that increased imports were "a cause which is important and not less than any other cause” and that, therefore, the statutory requirement of "substantial cause” had been me...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the steel safeguards implemented and subsequently removed during 2001 - 2003. Our results reveal that for shareholders of U.

Steel shareholders experienced negative abnormal returns of - 5 % {{in response to the}} WTO ruling that the U. S. violated WTO law. The results here are consistent with the neoclassical view that producers gain at the expense of consumers. Downstream consumers in transportation equipment and electrical equipment showed the clearest negative reaction to the safeguards. Moreover, steel firms that received larger cash disbursements under the Byrd amendment received additional wealth gains when the safeguard duties were imposed. Finally, empirical results indicate that U.

40|$|The use of {{safeguard}} measures provides trading nations {{with a unique}} and powerful “escape clause ” for certain domestic industries. Safeguards are intended to serve as emergency measures that temporarily protect a domestic industry from the serious injury that is experienced {{as a result of}} an increase in imports. Unlike other trade remedies available under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework such as antidumping and countervailing duties, the initiation of a <b>safeguard</b> <b>investigation</b> does not require the existence of unfair trade practices on the part of exporters. As such, {{safeguard measures}} are the only form of trade law that permits protection for injury caused by fair trade. Therefore, the potential for safeguards to be the subject of widespread abuse by trading nations has been well recognised. Despite this threat, the use of safeguard measures has actually been quite rare in the multilateral trading system to date. Until 1995, Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) governed the “escape clause ” of international trade. However due to significant difficulties encountered with the application of Article XIX including the widespread use of market distorting “grey area measures”, extensive negotiations took place during the Uruguay Roun...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} and empirical literature {{on the use of}} safeguards in a trade agreement. It then analyzes the available data on the use of safeguards by WTO members to examine two hypotheses in the economics literature, that safeguards improve welfare by facilitating tariff reductions and that safeguards improve welfare by providing insurance against adverse economic shocks. I find that countries which undertook larger tariff reductions during the Uruguay Round conducted more <b>safeguards</b> <b>investigations</b> after the WTO was established. However, this result is not robust across all specifications of the model and should not be regarded as definitive. I find no evidence to support the hypothesis that safeguards improve welfare by providing insurance. The empirical analysis rejects the hypothesis of a relationship between safeguards and aggregate uncertainty. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Organization); Trade...|$|R

It then moves on to report some of the findings from an evaluation of adult safeguarding in one English local authority, focussing on how the adult safeguarding database was populated from case records and how the resultant data was utilised. It found that, although the annual number of adult safeguarding alerts more than tripled between 2002 and 2008, this clear evidence of an increase in workload had not resulted in increased resource allocation. The evaluation further noted that only half of the designated ‘adult safeguarding managers’ who were interviewed were able to correctly define the meanings of the recommended terms under which adult safeguarding outcomes are recorded, i. e. ‘substantiated’, ‘not substantiated’ and ‘not determined’.

With regard to the legal findings, the panel followed the established jurisprudence in this area, and found a number of violations of the Safeguards Agreement. With regard to the economics, we delve more deeply into the economic and political background of the <b>safeguards</b> <b>investigation.</b> Ukraine was hit by the economic crisis shortly after its WTO accession that significantly liberalized import tariffs on passenger cars. Next, we offer a de novo look at the injury and causation issues in this case, and discuss the challenges of an industry reliant on offshored production that sees a safeguard as a mechanism to attract FDI for production. We conclude with an assessment of the operation of the WTO's safeguards regime, along with some tentative suggestions for reform. Overall, our examination of the economic analysis by the investigating authority and the legal review by the WTO panel raises questions about particular aspects of the domestic and WTO processes, but concludes that the system worked well in this case...|$|R

40|$|Peru's {{experience}} {{in the application of}} antidumping and safeguard measures is characterized by a radical change in the philosophy and procedures of trade {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s, and by an increasing use of these mechanisms. Trade liberalization was accompanied by the liberalization of foreign currency transactions and of financial and labor markets. Also, the internal revenue administration was modernized, institutions for regulation and competition defense were created, and state enterprises were transferred to private owners or concessionaires. New laws and institutions were created to regulate markets, including INDECOPI, a novel government agency charged with antimonopoly regulation and consumer defense, and which houses the Antidumping and Subsidies Commission. This highly autonomous and technical Commission became the central player in the implementation of WTO rules and procedures for fair trade. Since the reform was launched, a total of 81 trade protection cases have been presented, of which 57 were followed by a dumping investigation. The application of antidumping duties was approved for 29 of the cases investigated. Only two cases of <b>safeguard</b> <b>investigations</b> were recorded, one of which (Chinese textile clothing articles) is still in the negotiation phase. This paper reviews that case {{experience in}} detail, concluding that Peru has clearly differentiated between unfair competition and dumping on the one hand, and damage and safeguards on the other, and has applied strict technical criteria to the former and broader political considerations to the latter. Despite recent indications of a partial retreat from those principles, the decade-old reform is expected to last. ...|$|R
40|$|The trade {{liberalization}} {{has resulted in}} massive food imports into Cameroon and this is affecting the livelihoods of the farmers, industries, traders, and service providers of the imported foods. Cameroon was selected by FAO {{as one of the}} 12 country case studies on the impact of food import surges in developing countries with the overall objective of studying and analyzing the impact of the most prevalent and frequent surge commodities (poultry meat, rice, and vegetable oils) on stakeholders. The methods and analytical approach used for this study are those for WTO <b>Safeguards</b> <b>investigation</b> as outlined in the FAO working document, "Extent and impact of food import surges in developing countries: An analytical approach and research methodology for country case studies". Information for the study was obtained from both secondary sources and from primary sources (stakeholders' survey). Quantitatively and qualitatively, import surges occurred and are occurring for poultry meat in Cameroon. There were relatively low levels of this commodity imports into Cameroon until 1999 - 2004 at which time the import of poultry meat increased by 286. 7 %. Domestic and exogenous factors contributed to the commodity import surge in Cameroon. A potentially negative correlation between the movements in import volumes and movement in domestic price, per unit import value, domestic production, and profits, key injury indicators were noted. Factors other than imports contributed to the injuries. Cameroon's policy responses to the surges and injuries were its main trade policy instrument, the tariff, partial ban on imports of poultry meat, and instituted reference price.

40|$|While India {{did not use}} antidumping, safeguards, and countervailing {{measures}} (temporary trade barriers) prior to 1992, it subsequently came to become the WTO system’s dominant user of those policies. Using detailed product-level data from the World Banks’ Temporary Trade Barriers Database from 1992 - 2009, we first study India’s use of temporary trade barriers over time, and across products, sectors and targeted countries, to then establish changes in previous patterns that may have taken place during the global economic crisis of 2008 - 2009. We find {{that there has been}} an increase in the stock of products subject to antidumping measures during 1992 - 2009. Moreover, the percentage of tariff line products affected by an antidumping measure increased during the recent global recession, from 1. 82 % in 2007 to 4. 03 % in 2009, and the evidence suggests that such increase is larger than would be predicted by the observed pre-crisis trend. We also find a shift in the incidence of India’s antidumping policy towards China and other developing countries in recent years. Furthermore, another dimension along which India’s antidumping protection increased during 2008 - 9 was via the failure to remove policies that were imposed prior to the global economic crisis and were supposed to be terminated during the crisis under the five-year ‘Sunset Review’ limit. There was also an increase in India’s use of global <b>safeguard</b> <b>investigations</b> as well as Chinaspecific safeguards during the global economic crisis. However, the process of tariff liberalisation continued during such period, and it is possible that India’s use of temporary trade barriers might have helped it move in that direction. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{review on}} free trade {{principle}} {{in theory and}} practice suggests that trade liberalization is merely rhetoric under which industrialized countries can pursue specific interests of certain actors more deceptively. The purpose of this thesis is to testify whether this preliminary result on general trade issues is valid in the {{textile and clothing sector}} as well. The reasons for the author to narrow her research scope down to this industry are that: first, textiles and clothing had been subject to consistent trade protectionism for more than thirty years since the discriminatory Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) in 1974; second, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) in 1995 was designed to remove all quota restrictions by 1 st January 2005 via a ten-year transitional period; third, the European Union (EU) raised <b>safeguard</b> <b>investigations</b> within four months after the expiry of the agreement, and succeeded in re-introducing quantitative restraints back to this sector. The intense and dramatic Europe-China textile dispute in 2005 started from the completion of quota abolishment, but ended up with quota re-imposition, which inspires the author to ask whether the European Union’s trade liberalization in the textile and clothing sector is rhetoric or reality. The thesis examines the conventional stance of the Union’s textile and clothing policy, the actual fulfillment of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), and the development of the Europe-China trade dispute on in 2005. In order to identify involved interest groups and their demands during the implementation of the agreement and in the dispute shortly afterwards, the thesis also analyzes: first, the interaction between protectionist lobbying groups and national governments at the Union’s level; and second, the divergence on the attitudes towards China’s expansion in the European market among member states.             Comparing the Union’s early promises in the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) with its actual behaviors during implementation and in dispute, the author finally concludes that the Union’s trade liberalization in the textile and clothing sector is merely rhetoric under which the European Union (EU) pursues the protectionist interests of its domestic textile and clothing producers and those member states with substantial textile and clothing industry...|$|R

The trend data establishes that despite the increased cost, level of intrusion into private family life and surveillance of families there is no proportionate increase in the level of child abuse found in referred children. Although the number of children referred into the system has significantly increased, the number of cases where ‘core abuse’ (physical and sexual abuse) is detected has dropped. In addition, the ratio of referrals to registrations has significantly fallen year on year.

40|$|For UF 6 mass {{spectrometry}} {{two types of}} "standards" are equally important: firstly "documentary standards" which describe specific measurement techniques and associated calculations, and secondly "material standards" which are preferentially SItraceable certified isotopic reference materials, as e. g. provided by the European Commission's Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM). Recently the IRMM has upgraded its facilities for uranium isotopic measurements using uranium hexafluoride (UF 6) gas by the acquisition of a new gas source mass spectrometer (GSMS), the "URANUS" from Thermo Fisher. By that IRMM has expanded its UF 6 {{mass spectrometry}} capability from measurements of only the "major" isotope ratio n(235 U) /n(238 U) towards the so-called "minor" isotope ratios n(234 U) /n(238 U) and n(236 U) /n(238 U). The minor ratios contain increasingly valuable information about {{the source of the}} original ("feed") material used for the commercial or possibly clandestine isotopic enrichment of UF 6 and have therefore reached a high level of attention for safeguards authorities. "Documentary standards": within the recent few years new measurement techniques for UF 6 -GSMS have been developed at IRMM, e. g. the "memory corrected double standard" (MCDS) technique which shows an improved measurement performance for both the "major" n(235 U) /n(238 U) isotope ratio as well as the "minor" isotope ratios n(234 U) /n(238 U) and n(236 U) /n(238 U). A careful revision of some of the documentary standards for UF 6 GSMS measurements (e. g. ASTM C 1429 - 99) is now strongly suggested by IRMM. This will be an important contribution to improve the overall performance of UF 6 GSMS measurements. It {{is a good example of}} the JRC’s expertise contributing to standardization and innovation by further developing material standards and reference methods but also documentary standards to the benefit of the safeguards community and industry. "Material standards": IRMM has just started a comprehensive project for a new certification of the worldwide most widely used and well-known IRMM- 019 to IRMM- 029 series of 12 UF 6 reference materials. Special emphasis will be given on achieving lower uncertainties particularly for the "minor" isotope ratios using previously established high performance TIMS instrumentation and techniques. This new certification is a prerequisite for achieving accurate results for UF 6 GSMS measurements also for the minor ratios to be used for nuclear <b>safeguards</b> <b>investigations.</b> JRC.

30|$|Low {{similarity}} value {{expressed by}} isolates with the reference taxa belonging to different species result in DNA reassociation that {{rise above the}} 70 % threshold values (Stackebrandt et al. 2002). In the present study, phylogenetic analysis of the isolates showed low genetic relatedness with reference strains. Thus, the mushroom isolates are {{quite different from the}} reference sequences from the Genbank. This suggests that the similarity shared can be wiped off after sometimes due to environmental conditions (Konstantinidis and Stackebrandt 2013). In addition, isolates did not cluster with the reference taxa from the GenBank as a result of distinct nucleotide signature (Togashi et al. 2001; Aremu and Babalola 2015). From the phylogenetic distinctness point of view, these fungal isolates are probably novel mushroom species, and therefore calls for stern <b>safeguarding</b> and further <b>investigations</b> on the associated benefits.|$|R

40|$|Mexico's {{creation}} {{and use of}} safeguard and antidumping processes to advance its liberalization illustrate three key points: (1) The country {{was able to use}} the instruments without losing political control. In a period of crisis that threatened congressional approval of critical steps in the liberalization-brought on by currency overvaluation and recession, along with unexpected demands from the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreementnegotiations-the government applied a number of trade defense measures. Once the problems were addressed with adequate instruments the number of measures dropped drastically. The instruments had not been captured by protection-seeking interests; (2) The country adopted a liberalization-accepting measure of international norms. An important innovation that Mexico made operational was the use within World Trade Organization (WTO) rules of prevailing international prices as the measure of competition that industry was expected to meet. The WTO rules would also have allowed the use of other standards-as in traditional antidumping-using countries-that impose less discipline. Moreover, the Mexican standard was consistent with the government-industry understanding that though Mexican industry would be protected against extraordinary circumstances it would be expected to face up to international competition; (3) Political judgment and political courage are essential. While mastery of the technical elements of a <b>safeguard</b> or antidumping <b>investigation</b> is mandatory, sustaining liberalization depends in significant part on the political skills to know when to emphasize the technical elements, when to rely more on the discretion the government retains under the rules, and on the courage to do it.

This report has been prepared in accordance with DOE Order 231. 1 A and DOE guidance. This report documents WIPP's environmental monitoring programs and their results for 2003. The WIPP Project is authorized by the DOE National Security and Military Applications of Nuclear Energy Authorization Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96 - 164). After more than 20 years of scientific study and public input, WIPP received its first shipment of waste on March 26, 1999. Located in southeastern New Mexico, WIPP is the nation's first underground repository permitted to safely and permanently dispose of TRU radioactive and mixed waste (as defined in the WIPP LWA) generated through the research and production of nuclear weapons and other activities related to the national defense of the United States. TRU waste is defined in the WIPP LWA as radioactive waste containing more than 100 nanocuries (3, 700 becquerels [Bq]) of alpha-emitting transuranic isotopes per gram of waste, with half-lives greater than 20 years. Exceptions are noted as high-level waste, waste that has been determined not to require the degree of isolation required by the disposal regulations, and waste the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has approved for disposal. Most TRU waste is contaminated industrial trash, such as rags and old tools, and sludges from solidified liquids; glass; metal; and other materials from dismantled buildings. A TRU waste is eligible for disposal at WIPP if it has been generated in whole or in partby {{one or more of the}} activities listed in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 United States Code [U. S. C. ] § 10101, et seq.), including naval reactors development, weapons activities, verification and control technology, defense nuclear materials production, defense nuclear waste and materials by-products management, defense nuclear materials security and <b>safeguards</b> and security <b>investigations,</b> and defense research and development. The waste must also meet the WIPP Waste Acceptance Criteria. When TRU waste arrives at WIPP, it is transported into the Waste Handling Building. The waste containers are removed from the shipping containers, placed on the waste hoist, and lowered to the repository level of 655 m (2, 150 ft; approximately 0. 5 mi) below the surface. Next, the containers of waste are removed from the hoist and placed in excavated storage rooms in the Salado Formation, a thick sequence of evaporite beds deposited approximately 250 million years ago (Figure 1. 1).
