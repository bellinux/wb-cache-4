The proposed nMOS switch is composed of only intrinsic high-voltage transistors without channel implantation, which realizes both reduction of the minimum operating voltage and elimination of the leakage current. The proposed row decoder scheme is described in which all blocks are in selected state in standby so as to prevent standby current from flowing through the proposed <b>switches</b> in the <b>row</b> decoder. A merged charge-pump scheme generates a plurality of voltage levels with an individually optimized efficiency, which reduces circuit area {{in comparison with the}} conventional scheme that requires a separate charge-pump circuit for each voltage level. The proposed circuits were implemented on an experimental NAND flash memory. The charge pump and switch successfully operated at a supply voltage of 1. 8 V with a standby current of 10 A. The proposed pump scheme reduced the area required for charge-pump circuits by 40 %. Index Terms—Charge-pump circuit, high-voltage switching, low supply voltage, NAND flash memories, row decoder.

The name ARP was derived from Pearlman's initials. ARP entered the fledgling synthesizer industry with the introduction of the ARP 2002, which with twice as many <b>switch</b> <b>rows</b> on top, became the 2500 analog modular synthesizer. The 2002 was introduced at the AES show in Fall 1970, and subsequently competed head to head with other leading synthesizer companies of the time. Pearlman eschewed patch cord methodology for interconnecting synthesizer modules, designing instead a system of sliding matrix switches. He also applied his op-amp experience by utilizing dual transistors on a single integrated circuit to overcome temperature gradients and provide very stable oscillators - more stable than other popular synthesizers on the market at the time, namely offerings from Moog Music and Buchla.|$|R

40|$|Memory access consumes a {{significant}} amount of energy in data transfer intensive applications. The selection of a memory location from a CMOS memory cell array involves driving row and column select lines. A switching event on a row select line often consumes significantly more energy in comparison to a switching event on a column select line. In order to exploit this difference in energy consumption of row and column select lines, we propose a novel data layout method that aims to minimize <b>row</b> <b>switching</b> activity by assigning spatially and temporally local data items to the same row. The problem of minimum <b>row</b> <b>switching</b> data layout has been formulated as a multi-way mesh partitioning problem. The constraints imposed on the problem formulation ensure that the complexity of the address generator required to implement the optimized data layout is bounded and that the data layout optimization can be applied to all address generator synthesis methods.
