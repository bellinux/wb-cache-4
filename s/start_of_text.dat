50|$|An early ISO {{standard}} {{defining a}} Telex-oriented communications protocol that used the non-printable ASCII transmission control characters SOH (Start of Heading), STX (<b>Start</b> <b>of</b> <b>Text),</b> ETX (End of Text), EOT (End of Transmission), ENQ (Enquiry), ACK (Acknowledge), DLE (Data Link Escape), NAK (Negative Acknowledge), SYN (Synchronous Idle), and ETB (End of Transmission Block).|$|E
5000|$|An {{optional}} heading containing control information can precede {{data in a}} frame. The content of the heading is not defined by the protocol but is defined for each specific device. The heading, if present, is preceded by an SOH (start of heading) character and followed by an STX (<b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>text).</b> [...] Text data normally follows the heading, begun by the STX, and terminated by ETX (end of text) or ETB (end transmission block).|$|E
50|$|A {{data block}} {{begins with the}} {{character}} 02 (STX, <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>text),</b> and ends with the character 03 (ETX, end of text). After ETX, a check byte {{made up of the}} previous bytes including STX and ETX by binary addition (XOR), is transmitted. A 0D character (decimal 13) marks the end of a line during transmission. Data files created by programs are able to use all characters as data and must contain no control characters. They are read and written in blocks of 1024 bytes.|$|E

5000|$|The byte order mark (BOM) is a Unicode character, , whose {{appearance}} as a magic number at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> a <b>text</b> stream can signal several things {{to a program}} consuming the text: ...|$|R
50|$|The byte {{sequence}} of the BOM character differs per Unicode encoding, {{and none of the}} sequences is likely to appear at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> streams stored in other encodings. Therefore, placing an encoded BOM {{at the start of a}} text stream can serve to indicate the text is Unicode and to identify the encoding scheme used, even for UTF-8, which has no endianness. This generalized use of the BOM character is called a Unicode signature, and its use has been extended to Unicode-based encoding schemes that aren't part of the Unicode standard, such as UTF-7 (see table below).|$|E
50|$|The {{start of}} heading (SOH) {{character}} was to mark a non-data section of a data stream—the part of a stream containing addresses and other housekeeping data. The <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> character (STX) {{marked the end of}} the header, and the start of the textual part of a stream. The end of text character (ETX) marked the end of the data of a message. A widely used convention is to make the two characters preceding ETX a checksum or CRC for error-detection purposes. The end of transmission block character (ETB) was used to indicate the end of a block of data, where data was divided into such blocks for transmission purposes.|$|E

However, as the two sides are written with different hands, it is likely that these are distinct texts, and therefore that the question of recto vs. verso is irrelevant.|$|R

50|$|UTF-16 and UTF-32 do {{not have}} endianness defined, so a byte order must be {{selected}} when receiving them over a byte-oriented network or reading them from a byte-oriented storage. This may be achieved by using a byte-order mark at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>text</b> or assuming big-endian (RFC 2781). UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-32BE, UTF-16LE and UTF-32LE are standardised on a single byte order and does not have this problem.|$|R

40|$|Text {{databases}} {{are becoming}} increasingly important in business applications. However the diverse nature <b>of</b> <b>text</b> is not widely understood, nor appreciated. Some properties of simple document models and text algebras are presented, and these are briefly related to conventional relational systems. 1 Text as a string The simplest view <b>of</b> <b>text</b> is as a string of characters. Such a string has the property of linear order, but imposes no other constraints. Each character in the text can be identified by its position within the character sequence (i. e., the offset from the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>text),</b> and substrings can be identified by the positions of their first and last characters. Text matching, then, requires finding substrings that satisfy given predicates, whether for exact match or approximate match, and returning the character positions <b>of</b> the <b>start</b> and end <b>of</b> the matches. Proximity matching can be applied by comparing the character offsets of substrings' endpoints as appropriate. Although e [...] ...|$|R

It mentions campaigns by Nabonidus against a place named Hume and unnamed localities in [...] "the West" [...] (Arabia?). Cyrus's pillaging of Ecbatana, the capital of Astyages, is recorded in the sixth year of the reign of Nabonidus. The chronicle goes on to describe in several entries the self-imposed exile of Nabonidus in the Arabian oasis of Tema (mentioned as Teiman in Hebrew in the Dead Sea Scrolls fragment 4Q242 known as the Testimony of Nebonidus dated to 150 BC. and the disruption that this caused to the Akitu (New Year) festival for a period of ten years. The king spent ten years in Arabia and left Babylonia administered by his son, Bel-shar-usur (Belshazzar of the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament). The eighth year is purposefully left blank; apparently the scribe did not have any significant events to record for that year. Another campaign by Cyrus is recorded in the ninth year, possibly representing his attack on Lydia and capture of Sardis.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a biclausal construction in Chechen, {{arguing that it}} can be analyzed as an it-cleft. The construction consists of a main copula clause with a covert or pronominal subject, and a temporal complement that co-indexes with an adjunct position in a relative clause that does not form a constituent with the subject or the complement. A study of the construction in a corpus of newspaper and journal texts shows characteristics that make it stand out in terms of syntax and function: the cleft clause can appear both clause-finally as well as clause-initially, and its function is limited to text-structuring (it is mostly used to mark the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> a <b>text</b> or the transition to a new paragraph). This latter characteristic is exceptional: it-clefts in other languages (such as English and Norwegian) are known to be used for text-structuring to some extent, but Chechen is the first language known to only use it for this purpose. This prompts the question whether there are perhaps other language (e. g. from the Nakh-Daghestan family) with similar characteristics...|$|R
