40|$|The {{presence}} of {{substantial amounts of}} interstellar dust in late-type galaxies affects observable parameters such as the optical surface brightness, the color, and the ratio of far-infrared to optical luminosity of these galaxies. We conducted radiative transfer calculations for late-type galaxy environments to examine two different scenarios: (1) the effects of increasing amounts of dust in two fixed geometries with different star distributions; and (2) the effects of an evolving dust-star geometry in which {{the total amount of}} dust is held constant, for three different <b>star</b> <b>distributions.</b> The calculations were done for ten photometric bands, ranging from the far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared (K), and scattered light was included in the galactic surface brightness at each wavelength. The energy absorbed throughout these ten photometric bands was assumed to re-emerge in the far-infrared as thermal dust emission. We also considered the evolutionary contraction of a constant amount of dust relative to pre-existing <b>star</b> <b>distributions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The mass {{distribution}} of compact objects provides a fossil record {{that can be}} studied to uncover information on the late stages of massive star evolution, the supernova explosion mechanism, and the dense matter equation of state. Observations of neutron star masses indicate a bimodal Gaussian distribution, while the observed black hole {{mass distribution}} decays exponentially for stellar-mass black holes. We use these observed distributions to directly confront the predictions of stellar evolution models and the neutrino-driven supernova simulations of Sukhbold et al. (2016). We find excellent agreement between the black hole and low-mass neutron <b>star</b> <b>distributions</b> created by these simulations and the observations. We show that a large fraction of the stellar envelope must be ejected, either during the formation of stellar-mass black holes or prior to the implosion through tidal stripping due to a binary companion, in order to reproduce the observed black hole mass distribution. We also determine {{the origins of the}} bimodal peaks of the neutron <b>star</b> mass <b>distribution,</b> finding that the low-mass peak (centered at ~ 1. 4 M_sun) originates from progenitors with M_zams ~ 9 - 18 M_sun. The simulations fail to reproduce the observed peak of high-mass neutron stars (centered at ~ 1. 8 M_sun) and we explore several possible explanations. We argue that the close agreement between the observed and predicted black hole and low-mass neutron <b>star</b> mass <b>distributions</b> provides new promising evidence that these stellar evolution and explosion models are accurately capturing the relevant stellar, nuclear, and explosion physics involved in the formation of compact objects.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{magnitude}} limited (K less than = 8. 5 mag) speckle imaging survey of 69 T Tauri stars in the star forming regions Taurus-Auriga and Ophiuchus-Scorpius. Thirty-three companion stars were found with separations ranging from 0. 07 sec to 2. 5 sec, nine are new detections. This survey reveals a distinction between the classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and the weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTS) based on the binary star frequency as a function of separation: the WTTS binary <b>star</b> <b>distribution</b> is enhanced at the closer separations (less than 50 AU) relative to the CTTS binary <b>star</b> <b>distribution.</b> We suggest that the nearby companion stars shorten the accretion time scale in multiple star systems, thereby accounting for the presence of WTTS that are coeval with many CTTS. The binary star frequency in the projected linear separation range 16 to 252 AU for T Tauri stars (60 (+/- 17) %) is a factor of 4 greater than that of the solar-type main-sequence stars (16 (+/- 3) %). Given the limited separation range of this survey, the rate at which binaries are detected suggests that most, if not all, T Tauri stars have companions. We propose that the observed overabundance of companions of T Tauri stars is an evolutionary effect, in which triple and higher order T Tauri stars are disrupted by close encounters with another star or system of stars...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} proposed is that topology of {{a rotating}} gaseous cloud can be {{variable in the}} contraction process. Due to rotation an originally spherical cloud {{is transformed into a}} toroidal body. The contraction of a thin torus is considered with different suppositions on cooling the gas. In the determined time the torus will become gravitationally unstable. The excitation of Jeans' waves is shown to result in the disintegration of the torus into fragments. The number of the fragments and their mass distributions are calculated. The proposed hypothesis on toroidal stages in stellar evolution can remove some difficulties in the theory of structure and evolution of stars, such as absence of limitary <b>stars,</b> <b>distribution</b> of rotation velocities of early-type stars, origin of poloidal magnetic fields and decline rotators with the magnetic axis orthogonal to the axis of rotation...|$|R
