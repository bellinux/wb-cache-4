40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the {{commercial}} use of the Internet goes along with a rising need for security for both customer and merchant. As many parties and different systems are involved, security becomes a complicated issue. Therefore, the need for definition, structuring, and quantification of security arises. This paper proposes a structured approach to analyze security measures and to quantify the overall security of an electronic business application. The quantifier is calculated through a <b>security</b> <b>matrix</b> which breaks down the assessment of security into smaller parts. These parts correspond to the locations, security objectives, and implemented security mechanisms of the application. The security quantifier {{can be used to}} analyze, design the application, and to compare it with other applications. Keywords: security, security quantifier, electronic business application...|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} methods {{were applied to}} {{evaluate}} and understand security perceptions across five European countries. Eight dimensions of the security perception were assessed, namely physical safety, territorial integrity, environmental and ecological security, cultural identity, social stability, political stability, economic prosperity, and information and cyber security. Their evaluation and prioritisation was performed using the Perception <b>Security</b> <b>Matrix</b> representation. Statistical methods—contingency tables, functional analysis and structural equation modelling—were applied to explain {{the relationships between the}} dimensions and their dependencies on risk categories. Three basic principles were derived: “freedom from want” related to economic and environmental conditions, “freedom from instability” as determined by social and political issues, and “freedom from fear,” meaning freedom from war, terrorism and aggressiveness, and related also to the integrity of the private sphere. These general principles manifest themselves differently in different countries determined by specific political, social, cultural, and economic context...|$|E

40|$|Most {{organizations}} have acknowledged {{the importance of}} information systems security, yet in this environment of heightened awareness many organizations focus on technology and overlook the non-technical security resources available to them. This project focused on the non-technical side of security and the management practices {{that can be used}} to establish an important layer in a comprehensive security solution. A <b>security</b> planning <b>matrix</b> was developed by drawing from the theoretical and practical body of knowledge in the information systems <b>security</b> field. The <b>matrix</b> was designed to support generally accepted security principles, standards, and legislation so that information systems management can use the product to protect information systems using non-technical controls and techniques such as people, policies, practices, training, awareness, and the organizational structure and culture. A hybrid waterfall/spiral process model, Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) was used to develop the <b>security</b> planning <b>matrix.</b> Specific procedures emulated those used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) based on their experience and expertise in developing security guidelines and other security tools. A prototype of the product was developed early in the process based on requirements abstracted from security standards, legislation, and industry best practices. The prototype was then reviewed by an expert panel to refine both product requirements and design. One round of feedback and two versions of the prototype were required before the panel approved the prototype for use in the pilot study. The pilot was performed in a real-world setting at Republic Mortgage Insurance Corporation (RMIC), where user acceptance testing, success criteria evaluation, and security performance improvement testing were all performed to evaluate and stabilize the product. The research improved professional practice and added to the body of information systems security knowledge by identifying and demonstrating methods for defining requirements of, developing, and evaluating a product such as the <b>security</b> planning <b>matrix.</b> Results of the research also showed that the product 2 ̆ 7 s features and functions were acceptable to both subject matter experts and real-world users and that implementation and use of the <b>security</b> planning <b>matrix</b> could improve the level of security preparedness as evidenced by pilot study results at RMIC...|$|R

It will focus mainly on the indigenous Plantation Guard, a static defence force designed to protect the plantations that were considered vital to a successful Dutch return to Indonesia. Attempts to stifle the resistance came down heavily on the military side: the authorities, with the help of the planters' community in Indonesia, established one security force after another, dominated by the military. They ultimately created a <b>security</b> <b>matrix</b> they could not control as the parties concerned squabbled over who was to ‘own’ the security forces.

40|$|Abstract — The {{major concern}} for a {{computer}} system is its security and integrity. It is necessary to check the security level of your system and keep it updated. This can be best achieved by using a metric system. At present, there is no standard metric to measure the integrity and security of a computer system. Defining a standard metric that suits all the systems is difficult, {{considering the fact that}} every system is built according to the functions it is used for. The Computer systems are used for millions of different functions. In this work we develop an adaptive metric system for measuring security and integrity level of a computer system. To define the metric system we have used a matrix called <b>Security</b> <b>Matrix.</b> We call this matrix adaptive because users can introduce or delete columns in the matrix according to their requirements. The idea behind this is to allow the user to have a metric system that suits his or her system best. Each dimension in the matrix represents one influential factor of the system security and integrity. The factors can vary from the software used in the system to the mediums of attack on the system. In this thesis we refer the system for a single computer or multiple computers connected in a network infrastructure using routers and switches...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Secure multi-party {{computation}} (MPC) {{allows a}} set of n players to securely compute an agreed function, even when up to t players are {{under the control of}} an adversary. Known perfectly secure MPC proto-cols require communication of at least Ω(n 3) field elements per multipli-cation, whereas cryptographic or unconditional security is possible with communication linear in the number of players. We present a perfectly secure MPC protocol communicating O(n) field elements per multiplica-tion. Our protocol provides perfect security against an active, adaptive adversary corrupting t < n/ 3 players, which is optimal. Thus our proto-col improves the security of the most efficient information-theoretically secure protocol at no extra costs, respectively improves the efficiency of perfectly secure MPC protocols by a factor of Ω(n 2). To achieve this, we introduce a novel technique – constructing detectable protocols with the help of so-called hyper-invertible matrices, which we believe to be of independent interest. Hyper-invertible matrices allow (among other things) to perform efficient correctness checks of many instances in par-allel, which was until now possible only if error-probability was allowed.

It is shown that {{the establishment of the}} estimation system in the science of economic security began with its algorithmic aspects, in which the laws, principles, logic, estimation algorithms are reflected in several existing approaches to estimation. There have been analyzed the content, advantages and limitations of the most common in estimation of the enterprise economic security approaches: functional (or complex), indicator and expert one. It is shown that each of the analyzed approaches is based on using appropriate instruments, none of them is recognized to be ideal, the approaches do not compete with each other as they use different instrumentation. The expediency of applying to the estimation of economic <b>security</b> the <b>matrix</b> approach, which is not widely spread in the estimatology in the science of economic security, has been considered. There was shown the sequence of formation of simple matrices, and for the generalization of partial estimates of the enterprise economic security derived from a set of simple matrices, it is proposed to use the profiling of partial estimates, which allows {{on the basis of the}} results of visual arrangement of quadrants of simple matrices to get an idea of the economic security of the enterprise and the “bottlenecks” in it...|$|R
40|$|Steganography is {{the science}} of hiding the {{messages}} in a medium. The existence of hidden messages remains imperceptible to the Intruders. The medium used for hiding the messages may be audio, video, text or images. The important goal of steganography {{is to protect the}} hidden message. There are many techniques to hide the payload in images. This will be achieved by applying different techniques in any medium. There are many techniques applied by the intruders to find the hidden information those techniques are called anti-steganalysis techniques. To provide the security to the payload after inserting the payload in to messages we need to do the anti steganalysis, if the hidden information is found then we need to provide the additional security. There is a need to build the system with highest security levels so that the anti steganalysis techniques can’t find out the hidden information. In the proposed system there are certain areas which are suitable for hiding the payload are called Edges. Edges are good Regions of Interest or ROIs that are used for steganography. The proposed system uses edge adaptive image steganography [1] that uses the combinations of chaotic cat mapping [2] to provide additional <b>security</b> and <b>matrix</b> encoding [3] and LSBM [4] to embed the data in to image.

40|$|Both {{estimating}} portfolio {{credit risk}} and pricing credit risky <b>securities</b> require transition <b>matrices</b> for arbitary time horizons. Simply computing {{the root of}} the annual transition matrix is unacceptable because the resulting matrices often contain negative elements. A similar situation exists when taking the logarithm of the annual transition matrix to compute a generator. This paper develops regularization algorithms for obtaining transition matrices and generators that give rise to close approximations of a given annual transition matrix. In our approach, the root or logarithm of the annual transition matrix is transformed, on a row-by-row basis, into a valid transition matrix or generator by projecting each row onto an appropriate set in a Euclidean space. Our methods compare favourably with other known regularization algorithms.

40|$|Although the ASP {{model has}} been around for over a decade, it has not {{achieved}} the expected high level of market uptake. This research project examines the past and present state of ASP adoption and identifies security as a primary factor influencing the uptake of the model. The early chapters of this document examine the ASP model and ASP security in particular. Specifically, the literature and technology review chapter analyses ASP literature, security technologies and best practices with respect to system security in general. Based on this investigation, a prototype to illustrate the range and types of technologies that encompass a security framework was developed and is described in detail. The latter chapters of this document evaluate the practical implementation of system security in an ASP environment. Finally, this document outlines the research outputs, including the conclusions drawn and recommendations with respect to system security in an ASP environment. The primary research output is the recommendation that by following best practices with respect to security, an ASP application can provide the same level of security one would expect from any other n-tier client-server application. In addition, a <b>security</b> evaluation <b>matrix,</b> which could be used to evaluate not only the security of ASP applications but the security of any n-tier application, was developed by the author. This thesis shows that perceptions with regard to fears of inadequate security of ASP solutions and solution data are misguided. Finally, based on the research conducted, the author recommends that ASP solutions should be developed and deployed on tried, tested and trusted infrastructure. Existing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) should be used where possible and security best practices should be adhered to where feasible...|$|R

This research {{is carried out}} under development strategy implementation of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation and national safeguarding for the period before 2020 in the Murmansk region territory. Creation of unified interdepartmental multilevel computer-aided system is proposed intended for decision-making information support and socio-economic security monitoring of the Arctic regions of Russia. The distinctive features of the investigated system class are openness, self-organization, decentralization of management functions and decision-making, weak hierarchy in the decision-making circuit and goal generation capability inside itself. Research techniques include functional-target approach, mathematical apparatus of multilevel hierarchical system theory and principles of network-centric control of distributed systems with pro-active components and variable structure. The work considers network-centric management local decisions coordination problem-solving within the multilevel distributed systems intended for information support of regional security. The coordination problem-solving approach and problem formalization in the multilevel network-centric control systems of regional security have been proposed based on developed multilevel recurrent hierarchical model of regional socio-economic system complex security. The model provides coordination of regional security indexes, optimized by the different elements of multilevel control systems, subject to decentralized decision-making. The model specificity consists in application of functional-target technology and mathematical apparatus of multilevel hierarchical system theory for coordination procedures implementation of the network-centric management local decisions.

They are used in military area, industrial process monitoring and control, environment and habitat monitoring,health care. The sensor node has limited computational power and memory size affecting the amount of data that can be stored in individual sensor nodes. So the protocol use in sensors application should be simple and lightweight. In order to overcome the limitation and to provide security these theses attain to this problem. A single master key or storing each key in node is not feasible to use in wireless sensor network. LU matrix scheme of key pre distribution will be used for key distribution among node. The outcome of key pre-distribution technique by LU matrix provides node to node mutual authentication and guarantees to find a common keys between any two sensor nodes in the sensor network. RC 5 is a highly efficient and flexible cryptographic algorithm, for which many parameters (key size, block size, number of rounds) can be adjusted to tradeoff security strength with power consumption and computational overhead.

By shifting the focus of their vulnerability analysis from the discrete components of the food system to the food system as a whole, {{the authors of this}} article were able to develop a qualitative food system vulnerability matrix. The objective of the research was to make the concept of food system vulnerability operational by identifying vulnerability drivers, vulnerable systems and vulnerable subclasses in light of food <b>security.</b> The vulnerability <b>matrix</b> was set up with five classes of vulnerable systems ('Vulnerability of what?') on the horizontal axis and vulnerability drivers ('Vulnerability to what?') on the vertical axis. The authors analyzed the relationship between vulnerability drivers and vulnerable systems by using qualitative, abductive content analysis {{within the context of the}} Finnish food system. The data consists of public documents collected from the web pages of key organizations within the Finnish food system including ministries and their administration, interest groups and non-governmental organizations. It therefore covers various types of content related to food policy and management. Excerpts from the documentation data were coded according to which vulnerable system subclasses they addressed. The key findings of the study highlight the importance of using a systems approach that takes into account social, ecological and technical considerations. Such a framework covers multiple stressors, including exogenous natural drivers and endogenous social drivers, as well as the coalescence of vulnerability and food security discourses. The benefits of the proposed vulnerability framework for public food policy and food supply chain management include the explicit recognition of vulnerability drivers and vulnerable systems, a higher degree of specificity when speaking about food security, and opportunities for the identification of vulnerability-based innovations...|$|R
