40|$|Abstract: The {{estimation}} of the functions that describe the shear <b>stress</b> and the <b>pressure</b> drop across the short orifice die {{as a function of}} shear rate at different mean pressures for linear-low-density polyethylene copolymer (LLDPE) at 190 oC is obtained using Genetic Programming (GP). The GP has been running based on experimental data in two cases; shear <b>stress</b> and <b>pressure</b> drop at different mean pressures to produce shear <b>stress</b> and <b>pressure</b> drop for each target mean pressure. The shear rate and mean pressure of linear-low-density polyethylene copolymer have been used as input variables to find the discovered functions. The experimental, calculated and predicted shear <b>stress</b> and <b>pressure</b> drop are compared. The discovered function shows a good match to the experimental data.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the moderating effects of spirituality at work on job stress and health (well-being and ill-being) amongst Australian academics based on a spiritual appraisal model of stress and well-being. It also explored whether spirituality at work moderated the relationship between job stress and work-life balance and work-life conflict amongst Australian academics. A sample of 139 academic staff members employed in Australian universities (higher education and TAFE) anonymously completed a self-report questionnaire containing quantitative measures of spirituality at work (individual, work-unit and organisation-wide spirituality), health (well-being and ill-being), work-life balance, work-life conflict and job stress (job threat <b>stress</b> and job <b>pressure</b> <b>stress).</b> At the bivariate level, spirituality at work (individual, work-unit and organisation-wide levels), well-being, ill-being, job threat <b>stress</b> and job <b>pressure</b> <b>stress</b> correlated with each other. At the multivariate level however, {{each of the three}} levels of spirituality at work did not moderate the influence of job threat and <b>pressure</b> <b>stress</b> on both well-being or ill-being. Job threat stress significantly predicted decreased wellbeing and increased ill-being, but job <b>pressure</b> <b>stress</b> was not predictive of health. Age also significantly contributed to increased ill-being. At the bivariate level, all three levels of spirituality at work, job threat <b>stress,</b> job <b>pressure</b> <b>stress,</b> work-life balance and work-life conflict correlated with each other. Yet, at the multivariate level, spirituality at work unsuccessfully moderated the influence of job threat and job <b>pressure</b> <b>stress</b> on work-life balance and work-life conflict. Job threat <b>stress</b> and job <b>pressure</b> <b>stress</b> both significantly predicted decreased work-life balance and increased work-life conflict. The main effect of work-unit spirituality at work on work-life balance reached significance. Theoretical implications and practical implications for Human Resource Managers were discussed in terms of universities and businesses generally. Specifically, it was suggested that universities and businesses alike consider implementing stress management components into Human Resource Management employee well-being programs and initiatives. It was also suggested that HRM programs aimed at promoting work-life balance should integrate stress management and work-unit spirituality at work...|$|R

Although the force applied to the surface is the same, the thumbtack applies more pressure because the point concentrates that force into a smaller area.

50|$|The Young's modulus {{relates the}} <b>stress</b> (<b>pressure)</b> {{in a body}} to its {{associated}} strain (change in length as a ratio of the original length); that is, stress = E × strain, for a uniaxially loaded specimen. Young's modulus is independent of the component under investigation; that is, it is an inherent material property (the term modulus refers to an inherent material property). Young's Modulus allowed, for the first time, prediction of the strain in a component subject to a known stress (and vice versa). Prior to Young's contribution, engineers were required to apply Hooke's F = kx relationship to identify the deformation (x) of a body subject to a known load (F), where the constant (k) {{is a function of}} both the geometry and material under consideration. Finding k required physical testing for any new component, as the F = kx relationship is a function of both geometry and material. Young's Modulus depends only on the material, not its geometry, thus allowing a revolution in engineering strategies.|$|E

While the solubility of wheat gluten significantly increased with the increasing temperature above 140 ℃, the solubility markedly decreased with increasing temperature at the temperature below 120 ℃.

40|$|Aim. Callus {{is a risk}} factor, {{leading to}} severe {{diabetic}} foot ulcer; thus, prevention of callus formation is important. However, normal <b>stress</b> (<b>pressure)</b> and shear stress associated with callus have not been clarified. Additionally, as new valuables, a shear stress-normal <b>stress</b> (<b>pressure)</b> ratio (SPR) was examined. The purpose was to clarify the external force associated with callus formation in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Methods. The external force of the 1 st, 2 nd, and 5 th metatarsal head (MTH) as callus predilection regions was measured. The SPR was calculated by dividing shear stress by normal <b>stress</b> (<b>pressure),</b> concretely, peak values (SPR-p) and time integral values (SPR-i). The optimal cut-off point was determined. Results. Callus formation region of the 1 st and 2 nd MTH had high SPR-i rather than noncallus formation region. The cut-off value of the 1 st MTH was 0. 60 and the 2 nd MTH was 0. 50. For the 5 th MTH, variables pertaining to the external forces could not be determined to be indicators of callus formation because of low accuracy. Conclusions. The callus formation cut-off values of the 1 st and 2 nd MTH were clarified. In the future, {{it will be necessary}} to confirm the effect of using appropriate footwear and gait training on lowering SPR-i...|$|E

A significant information gap exists in the hydrodynamic response to nuclear detonations that occur near the earth's surface. Numerical simulation methods were {{used to evaluate the}} hydrodynamic response of earth-like materials and to develop the energy coupling/partitioning curve for low yield nuclear detonations close to the earth's surface. Using LLNL's supercomputers and GEODYN hydrodynamic code, the properties of <b>stress,</b> <b>pressure,</b> and energy were evaluated for twelve simulated 2. 5 kT detonations; six above the surface and six below the surface. The results indicate stronger air blasts for detonations above or near the surface and that energy coupling into the ground changes rapidly with detonation location over a very small range between the above-ground and below-ground interface. This work serves to provide a baseline model to evaluate <b>stress,</b> <b>pressure,</b> and energy in relation to nuclear yield close to the earth's surface. The results support {{a better understanding of the}} physics of near-surface detonations and also assist in planning future experimental work at NIF. US Army (USA) autho...|$|E

40|$|Contrast {{radiography}} was {{a better}} method of discriminating the 25 bitches with sphincter mechanism incompetence from the 25 normal animals than measuring only the maximum urethral clo-sure pressure and functional profile length from resting urethral pressure profiles. However, the use of <b>stressed</b> urethral <b>pressure</b> profilometry to determine the percentage of negative peaks extending below the resting intravesical pressure on the subtracted profile, {{with respect to the}} same number of peaks occurring on the intravesical pressure trace, improved the classification of the bitches with sphincter mechanism incompetence over contrast radiography alone. If contrast radiography and <b>stressed</b> urethral <b>pressure</b> profilometry were considered together, the number of false negatives was only four (8 per cent). The authors therefore recommend that <b>stressed</b> urethral <b>pressure</b> profilometry should be used in conjunction with contrast radiography as an aid to the definitive diagnosis of urethral sphincter mechanism incompe-tence in bitches. For practical purposes, the cranial brim of the pubis can be taken as the cut-off point between the positions of the bladder neck in continent and incontinent bitches. Similarly 50 per cent can be taken as the cut-off point for the assessment of negative peaks during <b>stressed</b> urethral <b>pressure</b> profilometry.
