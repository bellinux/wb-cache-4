40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} state estimation in induction motors. Generally, the motor observer design has been dealt based on standard models neglecting the saturation effect in the magnetic characteristic. As a matter of fact, magnetic saturation cannot be ignored especially when considering control strategies (speed and torque) that involve large flux variations. Such large flux variations are necessary to meet optimal operation conditions {{in the presence of}} wide range load torque changes. On the other hand, {{it is well known that}} use of mechanical (<b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque)</b> <b>sensors</b> entails reliability issues. In this paper, a new sensorless adaptive observer is designed for induction machine based on a model that accounts for the nonlinear feature in the magnetic circuit. The observer consists of two interconnected state-dependent gain observers and is formally shown to provide accurate estimates of the mechanical and magnetic variables using only stator current and voltage measurement...|$|E
40|$|Torque ripple {{exists at}} {{the output of}} {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) {{as a result of}} current error, non-sinusoidal back-EMF and cogging torque. Since part of the cogging torque component is based on manufacturing error, motor design may not eliminate all torque ripple. One possible method for reducing torque ripple is by injecting the inverse of a torque ripple estimate to the current controller. Torque estimators that include cogging torque rely on feedback from different sensors such as vibration sensors and accelerometers, microphones, <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> <b>sensors.</b> This paper outlines a control method that can utilize any sensor with a linear transfer function between the torque and the sensor input. The method determines an estimate of the torque ripple for a number of harmonics simultaneously, as well as the transfer function between the torque and the sensor. Experimental results show different sensor types provide similar estimates of the torque with less than 2 % variation in magnitude for the sensor types used. Experimental results show that regardless of which sensor type is used, critical torque harmonics are reduced by at least a factor of 3...|$|E

40|$|Improving the {{efficiency}} of collection, transmission, and consumption of resources {{is the focus of}} a wide swath of engineering research. Current technological solutions for capturing or mitigating energy and resource waste are asymmetrical. A dilemma is becoming increasingly apparent in monitoring and control systems. Networking tools provide potentially inexpensive remote access to information, but gathering useful information, however, may require the installation of an array of costly and intrusive sensors. The promise of highly effective and useful networked solutions is hemmed in by a sensing frontier consisting of significant challenges. At any time in the service life of a machine or system it may perform below its design efficiency. Valves may leak, belts might slip, and equipment may be left on when not needed. Systems under feedback control like HVAC plants will mask the effect of incipient faults from the user by increasing their duty cycle and wasting energy. Water distribution networks will supply healthy and leaky loads alike without obvious change save in perhaps a monthly bill delivered in the mail. To meet these challenges, this thesis uses easily installed non-intrusive sensors coupled with advanced signal processing algorithms to provide a collated corrected picture of consumption and to provide opportunities for fault detection. Specific contributions are made in three areas: Electric motor driven machine fault detection; a motor like an induction machine can serve as its own fine resolution <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> with performance to rival optical shaft encoders <b>and</b> exceeding most <b>torque</b> <b>sensors,</b> all from simple voltage and current signals.

40|$|Abstract. Various {{condition}} monitoring techniques were applied during a laboratory engine test {{in order to}} understand the wear processes occurring and to determine a suitable method which could be applicable to the detection and diagnosis of abnormal engine condition in practice. The goal of the research presented in this study is to monitor the internal combustion engine block. The proposed engine block approach is based on measuring and monitoring the engine operation in variable <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> using Piezoelectric <b>Sensor.</b> However, it normally requires analyzing the obtained signal for providing valuable information. This research involves two main procedures including data collecting as well as data analyzing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a scheme for accommodating faults in the blade pitch, rotor <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> generator <b>torque</b> control <b>sensors</b> of a wind turbine nonlinear system. These measured values are important {{both for the}} controller performance {{as well as the}} supervisory module of the wind turbine. The proposed control accommodation scheme is based on identified nonlinear filters, which can be also exploited to diagnose these faults. In particular, a nonlinear dynamic system estimation scheme is proposed to obtain these disturbance decoupled nonlinear filters, which provide the on–line estimate of the fault signals. The scheme is tested on a high–fidelity wind turbine simulator, in the presence of disturbance and measurement errors, along nominal operating conditions, including also different realistic fault situations. Tests on this simulated model show the the reliability features of the proposed active fault tolerant control scheme...|$|R

30|$|First, it {{is known}} that, when an IC engine is applied for the {{propulsion}} of a vehicle, it may frequently do its regular work in several different working states.

30|$|Dynamic {{characteristics}} of rotate <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> output <b>torque</b> were studied, considering they {{can affect the}} working condition and lifetime of the air-powered vehicle. Rotate speed is determined by output flow which is mainly created by extrusion of piston directly during the moving time, and the flow through hydraulic motor establishes pressure based on the outside mechanical load which determines the output pressure of the hydraulic system and then reflects the output torque. We take the average rotate <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> values during each working process under difference working condition which can directly reflect the dynamic capability of the power system. What’s more, variances of the output rotate <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> are calculated which can reflect the volatility of the dynamic characteristics and greatly affect the lifetime of the power system. In order to illustrate the influence, for the comparison, each parameter changes while other parameters keep constant. Then we get the final results as follows.|$|R
