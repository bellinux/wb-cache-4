Although, the number of existing information <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> methods is enormous, in practice a lot of time, effort and knowledge are invested by organizations in the process of creating new information <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> methods. Surprisingly, the study of literature reveals a lack of sufficient research concerning the process of developing new, or improving existing, information <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> methods. Therefore, in this paper we operate within the paradigm of design science research in order to propose a systematic process for the development of new, or improvement of existing, information <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> methods.

40|$|The <b>management</b> of {{information}} <b>security</b> risk {{is a major}} concern of organizations worldwide. Although the number of existing information <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> methodologies is enormous, in practice a lot of resources are invested by organizations in creating new information <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> methodologies. This is a crucial knowledge-intensive process for organizations, but in most cases it is addressed in an ad hoc manner. We believe that the existence of a systematic approach for the development of new (and the improvement of existing) information <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> methodologies would enhance the effectiveness of the process. In this paper we propose a systematic meta-process for developing new, or improving existing, information <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> methods. We also present our vision for a collaboration and knowledge-sharing platform capable of supporting a virtual intra-organizational cross-disciplinary team, which aims at improving information <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> methodologies by adopting the proposed meta-process. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
