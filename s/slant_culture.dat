The studies showed that the slant extracts were as useful as the culture filtrates and allowed more rapid identification of C. immitis and H. capsulatum. In every case, when an identification was made by conventional morphological methods, the immunological test yielded correlating results. The immunological tests were positive for two isolates that were converted to their yeast forms only after 4 months of study by conventional tests.
