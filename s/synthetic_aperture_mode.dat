40|$|A new {{methodology}} for retrieval of glacier and ice sheet elevations and elevation changes from CryoSat- 2 data is presented. Surface elevations and elevation changes determined using this approach show significant improvements over ESA's publicly available CryoSat- 2 elevation product (L 2 Baseline-B). The results are compared to near-coincident airborne laser altimetry from NASA's Operation IceBridge and seasonal height amplitudes from the Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite (ICESat). Applying this methodology to CryoSat- 2 data collected in interferometric <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>mode</b> (SIN) over the high-relief {{regions of the}} Greenland Ice Sheet we find an improvement in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 27 and 40  % compared to ESA's L 2 product in the derived elevation and elevation changes, respectively. In the interior part of the ice sheet, where CryoSat- 2 operates in low-resolution mode (LRM), we find an improvement in the RMSE of 68 and 55  % in the derived elevation and elevation changes, respectively. There is also an 86  % improvement in {{the magnitude of the}} seasonal amplitudes when compared to amplitudes derived from ICESat data. These results indicate that the new methodology provides improved tracking of the snow/ice surface with lower sensitivity to changes in near-surface dielectric properties. To demonstrate the utility of the new processing methodology we produce elevations, elevation changes, and total volume changes from CryoSat- 2 data for the Greenland Ice Sheet during the period January 2011 to January 2015. We find that the Greenland Ice Sheet decreased in volume at a rate of 289 [*]±[*] 20  km 3 a − 1, with high interannual variability and spatial heterogeneity in rates of loss.

We used Cassini RADAR (<b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar <b>mode)</b> data as the basemap, supplemented by Cassini RADAR microwave emissivity, Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) infrared data, Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) spectral images, and topography derived from <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar (SAR). Mapping {{was done at}} a spatial scale of 300 m/pixel, which corresponds to a map scale of 1 : 800, 000. We describe multiple terrain units and their spatial relations. We describe five broad classes of units that are in agreement with previous mapping efforts: crater, labyrinth, hummocky/mountainous, plains, and dune terrain classes. We subdivide these into seven crater units, four hummocky/mountainous units, six plains units, and three dunes units. Our results show that plains are the dominant unit in Titan’s mid latitudes. Of the plains units, the undifferentiated plains are the largest by total areal extent in the mapped region, accounting for over 45 % of the mapped area. We developed a stratigraphic sequence that has the hummocky/mountainous and labyrinth terrains as the oldest units. The observed properties of the hummocky/mountainous terrain are consistent with fractured water ice materials, while the labyrinth terrains are consistent with organic materials. The youngest units are the dune units and streak-like plains units, with the undifferentiated plains units being of intermediate age. The microwave emissivity of the undifferentiated plains and dune units are consistent with organic materials. Given their properties and stratigraphic placement, we conclude that the hummocky/mountainous terrains are most consistent with the presumed crustal materials of Titan. The plains materials are consistent with deposits resulting from the transport and emplacement of organic-rich materials predominantly by aeolian mechanisms. Our geomorphological mapping {{results are consistent with}} the equatorial and mid-latitudes of Titan being dominated by organic materials that have been deposited and emplaced by aeolian activity...|$|R

By computing RMSE and at multiple spatial scales and for different data combinations, we assessed how, and at which scales, the spatial sampling error, noise, and {{the choice of the}} reference data impact on RMSE and. The results reveal large changes in RMSE and with continental average values of 8 % and 18 % for the RMSE of relative soil moisture saturation and between 0. 4 and 0. 7 for depending on the spatial scale of aggregation and the choice of reference data. The combined effect of noise and spatial sampling error accounted for a 79 % RMSE increase at 1 km and predominated over the error due to the choise of the reference data also at 5 km scale. The effect of noise on RMSE strongly diminished at spatial scales. By con-trast, the impact of uncertainties in the reference data was larger on than on RMSE. This highlights the better potential of to estimate the benefit of observations prior to data assimilation. Based on our results, it is further suggested that a potential way for an improved ASAR GM SSM error assessment is to: 1) aggregate the data to resolution to minimize the noise; 2) subtract the spatial sampling error within the coarse resolution footprint; and 3) remove the reference uncertainty using advanced techniques such as triple collocation.

40|$|Range cell {{migration}} {{has a serious}} impact on the precision of image formation, especially for high-resolution and large-scale imaging. To get the full resolution and high quality of the image, the range {{cell migration}} correction in the azimuth time domain must be considered. For tackling this problem, this paper presents a novel and efficient range cell migration correction method based on curve fitting and signal processing. By emulating a curve to approximate the range-compressed echo of a strong point, the range location indexes of the strong point along the azimuth direction can be obtained under the least squares criterion. The merits of the proposed method are twofold: (1) the proposed method is robust to the uncertainty of system parameters (strong tolerance) under real flights and (2) the generalization of the proposed method is better and can be easily adapted to different <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR) <b>modes</b> (e. g., monostatic and bistatic).

Scenes with bare ground or with dry snow cover showed highest backscattering, with averages from 210 to 212 dB. Wet snow showed a shift towards lower values, peaking at 215 dB. A threshold of 213 to 214 dB was identified between dry/bare ground and wet snow scenes at Crater Lake. The backscatter difference to a reference snow-free scene usually provided better classification results, and a threshold ranging from 22 to 23 dB was found. Results show that, despite the relative ease of use of C-band ASAR, special care is necessary since the results show significant noise, and it should only be applied to large areas. Large seasonal patterns of snow melt were identified on Deception Island. Seasonal snow cover {{is one of the most}} important components of Earth’s cryosphere and is a funda...|$|R
40|$|Improving the {{accuracy}} of the marine gravity field requires both improved altimeter range precision and dense track coverage. After a hiatus of more than 15 years, a wealth of suitable data is now available from the CryoSat- 2, Envisat, and Jason- 1 satellites. The range precision of these data is significantly improved with respect to the conventional techniques used in operational oceanography by retracking the altimeter waveforms using an algorithm that is optimized for range precision {{at the expense of other}} parameters such as significant wave height. In addition, CryoSat- 2 has a new <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR) <b>mode</b> that provides a more complex waveform shape that should result in higher range precision. For this new mode we derived a simple, but approximate, analytic model for the shape of the SAR waveform that can be used in an iterative least-squares algorithm for estimating range. For the conventional waveforms, we demonstrate that a two-pass retracking algorithm that was originally designed for data from prior missions (ERS- 1 and Geosat) also improves precision on all three of the new satellites by about a factor of 1. 5. The improved range precision and dense coverage from CryoSat- 2, Envisat, and Jason- 1 should lead to a significant increase in {{the accuracy}} of the marine gravity field. ...|$|R
