25|$|The autumn passed, and winter, too, and as {{the first}} green began to show in the hickory and oak along the Housatonic, Lillinonah bedecked herself with the wild flowers of the forest as she waited in happy {{anticipation}} for her lover's return. But summer came and went, the reds and yellows of autumn showed bright on the trees, and still the young Englishman had not {{come back to the}} land of the Pootatucks. Lillinonah no longer sang a joyous song. There were no more flowers in her hair. Wan and listless, <b>she</b> <b>wandered</b> through the woods, her eyes red-rimmed from weeping, searching and hoping against hope that she had not been forgotten.|$|E

500|$|The final part of {{the book}} {{continues}} the story from when Olivero and Sally disappear under the water. A large bubble forms around them, transporting them to the centre of the pool and ascending into a large grotto, from where they proceed on foot through a series of adjoining caverns. Sally tells Olivero that this is the country she and her brother left 30years ago. Soon they encounter her people, to whom Sally, or Siloēn as she is properly known, explains that many years ago <b>she</b> <b>wandered</b> off and became lost, but that she has now returned with one who [...] "was lost too, and now wishes to dwell among us". Olivero and Siloēn are welcomed into the community, where life is ordered around a progression from lower to upper ledges: the first ledge teaches the pleasures of youth; on the second ledge the pleasure of manual work is learned; on the third of opinion and argument; and finally, on the upper ledge, the [...] "highest pleasure", of solitary thought.|$|E

2500|$|<b>She</b> <b>wandered</b> {{the streets}} of Leadville, rags on her feet, wearing a cross, and {{came to be known}} as a madwoman. Some who had been acquainted with her earlier thought she {{deserved}} to suffer for having broken up the marriage between Horace and Augusta, and believed that she had been the cause of his ruin. At that time, Leadville had lost much of its boomtown population and was becoming a ghost-town. She often walked the empty streets at night, dressed in a mixture of women's and men's clothing, wearing trousers and mining boots. She protected the mine from strangers with a shot-gun, and [...] "she became a sad spectre of Baby Doe to old-timers; a spectacle to the young." ...|$|E
2500|$|Butler’s field {{research}} in Maryland also influenced her writing of Kindred. She {{traveled to the}} Eastern Shore to Talbot County where <b>she</b> <b>wandered</b> a bit with little money and spent some time at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore and the Maryland Historical Society. She also went {{on a tour of}} Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington. This was the closest she could get to a plantation. On this tour, guides referred to the slaves as [...] "servants" [...] and avoided referring {{to the fact that the}} visitors were touring an old slave plantation. Butler also spent time reading emancipatory narratives, one of them being the slave narrative of Fredrick Douglass. Some of the facts she learned from these narratives were so grim that she realized that, in order to get people to read Kindred, she could not come close to presenting slavery as it was but had to clean it up.|$|E
2500|$|Once Io {{was given}} to Hera, she tied her to a tree and sent her servant Argus to keep Io {{separated}} from Zeus. [...] Argus was a loyal servant to Hera and he has immense strength and one hundred eyes all over his body. It {{was not possible to}} go past Argus since he never closed more than half his eyes at any time. Zeus was afraid of Hera's wrath could not personally intervene, so to save Io, he commanded Hermes to kill Argus, which he does by lulling all one hundred eyes into eternal sleep. In Ovid's interpolation, when Hera learned of Argus' death, she took his eyes and placed them in the plumage of the peacock, her favorite animal, accounting for the eye pattern in its tail and making it the vainest of all animals. Hera, furious about Io being free and the death of Argus, sent a gadfly (Greek oistros, compare oestrus) to sting Io as <b>she</b> <b>wandered</b> the earth. [...] Eventually Io made it to Egypt, the Egyptians worshiped the snow-white heifer and named her the Egyptian goddess Isis. [...] Hera permitted Zeus to change Io back into her human form, under the condition that he never look at her again. [...] Io, the goddess-queen of Egypt, then bore Zeus' son as the next King.|$|E

2500|$|Next Dann {{drove the}} {{children}} {{back to their}} home and offered them some arsenic-poisoned milk, but the boys spat it out because it tasted strange to them. Once at their home, she lured them downstairs and used gasoline to {{set fire to the}} house, trapping their mother and the two children in the basement (they managed to escape). [...] She drove three and a half blocks to the Hubbard Woods Elementary School with three handguns in her possession. <b>She</b> <b>wandered</b> into a second grade classroom for a short while, then left. Finding a boy in the corridor, Dann pushed him into the boys' washroom and shot him with a [...]22 semi-automatic Beretta pistol. Her Smith & Wesson [...]357 Magnum revolver jammed when she tried to fire it at two other boys, and she threw it into the trash along with the spare ammunition. The boys ran out of the washroom and raised the alarm. Dann then re-entered the second grade classroom where students were working in groups on a bicycle safety test. She ordered all the children into the corner of the room. The teacher refused and attempted to disarm Dann, managing to unload the Beretta in the struggle. Dann drew a [...]32 Smith & Wesson from the waistband of her shorts and aimed it at several groups of the students. She shot five children, killing eight-year-old Nicholas Corwin and wounding two girls and two boys before fleeing in her car.|$|E
