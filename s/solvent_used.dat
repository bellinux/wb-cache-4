40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{contribution}} of <b>solvent</b> <b>use</b> and road traffic to the total NMVOC emissions in Germany, the NMVOC composition of the city air of Wuppertal was investigated. During three campaigns NMVOC concentrations were measured at different locations {{in the city of}} Wuppertal. The measurements covered volatile hydrocarbons in the range of C 3 -C 10 and oxygenated compounds such as alcohols, ketones and esters. An assessment of the contribution from different emission sources to the observed NMVOC concentrations was attempted with the Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) modelling technique. Two emission source categories were investigated, namely road traffic and <b>solvent</b> <b>use.</b> Emission profiles for traffic were obtained from measurements performed in a traffic tunnel, at a down-town street intersection and during drives through the city and on free-ways. Solvent emission profiles were investigated in the vicinity of different solvent factories and workshops in Wuppertal. Apportionment analysis was performed for several receptor points located down-wind from the city centre, in residential areas, in dense traffic areas and in industrial areas. The outcomes of the CMB analysis with the application of source profiles and receptor concentrations obtained from the city measurements showed that traffic emission rather than <b>solvent</b> <b>use</b> determines the ambient NMVOC composition. The maximal contribution of <b>solvent</b> <b>use</b> to the NMVOC emission estimated on the basis of experimentally obtained results amounts to about 23 % in the whole city area of Wuppertal. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the contribution of <b>solvent</b> <b>use</b> to the NMVOC concentrations in German cities falls in the range of a few to about 20 %, provided that Wuppertal can be considered as a typical German urban area with certain proportions of domestic activities, traffic and various industries. The present work clearly shows that the experimentally observed proportions between traffic and <b>solvent</b> <b>use</b> emissions are in strong disagreement with the German Emission Inventory which states, that at present (reference year 2000) about 62 % of the total NMVOC emissions originate from <b>solvent</b> <b>use</b> and only 18 % from road traffic...|$|R

25|$|Anecdotal {{claims for}} an {{antimicrobial}} effect {{are based on}} abstract scientific experiments which show some antimicrobial activity in commercial grapefruit seed extracts and ethanol grapefruit seed extract but not natural GSE. The preliminary studies for the antimicrobial effect state that the Citricidal commercial brand of GSE was used for testing. There is considerable scientific evidence that the anti-microbial activity associated with grapefruit seed extract {{can be attributed to}} the contamination or adulteration of commercial GSE preparations with synthetic antimicrobials or preservatives. According to a 2001 study, branded commercial GSE preparations were contaminated with synthetic benzethonium chloride that was unlikely to have been made from grapefruit seeds. Some of the marketers claimed that their product did not contain benzethonium chloride and the error was due to the similarity in molecular weight of the quaternary ammonium compound which was formed through a proprietary manufacturing process. It is highly improbable that the preservative benzethonium chloride is formed during any extraction and/or processing of grapefruit seeds and pulp. Researchers conclusively demonstrated the presence of benzethonium chloride in commercial GSE using various analytical methods including HPLC, one- and two-dimensional NMR, PIXE analysis, and electrospray ionization MS. Another in vitro study claimed GSE had antibacterial properties. As with the branded in vitro test this extract was contaminated. The ethanolic grapefruit seed and pulp extract tested was prepared or contaminated with ethanol, a chemical <b>solvent</b> <b>used</b> in the extraction process. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is effective in inhibiting bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Solvent {{abuse is}} a {{particularly}} serious issue affecting Aboriginal people. Here we examine the association between <b>solvent</b> <b>use</b> and socio-demographic variables, drug-related risk factors, and pathogen prevalence in Aboriginal injection drug users (IDU) in Manitoba, Canada. Methods Data originated from a cross-sectional survey of IDU from December 2003 to September 2004. Associations between <b>solvent</b> <b>use</b> and variables of interest were assessed by multiple logistic regression. Results A total of 266 Aboriginal IDU {{were included in the}} analysis of which 44 self-reported recent <b>solvent</b> <b>use.</b> Hepatitis C infection was 81 % in solvent-users, compared to 55 % in those reporting no <b>solvent</b> <b>use.</b> In multivariable models, solvent-users were younger and more likely to be infected with hepatitis C (AOR: 3. 5; 95 %CI: 1. 3, 14. 7), to have shared needles {{in the last six months}} (AOR: 2. 6; 95 %CI: 1. 0, 6. 8), and to have injected talwin & Ritalin (AOR: 10. 0; 95 %CI: 3. 8, 26. 3). Interpretation High hepatitis C prevalence, even after controlling for risky injection practices, suggests that solvent users may form closed networks of higher risk even amongst an already high-risk IDU population. Understanding the social-epidemiological context of initiation and maintenance of <b>solvent</b> <b>use</b> is necessary to address the inherent inequalities encountered by this subpopulation of substance users, and may inform prevention strategies for other marginalized populations. </p...|$|R

500|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of ion-exchange {{separation}} technology in the 1950s, samarium had no commercial uses in pure form. However, a by-product of the fractional crystallization purification of neodymium {{was a mixture of}} samarium and gadolinium that acquired the name of [...] "Lindsay Mix" [...] after the company that made it. This material is thought to have been used for nuclear control rods in some early nuclear reactors. Nowadays, a similar commodity product has the name [...] "samarium-europium-gadolinium" [...] (SEG) concentrate. It is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed lanthanides isolated from bastnäsite (or monazite). Since the heavier lanthanides have the greater affinity for the <b>solvent</b> <b>used,</b> they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent. Not all rare-earth producers who process bastnäsite do so on a large enough scale to continue onward with the separation of the components of SEG, which typically makes up only one or two percent of the original ore. Such producers will therefore be making SEG with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors. In this manner, the valuable europium content of the ore is rescued for use in phosphor manufacture. Samarium purification follows the removal of the europium. , being in oversupply, samarium oxide is less expensive on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest.|$|E

2500|$|The {{chemical}} shift provides {{information about the}} structure of the molecule. [...] The conversion of the raw data to this information is called assigning the spectrum. [...] For example, for the 1H-NMR spectrum for ethanol (CH3CH2OH), one would expect signals at each of three specific {{chemical shift}}s: one for the CH3 group, one for the CH2 group and one for the OH group. A typical CH3 group has a shift around 1 ppm, a CH2 attached to an OH has a shift of around 4 ppm and an OH has a shift anywhere from 2–6 ppm depending on the <b>solvent</b> <b>used</b> and the amount of hydrogen bonding. While the O atom does draw electron density away from the attached H through their mutual sigma bond, the electron lone pairs on the O bathe the H in their shielding effect.|$|E

2500|$|A solvent (from the Latin , [...] "loosen, untie, solve") is a {{substance}} that dissolves a solute (a chemically distinct liquid, solid or gas), resulting in a solution. A solvent is usually a liquid but {{can also be a}} solid, a gas, or a supercritical fluid. The quantity of solute that can dissolve in a specific volume of solvent varies with temperature. Common uses for organic solvents are in dry cleaning (e.g. tetrachloroethylene), as paint thinners (e.g. toluene, turpentine), as nail polish removers and glue solvents (acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate), in spot removers (e.g. hexane, petrol ether), in detergents (citrus terpenes) and in perfumes (ethanol). Water is a solvent for polar molecules and the most common <b>solvent</b> <b>used</b> by living things; all the ions and proteins in a cell are dissolved in water within a cell. Solvents find various applications in chemical, pharmaceutical, oil, and gas industries, including in chemical syntheses and purification processes.|$|E
