500|$|... "Bart Gets Famous" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder. The episode mocks the use of catchphrase-based humor. Many {{characters}} from The Simpsons have catchphrases, including Homer ("D'oh!"), Bart ("Eat My Shorts", [...] "¡Ay, caramba!" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow, man!"), Marge (her worried [...] "hmmmm") and Maggie (her pacifier suck). The writers chose the phrase [...] "I didn't do it" [...] because they wanted a [...] "lousy" [...] phrase [...] "to point out how really crummy things can become really popular". It was also an intentional call {{back to the first}} season episode [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] where it was a catchphrase of Krusty the Clown. The episode ends with a self-referential scene in which several characters say their catchphrases, including the Simpsons, Ned Flanders, Nelson Muntz, Mr. Burns and Barney Gumble. All of the characters gather around Lisa and <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with an anticipating look, and Lisa, displeased, finishes the episode by muttering [...] "If anyone wants me I'll be in my room", to which Homer says [...] "what kind of a catchphrase is that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Skírnir {{declares}} that when Gerðr comes out {{she will be}} a spectacle; Hrímgrímnir will [...] "glare" [...] at her, [...] "everything" [...] will <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> she will become more famous than the watchman of the gods, and that she will [...] "gape through the bars". Gerðr will experience [...] "madness and howling, tearing affliction and unbearable desire" [...] and that, in grief, tears will flow from her. Skírnir tells Gerðr to sit down, for her fate will be even worse yet. She will be harassed by fiends all her weary days. From the court of jötnar to {{the halls of the}} hrimthurs, Gerðr shall everyday crawl without choice, nor hope of choice. Gerðr will weep rather than feel joy, suffering tearfully. She will live {{the rest of her life}} in misery with a three-headed thurs or otherwise be without a man altogether. Skírnir commands for Gerðr's mind to be seized, that she may waste away with pining, and that she be as the thistle at the end of the harvest; crushed.|$|E
500|$|At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign {{she belonged}} to Kappa Kappa Gamma {{sorority}} where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, [...] "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular {{with men and}} with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E

500|$|The music video's storyline depicts Azalea's biographical {{journey from}} {{life on the}} streets to Hollywood. According to Natasha Stagg of American {{magazine}} V, the plot involves Azalea rising from [...] "trailer park standby to high-class Hollywood-ite {{in a matter of}} minutes". The music video opens with Azalea confidently walking on a deserted highway situated in a desert environment. Azalea's costume includes dark red lipstick, red-soled vertiginous Louboutins, a powder blue Givenchy bag, a tropical print brassiere and shorts. The scene is intercepted with visuals of burning shoes and wheels. Azalea then walks through a trailer park community where several locals <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as she passes by. Upon the beginning of the song's chorus, the video transcends into a playground scene where Azalea dances in an evening setting, with a fire-lit swing as her backdrop. In this segment, she wears a grey crop top and red slim-fit pants, with her hair styled in a bun. The next scene involves Azalea performing in a dance-off with her two female friends in front of a Freightliner Truck. Azalea sports a plum-coloured fur coat over a white mesh swimsuit. In the segment, the three engage in twerking and hair flicking actions.|$|E
500|$|Ivy {{appeared}} {{several times}} in GameDaily's [...] "Babe of the Week" [...] series of articles, including as a stand-alone article and at eleventh place in their [...] "Top 50 Hottest Game Babes" [...] article. They later named her amongst other female characters in the Soul series {{as an example of}} a strong and iconic female character in video gaming. The New York Times felt her appearance came from the same [...] "Goth cyberaesthetic [...] that gave us The Matrix", one they felt was already becoming outdated. UGO.com ranked her eighteenth in their [...] "Top 50 Videogame Hotties" [...] article, stating [...] "However much she instills fear in our hearts, we revel in the opportunity to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from the safety of our television sets." [...] In later articles, they named her one of the top eleven girls of gaming at number ten and one of the top eleven video game heroines at number eight, stating [...] "What can you say about a chick that carries a whip? If you're talking about Ivy from the Soul Calibur series, you could say she's pretty intimidating." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post disliked Stevens' wig, writing: [...] "Izzie's wig looked horrible. She {{looked exactly}} like her mother Robbie and that's not a compliment. I loved Cristina's Stepford wife joke and how everyone, {{including}} Derek, couldn't help but <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hair. Yet, no one had the balls to tell her it was bad." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: [...] "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." [...] He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: [...] "I laughed when Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because you knew that she didn't {{know what she was}} doing." [...] Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: [...] "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. I understand that she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people that they were being cut, but it made Derek look really chivalrous." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the song's chorus, Gomez {{appears in}} front of a mirror while <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own {{reflection}} and the main view. The following scenes [...] "dramatic shots of bullets and blood-dripped flowers flash across the frame." [...] As noted by Ryan Reed from Rolling Stone. Later, Gomez is shown surrounded by flashes of cameras in a garden as background. The video also features several dancers performing interpretive moves, and later [...] "Gomez begins to shed layers of her clothing, at one point wearing just a corset and underwear." [...] Billboard Staff called it [...] "artful", while Ryan Reed of Rolling Stone named it [...] "dramatic". Gabriella Salkin of V went on to call it [...] "intimate and sultry." [...] While some critics praised its simplicity and meaning in contrast with the song's theme.|$|E
2500|$|In the January 1989 Elo rating list, {{at the age}} of 12, she {{was rated}} 2555, which was number 55 in the world and 35 rating points ahead of the Women's World Champion Maia Chiburdanidze. In the 6 months since the {{previous}} list, she had gained a remarkable 190 rating points. Judit's quiet and modest demeanour at the board contrasted with the intensity of her playing style. David Norwood, British GM, in recalling Judit beating him when he was an established player and she was just a child, described her as [...] "this cute little auburn-haired monster who crushed you". British journalist Dominic Lawson wrote about 12-year-old Judit's [...] "killer" [...] eyes and how she would <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> opponent: [...] "The irises are so grey so dark they are almost indistinguishable from the pupils. Set against her long red hair, the effect is striking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Catherine also {{received}} Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (formerly court painter to Marie Antoinette) at her Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by {{whom she was}} painted shortly before her death. Madame Vigée Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: I could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hazel Grace Lancaster—a 16-year-old {{with cancer}} that {{has spread to}} her lungs—attends a cancer patient support group at her mother's behest. At first she hesitates because she feels like it has done her nothing. She thinks {{attending}} the support group could be {{the worst part of}} her life, until a particular support meeting, Hazel meets a 17-year-old boy named Augustus Waters, whose osteosarcoma caused him to lose his right leg, which was replaced with a prosthetic. On catching Augustus <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> Hazel feels weird. They meet after the Support Group and converse on {{the fact that they were}} not [...] "literally" [...] in the heart of Jesus, but in a basement. When everything seems to go well, Augustus pulls out a cigarette and puts it between his lips. Hazel is disgusted by this and yells at him saying that he's already got cancer and he wants to pay money for more cancer, [...] "Not being able to breathe sucks," [...] she yells. Augustus calmly explains the metaphor, which is, [...] "You put the thing that kills you right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to kill you." [...] Hazel, impressed by this, goes to his place to watch a movie. Augustus is at the meeting to support his friend, Isaac, whose only remaining eye is soon to be removed due to cancer. Hazel and Augustus strike a bond immediately and agree to read each other's favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel written by Peter Van Houten, who lives in Amsterdam, about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience. After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion. Hazel explains the novel's author had retreated following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E
