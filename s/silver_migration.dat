The silver bridge may be interrupted by thermal expansion of the package; thus, disappearance of the shorting when the chip is heated and its reappearance after cooling is an indication of this problem.

40|$|Many animals perform long-distance migrations {{in order}} to {{maximize}} lifetime reproductive success. The European eel migrates several thousand kilometers between their feeding habitats in continental waters (fresh-,brackish, and sea water) and their spawning area in the Sargasso Sea. Eels residing in freshwaters usually initiate their spawning <b>migration</b> as <b>silver</b> eels during autumn, triggered by diverse environmental cues. We analyzed the time series of <b>silver</b> eel downstream <b>migration</b> in Burrishoole, Ireland (1971 – 2015), and Imsa, Norway (1975 – 2015), to examine factors regulating the <b>silver</b> eel <b>migration</b> from freshwater to the sea. The migration season (90 % of the run) generally lasted from 1 August to 30 November. Environmental factors acting in the months before migration impacted timing and duration of migration, likely through influencing the internal processes preparing the fish for migration. Once the migration had started, environmental factors impacted the day-to-day variation in number of migrants, apparently stimulating migration among those eels ready for migration. Both the day-to-day variation in the number of migrants and the onset of migration were described by nearly identical models in the two rivers. Variables explaining day-to-day variation were all associated with conditions that may minimize predation risk; number of migrants was reduced under a strong moon and short nights and increased during high and increasing water levels. Presence of other migrants stimulated migration, which further indicates that <b>silver</b> eel <b>migration</b> has evolved to minimize predation risk. The onset of migration was explained mainly by water levels in August. The models for duration of the migration season were less similar between the sites. Thus, the overall migration season seems governed by the need to reach the spawning areas in a synchronized manner, while during the actual seaward migration, antipredator behavior seems of overriding importance.

30|$|It can be concluded, that silver is not {{suitable}} as interconnect at the intermediate {{temperature in the}} long-term SOFC application {{if there is a}} risk of exposure to the dual atmosphere. <b>Silver</b> <b>migration</b> was also responsible for short-circuit formation.|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} migration {{of silver and}} condensation across the SDC layer is unclear. It is unlikely that thermal effect alone is responsible for Ag migration to SDC. The temperature distribution along the cell was relatively uniform and silver deposited in the SDC layer was observed only at the cell inlet (the most active part of the cell). <b>Silver</b> <b>migration</b> could {{be a result of}} electromigration [6] or it can be associated with the formation of Ag (g) species and vapour transport to the cathode–electrolyte face followed by reduction to metal phase [11]. Ag (g) has higher vapour pressure than Ag 2 O (g) at the SOFC operation temperature. Therefore, it is thought Ag (g) formation and penetration in SDC are possible for this mechanism. However, electromigration and evaporation/deposition of silver are too slow to be alone directly responsible for the observed rate of <b>silver</b> <b>migration</b> during the electrode polarisation [37]. Mosialek et al. [16] observed <b>silver</b> <b>migration</b> on the YSZ electrolyte in the potential range −[*] 0.2 – 0.5  V; no migration was observed without polarisation. In addition, no migration was observed without the electrolyte. They concluded that for the formation of silver dendrites, it is necessary to have a potential difference between the cathode (with Ag) and the oxygen ion conductor. Therefore, <b>silver</b> <b>migration</b> is not correlated directly with current density. Similar results were reported for the GDC electrolyte [37]. The mechanism responsible for silver mass transport is difficult to distinguish. <b>Silver</b> <b>migration</b> is possibly related to electron transfer and oxygen flux. The flow of electrons can promote silver electromigration. This can explain the agglomeration of silver at the edge of electrolyte since electrolyte can conduct only ions. The short 1 – 2  h OCV break in the cell power generation affected the performance of tested cells. Rapid cell degradation was often seen directly after OCV. Since the OCV state is not conductive for thermal or electromigration of silver [35], the cathode polarisation must promote <b>silver</b> <b>migration.</b> Moving from one state (including OCV) of operation to another could affect cell performance. The process of cell passivation/activation resulted in the difference in temperature distribution along and across the cell and could result in some microcrack formation in the electrolyte. Also, the risk of coke deposition on the anode during OCV was significant because no steam was formed from fuel electrooxidation and only 60 – 70 % of fuel was converted on the CPOX catalyst [28]. Formed coke and temperature gradient may also result in microcracks formation in the electrolyte structure. However, SEM scans did not confirm electrolyte cracks. Simner et al. [11] observed that fresh cell was not affected by holding it under OCV. This confirms our result that short-circuit occurs directly after a short OCV break in the cell operation if the cell was in operation for several hours. Another possible explanation is that during OCV period (no current flow through electrodes), silver deposited in the SDC layer was saturated with oxygen. This oxygen was reduced after the cell returned to the operation mode with the flow of electrons. According to Simner et al. [11], during OCV, {{it is possible that the}} formation of oxygen-containing species can block the oxygen charge transport.|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{microelectronics}} utilizes conductive pastes {{to interconnect}} different discrete devices {{on a common}} substrate, which is usually Alumina. Silver Palladium (Ag-Pd) alloy is widely used as the metal inclusion component in conductive pastes. Positive characteristics of Ag include low cost and low sheet resistivity. However, Ag migration in un-desired areas is its major drawback. Anodic dissolution rate of Ag can reach 10 - 1 A/cm 2 that corresponds to a catastrophic removal rate of 35. 6 nm/s [5]. <b>Silver</b> <b>migration</b> can be classified as electromigration and ionic migration depending upon the environmental conditions of occurrence.

40|$|ABSTRACT Migration of {{nanomaterials}} {{from food}} containers into {{food is a}} matter of concern because of the potential risk for exposed consumers. The aims of this study were to evaluate <b>silver</b> <b>migration</b> from a commercially available food packaging containing silver nanoparticles into a real food matrix (chicken meat) under plausible domestic storage conditions and to test the contribution of such packaging to limit food spoilage bacteria proliferation. Chemical analysis revealed the absence of silver in chicken meatballs under the experimental conditions in compliance with current European Union legislation, which establishes a maximum level of 0. 010 mg kg– 1 for the migration of non-authorised substances through a functional barrier (Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10 / 2011). On the other hand, microbiological tests (total microbial count, Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae) showed no relevant difference in the tested bacteria levels between meatballs stored in silver-nanoparticle plastic bags or control bags.

40|$|Background. A water {{filtered}} by jug filter system (JFS) can {{be applied}} for the preparation of food products, {{as well as it}} can be directly consumed as drinking water. In the European Union, in both above-mentioned cases the quality of water filtered using JFSs has to fulfill the requirements listed in Directive 98 / 83 /EC. However, Directive 98 / 83 /EC sets no parametric value for silver, JFSs are not regulated under this legislative act and additionally, silver-modified activated carbon (applied in such systems) has not been approved by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Therefore, the exposure to this metal should be assessed for all JFSs containing filtration cartridges with silver-modified activated carbon, present on the retail market. Objective. A comprehensive study was conducted in order to examine the effect of JFSs (consisted of filtration oval-cartridges of the new type with silver-modified activated carbon) on the quality of filtered water regarding the released amounts of silver. <b>Silver</b> <b>migration</b> from such type of cartridges has not been examined before.

Silver release was investigated at temperatures in the 20 - 70 °C range using contact times of up to 10 days. Migration of silver from the food box was in all cases 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than that observed for the baby bottle, although the total silver content in the original box material was half of that found in the baby bottle. As expected, for both food containers, <b>silver</b> <b>migration</b> depended on both {{the nature of the}} tested solution and the applied conditions. The highest release was observed for 3 % acetic acid at 70 °C for 2 h, corresponding to 62 ng dm and 1887 ng dm of silver for the baby bottle and the food box, respectively. Single particle-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICPMS) was used to characterise and quantify AgNPs in the food simulants extracts. Sample preparation was optimized to preserve AgNPs integrity. The experimental parameters affecting AgNPs detection, sizing and quantification by SP-ICPMS were also optimised. Analyses of water and acidic extracts revealed the presence of both dissolved silver and AgNPs. Small AgNPs (in the 18 - 30 nm range) and particle number concentrations within the 4 - 1510 10 L range were detected, corresponding to only 0. 1 - 8. 6 % of the total silver released from these materials.
