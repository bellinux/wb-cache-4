500|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> {{touch with}} book {{publisher}} Judith Regan {{who agreed to}} help her publish the book after a brief phone call, without first receiving {{a draft of the}} work. In an interview with Los Angeles Magazine, Dickinson recalled the process of pitching her book to Regan: [...] "I got a book deal without even turning in one shred of a writing sample. I was having an invincible moment. I told her how difficult it was for me growing up with an abusive father, how when I went to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.' Judith said, 'Okay, I'm in.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|His mother, Alexandra, {{was seven}} months' {{pregnant}} {{with him when}} while she was out with friends, she jumped into a boat, falling as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>in.</b> The next day, she collapsed {{in the middle of}} a ball from violent labour pains brought on by the previous day's activities; Dmitri was born in the hours following the accident. Alexandra slipped into a coma from which she never emerged. Although doctors had no hope for Dmitri's survival, he still lived, with the help of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, who gave the premature Dmitri the baths that were prescribed by the doctors, wrapped him in cotton wool and kept him in a cradle filled with hot water bottles to keep his temperature regulated. [...] "I am enjoying raising Dmitri," [...] Sergei wrote in his diary. Alexandra died shortly after Dmitri's birth. She was only 21, and the cause was almost certainly preeclampsia.|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the grand}} jury {{evidence}} pointed to a possible motive for Brawley's falsifying the incident: trying to avoid violent punishment from her mother and her stepfather, Ralph King. Witnesses testified that Glenda Brawley had previously beaten her daughter for running away and for spending nights with boys. King had a history of violence that included stabbing his first wife 14 times, later shooting and killing her. There was considerable evidence that King could and would violently attack Brawley: when Brawley had been arrested on a shoplifting charge the previous May, King attempted to beat her for the offense while at the police station. Witnesses also described King as having talked about his stepdaughter in a sexualized manner. On the day of her alleged disappearance, Brawley had skipped school to visit her boyfriend, Todd Buxton, who was serving a six-month jail sentence. When Buxton's mother (with whom she had visited Buxton in jail) urged her to get home before <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> trouble, Brawley told her, [...] "I'm already in trouble." [...] She described how angry King was over a previous incident of her staying out late.|$|E
2500|$|Evert won 46 {{straight}} {{matches and}} 12 tournaments, which started February 21, 1971 {{and went through}} till the semi-finals of the 1971 US Open. In those semifinals, Evert lost to Billie Jean King, which in the first service game for her <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> a love 40 hole, but was able to win five straight points to take the game, but Evert's demeanor would quickly change with a bad baseline call. This allowed King {{to take charge of}} the set and win the next four games in a row from 23 games advantage to Evert, which Evert's serve got broken by King in the seventh and ninth games, and the first set was hers 36 losing only nine points in the four games. During the second set, King would hit a drop shot winner and from that point onwards Evert lost her games flow pattern and poise, and started hitting errant shots outside of the court. This match was played before a sellout crowd of 13,500 fans in attendance, which included then-Vice-President Spiro Agnew, which King said to Evert {{at the end of her}} first lost in a Grand Slam that [...] "Don't let it bother you Chris. You've got your whole life ahead of you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The AMA {{temporarily}} {{lost track}} of Swango, who managed {{to find a place}} in the psychiatric residency program at the State University of New York at Stony Brook School of Medicine. His first rotation was in the internal medicine department at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northport, New York. Once again his patients began dying for no explicable reason. Four months later, Kristin Kinney committed suicide, and arsenic was found in her body {{at the time of her}} death. Her mother, Sharon Cooper, was horrified to find out a person with Swango's history could be allowed to practice medicine. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> touch with a friend of Kinney who was a nurse at Sanford. The nurse alerted Sanford's dean, Robert Talley, to Swango's whereabouts. Talley telephoned the dean at Stony Brook, Jordan Cohen. Under intense questioning from the head of Stony Brook's psychiatry department, Alan Miller, Swango admitted he had lied about his poisoning conviction in Illinois. He was immediately fired. [...] The public outcry resulted in Cohen and Miller being forced to resign before the end of the year. Before he resigned, Cohen sent a warning about Swango to all 125 medical schools and all 1,000 teaching hospitals across the nation, effectively blacklisting Swango from getting a medical residency in the United States.|$|E
