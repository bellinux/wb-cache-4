The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song.

The chorus, reminiscent of other pop productions by Max Martin, has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats. After the second chorus, the beats drop and Spears speaks the lines in the hook. This is followed by a dubstep-influenced breakdown, which lasts about thirty seconds. Spears moans, blows kisses and sings the lines [...] "Gimme <b>something</b> <b>good,</b> don't wanna wait I want it now / Pop it like a hood and show me how you work it out." [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] continues with a second breakdown, which is more similar {{to the sound of the}} track.
