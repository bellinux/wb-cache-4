25|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft, designated N.T.2B, was a single-engined pusher biplane, with unequal span two-bay {{wings and}} {{powered by a}} 160hp (119kW) Beardmore 160 hp engine mounted between the wings driving a four-bladed propeller. The trainee pilot and instructor <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> in an enclosed cockpit, fitted with dual controls.|$|E
25|$|AGO's design, the Ao 192, was a low-winged {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction. Its monocoque fuselage accommodated {{a crew of}} two {{pilots who}} <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> in an enclosed flight deck, while there were seats for five passengers in a separate cabin. It was powered by two 179kW (240hp) Argus As 10 and had a retractable tailwheel undercarriage.|$|E

25|$|The Don was {{designed}} to meet Air Ministry Specification T.6/36 for a multi-role trainer and was a single-engined monoplane of wooden stressed-skin construction. The DH.93 Don {{was intended to be}} a trainer for pilots and radio operators, and as a gunnery trainer, the gunnery requirement involved the mounting of a dorsal gun turret. Student pilot and instructor <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> up front, while accommodation for a trainee WT (radio) operator and the turret gunner was behind in the cabin.|$|E
25|$|The Ship 1 {{prototype}} registration NX41860 had an open cockpit, {{an enclosed}} fuselage for the Franklin piston engine, and fixed three-wheel landing gear. The engine drove a two-bladed main rotor and a two-bladed anti-torque tail rotor. The prototype crashed in September 1943 and was subsequently modified with several improvements, including an enclosed cabin {{for the pilot}} and passenger, who <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> in the cockpit. With all the lessons learned, the third prototype {{became the basis for}} the production model, the Bell Model 47. The Model 30 Ship 1A, Genevieve, is now on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessors, the V3's body {{consisted}} of welded steel tubing covered with treated fabric to save weight and make repairs easier. Its interior {{was divided into}} four sections— the cockpit, where pilot and observer <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side,</b> with the pilot on the left; the load compartment; the engine compartment; and the tail section. The engine and gearbox were centrally mounted and {{held in place by}} a series of tensioned steel cables, with the gearbox in front of the engine. Two steel tube outriggers extended out from the sides of the fuselage to carry the twin rotors, of three-bladed configuration and wooden construction with a steel spar, which were mounted 12.5m (41ft 0in) apart, far enough that they did not overlap.|$|E
60|$|She took my hand, {{and led me}} to the sofa. We <b>sat</b> down, <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side.</b> Her {{face was}} {{composed}} to a sad tranquillity. She was quiet; she was herself again.|$|R

25|$|The Whitley had {{a crew of}} five: a pilot, co-pilot/navigator, a bomb aimer, a {{wireless}} operator, and a rear gunner. The pilot and second pilot/navigator <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> in the cockpit, with the wireless operator further back. The navigator rotated to use the chart table behind him. The bomb aimer position was in the nose with a gun turret located directly above. The fuselage aft of the wireless operator was divided horizontally by the bomb bay; behind the bomb bay was the main entrance and aft of that the rear turret. The offensive armaments were stowed in two separate bomb bays housed within the fuselage, along with a further 14 smaller cells contained within the wing area. Bomb racks capable of holding larger bombs were installed on the Whitley Mk III variant.|$|E
25|$|The wings had {{constant}} chord with roughly elliptical tips, with roots joining the upper longerons. On each side, {{a pair of}} streamlined struts from {{the front and rear}} wing spars at mid-span transmitted lift loads {{to the end of the}} stub wing. There was another, slighter pair of struts from each engine mounting vertically to the wing. The wing structure was mostly metal, with some wooden components, then fabric covered. Each wing carried a pair of ailerons with trim tabs to reduce control loads. The fuselage was built around the usual four metal longerons and covered with an aluminium skin. Pilot and co-pilot <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> with dual control in an enclosed cabin just ahead of the leading edge, with fuselage windows on either side for lateral and downward vision. Access to the large passenger cabin, 4.60 m long, was via a radio compartment. The cabin seated ten passengers, five down each side with their own window. At the back were baggage spaces and toilet facilities. Passengers entered by a port-side door and luggage loaded through a door on the other side.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the Dutch {{aircraft}} manufacturer, Fokker, realising that the {{increasing use of}} jet-powered fighters meant that existing piston-engined advanced trainers had insufficient performance, started design of a jet-engined advanced trainer, the S.14 Machtrainer. According to Harker the idea for a Dutch jet trainer originated after Rolls-Royce approached Fokker with drawings for a Derwent-powered jet trainer. Rolls-Royce feared losing the large market for jet trainers to the Goblin-powered Vampire and, after an unsuccessful attempt to interest Miles Aircraft in producing a Derwent-powered competitor, approached Fokker. The S.14 was a low-winged monoplane of all-metal construction. In order to aid use in its role as a trainer, the crew of two <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> on Martin-Baker ejection seats, with room in the spacious cockpit for a third crew member, although this capability was never used. This gave a fairly wide fuselage. It had a retractable tricycle undercarriage, and was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Derwent engine mounted in the centre fuselage, fed from air inlets in the aircraft's nose. Three airbrakes were fitted to the rear fuselage. The wing design and size allowed for the aircraft to land at much lower speeds than most jet aircraft at the time.|$|E

500|$|In December 1953, No.82 (Bomber) Wing, {{headquartered}} at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, took {{delivery of}} Australia's first jet bomber, the English Electric Canberra. Over {{the next five}} years, forty-eight Canberras built in Australia by the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) re-equipped {{all three of the}} wing's flying units, Nos.1, 2 and 6 Squadrons. During this period, operational training of new bomber aircrew was performed [...] "in-house" [...] by the wing, primarily by No.6 Squadron. Aside from its adverse effect on regular flying duties, the task was made technically challenging and potentially dangerous by virtue of the Canberra being designed for only one pilot, with a single control column. On 12January 1959, No.1 (Bomber) Operational Conversion Unit (No.1OCU) was formed at Amberley. Coming under the control of No.82 Wing, its purpose was to convert pilots and navigators to the Canberra, and train them for operations with Nos.1, 2 and 6 Squadrons. On establishment, the unit was commanded by Squadron Leader B.F.M. Rachinger, and equipped with Mk.20 bombers and T.4 trainers. The T.4 was a dual-control model with three seats; the pilot and instructor <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> {{at the front of the}} cockpit, and the navigator was seated behind them. Two of these models had been purchased from Britain. The unit was subsequently allocated Mk.21 trainers; GAF built seven of these dual-control models by converting five early Mk.20s and two British-built B.2 bombers. Student aircrew underwent bombing and navigation instruction, as well as simulated operations. The first training course graduated in April 1959.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was entirely}} ply covered. [...] Pilot and passenger <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> under a rear sliding canopy.

Its [...] Potez 4E-20 air cooled flat four engine drove a two blade propeller made by Melville Helices.|$|E
2500|$|By 1913, whole {{families}} were living at various Pisgah Home facilities.

[...] The central fuselage was rectangular in section and contained three open cockpits. [...] The pilots <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> in a wide cockpit over the wing leading edge with one gunner in the extreme nose and the other where the fuselage began to fall away rapidly, ending at the wing trailing edge. To improve the defence [...] against attacks from below, the rear gunner could also fire through a trapdoor in the floor.|$|E
2500|$|The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito was a British {{twin-engine}} shoulder-winged multi-role combat aircraft. The crew of two, {{pilot and}} navigator, <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side.</b> It served {{during and after}} the Second World War. It was one of few operational front-line aircraft of the era constructed almost entirely of wood and was nicknamed The Wooden Wonder. The Mosquito was also known affectionately as the [...] "Mossie" [...] to its crews. Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber, the Mosquito was adapted to roles including low to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber, high-altitude night bomber, pathfinder, day or night fighter, fighter-bomber, intruder, maritime strike aircraft, and fast photo-reconnaissance aircraft. It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) as a fast transport to carry small high-value cargoes to, and from, neutral countries, through enemy-controlled airspace. A single passenger could ride in the aircraft's bomb bay when it was adapted for the purpose.|$|E
2500|$|The Vickers Vellore, {{named after}} the Indian city of Vellore {{in the state of}} Tamil Nadu, was a {{response}} to Air Ministry specification 34/24, which called for a civil mail and freight carrier. It was a large single-engined two-bay biplane, metal framed and fabric covered. [...] The wings were of equal span with a slight stagger and swept with simple parallel interplane struts. [...] Both upper and lower planes carried balanced ailerons. [...] The gap between the wings was large enough so that there were gaps both above and below the fuselage which increased diameter rapidly behind the uncowled radial engine. The crew <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> in an open cockpit at the highest point of the fuselage {{just in front of the}} wings, giving an excellent view. [...] Behind them was the cargo hold with the fuselage tapering gently towards the tail which carried biplane tailplanes with balanced elevators. [...] There were four slender finless rudders, roughly equally spaced between these two planes. [...] The undercarriage was a simple fixed split-axle arrangement, plus a sprung tailskid.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} Dick's soul demurred. If he told Olive {{anything}} {{he would tell}} her all he knew, and exactly what had happened.

60|$|A very timid, hesitating tap on {{the door}} was {{followed}} by the entrance of two men, both of whom, in general size, strength, and uncouthness, were ludicrously inconsistent with their diffident announcement.

2500|$|Traditionally, Albatros had {{constructed}} fuselages with wood frames but the L.66 marked a departure, with a welded steel tube longeron and strut framework covered with fabric. The sides were flat and almost airfoil shaped, with a blunt, rounded nose and taper aft. The nose mounted engine, driving a two blade propeller, was raised above the fuselage with a fairing behind it, enclosing the oil tank {{and with the}} instrument panel attached to its rear. The fuel tank was in the wing centre section, feeding the engine by gravity. Further aft, pilot and passenger <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> in the [...] wide fuselage; tandem controls could be fitted if required. The empennage was simple in shape and action as there were no fixed surfaces only an all-moving rudder and elevator. Both control surfaces were balanced. [...] The conventional undercarriage was also very simple, with the mainwheels attached to a single axle which passed through the fuselage, sitting the L.66 close to the ground. [...] The tailskid {{was linked to the}} rudder for steering on the ground ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} started afresh {{in early}} 2012, returning to Droste's mother's home in Cape Cod, where the band had previously recorded its second studio album, Yellow House (2006). Commenting {{on the return}} to Yellow House, Droste noted, [...] "It's so funny that we went back there in the end. It's my grandmother's house, we know it, and we can use it for free. And {{as soon as we}} got there, things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, and it happened. Some of the best songs on the record, like [...] "Speak in Rounds" [...] and [...] "Half Gate", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight." [...] Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to [...] "'try writing from the bottom up. We've never done it before.' There's a little bit of fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then everyone got excited. And that's when the ball started to roll, and then we just started playing around, and people were much more open."" ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{types of}} {{literature}} were spread quickly in all directions. Newspapers began and even multiplied. Furthermore, the newspapers were immediately compromised, {{as the political}} factions created their own newspapers, planted stories and bribed journalists. Leading clerics had their sermon collections printed, which were top selling books. Since dissenting, Establishment and Independent divines were in print, the constant movement of these works helped defuse any region's religious homogeneity and fostered emergent latitudinarianism. Periodicals were exceedingly popular, {{and the art of}} essay writing was at nearly its apex. Furthermore, the happenings of the Royal Society were published regularly, and they were digested and explained or celebrated in more popular presses. The latest books of scholarship had [...] "keys", [...] "indexes" [...] and [...] "digests" [...] made of them that could popularise, summarise and explain them to a wide audience. The cross-index, now commonplace, was a novelty in the 18th century, and several persons created indexes for older books of learning to allow anyone to find what an author had to say about a given topic at a moment's notice. Books of etiquette, of correspondence and of moral instruction and hygiene multiplied. Economics began as a serious discipline but did so in the form of numerous [...] "projects" [...] for solving England, Ireland and Scotland's ills. Sermon collections, dissertations on religious controversy, and prophecies, both new and old and explained, cropped up in endless variety. In short, readers in the 18th century were overwhelmed by competing voices. Truth and falsehood <b>sat</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> on the shelves, and anyone could be a published author, just as anyone could quickly pretend to be a scholar by using indexes and digests (Clair 45, 158–187).|$|E

Submissive Lomaque was too discreet to forget his place, and venture on starting a new topic. Trudaine was preoccupied, and disinclined to talk. It was necessary, however, in common politeness, to say something. Hardly attending himself to his own words, he began with a commonplace phrase: [...] "I regret, Monsieur Lomaque, {{that we have not}} had more opportunities of bettering our acquaintance." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was in the}} bows of the Emma an {{elevated}} grating over the heel of her bowsprit whence the eye could take in {{the whole range of}} her deck and see every movement of her crew.
