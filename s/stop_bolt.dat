5000|$|Bolt learns {{a series}} of {{important}} life lessons during his 'adventure', namely that life is not about accomplishments or material success but rather {{the integrity of the}} human spirit. However, Bolt is unaware that the unscrupulous Crasswell has no intention of honoring their bet. When Crasswell realizes Bolt is honoring the bet fair and square, Crasswell bribes Bolt's lawyers into fabricating the story that Bolt had lost his mind and has his property seized. Forced to live on the streets for good and remanded to a free clinic by mistake, a drugged Bolt murmurs that [...] "life stinks", but Molly implores him to remember small things such as the two of them waltzing that make life livable. Crasswell, meanwhile has his own plans for the slum area, planning to tear it down as well. Bolt incites Fumes and the other slum residents to stage a mock battle on the ceremony while it is televised. Crasswell attempts to <b>stop</b> <b>Bolt</b> with a hydraulic excavator, to which Bolt fights Crasswell in another hydraulic excavator akin to [...] "dinosaur fights". When Bolt's grapple has plucked Crasswell and has him hanging by his jacket, the scene is freeze-framed into a news report saying that Crasswell, in a court case, was forced to admit he made a bet with Bolt in order to get him to understand the slum conditions, then reneged on the terms. Bolt, now in control of the area, has plans to renovate it into the [...] "Bolt Center" [...] which will give the slum residents employment, renovate the tenements into livable homes and give the children a private school financed entirely out of pocket by Goddard Bolt. The news report ends by saying Bolt has married Molly and the press are expecting an extravagant CEO-type event, only to then be shown Goddard and Molly taking their wedding vows in a simple chapel in the slum area, then driving off in a limousine with a vanity plate [...] "PEPTO".|$|E
40|$|An {{electrical}} {{servo actuator}} {{is mounted on}} a support arm which is allowed to pivot on a bolt through a fixed mounting bracket. The actuator is pivotally connected {{to the end of}} the support arm by a bolt which has an extension allowed to pass through a slot in the fixed mounting bracket. An actuator rod extends from the servo actuator to a crank arm which turns a control shaft. A short linear thrust of the rod pivots the crank arm through about 90 for full-on control with the rod contracted into the servo actuator, and full-off control when the rod is extended from the actuator. A spring moves the servo actuator and actuator rod toward the control crank arm once the actuator rod is fully extended in the full-off position. This assures the turning of the control shaft to a full-off position. A <b>stop</b> <b>bolt</b> and slot are provided to limit pivot motion. Once fully extended, the spring pivots the motion...|$|E
25|$|The Timberwolf {{action is}} a {{manually}} operated stainless steel bolt action with a right-hand side bolt and ejection port. The bolt is a rotary bolt with dual front locking lugs plus one locking lug at the rear. It requires a 90-degree bolt rotation. the bolt is partly helically fluted which reduces weight and <b>stops</b> <b>bolt</b> debris jams. A double plunger ejector and hook type extractor are used to remove fired cartridge cases. This helps create a very smooth action which is very reliable. The extra locking lug at the rear assists in preventing the bolt from becoming jammed when chambering another round.|$|R

5000|$|In weapons {{where the}} round seats and fires {{at the same}} time, {{mechanical}} timing is essential for operator safety, to prevent the round from firing before it is seated properly. Machine guns are controlled {{by one or more}} mechanical sears. When a sear is in place, it effectively <b>stops</b> the <b>bolt</b> at some point in its range of motion. Some sears <b>stop</b> the <b>bolt</b> when it is locked to the rear. Other sears stop the firing pin from going forward after the round is locked into the chamber. Almost all machine guns have a [...] "safety" [...] sear, which simply keeps the trigger from engaging.|$|R
50|$|The M98 bolt {{group can}} be easily removed from the {{receiver}} simply by rotating the safety lever to the 12 o'clock position and pulling out the <b>bolt</b> <b>stop</b> lever, located at the rear left wall of the receiver, and then operate the action and continue rearward bolt travel past the <b>bolt</b> <b>stop.</b> The metal disc inlay in the stock functions as a bolt disassembly tool.|$|R

50|$|The STANAG {{magazine}} {{concept is}} only an interface, dimensional, and control (magazine latch, <b>bolt</b> <b>stop,</b> etc.) requirement. Therefore, it not only allows one type of magazine to interface with various weapon systems, but also allows STANAG magazines {{to be made in}} various configurations and capacities. STANAG magazines come in 20, 30, and 40 round box magazines, as well as 60 and 100 round casket magazines, 90 round snail-drum magazines, and 100 round saddle-drum magazines.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to <b>stop</b> the <b>bolt</b> from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|R
2500|$|The weapon {{takes the}} {{standard}} M14 action and replaces the standard [...] barrel with an [...] barrel. The barreled action is then bolted into a telescoping chassis stock {{system with a}} pistol grip, a different front sight, Harris bipod, [...] four Picatinny accessory rails (which surround the barrel), and a more effective flash hider {{in place of the}} standard lugged USGI flash suppressor. A paddle-type <b>bolt</b> <b>stop</b> {{similar to that of the}} M4 carbine is used on the rifle. The EBR chassis system stock is made up entirely of lightweight aircraft alloy.|$|R
5000|$|The STANAG {{magazine}} {{concept is}} only an interface, dimensional and controls (magazine latch, <b>bolt</b> <b>stop,</b> etc.) requirement. Therefore, it not only allows one type of magazine to interface with various weapon systems, but also allows STANAG magazines {{to be made in}} various configurations and capacities. The standard capacities of STANAG-compatible magazines are 20 or 30 rounds of 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. There are also 5-, 10-, 40- and 50-round box magazines, as well as 60- and 100-round casket magazines, 90-round snail-drum magazines, and 100-round drum magazines. [...] There has also been a 150-round drum magazine produced.|$|R
5000|$|Magazine: {{magazine}} {{should be}} so constructed as to protect the points of soft point spitzer bullets as they ride in the magazine. Some sort of magazine cutoff permitting the rifle {{to be used in}} the single-shot mode with the magazine in reserve. As an alternative to the magazine cutoff is a detachable box magazine with a double intent which could be inserted to its first stop not allowing the bolt to feed it. When desired, the magazine could be pressed into its second <b>stop,</b> permitting the <b>bolt</b> to pick up the top cartridge.|$|R
50|$|The Lee-Metford rifle, {{developed}} in 1888, {{was one of}} the first rifles to use a detachable box magazine. However, the first completely modern removable box magazine was patented in 1908 by Arthur Savage for the Savage Model 99. Other guns did not adopt all of its features until his patent expired in 1942: It has shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle. It operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths. It is insertable and removable at any time with any number of cartridges. These features allow the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges in the field. The magazine is assembled from inexpensive stamped sheet metal. It also includes a crucial safety feature for hunting dangerous game: when empty the follower <b>stops</b> the <b>bolt</b> from engaging the chamber, informing the operator that the gun is empty before any attempt to fire.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{removable}} box magazine {{often seen}} on military rifles {{was invented in}} 1908 by Savage, as an improvement to the Model 99. It did not come into wide use until his patent expired in 1942 with the obvious exception {{of the family of}} rifles designed by James Paris Lee and adopted by the USN and the British Empire; first as the Lee-Metford and later as the Lee-Enfield rifles. The box magazine has many attractive features that ensured its eventual dominance: shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle, operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths and is insertable and removable at any time with any number of cartridges. This allows the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges. It is assembled from inexpensive stamped sheet metal. When empty the follower <b>stops</b> the <b>bolt</b> from engaging the chamber, informing the operator of the gun's emptiness before any attempt to fire.|$|R
50|$|Using some {{technology}} from his timeline, Starhawk teleports {{himself into the}} 21st century of the Earth-616 timeline, {{to meet up with}} that era's equivalent of the Guardians of the Galaxy on Knowhere. Vance Astro, aka Major Victory, was found by this new squad of Guardians, and Starhawk fights him before teleporting away. Starhawk again ventures to Knowhere, but this time appears as a woman. Claiming that there is not meant to be a Guardians of the Galaxy {{at this point in the}} timeline, and that Major Victory's appearance there has put the entire future in flux, she again attempts to kill Astro and the Guardians. She is detained by the Guardians, and held captive for a time, until Moondragon released her. She discovers that the anomaly that is disturbing the time stream is not Astro or the Guardians, but instead Black Bolt activating a bomb that will cause time and space to collapse. Starhawk sacrifices her life to save the Guardians, and instructs Star-Lord to <b>stop</b> Black <b>Bolt,</b> at any cost.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] This dummy {{cartridge}} uses {{a modified}} case bearing the headstamp F A 4 09 indicating manufacture at Frankford Arsenal in April 1909. The {{case has been}} tin-plated, indented with six longitudinal corrugations, and perforated three times in alternating indentations. The hollow brass bullet retains a spring-loaded steel rod exposed in the primer pocket with 1/8-inch of possible forward movement when struck by the firing pin. This rod is intended to slow forward motion of the firing pin (similarly to striking a live primer) to avoid breaking the firing pin by the abrupt <b>stop</b> within the <b>bolt</b> if no resistance was encountered within the chamber.|$|R
5000|$|Their ascent closely {{followed}} the 1970 first ascent by Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell, completed with a heavy-handed reliance on bolts - {{a method that}} offended Robbins and other clean climbing advocates. Harding had left all his bolts in the rock; Robbins and Lauria used the bolts to repeat the climb; and Robbins then chopped the heads off the bolts behind them. After two pitches, Robbins <b>stopped</b> chopping the <b>bolts</b> because (according to Lauria) [...] "the quality of the aid climbing was much higher {{than he had ever}} expected of Harding or Caldwell and, of course, it was also taking us an awful long time to chop all those goddam bolts." ...|$|R
5000|$|Buffy and Cassie {{walk away}} together, leaving Peter on his own. A {{crossbow}} booby trap set {{by one of}} the cloaked boys nearly kills Cassie but Buffy <b>stops</b> the <b>bolt.</b> Buffy tells Cassie that one person can make a difference, to which Cassie responds, [...] "And you will," [...] before gasping and falling to the ground, dead. The next day, the Scooby Gang gathers at Revello Drive and solemnly talks about how Cassie died because of a congenital heart defect. She was always going to die, no matter what happened, and Cassie knew that Buffy would be at her side when her prediction came true. Buffy feels that she has failed, but a devastated Dawn corrects her, saying Buffy didn't fail since she tried to save Cassie; it was because of her that Dawn and Cassie were friends. The gang are now convinced as Buffy of Cassie's unique gift, all sadly realize that even though {{they may be able to}} avert outcomes, but not on fate. Buffy returns to work, knowing that while she will always try her best, sometimes she just can't help people.|$|R
50|$|At around 6 pm on 5 August, Inspectors Ranchin and Culioli {{recovered}} a Rock-Ola M1 carbine {{from the river}} Durance. It was broken in two and had clearly been in very poor condition even before being thrown into the river. Several pieces were missing and repairs had been made using makeshift knick-knacks: the sight {{had been replaced by}} half of a 1-franc coin, while the wooden forearm covering the barrel was missing. The lever had been replaced by a Duralumin ring taken from a bicycle's identity plaque, which was fixed to the wood by a screw. The safety strap was missing and the <b>bolt</b> <b>stop</b> was broken. Therefore, {{it was more of a}} DIY handyman's weapon than that of a seasoned killer.|$|R
50|$|Black Bolt, {{angered by}} the repercussions caused by the Skrull invasion, changes tactics and embarks on an {{aggressive}} campaign against all former persecutors of the Inhumans in the War of Kings limited series. At his command, the Inhumans attack the Kree and overthrow Ronan the Accuser, with Black Bolt declaring himself supreme ruler of the Kree Empire. This {{is followed by a}} preemptive strike against the Shi'ar empire, now controlled by the usurper Vulcan. Black Bolt intended to release the Terrigen Mist across the galaxy and end the war when, courtesy of the subsequent mutations, all are rendered equal, but the plan was interrupted by Vulcan, the two clashing as the bomb charged up. Although Vulcan was nearly killed by Black Bolt's voice, Black Bolt prepared to abandon his plan when Crystal pointed out that the powers produced by the explosion would only inspire more harm rather than good. However, an enraged Vulcan retained enough strength to <b>stop</b> Black <b>Bolt</b> from teleporting away with Crystal and Lockjaw, which resulted in Black Bolt and Vulcan apparently dying in the subsequent explosion of the Terrigen bomb, as Crystal only negated the Terrigen Mists within the bomb without shutting down its ability to explode.|$|R
5000|$|The Type 30 carbineor cavalry rifle (...) is a {{modified}} version made 300 mm (11.8 in) shorter than the infantry model (the carbine's barrel measures 480 mm (18.9 in) against 790 mm (31.1 in) for the standard infantry issue). Intended to equip cavalry troops with a modern carbine. Differences other than the shorter barrel and stock from the standard infantry rifle is that it lacked a handguard over the barrel, rear sight ladder only went up to 1,500 meters (compared to the rifles 2,000 meters), front sight had protection guards on each side, slight changes to the <b>bolt</b> <b>stop</b> latch and the sling swivels were moved {{to the left side}} of the gun to prevent the bolt from digging into the cavalry trooper's back. The pre-production version lacked a bayonet.|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, the Yugoslavs {{took this}} design and {{incorporated}} minor modifications. Although very similar in general appearance {{to that of}} the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. M48s are usually distinguished from the 98k by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends {{just in front of the}} receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well. The M48 was designed with a stock similar to the 98k, but it has a shorter intermediate-length action and receiver, as does the similar M24 series Mauser. The M24 series Mausers were built from prewar Yugoslav Model 24 Mausers and then refurbished with newer Belgian parts, and usually have straight bolts, while the M48s have curved bolts. Most M48 stocks are made from thicker Elm or Beech wood and have a thick stainless steel butt plate at the rear of the stock. The M24/47 stocks are mostly made of thinner Walnut or Beech wood and do not have a milled stainless steel [...] "cupped" [...] butt plate. The M48 was also designed to remove the follower from <b>stopping</b> the <b>bolt</b> from closing when the magazine is empty. M48's are regarded as a military surplus firearm and can be collected in the USA, Canada and Australia at a generally cheap price due to the plentiful numbers recently imported from Europe, most of which had never been used in combat.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} magazine housing, {{which is}} suited to accept AR-15 type magazines, has ambidextrous magazine release buttons. The ambidextrous <b>bolt</b> <b>stop</b> release button {{is located at}} the front of the triggerguard. Safety lever is also ambidextrous, and charging handle can be installed on either side of the gun. It can be equipped with various Magpul-made buttstocks, fixed or side-folding, and adjustable for length of pull (some also with adjustable cheek rest), it can also be fitted with removable iron sights, and/or with any optical or night sight  with appropriate mounting, depending on the user's preference or the variant. It also has an integral Picatinny rail on the top of the receiver and additional accessory rails can be installed on forend according to user preferences. The Bushmaster's handguard model is polymer with heat guards and attachable aluminum tri-rail, while the Remington model has a five-sided aluminum handguard that can be user configured with MIL-STD-1913 rail elements.|$|R
50|$|Tippmann {{recently}} introduced a feature known as A.C.T. (Anti-Chop Technology), {{which is a}} mechanical system integrated into the bolt system to reduce the chance of jams due to misfed paintballs. In the 98 Custom and Custom Pro markers, the hammer has a deep groove that the linkage arm sits in, along with the ACT spring {{to keep it in}} position (there is also a small hole to insert the linkage arm into if the user chooses not to use the ACT function). If a paintball is incorrectly fed into the breech when the bolt is closing, the <b>bolt</b> <b>stops</b> on the paintball with little pressure from the ACT spring, while the hammer continues on its stroke unlinked to the bolt. It hits the valve and is blown back open, where it re-engages the linkage arm and retracts the bolt, letting the paintball fall into the breech correctly. The marker is now ready to fire again. The Tippmann A.C.T feature is very similar to Spyder's ACS bolt.|$|R
5000|$|Like the 1898 Mauser rifle, the 1891 Mosin uses two front-locking lugs {{to lock up}} the action. However, the Mosin's lugs lock in the {{horizontal}} position, whereas the Mauser locks vertically. The Mosin bolt body is multi-piece whereas the Mauser is one piece. The Mosin uses interchangeable bolt heads like the Lee-Enfield. Unlike the Mauser, which uses a [...] "controlled feed" [...] bolt head in which the cartridge base snaps up under the fixed extractor as the cartridge is fed from the magazine, the Mosin has a [...] "push feed" [...] recessed bolt head in which the spring-loaded extractor snaps over the cartridge base as the bolt is finally closed similar to the Gewehr 88 and M91 Carcano or modern sporting rifles like the Remington 700. Like the Mauser, the Mosin uses a blade ejector mounted in the receiver. The Mosin bolt is removed by simply pulling it fully {{to the rear of}} the receiver and squeezing the trigger, while the Mauser has a <b>bolt</b> <b>stop</b> lever separate from the trigger.|$|R
50|$|The 6.5mm bullet {{was found}} to be too light for {{long-range}} fire support and anti-aircraft use, so in 1932 the heavier 8×63mm patron m/32 cartridge was developed. As this resulted in a heavier recoil, a spring-loaded cradle replaced the backplate with a heavily spring-loaded buffer that acted {{as an extension of the}} standard Browning recoil buffer. This also replaced the regular spade-grips with the ones integrated in the cradle. The cradle, now part of the weapon, would then be hooked onto a tripod m/36. This tripod featured, beside a 5×25 power optical sight, advanced elevation- and traverse controls. The unprecedented recoil control and steadiness of the tripod made Dolf Goldsmith remark that this arrangement “was undoubtedly the most accurate long-range rifle-caliber machine gun ever made”. For anti-air purposes, a double cradle was made to hold a matching pair of m/36. The right gun, lacking sights altogether, was fed from the right, while the left gun, with iron sights complemented with an AA sight ring, was fed from left. The cocking handles were located between the guns, while safety and triggers were individual for left and right. The special AA tripod had elongated legs and chains to either secure the tripod or hang weights on it for extra stability. These double cradles were also used as standard defense, mounted on a ring on the cab roof, on terrain vehicles and armored troop carriers like Terrängbil m/42 KP. The latter was used with good effect in the Congo crisis in the early 1960s. Until 1966, the m/14-29 and m/36 machine guns could use both the 6.5mm and the 8mm ammunition. Converting between the two was a matter of exchanging barrel, cartridge <b>stop</b> and <b>bolt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bolt's son Terry Bolatinsky {{appears in}} Teen Titans #55. He {{initially}} attempts to befriend Blue Devil's former sidekick, Kid Devil, before revealing he is following in his father's footsteps as Dreadbolt. He tries to persuade Kid Devil {{to join his}} team, the Terror Titans, but when Kid Devil refuses, he joins {{the rest of the}} Terror Titans in defeating him. Later {{at the request of the}} new Clock King's he is sent to help to defeat Ravager who already took out Persuader and Copperhead. He threatens to kill Wendy and Marvin but Ravager calls his bluff and defeats him alone. He regroups with his teammates and attempts to take her down again, but is apparently killed in the pursuing explosion caused by Ravager breaking a gas pipe. He is later revealed to have used the teleportation system in his suit to get himself and his teammates to safety. In the Terror Titans miniseries, Dreadbolt is tasked by Clock King to kill his father, thereby proving himself worthy to lead his fellow Terror Titans. Clock King then renames him Bolt, when he finally does. Disruptor, having lost favor from Clock King to Ravager, tried to manipulate Terry into killing her, but Terry was not fooled. When Clock King sets in motion his plan to destroy Los Angeles with an army of brainwashed metahumans, Ravager set out to <b>stop</b> him. <b>Bolt</b> and the Terror Titans battled her, only to be outmaneuvered. Miss Martian, who had posed as one of the metahumans, freed the others from their brainwashing, and they came after the Terror Titans. Retreating to Clock Kings lair for help, Bolt and the others are aghast to see Clock King kill Disruptor for her failure, and leave them at the mercy of the oncoming metahumans. Bolt offers to hold them off while his teammates get away, but they insist on fighting together, and are eventually subdued, with Dreadbolt being defeated by electromagnetic-powered superhero Static. Two weeks later, Bolt and the remaining Terror Titans escape from custody, planning revenge on Clock King.|$|R
50|$|After the University of Nebraska {{backed out}} of their sponsorship, Speed and Melling ran a limited 1997 season. Speed {{qualified}} for all 25 races he attempted. Lake and the team raced to a solid 12th-place finish in the Pontiac Excitement 400 at Richmond, then followed that up with a sixth-place qualifying effort at Atlanta. During {{the midpoint of the}} season, the No. 9 car was filmed for the TV movie Steel Chariots. In the Miller 400 at Michigan, Speed earned his and the team's best finish of the season, an 11th. A few races later, Speed finished 12th in the Brickyard 400. At Richmond in the Exide NASCAR Select Batteries 400, Speed seemed to have one of the stronger cars, leading three laps through a series of green flag pit stops. However, during the <b>stop,</b> the crew <b>bolted</b> the left side tires on the right side and the right side tires on the left, forcing Speed to make multiple pit stops and dropping him out of a chance of having a good finish. A few races later, Lake had a 14th-place run at Martinsville in the Hanes 500. The Melling team was able to get sponsorship for the last four races of the season from Advantage Camo, their best finish being 17th at Rockingham's AC Delco 400.
