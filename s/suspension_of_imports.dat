40|$|The diploma thesis "Influence of {{international}} energy security on shale gas mining in euro-atlantic area" {{deals with the}} possibility of developing commercial shale gas mining operations in Europe. Due to increase of gas consumption in Europe and without Europe's own sufficient production, its dependence on gas imports is growing, especially on the imports from Russian Federation. Although thanks to the development of LNG natural gas could become a global commodity in the future, the natural gas markets still maintain a regional character for the moment. This situation could be used for political objectives by some actors, such as Russia's temporary <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> gas <b>imports</b> to Europe in 2006 and 2009. As a reaction to development of commercial unconventional shale gas production in USA, some of the EU members turned their attention to their own shale gas deposits in order to bolster their energy security. The stance of the individual countries differs however, with some of the countries imposing research moratoria (France, Bulgaria, Czech Republic), while some other countries expressing significant interest in the research of possible production on their territory (United Kingdom, Poland).

The suggested framework views the extent <b>of</b> <b>import</b> sourcing in a firm as a function of three factors: cost factor, strategy factor and the international trade infrastructure (ITI) factor. In the past decade, changes in ITI have facilitated international trade through developments in communication, transportation and other structural elements of international trade.

More recently, an emerging literature suggests that <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments may well be optimal in some states of the world. We present evidence about <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments from an episode that is close to a controlled experiment for examining their effects. In 1861, about 44 percent of the banks in Wisconsin closed, 81 percent of the banks in Illinois closed, and noteholders suffered substantial losses. The historical record suggests a possible explanation: an effective <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments in Wisconsin but not Illinois. Historical and statistical evidence indicate that the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreased the number of banks that closed as well as noteholders' losses.

Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2.
