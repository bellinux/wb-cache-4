To assess the ideal zone of lateral radiographs in determining the safe or hazardous locations of the <b>screw</b> <b>tips</b> during transarticular <b>screw</b> implantation in the lower cervical spine. Transarticular screw in the lower cervical spine had been used as an alternative technique to achieve posterior cervical spine stability. Injury to the spinal nerves caused by transarticular screws which are too long must be identified quickly to minimize the neurologic complication. No previous radiological study regarding evaluation of the transarticular screw placement using lateral radiographs has been reported. Twelve cervical spines were removed from embalmed cadavers. Four transarticular screw placements with Dalcanto’s technique under direct visualization, including placement of the <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> staying the ventral cortex, 2, 4 and 6  mm over-penetration of the ventral cortex, were performed on each specimen. Following each placement, a lateral radiograph was taken. Each vertebral body was divided vertically into four equal zones, and another equal zone posterior to the posterior border of the vertebral body was defined as Zone pre- 1. The numbers of <b>screw</b> <b>tips</b> seen in each zone were quantified for each placement. Partitions of χ 2 method {{was used to evaluate}} the ideal zone on lateral radiograph for transarticular screw insertion. At C 34 and C 45, no significant difference was found between Zone pre- 1 and Zone  1 (χ 2  =  0. 18, P >  0. 50), while there was significant difference between Zones 1 and 2 (χ 2  =  73. 6, P    0. 50), while there was significant difference between Zone pre- 1 and Zone 1 (χ 2  =  66. 2, P <  0. 005), as well as Zones 1 and 2 (χ 2  =  10. 5, P <  0. 005).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six internally fixated cadaveric humeri were examined using SECT and DECT. Data were reconstructed using FBP, IFS-MAR, and mono-energetic DECT extrapolations. Image analysis included radiodensity values and qualitative evaluation of artefacts, image quality, and level of confidence for localizing <b>screw</b> <b>tips.</b> RESULTS: Radiodensity values of streak artefacts were significantly different (p <  0. 05) between FBP (- 104  ±  222) and IFS-MAR (73  ±  122), and between FBP and DECT (32  ±  151), without differences between IFS-MAR and DECT (p <  0. 553). Compared to FBP, qualitative artefacts were significantly reduced using IFS-MAR (p <  0. 001) and DECT (p <  0. 05), without significant differences between IFS-MAR and DECT (p <  0. 219). Image quality significantly (p =  0. 016) improved for IFS-MAR and DECT compared to FBP, without significant differences between IFS-MAR and DECT (p <  0. 553). The level of confidence for <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> localization was assessed as best for DECT in all cases. CONCLUSION: Both IFS-MAR in SECT and mono-energetic DECT produce improved image quality and a reduction of metal artefacts. <b>Screw</b> <b>tip</b> positions can be most confidently assessed using DECT...|$|R

In order to visualize better this concept, the locus of points having the same TAD was plotted and the dependence of TAD on the location of the lag <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> was also reported. It was shown that TAD should be adjusted for the size of the femoral head (a variable which varies a lot according to the sex of the patient) while no correlation was found between TAD and bone morphometry indices obtained from micro-CT data (BV/TV and Tb.

Therefore, these results seem to suggest that TAD lacks mechanical justification and that predictors which are based on mechanical properties, such as bone density, should be investigated further...|$|R
40|$|Introduction During a triple-screw {{internal}} fixation of femoral neck fracture, joint penetration {{is difficult}} to detect without imaging technologies and manual measurements. The screws may appear on the standard antero-posterior and lateral radiographs to be within the femoral head while they are actually penetrating the articular joint [1, 2]. The objective {{of this paper is}} to study the feasibility of a new semi-automatic detection method of joint penetration during triple-screw internal fixation of femoral neck fractures. Materials and methods The proposed semi-automatic detection method of joint penetration requires the computation of the tip-to-surface distance (TSD) defined as the distance in mm between the tip of an inserted screw and the articular surface of the femoral joint. A two-step process for the computation of TSD was implemented. First, the tip position of the inserted screw can be manually identified on intraoperative antero-posterior and lateral 2 D radiographs. Second, the Euclidean coordinates of the identified <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> can be reconstructed in 3 D and expressed in the absolute reference frame of the intraoperative imaging system. These Euclidean coordinates enable the automatic computation of TSD. Negative values of TSD represent actual penetrations of the articular surface, while positive values represent no joint penetration. To show the feasibility of this method, five cases of internal screw fixation of femoral neck fracture were simulated in a 3 D Computer Aided Design (CAD) software using a virtual model of femur and screw. Three cases (cases # 2, 4 and 5) were designed with the screw penetrating the articular joint, while two other cases (cases # 1 and 3) had no joint penetration. The theoretical TSD corresponding to each simulated case was computed. For each case, two perpendicular 2 D snapshots of the 3 D CAD scenario with no visually detectable joint penetration, especially for the simulated cases # 2, 4 and 5, were defined to simulate intraoperative antero-posterior and lateral radiographs. For each case, two operators were asked to perform the manual identification of the <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> on the simulated antero-posterior and lateral radiographs. TSD were computed from the manual identifications of the <b>screw</b> <b>tips</b> and the average value (called semi-automatic measurement) was compared to the corresponding theoretical TSD (reference measurement). Correlation coefficient between the two operators was computed. Results Correlation coefficient between the two operators who identified the <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> for the five simulated cases was 0. 96. All penetrating screws were detected by the operators (cases # 2, 4 and 5; Table I). Maximum difference between reference and semi-automatic measurements was 1. 2 mm for the simulated case # 5. There was no negative difference between reference and automatic measurements. Moreover, no unpenetrating screw was considered as a penetrating screw. Discussion This study showed the feasibility to detect joint penetration during simulated internal screw fixation of femoral neck fracture by using 2 D radiographs to identify the position of the inserted <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> and compute the 3 D distance relative to the articular surface of the hip joint. Observed results showed positive semi-definite differences between reference and semi-automatic measurements of TSD. This suggests that the proposed method to detect joint penetration is conservative, by ensuring the recognition of actual joint penetration and reducing the risk to recognize false joint penetration. Although these results clearly have to be validated clinically, they may be straightaway useful to assess the level of accuracy that the semi-automatic detection method needs to be provided with, particularly in terms of the <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> identification performed intraoperatively by the operator.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We develop simple {{models that}} can be used to predict the forces of impact that occur during the {{injection}} molding process involving a magnesium alloy. We model the impact of the injection molding <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> on the molten material entering the mold, and the impact of the piston flange on the machine housing, which can occur when the amount of material that has been injected into the mold is insufficient to completely fill the mold. We consider the effects due to the elasticity of the molten material and machine parts, those due to the presence of a thin film of hydraulic fluid between the piston flange and machine housing, the variation of the viscosity of the hydraulic fluid, and those due to the leakage of molten metal past the <b>screw</b> <b>tip.</b> With the simple models developed here, an injection molding machine designer can predict how varying the process parameters may affect the impact forces, and thus, may be able to more efficiently design the machine so that damage is less likely to occur during operation. This will result a longer life for the machine, which will lead to increased cost effectiveness for the manufacturer...|$|R

Thirty formaldehyde-preserved human male cadavers were studied. Posterior midline incision was performed, and soft tissues and muscles were dissected from the posterior part of the lumbosacral region. A 6  mm pedicle screw was inserted between the superior facet of S 1 and the S 1 foramen. The entry point of the S 2 pedicle screw was located between S 1 and S 2 foramina. S 1 and S 2 screws were placed on both {{right and the left}} sides of all cadavers. Then, all cadavers were turned into supine position. All abdominal and pelvic organs were moved away and carefully observed for any injury. The tips of the sacral screws were marked and the relations with the anatomic structures were defined. The position of the sacral screws relative to the middle and lateral sacral arteries and veins, and the sacral sympathetic trunk were measured. There was no injury to the visceral organs. In four cases, S 1 <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> was in direct contact with middle sacral artery. In two cases, S 1 <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> was in direct contact with middle sacral vein. It was observed that the S 1 <b>screw</b> <b>tips</b> were in close proximity to sacral sympathetic trunk on both right and the left sides. The tip of the S 2 screw was in contact with middle sacral artery on the left side only in one case. It is found that the tip of the S 2 screw was closely located with the middle sacral vein in two cases. The tip of the S 2 pedicle screw was in contact with the sacral sympathetic trunk in eight cases on the right side and seven cases on the left side. Lateral sacral vein was also observed to be disturbed by the S 1 and S 2 screws. As a conclusion, anterior cortical penetration during sacral screw insertion carries a risk of neurovascular injury. The risk of sacral sympathetic trunk and minor vascular structures together with the major neurovascular structures and viscera should be kept in mind...|$|R
30|$|Dorsally {{prominent}} <b>screw</b> <b>tips</b> {{have been}} identified as a cause of extensor tendon injuries: Beson et al. [27] reported screw penetration into the third dorsal compartment and fracture-related bony spurs or gapping at the fracture side as potential causes of the extensor pollicis longus tendon (EPL). We saw a total of four EPL problems: one patient had an initial traumatic rupture of the EPL tendon that was repaired during the first operation; two of our patients reported an insufficient thumb elevation in a period of 2 – 16  weeks after surgery. Here, prominent <b>screw</b> <b>tips</b> have been indentified as the reason for this problem. In a fourth patient with the same symptoms of thumb weakness, an early revision of the EPL tendon could exclude an alteration due a postoperative problem. Although the EPL tendon is especially known to be a typical problem, paying high operative attention may lead to fewer problems. In contrast to our high incidence of this complication, others do report less to zero tendon problems [4, 9]. A continuous intraoperative fluoroscopy with respect to the complicated dorsal shape of the distal radius, especially in the region of Lister’s tubercle, in addition to an aggressive treatment or revision in the situation of tendon irritation might prevent the major complication of a delayed or missed EPL rupture necessitating tendon transfer. Besides these highly relevant tendon problems, we saw one screw break leading to a secondary revision. Other common problems as described by others [4, 8, 10] such as CRPS, nerve irritation, carpal tunnel syndrome, and wound infections were not seen in our series.|$|R

Another concern is that if the blunt end of the screw begins to degrade by cracking, pieces could become small projectiles during firing. All screws used in firing 100 rounds or more exhibited some degree degradation, which progressively worsened as the number of rounds fired increased. (SEM, metallography, x-ray analysis, and microhardness were used.) Presence of cracks in these screws after 100 fired rounds is a serious concern that warrants the discontinued use of these screws.

The installation was also designed as an on-line rheometer process, especially for rheological investigations of PBXs and LOVA propellant formulations, {{as well as of}} single and triple base propellants. The on-line rheometer and the twin-screw extruder process were remote controlled. In the meantime, the safe and infinite variation in slit-height of the rheometer within a defined range of some millimeters during processing by remote control has proven advantageous. This is particularly evident, when extruding highly filled PBXs and gun propellants, both having a correspondingly high viscosity. The sensitivity of the energetic materials can be reacted to during processing by adjusting the slit geometry, thus avoiding safety problems due t o a non-adjusted slit geometry. We have succeeded in designing the slit-die adjustable in height by remote control prior to and during rheological measurements. All aspects of safety are incorporated in its construction.

30|$|The {{difference}} in mode of catastrophic failure is also noteworthy. The ST/G reconstructions characteristically failed when the graft slipped around the interference screw; i.e., both the static friction along the graft–tunnel interface and the anchoring with the interference screw failed {{to counter the}} tension load. The majority of Quad ST-tape constructs failed when the knotted tape slipped around the screw into the cancellous bone. The interference screws used had a different design from other reports for a partial inside-out technique tape fixation technique, which may {{have resulted in the}} heterogeneous fixation results in our study. Full-length tunnels were used to mimic an ACLR technique using fixed suspensory loop femoral fixation with tibial tape–screw fixation. If our tunnels had been drilled partial length inside-out, our results may have been different; however, given that the majority of Quad ST-tape failures were due to graft slippage around the screw, despite the tape being tied over the screw head, it remains uncertain if the graft slippage still would not have occurred. If the tunnels had been drilled partial length inside-out so that an isthmus of bone remained at the <b>screw</b> <b>tip,</b> this may have provided additional friction to the tape. However, as noted above, we attempted to add to the tape–screw fixation by tying a knot over the screw in compensation for the full-length tunnel.|$|R

40|$|Self-tapping {{continuously}} threaded screws can {{be installed}} without predrilling and have – besides their use as fasteners – proven suitable as high-performance reinforcements of structural members and joints in timber construction. For this type of application big installation depths (leff > 20 d) and screw lengths (l > 0. 6 m) are required which cause problems regarding precisely positioned installation. Due to the inhomogeneity of wood as a natural material, even at medium size lengths the screws tend to 'stray' i. e. a deviation of the <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> from the designated axis occurs which is increasing disproportionately with growing screw lengths. While for shorter screws mechanically drilled holes are commonly used as guidance, for longer screws potentially only laser-drilled holes can ensure a straight direction of the screw axis. The high energy and heat input of the laser beam results in a thermal modification of the wood around the drill hole, thus presumably influencing the load bearing and bond behaviour of screws that are screwed into such holes. The Chair of Structures and Structural Design and the Chair of Laser Technology of RWTH Aachen University carried {{out a series of}} tests to examine the use of laser radiation to drill holes in glued laminated timber and to evaluate the load bearing behaviour of self-tapping screws installed in these holes focussing on short drill-/bond lengths (l = 6 d). The results point out the potential of the development of this innovative wood processing method for the field of timber construction...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{describe}} a surgical tool {{that uses the}} distractor pin as a reference for determining proper screw length in ACDF. It is critical that screw purchase depth be as deep as possible without violating or penetrating the posterior cortical wall, which ensures strong pull out strength. Methods: We enrolled 81 adult patients who underwent ACDF using an anterior cervical plate from 2010 to 2012. Patients were categorized into Groups A (42 patients: retractor pin used as a reference for screw length) and B (39 patients: control group). Intraoperative lateral x-rays were taken after screwing the retractor pin to confirm the approaching vertebral level. The ratio of retractor pin length to body anteroposterior (A-P) diameter was measured as a reference. Proper screw length was determined by comparison to the reference. Results: The average distance from <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> to posterior wall was 3. 0 ± 1. 4 mm in Group A and 4. 1 ± 2. 3 mm in Group B. The ratio of screw length to body sagittal diameter was 86. 2 ± 5. 7 % in Group A and 80. 8 ± 9. 0 % in Group B. Screw length to body sagittal diameter ratios higher than 4 / 5 occurred in 33 patients (90 %) in Group A and 23 patients (59 %) in Group B. No cases violated the posterior cortical wall. Conclusion: We introduce a useful surgical method for determining proper screw length in ACDF using the ratio of retractor pin length to body A-P diameter as a reference. This method allows for deeper screw purchase depth without violation of the posterior cortical wall...|$|R
40|$|Background:  Conventional {{treatments}} after complicated injuries of {{the distal}} radioulnar joint (DRUJ) such as Darrach and Kapandji-Sauvé procedures have many drawbacks, which may {{eventually lead to}} a painful unstable distal ulna.   The development of DRUJ prosthesis has significantly evolved over the past years. In this study, we assessed the outcome results of patients after DRUJ implant arthroplasty using the Aptis (Scheker) prosthesis. Methods: We identified 13 patients with 14 prosthesis during the past 10 years. Patients underwent DRUJ arthroplasty due to persistent symptoms of instability, chronic pain, and stiffness. Records and follow-up visits were reviewed to find the final post-operative symptoms, pain, range of motion, and grip strength with a mean follow-up of 12 months (range:  2 - 25 months). Also, patients were contacted prospectively by phone in order to  minister the disabilities of the armshoulder and hand (DASH), patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE), and visual analogue scale (VAS), and to interview regarding satisfaction and progress in daily activities. Eleven patients out of 13 could be reached with a median followup time of 60 months (range: 2 to 102 months).   Results: No patient required removal of the prosthesis. Only two patients underwent secondary surgeries in which both required debridement of the <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> over the radius. The median DASH score, PRWE score, VAS, and satisfaction were 1. 3, 2. 5, 0, and 10, respectively. The mean range of flexion, extension, supination, and pronation was 62, 54, 51, and 64, respectively. Conclusions: Distal radioulnar joint injuries are disabling and patients usually undergo one or more salvage surgeries prior to receiving an arthroplasty. The Scheker prosthesis has shown satisfactory results with 100 % survival rate in all reports. The constrained design of this prosthesis gives enough stability to prevent painful subluxation...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho {{experimental}} propõe uma nova e eficiente técnica para in-trodução de parafuso no processo articular cervical, com menor risco. Utilizando um novo dispositivo e determinando o comprimento efetivo médio do parafuso. Foram usadas cinco colunas cervicais de esqueleto humano de C 3 a C 7, num total de 25 vértebras e 50 perfurações. Foram selecionados dois grupos de vértebras: um de C 3 a C 6, outro de C 7. No primeiro grupo, o ponto inicial do parafuso situou-se a 2 mm. mediais e caudais do ponto central do processo articular, dirigindo-se a ponta do parafuso a 21, 5 º no sentido cranial. No outro grupo, o ponto inicial foi localizado a 2 mm. da linha média vertical, logo abaixo da superfície articular superior, dirigindo-se a ponta do parafuso a 16, 5 º no sentido caudal. Em ambos os grupos, o parafuso foi desviado lateralmente a 42, 5 º. Concluímos que a nossa técnica é eficiente e segura porque: 1) utiliza um dispositivo que mede o ângulo de introdução do parafuso, bloqueando-o após a ultrapassagem da cortical anterior, introduzindo somente o comprimento ideal para cada processo articular, diminuindo o risco de lesão; 2) não causa lesão da artéria vertebral e da raiz nervosa; 3) apresenta baixa incidência de violação da superfície articular, 7, 5 % nas vértebras C 3 a C 6 e 0 % nas C 7; 4) apresenta um comprimento efetivo do parafuso de 10, 7 mm. para ambos os grupos vertebrais oferecendo boa fixação óssea e boa margem de segurança, em relação às estruturas anatômicas importantes. This experimental paper {{presents a}} new and efficient technique to insert a screw in the cervical lateral mass with the less risk of damaging the vertebral artery, the nerve root and the articular facet. This procedure is carried out by using a new device which measures the screw insertion angle and lock the screw after it goes through the posterior cortical area. This paper also aims at determining the effective screw length {{to be used in}} this technique. Five human lower cervical spines from C 3 to C 7 - were used. Two holes were made in both sides of these 25 vertebrae. Therefore 50 holes were made. Two vertebrae groups were selected: C 3 -C 6 and C 7. In the C 3 -C 6 group the start point of the screw was placed in a medial and caudal position 2 mm. in relation to the central point of the articular prossece; the <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> was directed to the half of the lateral vertebral line at a 21, 5 ° angle in the cranial direction; for the C 7 vertebrae the screw initial point was placed at a 2 mm. medial position in the vertical mean line just below the upper articular level; the <b>screw</b> <b>tip</b> was directed to the half of the lateral vertebral line at a 16, 5 ° angle in the caudal direction. In both vertebral groups the screw was laterally deviated at a 42, 5 ° angle. The conclusion is that this new technique is efficient and safe because: 1) it utilizes a new device to guide and measure the screw insertion and lock the screw after it goes through the posterior cortical area; the in-sertion is thus adequate for each specific lateral mass and decreases the risk of damage to the vertebral artery and to the nerve root; in fact it did not occur in both vertebral groups; 2) it presents a low rate of articular facet violation; 3) it presents a 10, 7 mm. screw length which is effective for both vertebral groups; 4) therefore there occurs a good bone fixation and the important anatomic structures are preserved...|$|R
