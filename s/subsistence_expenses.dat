40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} challenges facing the world today is how to sustainably feed a growing population while conserving the ecosystem services we depend on. Coffee landscapes are an important site for research on agrifood systems because they reflect global-scale dynamics surrounding conservation and livelihood development. Within them, we find both what is broken in our global agrifood system, {{as well as the}} grassroots struggles that strive to change the system by building socio-ecologically resilient, sustainable livelihoods. Research shows that smallholder shade coffee farmers steward high biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services. At the same time, studies in the last decade demonstrate that many smallholder coffee farmers in Mesoamerica suffer annual periods of seasonal hunger, as well as pervasive poverty. This dissertation explores household livelihood strategies, with a particular emphasis on agroecology, and how they can contribute to build sustainable systems that secure food and maintain biodiversity in coffee communities of Chiapas, Mexico. Research was conducted using a mixed methods approach, which included the collection of quantitative and qualitative socio-ecological data through focus groups, surveys, semi-structured interviews, participant observation and plant inventories. Surveys were conducted with 79 households in 11 communities, all located within the buffer zone of a biosphere reserve. A stratified random sample of 31 households from these 79 were surveyed again to collect more in-depth data, including the collection of biophysical data in their subsistence and coffee land use systems. The following research questions were explored: 1) What are the major ecological, social, economic, and political drivers of seasonal hunger? 2) What is the relationship between agrobiodiversity (plant and livestock diversity) and food security (months of adequate household food provisioning and dietary diversity) ? 3) What household livelihood assets and strategies contribute to or limit food security and food sovereignty? Across the sample population, total agrobiodiversity and maize and bean production were strongly correlated with improved food security. Coffee income was not strongly correlated with improved food security, which suggests that income is used for priorities within the household other than food, despite seasonal food shortages. Results demonstrate the importance of balancing subsistence and commodity (i. e. coffee) production in these communities, where subsistence food serves as a risk management strategy to buffer against volatility in coffee prices, in addition to offsetting income that might be used for food towards non-food <b>expenses.</b> <b>Subsistence</b> production, which typically applies agroecological practices in this site, also holds important cultural and environmental value. The results of this research indicate that government policy and development practice should enable farmers to maintain the social, ecological and cultural processes that support the management of agrobiodiversity for subsistence and coffee...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} report is to identify and quantify the cost drivers of three district hospitals in the Western Cape, namely Knysna Hospital, Oudtshoorn Hospital and Mossel Bay Hospital, and to simultaneously measure value-driven performance indicators. An environmental scan identified various driving forces that would significantly affect change in the healthcare industry such as the brain drain of health professionals, consumerism and cost containment and efficiency initiatives. The Department of Health’s understanding of the eighth Batho Pele principle of value for money is generally understood as providing quality health care within prescribed cost limits. An attempt is made to establish {{the effect of the}} quadruple burden of disease (the HIV/AIDS pandemic, persistent infectious diseases, injury arising from violence and road traffic collisions and emerging chronic conditions) on hospital expenditure in the Eden District. Research identified Mossel Bay as a high TB burden area known as a TB “hotspot” and it is a recognized immigration transit point en route to Cape Town. The population analyses revealed that Mossel Bay is the growth point of the Eden District, showing extraordinary growth of 25 % between 2007 and 2009. Personnel costs: This study revealed that personnel costs are responsible for {{the overwhelming majority of the}} total expenditure of the district hospitals. Staff numbers, occupation specific dispensation (OSD) implementation and annual wage negotiations are the cost drivers of personnel costs. This study also found a clear correlation between an over-expenditure in personnel expenses and over-expenditure in the total expenditure of all three hospitals. Health care costs: Expenditure on blood products is considered a major cost driver of clinical expenses. Laboratory expenditure is clearly the largest cost driver for clinical expenses at all three hospitals. Together with laboratory expenses, medicine and medical supplies are the cost drivers for clinical expenses. Costs not related to health care: The three most significant administrative expenses are communication, stationery and printing as well as travel and subsistence allowances. The cost driver for <b>subsistence</b> and travel <b>expenses</b> is the number of vehicles followed by the preference of vehicle, which in turn determines the daily tariff and the kilometre tariff. This study revealed that Knysna Municipality has the cheapest electricity cost of the three towns. It is clear that cost and consumption of electricity and water are the two variables that affect municipal service expenditure the most. Equity: When the district hospital expenditure is combined with the primary health care expenditure in the three sub-districts, the figures show that Oudtshoorn is spending 3 % more than its equitable share of the total budget at a higher cost of R 978 per capita, in excess of R 100 above the district average. Efficiency: The cost per patient day equivalent (PDE) per economic classification for all three hospitals is less than the average cost per PDE of the district hospitals in the Western Cape. The cost/PDE of Oudtshoorn Hospital is considerably higher than that of Knysna and Mossel Bay in all economic classifications, with the single exception of the agency cost of Mossel Bay Hospital. The cost of health care always reflects a combination of price, quantity and value, and it is impossible to consider individual cost drivers in isolation. Several cost-saving initiatives and managerial control measures are recommended...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{response}} of Philippine rice farmers to uncertainties and associated risks in the production environment. Farmers' risk behaviour is analyzed {{within the context of}} land use intensification through the adoption and utilization of the socalled 'modern seed-fertilizer' technology. This technology has been criticized for its capital intensity and high riskiness compared to existing technology. Among others, farmers' aversion to take risks has been suggested as a possible factor explaining slow adoption rates of poor farmers. In order to investigate the impact of risk on decision making, a distinction should be made between (1) farmers' attitudes towards risk taking, i. e., the possibility that they are unwilling to take risks and to invest in risky but profitable technology causing an overall underinvestment in agricultural inputs and misallocation of resources and/or; (2) the farmers' inability to invest in risky technology because of a limited risk taking capacity leading to an unequal distribution of benefits derived from new technology among the rich and poor strata of the rural economy. Conceptual issues and practical problems in analyzing the influence of risk and uncertainty on farm-household decision making are discussed in Chapter 3. A critical review is presented of various theories concerning risky decision making. The general conclusion is that none of these theories have yet been tested {{to the extent that they}} can be used as an adequate framework for examining the occurrence of farmers' risk aversion and assessing the impact of risk on decisions. Chapter 4 describes the historical process of land use intensification in relation to population growth. It shows that the introduction of the 'modern' IRRI-released rice varieties (IR-varieties) and double rice cropping is just a new phase in a continuous process of land use intensification that started in the mid 1940 s with the closing of the land frontier in the rice lowland area. Compared to their predecessor BE- 3 - now considered a traditional rice variety - the adoption of IR-varieties has been relatively quick. However, adoption at an appreciable scale did not take place until farmers themselves - through various cultural adaptations - had augmented the attractiveness of growing IR- varieties under rainfed conditions. The new rice technology allowed a more effective use of family labour resources, and augmented the income of individual farmhouseholds. However, due to changes in the labour utilization pattern induced by this technology and the introduction of labour saving technology (rice threshers), job opportunities in the village did not increase, whereas income sharing between the poor and somewhat wealthier households declined and the economic position of women deteriorated. In the process of land use intensification, the overall risk that farm-households face has increased. The present land utilization pattern is characterized by intensive cropping systems on relatively small farm areas that have become strongly dependent on external inputs. The capacity of risk spreading between agricultural activities has become limited, whereas the overall financial risk of crop production has increased. The majority of development programmes imposed upon the village community during the 1970 s, did not contribute much to farmers' efforts to intensify rice crop production. Instead, they created an atmosphere of uncertainty and were counterproductive to the needs and economic development of households. In order to investigate the effect of risk on the household's ability to take advantage of the new crop technology, farmhouseholds were classified according to their sensitivity to income risks (Chapter 5). Two classification variables were employed: (1) the subsistence coverage factor indicating the household's capacity to generate a surplus income above basic subsistence requirements through crop activities, and (2) the family life cycle stage which among others determines family labour availability and the capacity to timely control crop production risks. Patterns of farm resource utilization, household income formation and consumption expenditures are analyzed in Chapter 6. Household categories differ substantially with respect to their ability to improve upon living conditions and risk taking capacity. In sharp contrast with surplus households, for non-surplus households there is hardly any room to cut back on household expenditures or create reserves. Forced by short-term subsistence pressures during the lean month period, young non-surplus households have to employ their scarce family labour resources on activities that provide immediate income affecting labour investments in self-employed agriculture. With a higher worker to consumer ratio, middle-aged non-surplus households are able to devote much more family labour to self-employed agricultural activities while at the same time providing for short-term income requirements through wage labour activities. In fact, these households face serious problems in finding remunerative employment for all their family labour resources. The possibility of increasing labour input in individual rice crops is economically marginal, whereas off-farm employment opportunities are limited. Compared to surplus households, non-surplus households show low productivities per labour hour mainly due to a lower level of cash input investments. The necessity to use credit to sustain <b>subsistence</b> and education <b>expenses</b> affects the capacity of nonsurplus households to invest in productive activities and induces them to credit rationing. Interest payments on loans acquired in poor production years usurp a substantial part of the income above basic subsistence needs realized in good production years. The middle-aged non-surplus households have to use income for the education of children in order to safeguard long-term security. In Chapter 7 the relationship between the household's risk sensitivity and the adoption of double rice cropping is investigated. Households differ with respect to the perceived risks of double rice cropping due to differences in risk control capacity resulting from differences in family labour availability and financial position. They also differ with respect to the need to intensify rice crop production. The importance of the family life cycle - a variable commonly lacking in adoption studies - on adoption behaviour is indicated. This factor may cause cyclical dynamics in technology utilization patterns, i. e., households may gradually change management orientation and pattern when moving from one life cycle to another. The adoption process shows that experimentation is a major tool of farmers to reduce uncertainty and that - in contrast with a commonly held belief experimentation with new crop technology is not a prerogative of wealthy farmers. Farmers' decisions with respect to the use of fertilizer in rice crop production are discussed in Chapter 8. An attempt is made to quantitatively assess the relative importance of resource-induced risk aversion as opposed to the farmers' risk taking willingness, and farmers' fertilizer response perceptions as opposed to risk aversion. Difficulties encountered in quantifying the various parameters playing a role in such an analysis are discussed. Fertilizer response under farmers' conditions are estimated and the risk of fertilizer application is empirically assessed. The farmer's perception of fertilizer response turns out to be strikingly similar to empirical estimates. In contrast with response perception and risk taking willingness, resource-induced risk aversion appears to be an important variable explaining differences in fertilizer application levels among household categories. However, perceptions and risk taking willingness are important in explaining differences between individual households. A summary of the salient features of the farmer's choice processes and a synthesis of major findings concerning farmers' risk behaviour is presented in Chapter 9. The study arrives at the overall conclusion that it is dangerous to base risk analyses on superficial observations and generalize about small farmers' risk behaviour. First, many farmers' production strategies and practices - often erroneously identified as resulting from risk averse behaviour - serve the dual purpose of reducing risk and attaining best economic results. Such strategies result from (1) cautious optimization over a certain period of time based on adaptation to changes in internal household conditions and external circumstances, search for improvements, and experimentation and; (2) sequential choice procedures and risk control within years based on adaptation to chance constraints and opportunities as they evolve in the course of a production cycle. They allow for an optimum use of environmental resources and are thus sound economic practice. Second, risk is not a well defined concept. It describes various types of uncertainty (e. g. yield vs. financial risk), whereas the degree of riskiness of activities depends on the risk taking capacity of households, comprising both the ability to timely control crop production risks through labour investments and the capacity to bear financial risks. Hence, crop production risks are not the same for different types of households, whereas financial risk is likely to differ between time periods. Within an apparently homogeneous group of small farm-households, differences in financial risk taking capacity and resource composition are such that households perceive different production risks as well as financial risks to similar activities, and thus show a different response to risks in agricultural production. Moreover, for the same household there may exist a conflict of interest between risk reduction in the short and medium term and in the medium and long term. Thus, without specifying the type of risk as well as the period and conditions under which decisions are made, it cannot be evaluated whether risk deters investments in inputs or adoption of technology more for one category of households than another. From a production point of view, farmers simply cannot be classified as risk seekers or risk averters. In fact, the same farmer may fit both categories. Farm-households are used to risk taking in agriculture. They are generally not much interested in stabilizing agricultural output if such implies an even moderate reduction in perceived income. It is not so much the perceived production risks in agricultural that influence choice behaviour of poor households, it is the need to opt for particular income earning activities that secure immediate subsistence needs and limit the impact of financial risks on subsistence security. In order to keep financial risk at a manageable level, households have to ration credit use and limit financial investments in agriculture. When risk-induced underinvestment occurs, it is caused by the limited capacity of poor households to take financial risks rather than by their risk averse attitudes. Given the continuous indebtedness of non-surplus households, perceived financial risk may constitute a serious cause for underinvestment in agriculture and widening income disparities between poor and wealthy households...|$|R

40|$|Ensuring the set {{of rights}} and freedoms {{that are part of}} the Treaty of Accession to the European Union (EU) seems to be a {{double-edged}} sword. If in 2000 s, these rights and freedoms were the main catalyst for accession to the European common market, currently these rights are generating consistent disputes among the Member States (MS). Geopolitical tensions that currently exist, along with the political changes that have occurred in certain MS have fuelled pessimism and lack of confidence in the ability of the European common market and the EU to deliver smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. We reached a point in which the very elements that underpinned the common market create suspicion regarding the future of the EU. Therefore, some opinions, (especially from politics) are in favour of a restricted or controlled access to these rights and freedoms in order to maintain stability in the EU, and the framework for growth. The significant increase of xenophobia, terrorism threats, migration crisis, populism, nationalism, and the Brexit are all elements covered by the public agenda and exerting a major pressure on the organization and functioning of the EU in general, and especially on the future of the Cohesion Policy. The development scenarios for Europe have been recently publicly released for debate, and they are a consequence of the concerns about the inability of the European development model to remain competitive globally. Our analysis was aimeds at the phenomenon of migration of the Romanian labour force in the frame of the current socio-economic climate; concretely, we made an analysis of the Romanian labour market, focused on social tensions manifested at this level, and on the one hand, and on the other hand, we analysed the minimum wage in Romania and other EU member states, namely the unemployment and the factors that influence it. The information we used came from multiple sources, such as economic literature, recent studies of various national and international bodies; statistical institutes of EU member states, etc. The economic analysis of unemployment has been completed by the utilization of a multiple linear regression model. The research first proposes a set of theoretical and methodological elements and aspects related to migration in general, and to international migration, in particular. Then, the paper analyzes the specificity of the labor market in Romania, proposing a more in-depth analysis of unemployment, which also includes an econometric model. The research enumerates the variables that determine and justify, at the same time, the emigration of Romanian workers. Also, the paper presents aspects related to the administration of the labor market in Romania, the social tensions emerging on this market, and the ratio between the minimum wage and the <b>subsistence</b> <b>expenses.</b> The number of Romanian emigrants is analyzed as well, having as source the diplomatic missions of our country in the host countries, and the national statistical institutes...|$|E
