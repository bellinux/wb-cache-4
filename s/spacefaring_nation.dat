40|$|The {{technological}} {{benefits of}} space hardware are universally recognized. One is {{hard pressed to}} find {{an area of the}} world where satellite dishes for television reception, satellite use for data transmission, or the Global Positioning System (GPS) for multiple purposes are not utilized. But utilization of commercial or of other countries’ space assets does not equate to being a space-faring nation. Space-faring nations have, to varying degrees, their own capabilities. The importance of status as a space-faring nation comes from two sources: not having to rely on others for access to the benefits of space assets, and prestige that can translate into geopolitical influence. Beyond users and space-faring nations, there are those countries actively asserting space leadership in some form, whether regional or global. What pushes countries to go beyond being a <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nation</b> and assert leadership potential, including potentially engaging in an implicit or explicit space race, is techno-nationalism, which {{for the purposes of this}} paper refers to nationalism that becomes the impetus for technology development as an indicator of geostrategic power. It is often triggered by a threat or perception of a threat, including a threat to perceived leadership. Techno-nationalism carries with it an inherent quest for leadership, by some definition. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{countries}} with more or less comprehensive national space legislation addressing in particular the authorization and supervision of private space activities continues to grow, and several more countries are currently {{in the process of}} adding themselves to that list. One of the more recent and most interesting ones among them is Nigeria, as the second African country after South Africa and—after Brazil—the second leading <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nation</b> from the developing world, to draft, further to a fairly recently established succinct framework law, a set of regulations addressing precisely those issues. The paper briefly recaps the underlying international obligations, in particular as following from Articles VI, VII, and VIII of the Outer Space Treaty, the Liability Convention, and the Registration Convention, Nigeria being a party to all three. It then proceeds to analyze the 2010 National Space Research and Development Agency Act and the 2015 draft Regulations on the Licensing and Supervision of Space Activities from the above perspective. It will compare the Nigerian legislation as needed or helpful with other national space laws already pronounced on those issues, and in doing so will take Nigeria’s role as leading African nation in outer space in this respect into consideration. This will finally allow for some conclusions as to the contribution to the further development of (international and national) space law represented by these Nigerian legislative efforts...|$|E

40|$|The 21 st {{century has}} seen the emergence, after the Soviet Union and the United States, of the third great space superpower: China. Here, in China in Space - The Great Leap Forward, Brian Harvey takes a {{contemporary}} {{look at the new}} Chinese space program. China has already launched its first space station, Tiangong; has sent its first spacecraft to the Moon, the Chang e; and has plans to send spaceships to Mars and further afield. China's annual launch rate has already overtaken those of both Europe and the United States. Huge new production plants and launch centers are under construction, to build and launch the new family of Long March 5, 6, and 7 rockets. In Roadmap 2050, the Academy of Sciences indicates that China intends to be the leading <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nation</b> by mid-century, with bases on the Moon and Mars. This book gives an informed, fully up-to-date commentary on all aspects of the Chinese space program, including its history, development, technology, missions, and the personalities involved. It lists all the Chinese launches, missions, and terminology, going behind the press releases to draw on hitherto unused scientific papers and sources.

Second, NASA considers the present space station, the ISS, to be valuable as a zero gravity laboratory, and its current microgravity environment was a conscious choice.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} {{commercial}} space activities {{beyond the scope}} of the satellite communications industry, and the development of many commercial spaceports, is leading many countries to consider how to regulate private space activities. The challenge is to regulate these activities in a manner that does not hinder or preclude investment, while still ensuring that commercial activities comply with international law. The developing nations are concerned that the <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nations</b> will monopolize space resources. However this may be resolved by simply extending the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to outer space.|$|R

50|$|Beyond the {{technical}} {{factors that could}} make living in space more widespread, {{it has been suggested}} that the lack of private property, the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against.

40|$|The Netherlands, {{being aware}} of its {{relative}} size {{when compared to the}} major <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nations</b> not only globally but also in the European context, has always addressed outer space and space activities {{from the perspective of the}} role it could feasibly play. It has thus concentrated on a few niche areas which were either closely aligned to existing capabilities and experience or seemed to offer possibilities for mid-size economies and societies to play an important role. The longstanding focus on scientific/technical aspects of space activities on the one hand, and on an international/legal context for them on the other, constitutes the key for understanding the approach of the Netherlands towards international space law, as well as to the possibility, desirability or even the need to create national space legislation as the main topic of the present book. The Dutch Space Activities Act deals in particular with private space activities for which the Netherlands could be held internationally responsible and/or liable under the corpus juris spatialis internationalis, and the more specific issue of establishing a formal registration procedure and a national register of space objects with a view to, inter alia, dealing with the same set of space activities. Discussed in detail are the Act 2 ̆ 7 s 28 sections in 7 chapters. Such major <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nations</b> within Europe as France, Germany, Italy and Spain, though all to some extent involved in discussions regarding the establishment of a proper national act dealing with, in particular, private space activities, have not yet achieved that feat. Even France, indeed, Western Europe’s foremost space power and enjoying the presence since many years of Arianespace and SpotImage, key players in the global private space arena, has only realized a national space act after the Dutch did...|$|R
40|$|Space debris {{represent}} {{a big concern}} for future space activities. Particularly at low Earth orbit there is a concentration of debris. Although the probability of impact are today relatively low some occurrences have been registered. The problem was addressed {{since the beginning of}} the space age and international treaties regulate the responsibilities of the <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nations.</b> LARES (LAser RElativity Satellite) mission was launched in 2012 and is currently operational. The scientific requirements and the mission design required a waiver to the European debris mitigation regulation for the launch.

The paper addresses possible legal scenarios in case LARES would be involved in an impact with a space debris...|$|R
30|$|International {{governance}} policies {{exist to}} reduce debris generation through multiple technical and operational means (IADC 2007). Incomplete {{compliance with the}} measures are increasing the chances that orbits become more “polluted” with debris, and increase the probability of destructive hypervelocity impacts. A spacecraft operator’s action to not maintain the fuel reserve needed to boost a satellite to a disposal orbit or deorbit, either through neglect or profit motives, or to not reenter a spent upper stage rocket in order to devote that fuel to lofting heavier payloads, could ultimately end in a consequential explosion or collision that generates harmful debris with detrimental effects on all nation’s assets and the shared orbits. The more <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nations</b> become dependent on space critical infrastructures, the more interested they should become in the conservation of “orbital infrastructure.” Orbital debris has no national boundaries.|$|R

30|$|The {{values of}} target and {{critical}} loads {{for a specific}} ecosystem are based on careful study and analysis. For critical orbits, defining target and critical loads will be influenced by factors specific to the space domain. While critical loads may be set by the capabilities of current orbital debris shielding technologies (for example, Whipple Shields) or by the satellite operators’ and insurance companies’ risk tolerance, target loads may be more challenging to define. Once the target load threshold has been reached for a critical orbit, policy may dictate no new operations unless debris remediation measures {{are included in the}} launch vehicle and satellite to minimize the probability of generating additional debris and exceeding the critical load threshold. Debris remediation measures drive up system costs through increased design complexity and mission complexity, and may be a cost burden for emerging <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nations.</b> But it is {{a small price to pay}} to maintain the sustainability of critical orbits. An agreed-upon strategy or policy is necessary to set target loads and how the orbit is used after the target load is exceeded.|$|R
30|$|Countries {{around the}} world are {{increasingly}} dependent on space assets to fulfill many civilian and military critical infrastructure functions such as communications, earth imaging, navigation, and early warning systems. Sustainment of space assets is now paramount to the economies and security of <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nations.</b> In the United States, critical infrastructures are thought of as so important that their loss would have a debilitating effect on the security or economic welfare of the country (DHS 2013). Communications satellites and associated ground station assets {{are a part of the}} communications critical infrastructure in the United States (DHS 2010). Space is probably not recognized as a sector-specific critical infrastructure in the United States due to the crosscutting and global nature of its applications. Europe has already taken steps to classify space as a critical sector and actions are under way to classify certain space assets as critical infrastructures deserving of increased measures of protection (Schmieer 2015). The economic value of space assets cannot be overstated. According to the Satellite Industry Association, global industry revenues were USD 189.2 billion in 2013 (SIA 2014).|$|R
40|$|Japan and China, as two {{advanced}} <b>spacefaring</b> <b>nations</b> in Asia-Pacific region, {{are often}} referred to as rivals in space. China's successful manned space launch program in 2003 and ASAT test in 2007 were considered as turning points which potentially introduces a "space race in Asia". This article argues that there are three defining arenas in a space race: competition for prestige or soft power, competition over military capability or hard power, and competition of international services or public goods. It analyzes the objectives, norms and logics of space policy in Japan and China, and argues that these two countries have quite different thinking over what to do in space, explaining that they are playing different games in the first two arenas. However, Japan and China are competing for leadership and influence over the region. APRSAF and APSCO, two similar regional space organizations, are the vehicles for this competition. It concludes that there is a space race only in the third arena as a competition for leadership in Asia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
