50|$|The shaving {{process is}} a {{finishing}} operation where {{a small amount of}} metal is sheared away from an already blanked part. Its main purpose is to obtain better dimensional accuracy, but secondary purposes include <b>squaring</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> and smoothing the edge. Blanked parts can be shaved to an accuracy of up to 0.025 mm (0.001 in).|$|E

50|$|Individual mesh {{elements}} may be millimeters to centimeters, usually from 1-1.5 to 2-3 cm, and entire mesh patterns {{can cover}} areas up to a <b>square</b> meter. <b>The</b> <b>edges</b> or threads {{that make up}} the mesh are usually cylindrical or ellipsoid in cross-section, and some forms have vertical tubes connecting the mesh upwards to the sediment-water interface. Dolf Seilacher proposed in 1977 that it may be a trap for food, a mechanism for farming, or a foraging path. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} it may be a cast of a xenophyophoran protist.|$|R

He thought he would just try them a little, and began to stand them up in such a manner as to make the four walls of a house. He found, however, an {{unexpected}} difficulty; for although the chips were large and <b>square,</b> yet <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> were so sharp that they would not stand up very well.|$|R
50|$|Fox Township {{occupies}} <b>the</b> 6 mile <b>square</b> on <b>the</b> western <b>edge</b> of Kendall County, Illinois.

5000|$|... "A {{circular}} cut is {{made with}} a shell in the bark above {{the root of the}} tree; the tree is broken off, and in a few days, when the stem is half-dry, the bark and bast are separated from it. The bast is then cleaned and macerated in water, after which it is beaten with the ribbed club on a wooden block. This beating enlivens a village in Tonga as threshing does in Europe. In half an hour the piece will have changed in shape from a strip almost to a <b>square.</b> <b>The</b> <b>edges</b> are snipped with shells, and a large number of the pieces are drawn separately over a semi-cylindrical wooden stamp, on which the pattern, worked in coco-fibre, is stretched and smeared with a fluid at once adhesive and colouring. On each a second and third layer is placed; and the piece, three layers thick, is coloured more strongly in the parts which are thrown into relief by the inequalities of the bed. Others are annexed to it both at the side and the end, until pieces a yard wide, and 20 to 25 yards long, are produced.|$|R
