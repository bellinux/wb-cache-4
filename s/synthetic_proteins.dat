25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{researchers}} developed zinc finger nucleases, <b>synthetic</b> <b>proteins</b> whose DNA-binding domains {{enable them to}} create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require {{the creation of a}} custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires making only a short RNA sequence.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the entire}} field of {{synthetic}} biology began with researchers such as Erik T. Kool, where bases other than A, C, T and G {{are used in}} a synthetic DNA. In addition to synthetic DNA there are also attempts to construct synthetic codons, synthetic endonucleases, <b>synthetic</b> <b>proteins</b> and synthetic zinc fingers. Using synthetic DNA, instead of there being 43 codons, if there are n new bases there could {{be as many as}} n3 codons. Research is currently being done to see if codons can be expanded to more than 3 bases. These new codons can code for new amino acids. These synthetic molecules can be used not only in medicine, but in creation of new materials.|$|E
25|$|RhlA is an α, β {{hydrolase}} (analysis by Fugue structural prediction programme). This fold is {{a common}} structural motif in fatty acid <b>synthetic</b> <b>proteins</b> and RhlA shows homology to transacylases. It has been shown using enzyme assays that the substrate for RhlA is hydroxyacyl-ACP rather than hydroxyacyl-CoA suggesting that it catalyses the formation of HAAs directly from the type II fatty acid synthase pathway (FASII). Furthermore, RhlA preferentially interacts with hydroxyacyl-ACP with an acyl chain length of ten carbon residues. The hydroxyacyl-ACP substrate of RhlA {{is the product of}} FabG, a protein which encodes the NADPH-dependent β-keto-acyl-ACP reductase required for fatty acid synthesis. It {{is a member of the}} FASII cycle along with FabI and FabA, which synthesise the precursors utilised by FabG.|$|E

2500|$|The DNA {{double helix}} {{structure}} proposed by Watson and Crick {{was based upon}} [...] "Watson-Crick" [...] bonds between the four bases most frequently found in DNA (A, C, T, G) and RNA (A, C, U, G).

50|$|DNA {{within our}} bodies {{naturally}} breaks down, replicates itself, and rebuilds itself {{every time a}} cell divides. These processes are all controlled and completed by various enzymes. DNA molecules are composed of corresponding base pair nucleotides in a double-helix formation, which makes these processes very efficient, accurate, and predictable. Due to {{the ease with which}} DNA molecules can be fashioned, many publications in the academic society are geared towards creating nanostructures using DNA. With a DNA-based nano-device, <b>synthetic</b> <b>proteins</b> could be created, designed to deactivate a nano-device.

50|$|While {{assisting}} the Teen Titans in battling Superboy-Prime, {{members of the}} Doom Patrol had flashbacks to their original history. Robotman and Niles Caulder regained memories of the previous Doom Patrol teams with which they had worked. This battle apparently undid some of Superboy-Prime's timeline changes, and resulted in a timeline incorporating all previous incarnations of the Doom Patrol, but with Rita Farr and Larry Trainor still alive. The Chief confirmed that Rita was indeed killed by Zahl's explosion. The Chief claimed that he later found her skull and treated it with <b>synthetic</b> <b>proteins</b> until her malleable body was regrown from it.|$|E
50|$|Researchers are {{pursuing}} {{the building of}} nanostructures using amino acids. Nanostructures that are created using amino acids are constructed using only synthetic types of amino acids, which tags these structures with unique molecules. These engineered amino acids essentially form <b>synthetic</b> <b>proteins</b> that differ from the naturally occurring proteins in the human body. This difference in the engineered amino acids makes these proteins easy to isolate and target. In case of failure or malfunction, {{it is possible to}} identify these proteins using the specifically targeted molecules, which act as a flag to indicate the location of the target. Then, another mechanism would be used to isolate them and deactivate them.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical {{labeling}} {{or the use}} {{of chemical}} tags utilizes the interaction between a small molecule and a specific genetic amino acid sequence. [...] Chemical labeling is sometimes used as an alternative for GFP. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>proteins</b> that function as fluorescent probes are smaller than GFP's, and therefore can function as probes in a wider variety of situations. Moreover, they offer a wider range of colors and photochemical properties. [...] With recent advancements in chemical labeling, Chemical tags are preferred over fluorescent proteins due to the architectural and size limitations of the fluorescent protein's characteristic β-barrel. Alterations of fluorescent proteins would lead to loss of fluorescent properties.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept that}} {{capillary}} blood, obtained from pricking the heel or finger and blotted onto filter paper, {{could be used}} to screen for metabolic diseases in large populations of neonates was introduced in Scotland by Robert Guthrie in 1963. Neonatal screening for phenylketonuria became nationwide in 1969-70. Since then, Guthrie card samples have been collected routinely from infants in over 20 countries to screen for phenylketonuria and more recently for congenital hypothyroidism, sickle cell disorders and HIV infection. The limitations of sensitivity and specificity when screening such small volumes of blood restricted the use of dried blood spots for many years.

Here, we discuss a novel bottom-up approach to understanding biological motors by considering the construction of <b>synthetic</b> <b>protein</b> motors. Specifically, we present a design for a <b>synthetic</b> <b>protein</b> motor that moves along a linear track, dubbed the "Tumbleweed.

Here we describe how de novo peptide design and molecular biology could be used to produce the Tumbleweed, and we explore the fundamental motor operation of such a design using numerical simulations. The construction of this and more sophisticated protein motors is an exciting challenge that is likely to enhance our understanding of the structure-function relationship in biological motors.
