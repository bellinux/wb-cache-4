25|$|Charles Fox Parham, an {{independent}} holiness evangelist who believed strongly in divine healing, {{was an important}} figure {{to the emergence of}} Pentecostalism as a distinct Christian movement. In 1900, he started a school near Topeka, Kansas, which he named Bethel Bible School. There he taught that speaking in tongues was the scriptural evidence for the reception of the baptism with the Holy Spirit. On January 1, 1901, after a watch night service, the students prayed for and received the baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues. Parham received this <b>same</b> <b>experience</b> sometime later and began preaching it in all his services. Parham believed this was xenoglossia and that missionaries would no longer need to study foreign languages. After 1901, Parham closed his Topeka school and began a four-year revival tour throughout Kansas and Missouri. He taught that the baptism with the Holy Spirit was a third experience, subsequent to conversion and sanctification. Sanctification cleansed the believer, but Spirit baptism empowered for service.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Dover Area School District reports {{employing}} 351 {{teachers and}} administrators with a salary range of $39,277 to $135,200. Teachers earn extra pay for duties such as advising the clubs, writing curriculum or coaching athletics teams. That amount ranges from several hundred dollars a year to a few thousand. When a team progresses past the regular season the coaches are paid additional dollars for each week the teams continues to play. All of this is stipulated in the teachers' union contract at each district. Additionally, the district's teacher union contract includes seven levels, from a bachelor's degree to a doctorate. A teacher with five years of experience and a doctorate would make about $7,500 more than one with the <b>same</b> <b>experience</b> and a master's degree. A teacher who achieves {{a higher level of}} education receives a raise in step pay and then the annual raise, as well. The school contract year is 190 days. In addition to salary, the teachers receive an extensive benefits package which includes: health insurance, life insurance, vision insurance, dental insurance, a defined benefit pension, 10 paid sick and 2-3 paid personal days, reimbursement for college courses and more.|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, AllMusic {{reviewer}} Jason Birchmeier criticized Experimental Jet Set for its stripped-down sound, {{saying that}} the album only contains [...] "odd lyrics and unique guitar nuance." [...] Similarly, Evelyn McDonnell of Entertainment Weekly noted that the songs [...] "never quite emerge from the sketch stage" [...] and that newcomers may {{find it difficult to}} appreciate. In contrast, Alternative Press highlighted the album's anti-commercial aesthetic, claiming that [...] "It doesn't get much cooler than this". The Advocate criticized the album and the band for not taking risks, concluding: [...] "Sonic Youth is stuck repeating the <b>same</b> <b>experience.</b> And this time around, the songs don't stick." [...] Mike Rubin, writing for Spin, described Experimental Jet Set as a [...] "low-key, mellow affair", but highlighted the guitar playing and the audio feedback on some songs.|$|E
500|$|Since {{several members}} of the team enjoyed racing games and had also worked on Diddy Kong Racing, they decided to include the futuristic Ant racing {{featured}} in the campaign and the top-down arcade racing games in the multiplayer. Developers initially considered the possibility to use the 4MB Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, but the idea was eventually dropped. According to Mountain, [...] "we wanted to deliver the <b>same</b> <b>experience</b> to all players and were confident that we could do this using the standard 4MB of RAM on the console." [...] This led to some confusion as the box cover for the original release stated that it did support such a feature. Nintendo provided a quick-fix to the mislabeled covers by providing stickers declaring its Rumble Pak compatibility and fixed later printings of the boxes.|$|E

500|$|A {{port for}} Android and Kindle Fire was {{announced}} on September later that year. The app was released for those platforms on February 11, 2016.

Additionally, he said that those using the Android port will have the <b>same</b> <b>experience</b> as those playing Alto's in the iOS.

500|$|Cameron {{himself said}} {{he decided to}} open the film in December {{so that it would}} have less {{competition}} from then to January.

Gray said, [...] "At this point, {{people who are going to}} see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Gaga explained {{that she wanted to}} put together an expensive looking, beautiful show which would be affordable for her fans.

According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was [...] "essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage." [...] The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured {{in such a way that}} the box fit any stage. [...] "So no matter where I go, my fans get the <b>same</b> <b>experience.</b> So often you go into theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths, so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show", she added.|$|E

500|$|The {{stage was}} {{designed}} by production designer Steven Cohen and production manager Rob Brenner for the HBO special. This {{was the first time}} Spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end-stage with a ramp and stairs at the center as on her first 3 tours (the ...Baby One More Time Tour, the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, and the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour). Cohen designed the main stage with an oval shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said {{that the rest of the}} stage was created with three main components in mind: a runway, a B-stage, and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, [...] "around this Cleopatra's barge concept I got into my head while designing when the movie Cleopatra was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech, because it was going to have to be traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." [...] Brenner continued, [...] "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the <b>same</b> <b>experience</b> as the one in the first 10 rows." [...] The runway uniting the main stage and the B-stage was suggested by one of Spears's managers, Johnny Wright. The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. Cohen said, [...] "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] did a great job on executing the fine details like the hand railings and the floor lights and the MR-16 covers. When you're doing something for TV, all of those pieces are foreground pieces. The mirrors on the platforms and the floor painting made the show look better on TV." ...|$|E
