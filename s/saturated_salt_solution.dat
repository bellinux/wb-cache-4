5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of <b>saturated</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution</b> is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E

40|$|In seed storage research, {{moisture}} content {{can be maintained}} by providing a stable relative humidity (e. g. over <b>saturated</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solutions)</b> or by hermetic storage, but the two approaches provide different gaseous environments which might affect longevity. Seeds of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) were stored at 45 degrees C or 50 degrees C, respectively, with different {{moisture content}}s maintained by hermetic storage in laminated-aluminium-foil packets, or by desiccators above either <b>saturated</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solutions</b> or moistened silica gel. Seeds were withdrawn from storage at intervals from 1 to 28 d for up to 480 d and viability estimated. Within a species, the negative logarithmic relation between seed longevity and moisture content did not differ (P> 0. 25, timothy; > 0. 05, sesame) between storage in desiccators over either moistened silica gel or <b>saturated</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solutions,</b> whereas the relation was much steeper (P< 0. 005) in hermetic storage: longevity was similar at high moisture contents, but at low values much greater with hermetic storage. This effect of storage method on seed longevity's sensitivity to moisture content implies that oxygen is relatively more deleterious to seeds at lower than at greater moisture contents and confirms that hermetic storage is preferable for long-term seed storage at low moisture contents...|$|R

5000|$|The {{compression}} ratio in a MVR unit does not usually exceed 1.8. At a {{compression ratio}} of 1.8, if the evaporation is performed at atmospheric pressure (0.101 MPa), the condensation pressure after compression will be 0.101 x 1.8 = 0.1818 MPa. At this pressure, the condensation {{temperature of the}} water vapor at the heat exchanger will be 390 K. Taking into account the boiling point elevation of the salt water we wish to evaporate (8 K for a <b>saturated</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution),</b> this leaves a temperature difference of less than 8 K at the heat exchanger. A small ∆T leads to slow heat transfer, meaning that we will need a very large heating surface to transfer the required heat.

40|$|An {{adjustable}} pump for microfluidics employing {{principles of}} osmoregulation analogous {{to those of}} phloem loading in plant leaves has been constructed and tested. Volume flow arises in a hollow fibre with vapour-permeable hydrophobic membrane. The fibre is connected to a source chamber filled with salt crystals and <b>saturated</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution.</b> The source chamber takes up water through a relatively small membrane area and delivers <b>saturated</b> <b>salt</b> <b>solution</b> to {{one end of the}} capillary flow path within the hollow fibre.
