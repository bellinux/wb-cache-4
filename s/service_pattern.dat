This was changed in the mid-1990s, with a more frequent service to Avonmouth but very few on to Severn Beach and no Sunday services. Services at Stapleton Road were boosted due to the proximity of Eastville Stadium, but this use ended in 1986 when Bristol Rovers F.C. moved to Twerton Park in Bath.|$|E

Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched.

All trains along the Severn Beach Line ran to Severn Beach, but the <b>service</b> <b>pattern</b> was irregular. This was changed in the mid-1990s, with a more frequent service to Avonmouth but very few on to Severn Beach and no Sunday services. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. Services along the Severn Beach Line were increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005, with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, which was rebranded in 2015 as Great Western Railway. A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the Severn Beach Line. Passenger traffic increased significantly, and in 2010, Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine type of care, {{oral health}} status and <b>service</b> <b>patterns</b> by {{country of birth}} and language. METHODS: A random sample of public-funded {{patients}} (n = 6, 109) was surveyed in 1995 - 96. RESULTS: Emergency care was highest among overseas-born patients who spoke a non-English language at home; edentulism was highest among Australian-born/English only patients; while {{a higher percentage of}} Australian-born persons were in the periodontal health category (chi 2; p < 0. 05). Differences in caries experience were generally small (ANOVA; p < 0. 05). Service provision varied by country of birth/language after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, type of care, and oral health status in six service areas (logistic regression; p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Service</b> <b>patterns</b> may reflect behavioural and cultural factors of patients or providers operating independently of socio-demographic and oral health status variables.

Intervention research is important to the advancement of programs designed to protect the safety of children, improve family functioning, as well as prevent out-of-home placement. Employing a retrospective “clinical data-mining” (CDM) methodology, this exploratory study of Families First, an IFPS program, makes use of available information extracted from client records to describe interventions and <b>service</b> <b>patterns</b> provided over a two year period. This study uncovers actual IFPS <b>service</b> <b>patterns,</b> demonstrates IFPS program fidelity, as well as reveals the usefulness of CDM as a social work research methodology.
