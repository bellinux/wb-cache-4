50|$|Series wound {{electric}} motors respond to increased load by slowing down; the current increases and the torque rises {{in proportion to}} the square of the current since the same current flows in both the armature and the field windings. If the motor is stalled, the current is limited only by the total resistance of the windings and the torque can be very high, and there is a danger of the windings becoming overheated. The counter-EMF aids the armature resistance to limit the current through the armature. When power is first applied to a motor, the armature does not rotate. At that instant, the counter-EMF is zero and the only factor limiting the armature current is the armature resistance. Usually the armature resistance of a motor is low; therefore the current through the armature would be very large when the power is applied. Therefore the need can arise for an additional resistance in series with the armature to limit the current until the motor rotation can build up the counter-EMF. As the motor rotation builds up, the resistance is gradually cut out. The speed-torque characteristic is an almost perfectly straight line between the stall torque and the no-load speed. This suits large inertial loads as the speed will drop until the motor slowly starts to rotate and these motors have a very high <b>stalling</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{external}} torque on the F 1 -ATPase rotary molecular motor are studied {{from the viewpoint}} of recent advances in stochastic thermodynamics. This motor is modeled in terms of discrete-state and continuous-state stochastic processes. The dependence of the discrete-state description on external torque and friction is obtained by fitting its transition rates to a continuous-angle model based on Newtonian mechanics with Langevin fluctuating forces and reproducing experimental data on this motor. In this approach, the continuous-angle model is coarse-grained into discrete states separated by both mechanical and chemical transitions. The resulting discrete-state model allows us to identify the regime of tight chemomechanical coupling of the F 1 motor and to infer that its chemical and mechanical efficiencies may reach values close to the thermodynamically allowed maxima near the <b>stalling</b> <b>torque.</b> We also show that, under physiological conditions, the F 1 motor is functioning in a highly-nonlinear- response regime, providing a rotation rate a million times faster than would be possible in the linear-response regime of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Furthermore, the counting statistics of fluctuations can be obtained in the tight-coupling regime thanks to the discrete-state stochastic process and we demonstrate that the so-called fluctuation theorem provides a useful method for measuring the thermodynamic forces driving the motor out of equilibrium. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

40|$|While {{conventional}} turbines {{have been}} extensively researched and tested, Tesla and boundary layer type turbines have not. In {{order to construct}} a dynamometer, thermodynamic flow apparatus and future turbines, we modeled the Tesla turbine using theoretical calculations and preliminary experiments. Thus a series of experiments were run to determine <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> and maximum run speed for a known pressure range. This data was then applied to modeling formulas to estimate <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> over an extended range of variables. The data were then used to design an appropriate dynamometer and airflow experiment. The model data also served to estimate various specifications and power output of the future turbine. An Obi Laser SSTG&# 8208; 001 Tesla turbine {{was used in the}} experiments described. Experimental <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> measurements were conducted in two stages. Shaft speed measurements were taken with an optical laser tachometer and Tesla turbine <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> was measured using a spring force gauge. Two methods were chosen to model Tesla turbine stall torque: 1) flow over flat plate and 2) free vortex with a sink. A functional dynamometer and thermodynamic apparatus were constructed once the model was confirmed to be within the experimental uncertainty. Results of the experiments show that the experimental turbine at 65 PSI has a speed of approximately 27, 000 RPM and a measured <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> of 0. 1279 N&# 8208;m. 65 PSI is an important data point because that data set is the cut&# 8208;off from laminar to turbulent flow.

In conclusion, the experimental turbine was seen to have a laminar and a turbulent flow regime at different air pressures, rather than the assumed laminar flow regime.

Ultrasonic motors offer {{the advantage of}} low speed, high torque operation {{without the need for}} gears. They can be made compact and lightweight and provide a holding torque in the absence of applied power, due to the traveling wave frictional coupling mechanism between the rotor and the stator. This report covers modeling, simulation, fabrication and testing of ultrasonic motors. Design of experiments methods were also utilized to find optimal motor parameters.

3000|$|The range R {{reflects}} the influence level of each geometrical parameter on the hydrodynamic {{characteristics of a}} torque converter. The contribution value C {{was defined as the}} percentage of the R value of a specific factor to the total R values of all the factors. A factor with larger R would have more influence on torque converter performance indicators, and was considered as an important factor during converter design. While factors with small range value R would be considered as less important factors during design procedure. It could be found in Table  4 that, parameters turbine outlet angle β_T 2 and stator outlet angle β_S 2 are the two most important factors. To be more precise, the descending sort of range R is β_T 2 > β_S 2 > β_T 1 > β_S 1 > β_I 2 > β_I 1 for <b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> ratio, and β_T 2 > β_S 2 > β_T 1 > β_I 2 > β_I 1 > β_S 1 for peak efficiency. Therefore, more focuses are needed on the optimization of turbine outlet angle and stator outlet angle in the design phase, in order to achieve better performance of the flat torque converter. It {{should be noted that the}} results may have some difference with the conclusions studied before. This is possible caused by the level selection of design parameters.

50|$|The {{characteristics}} of the torque converter must be carefully matched to the torque curve of the power source and the intended application.

This was done first at low field strengths, then at field strengths generating speeds high enough to disrupt motor function, and finally at low field strengths. Comparison of the initial and final speed versus applied-torque plots yielded relative motor torque. For backward rotation, motor torque rose steeply at speeds close to zero, peaking, on average, at about 2. 2 times the <b>stall</b> <b>torque.</b> For forward rotation, motor torque remained approximately constant up to speeds of about 60 % of the zero-torque speed.

The simulation results show that the overall performance tends to deteriorate as the flatness ratio decreases. Then a parametric study covering six geometric parameters, namely, inlet and outlet angles of impeller, turbine, and stator is carried out. The results demonstrate that the inlet and outlet angles {{play an important role in}} determining the performance characteristics of a torque converter. Furthermore, the relative importance of the six design parameters is investigated using DOE method for each response (<b>stall</b> <b>torque</b> ratio and peak efficiency).
