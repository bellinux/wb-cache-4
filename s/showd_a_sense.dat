Cornered by Gerard Gordeau and sporting an improved game, Ben rushed Paulson through the fight with multiple takedown attempts, along with brawling style punches and some hip tosses which connected. However, Erik <b>showd</b> <b>a</b> proficient defense and superior striking, and the fight went outside the ring when the two fell between the ropes and later when Paulson threw Spijkers outside. Ending came at the fifth round when Paulson avoided another takedown attempt and locked a guillotine choke, making Spijkers tap.|$|R

Postoperative complications were intimately related to the operative indicetion selected, i. e. preoperative chemotherapy.

The rate was higher in case of presenting becilli in sputum from the cavity even after a long duration of chemotherapy and in case of developing resistant bacilli.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the relationships between rangeland index species and soil characteristics in Markazi province. 10 plots (1 x 1 m) were used in each of vegetation types. 10 profiles (depths of 0 - 20 and 20 - 40 cm) were dug in each type and soil samples were collected. The following characteristics of soil were determined in the lab: texture (percent of clay, silt and sand), organic matter (OM%), amount of lime (CaCO 3), electroconductivity (EC) and pH. Using SPSS, one way ANOVA and multiple regression analysis were made. The results showed that Artemisia herba alba had the highest relationship with sand and clay in 0 - 20 and 20 - 40 cm respectively. Noeae mucronata <b>showd</b> <b>a</b> negative relationship with EC in upper horizon and a positive relationship with loam and CaCO 3 in the subsoil. Stipa barbata had negative relationship with loam in both horizones. Cousinia sp. Showed positive relaionship with OM% in the upper horizon.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{presents}} the results of the second series of sorting analyses with household waste, collected after separate collection at source in the municipality of Lemsterland. The sorting analyses took place in october 1991 and form part of a pilot project, called 'de dubbele duobak' (dual duobin). The main purpose of this project is to achieve a more extended reduction of the amount of household waste by separate collection at source. In Lemsterland each household is provided with two dual-chamber wheeled bins. The first bin contains a paper/carboard fraction and a mixture ('PMD') of plastics/metals/drinks-packaging (laminated cardboard); the other bin contains a fraction of garden, fruit and vegatable waste ('GFV') and a residual fraction. Of each fraction two samples were collected at two different locations and analysed on the composition, purity and response. The results on GFV- and paperfractions <b>showd</b> <b>a</b> purity which amount to 96 % or more, and a response of more than 80 %. The PMD-fraction showed a purity of 70 % and a response of 67 %. The response of glass containers (glass does not form part of the house-to-house collection) showed also a very high response rate (92 %). A provisionally estimate on the total reduction of the amount of household waste, {{based on the results of}} the participating households in 1991, showed a recycling percentage of 58 %...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: to {{evaluate}} dimensions of both parents' postnatal {{sense of security}} the first week after childbirth, and to determine associations between the PPSS instrument and different sociodemographic and situational background variables. DESIGN: evaluative, cross-sectional design. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: 113 mothers and 99 fathers with children live born at term, from five hospitals in southern Sweden. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: mothers and fathers had similar feelings concerning postnatal sense of security. Of the dimensions in the PPSS instrument, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of midwives'/nurses' empowering behaviour, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of one's own general well-being and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of the mother's well-being as experienced by the father {{were the most important}} dimensions for parents' experienced security. <b>A</b> <b>sense</b> of affinity within the family (for both parents) and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of manageable breast feeding (for mothers) were not significantly associated with their experienced security. <b>A</b> <b>sense</b> of participation during pregnancy and general anxiety were significantly associated background variables for postnatal sense of security for both parents. For the mothers, parity and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that the father was participating during pregnancy were also significantly associated. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: more focus on parents' participation during pregnancy as well as midwives'/nurses' empowering behaviour during the postnatal period will be beneficial for both parents' postnatal sense of security...|$|R
