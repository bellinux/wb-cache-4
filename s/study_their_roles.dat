40|$|Like other herpesviruses, human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{contains a}} unique proteinaceous layer between the virion envelope and capsid, termed the tegument. Upon infection, {{the contents of}} the tegument layer are delivered to the host cell, along with the capsid and the viral genome, where they facilitate the initial stages of virus replication. The tegument proteins also play important roles in virion assembly and this dual nature makes them attractive potential targets for antiviral therapies. While our knowledge regarding tegument protein function during the initiation of infection {{has been the subject of}} intense <b>study,</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> in assembly are much less well understood.

40|$|The {{occlusion}} derived form of baculovirus is specially {{adapted for}} primary {{infection of the}} host midgut epithelium. As such, the virion must contain the proteins essential for host range determination and initiation of infection. Because knowledge of virion composition {{is a prerequisite for}} functional investigation, this study used a combination of techniques to identify the proteins present within or associated with the occlusion-derived virus (ODV) virion. Thirty-one proteins, including proteins known to be essential for viral DNA replication, were identified with confidence. An additional 13 proteins were identified by using one of the three techniques. A comparison of gene conservation among the ODV proteins encoded in the 16 sequenced baculoviridae genomes is presented. With knowledge of the composition of ODV, it is now possible to target proteins and <b>study</b> <b>their</b> <b>role(s)</b> during primary infection...|$|E

First, we define some homotopical kinds of the unique path lifting property and find all possible relationships between them. Moreover, we supplement the full relationships of these new notions in the presence of fibrations. Second, we deduce some results in the category of fibrations with these notions instead of unique path lifting such as the existence of products and coproducts. Also, we give a brief comparison of these new categories to some categories of the other generalizations of covering maps.

40|$|Intracellular {{bacteria}} and viruses must survive the vigorous antimicrobial responses of their hosts to replicate successfully. The cellular process of autophagy — in which compartments bound by double membranes engulf {{portions of the}} cytosol and then mature to degrade their cytoplasmic contents — {{is likely to be}} one such host-cell response. Several lines of evidence show that both {{bacteria and}} viruses are vulnerable to autophagic destruction and that successful pathogens have evolved strategies to avoid autophagy, or to actively subvert its components, to promote their own replication. The molecular mechanisms of the avoidance and subversion of autophagy by microorganisms will be the subject of much future research, not only to <b>study</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> in the replication of these microorganisms, but also because they will provide — as bacteria and viruses so often have — unique tools to study the cellular process itself.

40|$|Integrins are a {{large family}} of cell {{adhesion}} receptors involved {{in a variety of}} cellular functions. To <b>study</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> at central synapses, we used two cre recombinase lines to delete the Itgb 11 integrin gene in forebrain excitatory neurons at different developmental stages. Removal of the 1 integrins at an embryonic stage resulted in severe cortical lamination defects without affecting the cellular organiza-tion of pyramidal neurons in the CA 3 and CA 1 regions of the hippocampus. Whereas the hippocampal neurons underwent normal dendritic and synaptic differentiation, the adult synapses exhibited deficits in responses to high-frequency stimulation (HFS), as well as in long-term potentiation (LTP). Deletion of 1 integrin at a later postnatal stage also impaired LTP but not synaptic responses to HFS. Thus, the 1 -class integrins appear to play distinct roles at different stages of synaptic development, critical for the propermaturation of readily releasable pool of vesicles during early development but essential for LTP throughout adult life.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{propagation of}} an intense ultrafast laser pulse in atmosphere or other gas media leads to filamentation, a phenomenon useful for {{applications such as}} remote sensing, spectral broadening and shaping of ultrashort laser pulses, terahertz generation, and guiding of electrical discharges. Axially extended optical filaments result from the dynamic balance between nonlinear self-focusing in the gas and refraction from the free electron distribution generated by laser ionization. In the air, self-focusing is caused by two nonlinear optical processes: (1) the nearly-instantaneous, electronic response owing to the distortion of electron orbitals, and (2) the delayed, orientational effect due to the torque applied by the laser field on the molecules with anisotropic polarizability. To <b>study</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> in filamen-tary propagation as well as influences on plasma generation in atmosphere, these effects were experimentally examined by a sensitive, space- and time-resolved tech-nique based on single-shot supercontinuum spectral interferometry (SSSI), which is capable of measuring ultrafast refractive index shift in the optical medium.

Caenorhabditis elegans not only possesses most known small RNA pathways, {{it is also an}} easy system to <b>study</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> and interactions during development. It has been proposed that in C. elegans, some small RNA pathways compete for access to common limiting resources. The strongest evidence supporting this model is that disrupting the production or stability of endogenous short interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) enhances sensitivity to experimentally induced exogenous RNA interference (exo-RNAi). Here, we examine the relationship between the endo-siRNA and microRNA (miRNA) pathways, and find that, consistent with competition among these endogenous small RNA pathways, endo-siRNA pathway mutants may enhance miRNA efficacy. Furthermore, we show that exo-RNAi may also compete with both endo-siRNAs and miRNAs. Our data thus provide support that all known Dicer-dependent small RNA pathways may compete for limiting common resources. Finally, we observed that both endo-siRNA mutants and animals experiencing exo-RNAi have increased expression of miRNA-regulated stage-specific developmental genes. These observations suggest that perturbing the small RNA flux and/or the induction of exo-RNAi, even in wild-type animals, may impact development via effects on the endo-RNAi and microRNA pathways...|$|E

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScLung cancer {{remains the}} leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with the {{majority}} of cases attributed to non-small cell lung carcinomas. At the time of diagnosis, a large percentage of patients present with advanced stage of disease, ultimately resulting in a poor prognosis. The identification circulatory markers, overexpressed by the tumour tissue, could facilitate the discovery of an early, specific, non-invasive diagnostic tool as well as improving prognosis and treatment protocols. The aim was to analyse gene expression data from both microarray and RNA sequencing platforms, using bioinformatics and statistical analysis tools. Enrichment analysis sought to identify genes, which were differentially expressed (p 2) and had the potential to be secreted into the extracellular circulation, by using Gene Ontology terms of the Cellular Component. Results identified 1 657 statically significant genes between normal and early lung cancer tissue, with only 1 gene differentially expressed (DE) between the early and late stage disease. Following statistical analysis, 171 DE genes selected as potential early stage biomarkers. The overall sensitivity of RNAseq, in comparison to arrays enabled the identification of 57 potential serum markers. These genes of interest were all downregulated in the tumour tissue, and while they did not facilitate the discovery of an ideal diagnostic marker based on the set criteria in this <b>study,</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> in disease initiation and progression require further analysis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Differential {{expression}} {{analysis of}} (individual) genes {{is often used}} to <b>study</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> in diseases. However, diseases such as cancer are a result of the combined effect of multiple genes. Gene products such as proteins seldom act in isolation, but instead constitute stable multi-protein complexes performing dedicated functions. Therefore, complexes aggregate the effect of individual genes (proteins) and can be used {{to gain a better understanding}} of cancer mechanisms. Here, we observe that complexes show considerable changes in their expression, in turn directed by the concerted action of transcription factors (TFs), across cancer conditions. We seek to gain novel insights into cancer mechanisms through a systematic analysis of complexes and their transcriptional regulation. Results: We integrated large-scale protein-interaction (PPI) and gene-expression datasets to identify complexes that exhibit significant changes in their expression across different conditions in cancer. We devised a log-linear model to relate these changes to the differential regulation of complexes by TFs. The application of our model on two case studies involving pancreatic and familial breast tumour conditions revealed: (i) complexes in core cellular processes, especially those responsible for maintaining genome stability and cell proliferation (e. g. DNA damage repair and cell cycle) show considerable changes in expression; (ii) these changes include decrease and countering increase for different sets of complexes indicative of compensatory mechanisms coming into play in tumours; an...|$|E

Intriguingly, while NS mutations result in a more ‘active’ state of Shp 2, LS mutations {{give rise to a}} PTP defective protein. First, we studied the role of ptpn 11 in zebrafish embryonic development. Whereas ptpn 11 a is crucial for development ptpn 11 b seems dispensible. Moreover, using phoshoproteomics we show hypo- and hypertyrosyl phosphorylation of Fer kinase and PZR (Protein zero related), respectively and <b>study</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> as (potential) interacting proteins in the etiology of both NS and LS. Defective heart development is a prominent symptom of NS and LS. Embryos expressing NS and LS Shp 2 showed impaired expression of laterality markers, impaired cilia function in Kupffer’s vesicle and at later stages, heart function defects. Finally we identified several mutations in Alpha- 2 -Macroglobulin-Like- 1 (A 2 ML 1) in patients diagnosed with NS. Functional characterization of these mutations in zebrafish showed NS-like developmental defects. This is the first example of an extracellular factor in a disorder clinically related to NS and LS, providing potential new leads for better understanding of the molecular basis of these developmental syndromes.

30|$|However, the {{detailed}} mechanisms and biological significance of membrane deformation during herpesvirus infections remain largely unknown. In addition to NEC, {{only a few}} viral and host factors involved in nuclear egress are identified and their molecular mechanisms are not clear yet. Although exogenous expression of NEC results {{in the formation of}} vesicles in cells, empty vesicles in PNS are rarely observed in herpesvirus infected cells. Thus, primary envelopment is under precise regulation by inhibitory and triggering factors, which have not been identified. Proteins involved in the primary envelopment like NEC may also function in the deenvelopment. However, since lack of these proteins inhibits the primary envelopment process, it is technically difficult to <b>study</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> in the subsequent deenvelopment process. Furthermore, the attempt to identify organelles by protein markers via immunofluorescence assays and by morphology via electron microscopy is confounded by the fact that protein markers are in a constant flux because of close communications among organelles, especially during the late stage of herpesvirus infection, when many organelles are significantly remodeled and protein markers are redistributed. So it is difficult to identify the source of vesicles induced in secondary envelopment. Along this line, {{it has been reported that}} secondary envelopment of HCMV takes place in a novel compartment containing protein markers of TGN, EE and Glogi, indicating complex mechanisms of the membrane organization (Homman-Loudiyi et al., 2003).

Three xyloglucan xylosyltransferases (XXTs), XXT 1, XXT 2, and XXT 5, are responsible for the D-xylosylation of the beta-(1 - 4) -D-glucan backbone in Arabidopsis thaliana. They are Golgi-localized type II transmembrane proteins that have putative DXD catalytic centers. All have been shown to interact in a protein complex, XXT 2 and XXT 5 showing the strongest interaction, and XXT 1 and XXT 2 have demonstrated alpha-D-xylosyltransferase (XT) activity in vitro. The catalytic mechanism of XXT 2 and XXT 1, as well as the biological function of XXT 5, are still unknown.

Targeted deletion of the G-protein-coupled endothelin receptors ETA and ETB was shown to result in characteristic developmental defects of derivatives of cephalic and cardiac neural crest and of neural crest-derived melanocytes and enteric neurons, respectively. Since both endothelin receptors are coupled to G-proteins of the Gq/G 11 - and G 12 /G 13 -families, we generated mouse lines lacking Gαq/Gα 11 or Gα 12 /Gα 13 in neural crest cells to <b>study</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> in neural crest development. Mice lacking Gαq/Gα 11 in a neural crest cell-specific manner had craniofacial defects similar to those observed in mice lacking the ETA receptor or endothelin- 1 (ET- 1). However, in contrast to ET- 1 /ETA mutant animals, cardiac outflow tract morphology was intact. Surprisingly, neither Gαq/Gα 11 - nor Gα 12 /Gα 13 -deficient mice showed developmental defects seen in animals lacking either the ETB receptor or its ligand endothelin- 3 (ET- 3). Interestingly, Gα 12 /Gα 13 deficiency in neural crest cell-derived cardiac cells resulted in characteristic cardiac malformations. Our data show that Gq/G 11 - but not G 12 /G 13 -mediated signaling processes mediate ET- 1 /ETA-dependent development of the cephalic neural crest.

40|$|The human gut harbors {{thousands}} of bacterial taxa. A profusion of metagenomic sequence data has been generated from human stool samples {{in the last}} few years, raising the question of whether more taxa remain to be identified. We assessed metagenomic data generated by the Human Microbiome Project Consortium to determine if novel taxa remain to be discovered in stool samples from healthy individuals. To do this, we established a rigorous bioinformatics pipeline that uses sequence data from multiple platforms (Illumina GAIIX and Roche 454 FLX Titanium) and approaches (whole-genome shotgun and 16 S rDNA amplicons) to validate novel taxa. We applied this approach to stool samples from 11 healthy subjects collected as part of the Human Microbiome Project. We discovered several low-abundance, novel bacterial taxa, which span three major phyla in the bacterial tree of life. We determined that these taxa are present in a larger set of Human Microbiome Project subjects and are found in two sampling sites (Houston and St. Louis). We show that the number of false-positive novel sequences (primarily chimeric sequences) would have been two orders of magnitude higher than the true number of novel taxa without validation using multiple datasets, highlighting the importance of establishing rigorous standards for the identification of novel taxa in metagenomic data.

Our previous studies on Ribosomal Protein Large subunit (RPL) genes provided insights into their stress responsive roles in rice. In the present study, we have explored the developmental and stress regulated expression patterns of Ribosomal Protein Small (RPS) subunit genes for their differential expression in a spatiotemporal and stress dependent manner. We have also performed an in silico analysis of gene structure, cis-elements in upstream regulatory regions, protein properties and phylogeny. Expression studies of the 34 RPS genes in 13 different tissues of rice covering major growth and developmental stages revealed that their expression was substantially elevated, mostly in shoots and leaves indicating their possible involvement in the development of vegetative organs. The majority of the RPS genes have manifested significant expression under all abiotic stress treatments with ABA, PEG, NaCl, and H 2 O 2. Infection with important rice pathogens, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Rhizoctonia solani also induced the up-regulation of several of the RPS genes. RPS 4, 13 a, 18 a, and 4 a have shown higher transcript levels under all the abiotic stresses, whereas, RPS 4 is up-regulated in both the biotic stress treatments.
