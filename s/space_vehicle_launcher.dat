This infinitedimensional problem is then formulated as a generalized moment problem, which allows for a numerical solution via a hierarchy of linear matrix inequality relaxations solved by semidefinite programming. The approach is illustrated on <b>space</b> <b>launcher</b> <b>vehicle</b> benchmark problems, {{in the presence of}} closed-loop nonlinearities (saturations and dead-zones) and axis coupling...|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} a comprehensive overview of magnetic levitation (Maglev) technologies, from fundamental principles {{through to the}} state-of-the-art, and describes applications both realised and under development. It includes a history of Maglev science and technology showing the various milestones in its advancement. The core concepts, operating principles and main challenges of Maglev applications attempted across various fields are introduced and discussed. The principle difficulties encountered when applying Maglev technology to different systems, namely air gap control and stabilization, are addressed in detail. The book describes how major advancements in linear motor and magnet technologies have enabled {{the development of the}} linear-motor-powered Maglev train, which has a high speed advantage over conventional wheeled trains and has the potential to reach speed levels achieved by aircraft. However, many expect that Maglev technology to be a green technology that is applied not only in rail transportation, but also in diverse other fields; to ensure clean transfer in LCD manufacturing, in ropeless high speed elevators, small capacity rail transportation, <b>space</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>launchers,</b> missile testers, energy storage, and so on. These potential applications and their unique challenges and proposed technological solutions are introduced and discussed in depth. The book will provide readers from academia, research institutes and industry with insights on where and how to apply Maglev technology, and will serve as a guide to the realization of their Maglev applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>Space</b> <b>launcher</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{consist of}} {{thin-walled}} shell structures which {{are prone to}} buckling and often are sensitive towards geometrical imperfections. Even small deviations of the shell from the perfect structure which still are within manufacturing tolerances, result in a tremendous decrease of load carrying capacity. To account for geometrical imperfections in an early design phase, empirical knock-down factors or theoretical approaches can be applied. In this paper, it is shown that the design of imperfection sensitive shell structures with unknown geometric imperfections may not lead to robust designs for the existing empirical and theoretical design methods. In contrast to unstiffened structures and grid stiffened shell structures, which are imperfection sensitive, {{it is known that}} the influence of imperfections during an early design phase of ring frame stringer stiffened shells is negligible when the post-buckling regime of the skin fields is exploited. Frame stringer stiffened structures can be designed in a robust manner, using efficient analysis methods, as imperfection tolerant structures; but, existing methods to size ring frame stiffeners of <b>space</b> <b>launcher</b> <b>vehicles</b> shell structures do not mandatorily lead to reliable and light designs. In this contribution a novel method for the efficient design of ring frame stringer stiffened shells is presented. The suggested approach is based on the explicit description of the mechanical behavior of the ring frame stiffeners at the onset of panel instability. Together with existing sizing methods for stringer stiffened shell panels the suggested approach allows for robust designs of ring frame stringer stiffened shells. The application of the novel method to size ring frames reveals that the minimum stiffness requirements are satisfied likewise with regard to existing methods; whereby, the lightweight potential is not mandatorily exploited using existing methods...|$|R

40|$|Pseudo-spectral optimal solvers {{are used}} to {{optimize}} numerically a performance index of a dynamical system with differential constraints. Although these solvers are commonly used for <b>space</b> <b>vehicles</b> and <b>space</b> <b>launchers</b> for trajectory optimization, few experimental papers exist on optimal control of small airships. The objective of this thesis is {{to evaluate the use}} of a pseudo-spectral optimal control solver for generating dynamically constrained, minimal time trajectories. A dynamical model of a small airship is presented, with its experimental virtual mass, drag and motor experimentally modeled. The problems are solved in PSOPT, a pseudo-spectral optimal control code. Experimental tests with a small scale model are performed to evaluate the generated paths. Although drift occurs, as a consequence of an open loop control, the vehicle is capable of following the path. This results of this thesis may find uses in verifying how close to optimal discreet path planners are, to plan complex trajectories on short distances, or to generate dynamic maneuverer such as take-off or landing. Ultimately, improving path planning of small airships will improve their safety, maneuverability and flight-time, which makes them fit for scientific monitoring, for search and rescue, or as mobile telecommunications platforms...|$|R

40|$|Within {{this paper}} {{a long term}} vision for {{possible}} <b>space</b> <b>vehicles</b> and <b>launcher</b> systems with full or partial re-usability will be given. In the past decades since {{the development of the}} Space Shuttle launch systems a lot of development work was focused on the technology for future reusable launch vehicles. Most important key technologies are the thermal protection system, tanks and propulsion. However, independent from near term decisions for a next generation launcher and the proposed launcher systems for the exploration in the US, the need for re-useable technologies seems to be definitely present. Having a look on growing activities and visions within the field of private launch <b>vehicles,</b> <b>space</b> tourism, hypersonic transport and perspectives in human space flight, current technologies are essential corner stones to realize such scenarios. Especially new visions of commercial transport systems like the Space Liner concept or space tourism are only possible with a high launch sequence and seem to be only possible in using mainly re-usable systems or sub-components. The lessons learnt from recent studies or realized launcher systems showed, that the idea of a universal launcher for all applications was not an optimal approach. More flexible systems, adaptable to the required mission and also included re-usable parts may be a solution. Considering {{the current state of the}} art of RLV related technologies and presenting some ongoing or possible applications, this paper will try to indicate possible future development directions. Based on the SHEFEX flight experiment program a way of technology development and flight test will be presented, which covers a wide range of disciplines and different technological areas, starting from aerodynamics, thermal protection systems, flight control, measurement techniques and at the end flight operations. All these technologies are applicable and needed for different concepts and vehicles, either a RLV, or semi reusable launchers, or valuable pay loads to be returned to earth or finally hypersonic flight vehicles. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Space</b> <b>launcher</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{structures}} are designed as thin walled cylindrical and conical structures which {{are prone to}} buckling and are sensitive towards geometrical imperfections. Small deviations in dimensions, which still are within manufacturing tolerances, {{may lead to a}} tremendous decrease in load carrying capacity. Thus, imperfections have to be considered during the design phase and this is commonly done using empirical knock down factors. Besides this approach, imperfections can be considered by applying numerical or analytical structural models. Composite materials are used to exploit the light weight potential of unstiffened thin walled structures. For this type of shell structure, the buckling load of the geometrically perfect shell and the imperfection sensitivity are significantly influenced by the laminate stacking sequence. In this paper, the influence of the laminate stacking sequence of composite shells with rotational symmetric imperfections on the buckling behavior is studied and laminate stacking sequences leading to the highest buckling loads of an imperfect shell structure are identified. These stacking sequences are evaluated further by applying non-rotational symmetric imperfections and localized imperfections and the stacking sequences leading to optimum designs of the geometrical perfect shell structure are considered as reference structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{passivation}} of spacecraft {{and launch}} vehicle orbital stages at end-of-mission {{has been a}} principal space debris mitigation measure world-wide since the 1980 s. <b>Space</b> <b>vehicle</b> passivation includes the removal of stored energies, especially those associated with propulsion and electrical power systems. Prior to 2007 the breakup of non-functioning, non-passivated <b>space</b> <b>vehicles</b> was {{the major source of}} hazardous debris in Earth orbit.
