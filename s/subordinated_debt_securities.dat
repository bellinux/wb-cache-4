40|$|Asset {{securitisation}} {{represents an}} alternative risk management and refinancing method, which allows issues to convert classifiable cash flows from a diversified portfolio of pre-existing assets and receivables (liquidity transformation and asset diversification process) of varying maturity and quality (integration and differentiation process) into negotiable capital market paper, so-called "asset-backed securities" (ABS). Over {{the recent past}} ambivalence {{in the definition of}} capital adequacy for credit risk has particularly facilitated the development of loan securitisation as a refined "regulatory arbitrage tool". However, as impending regulatory change shifts the prime objective of securitisation to the efficient management of economic capital, procedural and substantive aspects of asset securitisation warrant closer inspection. The dissertation presents a comprehensive examination of the risk modelling, asset selection, optimal security design and competitive market pricing of asset-backed securities. We first provide an overview of the main characteristics of asset securitisation and explain its attendant benefits and drawbacks, especially as they pertain to the refinancing of illiquid asset exposures, such as SME-related payment obligations. Subsequently, we explain the gradual evolution of the regulatory treatment of asset securitisation adopted by the Basle Committee on banking Supervision {{in the wake of a}} general revision of the 1988 Basle Accord, which finally led to the adoption of the so-called Basle Securitisation Framework in 2004. We then present a single-factor, loss-based asset pricing model, which estimates the risk-neutral investment return of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> ("tranches") as leveraged contingent claims on a securitised reference portfolio of pooled credit exposures. We challenge common wisdom of robust statistics for the estimation of portfolio credit risk by adopting extreme value analysis, mainly because the leveraged exposure of securitised debt on fundamental asset value changes requires a better parametric specification of extreme quantiles to gauge unexpected loss. Based on the loss sharing between issuers and investors in a common security design, we examine how securitised asset exposure translates into investment risk of asset-backed securities. As a longitudinal extension to this valuation model, we also investigate the price dynamics of securitised debt. A multi-factor GARCH process is applied as an econometric specification of the heteroskedasticity of secondary market spreads of selected types of ABS transactions for valuation and forecasting purposes. In light of the substantial valuation uncertainty in securitisation markets, we conclude with a simple one-shot auction model, in which issuers maximise net payoffs from securitised debt under "winner's curse"-type underpricing as agency cost of adverse selection. In particular, we study how uninformed investment demand at varying degrees of valuation uncertainty affects the utility of endogenous price discovery by informed investors. Overall our synthesis of empirical and theoretical approaches yields instructive findings about important yet unexplored issues concerning the economic rationale of asset securitisation...|$|E

40|$|Increasing the {{effectiveness}} of market discipline in regulated financial markets {{has emerged as a}} major policy issue for banking regulators. Perhaps the most prominent proposal for increasing market discipline is the proposal to require banks to issue publicly held <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt.</b> <b>Subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> holders can discipline banks either directly by demanding higher yields for riskier institutions or indirectly by means of market signals. This paper explores the fundamental rationale behind mandatory <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> proposals, and discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the most prominent proposals. To more clearly focus the analysis, the paper concentrates on proposals for requiring publicly traded <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt,</b> and therefore our analysis is relevant only to relatively large institutions that can feasibly issue such securities. The paper does not consider the various alternative proposals for issuing <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> specifically designed for small institutions.

40|$|This {{research}} empirically investigates how and to {{what extent}} bank <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> plays a role in providing market discipline whereby the private sector is deployed to monitor and influence bank risk taking, hence complement government supervision and regulation of banks. The study comprises four essays on the use of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> as an instrument for creating direct and indirect market discipline, with specific reference to the case of the UK banking industry. Broadly, Chapters 2, 3 and 4 examine the effectiveness of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> as an instrument of direct market discipline; Chapter 5 approaches the issue of indirect market discipline. First, we analyse whether the risk premiums or yield spreads of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> indicate banks’ financial health. Our results show that yield spreads contain timely and accurate information on issuing banks’ risk taking, and this underpins the proposals that advocate forcing large financial institutions to issue <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> to the public on a regular basis. Then we examine whether the issued <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> and its price have any impact on banks’ performance. The results have positive signs, implying that the signalling and influencing effects of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> can induce banks to act prudently and restrain them from assuming unsound risk. However, the final chapter finds that the UK financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has little enthusiasm for utilizing the <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> to indirectly discipline financial institutions. This reflects the FSA’s doubt as to the usefulness of the market in providing disciplining effects. In contrast, the evidence documented in this research shows that the subordinated market proves to be sensitive to bank risk, and banks do respond to market information, hence it can be an effective mechanism for generating useful market discipline. In reforming the financial regulation regime, adding new regulations to the old is therefore not the best way forward. Rather, priority should be given to reforming the paradigm of financial regulation by allowing more room for the subordinated market to discipline the regulators to take more prompt and rigorous corrective actions. ...|$|R
40|$|Academics, {{policymakers and}} bank {{supervisors}} have expressed considerable interest in using <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> and other market {{data in the}} surveillance of banking organizations, especially large and complex financial institutions. However, {{little research has been}} devoted to developing practical means of implementing such an approach for <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt.</b> This paper attempts to fill a portion of this gap. A major problem with using <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads is that accurate prices of individual <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> issues are difficult to come by. The bond market is largely an over-the-counter market where dealer prices are proprietary. The approach used here is to evaluate a number of data sources, including price series from vendors and broker-dealers. Our results indicate that <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads are most consistent across sources for the most liquid bond issues. We also find that the most liquid bonds are those that have a relatively large issuance size, have a relatively young age, have been issued by a relatively large banking organization, and are traded in a relatively robust overall bond market. Moreover, although there are substantial differences in spread levels for individual bonds across data sources, there is a high degree of concordance in rankings of banking organizations by their minimum spreads across issues. There is especially strong agreement about which large banking organizations are in the tails of the spread distribution at a given point in time. However, time series results indicate that movements of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads at individual institutions are sensitive to the data source for bond prices, thus complicating interpretation of such movements. On balance, our results support and provide guidance for the use of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads in supervisory monitoring. However, they also support the need for careful judgment when interpreting such spreads, highlight difficulties with currently available data sources, and motivate the need for further research...|$|R
