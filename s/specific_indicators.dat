5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "Fault" [...] or [...] "Defect". When held steady or flashing, {{it means that}} a trouble {{condition}} exists on the panel. Trouble conditions are often activated by a contaminated smoke detector or an electrical problem within the system. Trouble conditions are also activated by a zone being disabled (disconnected from the system), a circuit being disabled, low power on the backup battery, the disabling of a notification appliance, the ground faults, or short or open circuits. Usually the alarm panel's sounder will activate if a trouble condition exists, though older systems would sometimes activate a bell or other audible signal connected to the panel. In a trouble condition, the panel displays the zone or devices causing the condition. Usually, the [...] "Trouble" [...] indicator goes out automatically when the situation causing the trouble condition is rectified, however in some systems the panel must be reset to clear the trouble alarm. Some panels have more <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> such as 'Trouble-PSU' which shows when the panel itself is compromised and 'Trouble-Bell' ('Sounder Fault' on UK panels) which shows that the notification appliances are not functioning correctly.
