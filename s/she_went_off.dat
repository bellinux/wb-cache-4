500|$|The 1983 season {{started the}} Group B {{era of the}} WRC and Mouton was now {{at the wheel of}} the Audi Quattro A1. She also had a new teammate; Audi had signed Stig Blomqvist as their third regular driver. For the third year in a row, Mouton had a bad start to her season in Monte Carlo. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> the road on a stage not far from her home town, and again hit a stone wall at over 100km/h (60mph). The car was destroyed, but Mouton and Pons were unharmed. Mouton {{explained}} to her team boss Roland Gumpert, later of Gumpert supercar fame, that she had had to dodge a photographer. Mouton went on to record successive points finishes. She finished fourth in Sweden in a quadruple win for Audi, after an early driving error that had sent her Quattro into a snow bank. In Portugal, Mouton finished second to Mikkola, ahead of Lancia's Röhrl and Markku Alén. After the first section of the Safari Rally, totaling over 1,600km (1,000mi), Mouton arrived to the finish on three wheels and said she was [...] "totally exhausted" [...] from the effort. She eventually placed third behind Opel's Ari Vatanen and her teammate Mikkola. After four events, Mikkola and Mouton were first and second in the drivers' championship.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Lorrainers," [...] as the occupying {{forces were}} dubbed, were popularly loathed. The Viceroy, the Prince de Craon, whom the Electress disliked for his [...] "vulgar" [...] court, allowed the Electress to live {{undisturbed}} {{in her own}} wing of the Pitti, living in virtual seclusion, only on occasion receiving a select-number of guests under a black dais in her silver-clad audience room. She occupied herself financing and overseeing {{the construction of the}} Cappella dei Principi—started in 1604 by Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany—to the tune of 1,000 crowns per week, and she donated much of her fortune to charity: £4,000 per annum. [...] This is equivalent to £ in present-day terms. On 18 February 1743, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, Dowager Electress Palatine, died of an [...] "oppression on the breast". Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet, a British resident in Florence, recalled in a letter that [...] "The common people are convinced <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> in a hurricane of wind; a most violent one began this morning and lasted for about two hours, and now the sun shines as bright as ever..." [...] The royal line of the House of Medici became extinct with her death. Her will, having been completed just months before, according to Sir Horace Mann, left £500,000 worth of jewellery to the Grand Duke Francis and her lands in the former Duchy of Urbino to the Marquis Rinuccini, her main executor and a minister under her father, Cosimo III. She was interred in the crypt that she helped to complete in San Lorenzo; although not entirely finished {{at the time of her}} death, her testament stipulated that part of the revenue of her estate should [...] "be used to continue, finish and perfect...the said famous chapel San Lorenzo".|$|E
