40|$|Green manure {{is used as}} a {{nitrogen}} and carbon source in crop production, especially in organic cropping systems without access to farmyard manure. Decomposition and release of nutrients from the green manure is mediated by soil organisms. Consequently, increased understanding of how the biomass, activity and community composition of soil organisms are influenced by this resource input may contribute to improved plant nutrient management. The influence of different green manure forms and application methods on soil organisms, with emphasis on microbial community composition (described by phospholipid fatty acid analysis) and soil enzyme activity, was investigated in field trials. The green manure systems investigated were various red clover-based green manure forms (biogas slurry, <b>compost,</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mulch</b> and direct incorporation of a red clover ley) and long-term timothy grass amendments.

Habitat can be an important factor in retaining predators in a system and can affect predator efficiency. We investigated the potential of increasing a complex of generalist ground-dwelling predators and enhancing biological control in a young 2 ̆ 7 Golden Delicious 2 ̆ 7 apple orchard through ground habitat manipulation. We modified the orchard floor with four comparative habitat treatments: (1) detritus-rich <b>compost</b> <b>mulch</b> layer, (2) detritus-free synthetic mulch layer, (3) herbicide-treated vegetation thatch, and (4) bare soil with vegetation hand-removed. Relative abundances of predators and alternative prey in the habitats were measured with pitfall trapping throughout the growing season. Predation was measured using sentinel Cydia pomonella larvae and directly observed in night experiments. Throughout the season, the <b>compost</b> <b>mulch</b> treatment consistently supported significantly greater densities of alternative prey resources for predators, and generalist predators were more abundant in the <b>compost</b> <b>mulch</b> than the other habitats.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Composts with {{different}} feedstocks may have differential effects on soil properties and plant growth which, may be further modulated by soil texture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 77 -day pot {{experiment in the}} glasshouse, we investigated {{the effect of a}} single application as mulch of six types of composts derived from different starting feedstocks in two soils (13 % and 46 % clay, referred to as S 13 and S 46) on soil physical, chemical and biological properties, plant growth and nutrient uptake. Composts were placed as 2. 5 cm thick mulch layer on the soil surface and wheat plants were grown and harvested at 42 days and at 77 days (grain filling). RESULTS: Composts differed in total and available N and P and particle size with C 1, C 3, C 4 and C 5 being finetextured, whereas C 2 and C 6 were coarse-textured. <b>Compost</b> addition as <b>mulch</b> increased soil total organic C and EC, but had no effect on pH. In all treatments, cumulative soil respiration was higher in S 13 than in S 46 and was increased by compost addition with the greatest increase with C 2 and C 6. Compared to the unamended soil, most <b>compost</b> <b>mulches</b> (except C 2) increased macroaggregate stability. <b>Compost</b> <b>mulches</b> significantly increased available P and N in both soils, except for C 2. <b>Compost</b> <b>mulches</b> increased available N up to 6 -fold in both soils with the strongest increase by C 5. Most composts also increased wheat growth and shoot P and N concentrations with the greatest effect on plant N concentration by C 5 and on plant P concentration by C 4. However, C 2 decreased shoot N and P concentrations compared to the unamended soil. Most <b>compost</b> <b>mulches</b> (except C 2) increased mycorrhizal colonization by up to 50 % compared to the unamended soil. CONCLUSIONS: Fine-textured <b>compost</b> <b>mulches</b> generally had a greater effect on soil properties and plant growth than coarse-textured composts. Despite distinct differences between the soils with respect to clay content, TOC and available P, the effect of the <b>compost</b> <b>mulches</b> on soil and plant properties was quite similar.

The trials were established to evaluate the potential of soil amendments as part of an integrated management program for Kelly’s citrus thrips (KCT). Experimental sites were designed to obtain best possible data for pest management within budget limitations, subsequently, the agronomic and environmental data were in some cases restricted to one site and selected representative treatments. A range of data were collected, including fruit yields, and fruit, soil, leaf, and water quality measures and biological changes, and the potential for water savings assessed. The field trials involved application of various rates of compost to crops, ranging from 40 - 200 m 3 ha- 1 for <b>compost</b> <b>mulch,</b> 100 - 200 m 3 ha- 1 for grape marc, and 10 - 40 m 3 ha- 1 for animal manure. The recycled green waste and composted animal manure have provided significant pest management and agronomic benefits through suppression of KCT and improved yield and fruit size. There were considerable economic net benefits from every type of trial application to citrus at both sites over the four year period assessed. For example, for every dollar invested in an application of 40 m 3 ha- 1 <b>compost</b> <b>mulch</b> at Loxton North, a return of about $ 5 dollars was realised. Returns ranged from $ 1. 91 to 4. 96. There also is the benefit of improved water efficiency that could provide significant cost savings. The longevity of these benefits remains unknown and is currently being evaluated. Whilst the grape marc treatments improved yields, and are cheaper than the composted green waste, the level of suppression of KCT was not as good as that provided by the compost, and the increased acidity that resulted from the high phosphate levels associated with the grape marc treatments could result in reduced quality. It seems that higher levels of application for <b>compost</b> <b>mulch</b> create more overall benefits in terms of fruit quality and tree health. P. Crisp, G. Baker and S. Wheele...|$|R

An experiment was conducted to compare <b>composted</b> green waste <b>mulch</b> and barley straw mulch with herbicide as alternative means of maintaining the undervine strip in a cool climate vineyard. Plant and soil responses to the different undervine treatments were monitored. Grapevine budburst was retarded, however, by the fourth week of vine growth there were no observable differences in grapevine growth stage. Both mulches stimulated grapevine growth and increased yield, with the <b>compost</b> <b>mulch</b> increasing vegetative growth with respect to fruit yield. The fruit quality parameters juice pH and titratable acidity were not significantly altered by the different undervine treatments. In the second year of the experiment the juice soluble solids were lower on the straw <b>mulched</b> grapevines. The <b>compost</b> <b>mulch</b> increased soil pH and carbon levels.

Reduced tillage in vegetable operations provides multiple environmental benefits for soil conservation, as well as reducing machinery, labor and fuel costs. On organic farms, an innovative roller/crimper is used in lieu of herbicides to terminate cover crops. The objective of this research included an investigation of the feasibility of adopting conservation tillage practices for organic squash production. Cover crops of hairy vetch and rye were planted on October 18, 2015, at the ISU Neely-Kinyon Farm, Greenfield, Iowa, and terminated the following spring with a roller/crimper. Organic squash transplants (‘Delicata,’ Johnny’s Seed, Albion, ME) were planted on June 14, 2016. Cover crop biomass averaged 5, 323 lb/acre across all plots.

40|$|Compost is {{increasingly}} used in agriculture as a soil conditioner and fertilizer to improve soil properties and crop production by replenishing {{soil organic matter}} and supplying nutrients and thereby improving soil physical, chemical and biological properties. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of compost on soil water content and plant growth under water deficit stressed condition and if clay added to compost or soil influences nutrient leaching from compost. This thesis includes pot, field and laboratory incubation studies with the following aims (1) to assess the effects of compost on water availability to plants and gas exchange under well-watered and drought stressed conditions, (2) to study the long term effect of <b>mulched</b> <b>compost</b> after a single application, (3) to compare effects of incorporated and <b>mulched</b> <b>compost</b> on soil water content, nutrient uptake and plant growth, and (4) to determine the effect of clay added to compost or sandy soil on nutrient availability and leaching. To assess the effects of compost on plant growth under water-limiting conditions, two pot experiments were conducted; one with tomato and the second with capsicum. Tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) were grown in pots were grown in a sandy soil without or with <b>mulched</b> or incorporated <b>compost</b> from garden and food waste to assess water availability to plants and plant physiology under well-watered and drought stressed conditions. Both <b>mulch</b> and incorporated <b>compost</b> increased plant growth with the greater effect by incorporated compost, but only incorporated compost increased total available water and water available to plants. Compost did not affect gas exchange in well-watered and drought stressed conditions, but the incorporated compost increased the recovery of plants after drought by increasing photosynthesis and transpiration rate compared to the plants without <b>compost</b> or with <b>mulched</b> <b>compost.</b> This may be explained by the greater root length and mass of plants grown with the incorporated compost compared to the other compost treatments. Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants were grown in pots in a silt loam which had received <b>mulched</b> <b>compost</b> once three years previously, and in a corresponding unamended control under (i) sufficient water supply and (ii) two transient drought cycles, separated by one week of sufficient water supply. Compost applied once three years previously increased soil organic C and total N, dry root mass and root length under well-watered and drought stressed conditions. The single compost application increased total available water, total water used and water availability to plants grown in well-watered condition, but did not affect gas exchange and had no effect on water use efficiency and the capacity of plants to recover after drought. As in the previous experiment with freshly applied <b>compost,</b> <b>mulched</b> <b>compost</b> applied once three years previously increased the ability of plants to take up water by stimulating root growth. To investigate effects of compost on soil water content and plant growth under field conditions, compost from garden and food waste was incorporated or mulched in a vineyard (Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot) at a rate of 100 m³ ha⁻¹ with normal irrigation during spring and summer. The compost was applied three months before the start of the first soil water content measurement. Only <b>mulched</b> <b>compost</b> increased soil water content at 10 cm depth and the rate of photosynthesis per plant at flowering, pea sized berries and maturity (about 13 months after application). <b>Compost</b> amendment, particularly <b>mulch,</b> increased yield, specific berry weight, and leaf N and P concentrations, and reduced the number of chlorotic leaves at harvest. It can be concluded that <b>mulched</b> <b>compost</b> has a positive effect on grapevine yield and can be used as an alternative fertiliser for vines with no adverse effect on berry quality. Incubation experiments were carried out to assess effects of clay addition to compost or sandy soil on nutrient leaching. In the first incubation experiment, a fine-textured soil (34 % clay) was added at 5 % or 20 % (w/w) to compost and this mix was incorporated into a sandy soil. Compost addition increased nutrient availability and leaching. Addition of the fine-textured soil to compost reduced nutrient leaching, especially N and P from compost. In a second incubation experiment, clays isolated from a surface soil and subsoil were added to a loamy sand (98. 1 g clay kg⁻¹soil) and different concentrations of water-extractable organic C (WEOC) from compost was added. Clay addition reduced C loss (mg C per kg soil) via leaching and respiration and increased the WEOC sorption capacity of the loamy soil. The clay properties such as mineralogy, surface area, cation exchange capacity and exchangeable Ca concentration cannot explain differences in C sorption and loss. However, clays with a high C sorption capacity had low indigenous organic C and high Fe/Al concentrations. It can be concluded that clay addition to compost or soil reduces the risk of entrophication and increase C sequestration by decreasing C loss via leaching and respiration if the added clays have low total organic C and high Fe/Al concentrations.

Incubation is about two months, and eggs hatch from July through September. Hatchlings are usually just over a foot long at birth, with the distinct gray and black pattern characteristic of juveniles.|$|R
40|$|For many decades, it was {{commonly}} {{believed that}} humic acids were formed in soils by the microbial conversion of plant lignins. However, an experiment {{to test whether}} these humic acids were formed prior to plant matter reaching the soil was never reported until the late 1980 s (and then only as a side issue), even though humic acids were first isolated and reported in 1786. This was a serious omission, {{and led to a}} poor understanding of how the humic acid content of soils could be maintained or increased for optimum fertility. In this study, commercial sugar cane mulch and kelp extracts were extracted with alkali and analyzed for humic acid content. Humic acids in the extracts were positively identified by fluorescence spectrophotometry, and this demonstrated that humic acids are formed in senescent plant and algal matter before they reach the soil, where they are then strongly bound to the soil and are also resistant to microbial metabolism. Humic acids are removed from soils by wind and water erosion, and by water leaching, which means that they must be regularly replenished. This study shows that soils can be replenished or fortified with humic acids simply by recycling plant and algal matter, or by adding outside sources of decomposed plant or algal matter such as <b>composts,</b> <b>mulch,</b> peat, and lignite coals...|$|R
40|$|Compost {{production}} {{is considered an}} economic and environmentally friendly means to reduce the waste going into landfill. Compost application can improve soil quality and productivity as well as sustainability of agricultural production by replenishing soil organic matter and supplying nutrients. Organic matter is a vital component of a healthy soil as it {{plays an important role}} in soil physical, chemical and biological fertility. In this project, four experiments were conducted to assess the effect of <b>compost</b> <b>mulch</b> on soil properties and plant growth and nutrient uptake as influenced by compost composition and particle size, soil type and time after application. The first experiment was carried out using four composts from various feedstocks applied as mulch to a sandy loam. Their effect on soil properties, plant growth and nutrient uptake was assessed after 2, 4, 6, 9, 13 and 18 months. The composts were Cl and C 2 (from organic fraction of municipal solid waste); C 3 (from manure); C 4 (from straw and manure). A soil without compost amendment was used as control. At each sampling date, the soil was sampled after removing the <b>compost</b> <b>mulch</b> and the remaining soil was planted with wheat; plant growth and nutrient uptake were determined after 4 weeks. The coarse-textured compost (C 2) had the least effect on nutrient availability and plant growth despite moderate concentrations of available N and P in the compost. However, its total N and P concentrations were low which, together with the coarse texture resulted in low mobilisation rates. The other three composts increased soil aggregate stability and water holding capacity although there was no measurable increase in soil organic C, suggesting that the improved soil structure was due to microbial activity (bacterial slimes, fungal hyphae). These three composts also increased soil N and P availability, plant growth and nutrient uptake with N and P availability increasing over time whereas plant growth was maximal after 4 months. The increased soil nutrient availability was due to two mechanisms: either release of P and N already present in available form in the composts or mobilisation of the nutrients during the experiment which varied with compost type. Despite the fact that the beneficial effects of compost on soil properties are generally well-known, there are few systematic studies comparing the effects of composts on soils of different texture. The second experiment was conducted to assess the effects of two types of composts derived from different feedstocks: Cl (from garden waste) and C 2 (from agricultural residues and manures) applied as mulch on three soils with different clay content (46 yo, 22 %o and l 3 Yo, hereafter referred to as 546, 522 and Sl 3) on soil properties as well as on plant growth and nutrient uptake. Wheat plants were grown for 35 days and to grain filling (70 days). The soil was sampled after removal of the <b>mulch</b> layer. The <b>composts</b> reduced the soil pH by 0. 3 - 0. 7 units and slightly increased total organic C compared to unamended soil. Soil respiration was highest in S 13, and at grain filling it was greater in soil amended with C 2 than that amended with Cl and the non-amended soil. The addition of compost significantly increased soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) n 522 and 546, but not in S 13 which had the lowest CEC among the soils. C 2 increased the available P concentration and macroaggregate stability in all soils compared to Cl and the unamended soil. Compost addition increased available N in 546 and 522 compared to the unamended soil with a stronger effect by Cl. Both composts increased wheat growth and shoot P concentrations with the effect of C 2 being greater than that of Cl. Generally, the effect of soil type was greater than that of compost type. It is concluded that the effect of composts on soil properties and plant growth is strongly affected by soil properties. There are few studies in which the effect of several composts applied as on soil properties and plant growth has been studied under controlled conditions. To address this knowledge gap, a third experiment was carried out with six types of <b>composts</b> applied as <b>mulch</b> on two soils (13 % and 46 % clay, referred to as S 13 and S 46). Wheat was grown and harvested at 42 days and at 77 days (grain filling). Composts differed in total and available N and P and particle size with Cl, C 3, C 4 and C 5 being fine-textured, whereas C 2 and C 6 were coarse-textured. Compost addition increased soil TOC and EC, but had no effect on pH. In all treatments, cumulative soil respiration was higher in S 13 than in 546 and was increased by compost addition with the greatest increase with C 2 and C 6. Compared to the unamended soil, most composts (except C 2) increased macroaggregate stability. <b>Compost</b> <b>mulches</b> significantly increased available P and N in both soils, except for C 2. <b>Compost</b> <b>mulches</b> increased available N concentrations up to 6 -fold in both soils with the strongest increase by C 5. Most composts also increased wheat growth and shoot P and N concentrations, except C 2 which decreased shoot N and P concentrations compared to the unamended soil. Most composts (except C 2) increased mycorrhizal colonization by up to 50 %m compared to the unamended soil. It can be concluded that fine-textured <b>compost</b> <b>mulches</b> generally had a greater effect on soil properties and plant growth than coarse-textured composts. In this experiment, a given compost had similar effects in both soil types. In most studies to date, compost effects on soils have been studied in the bulk soil without considering the distance from the compost. This distance could be important because the effects are likely to be greater in the immediate vicinity compared to further away. Thus by taking a bulk soil measurement, one may underestimate the effect in immediate vicinity of the compost whereas the effect in greater distance is overestimated. A fourth experiment was carried out to assess the effect of compost on soil properties in their immediate vicinity. This experiment was also used to assess the changes in nutrient concentrations withing the composts. Three composts from different feedstocks: Cl (from animal manures) and C 2 and C 3 (from the organic fraction and municipal solid waste) were applied as a layer which was separated from the soil by a mesh. Microcosms without compost served as controls. Microbial and chemical properties of the soil were determined at 0 - 5 and 5 - 10 mm distance from the mesh after 30 and 63 days. During the 63 day incubation, the total C, N and P and available N concentrations in the composts decreased whereas the available P concentration increased. The composts induced higher microbial biomass and activity, total organic C and available N and P concentrations up to 10 mm into the surrounding soil with greater effects after 30 than after 63 days. The nutrient concentrations were generally greater in soil adjacent to the two finer-textured composts with the higher nutrient concentration (Cl and C 3) than in the coarser-textured compost (C 2) which had lower nutrient concentrations. The 0 - 5 and 5 - 10 mm layers did not differ in most of the measured properties except for greater soil respiration and N and P availability in the 0 - 5 mm layer. It can be concluded that composts affect soil properties up to 10 mm distance but that the greatest effect on microbial activity is limited to the first 5 mm. The experiments showed that compost properties, particularly particle size and nutrient concentration determine the effect of compost on soils. Finer composts have greater effects than coarse-textured composts. Nutrients released from composts may derive from the nutrients already available in the composts or may become mobilised after compost application. Compost effects were modulated by soil type and changed over time. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, 201...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to {{rapid population growth}} {{and the need for}} more agricultural products, many countries in the world are engaged in an intensive irrigation development. As these efforts, in many cases, are following injudicious uses of water, environmental challenges such as widespread of soil salinity are emerging in many instances. The Ethiopian rift valley system,where this study was conducted, exhibits this problem. Research addressing these challenges,using locally accessible material such as <b>compost</b> and <b>mulch</b> are rarely available. Thus, this study was conducted at Dugda District, Girisa Kebele with the objective of evaluating effects of compost application rate (0, 2, 4 and 6 ton/ha) and mulch thickness (0 cm/ha, 5 cm/ha, 10 cm/ha,and 15 cm/ha) on yield and yield quality of irrigated tomato. The experiment was conducted in factorial experiment arranged in a Randomized complete block design with three replications. The post-harvest soil result indicated that Mg, Om%, CEC, Ec (ds) /m, Na, and Available (Av. P) ppm were significantly (p< 0. 01) affected by the interaction effects of compost application rates and mulch thicknesses. However, pH, TN%, OC%, and Ca are significantly (p< 0. 01) affected bythe main effects of compost application rate. The interaction effects of the treatments, on the other hand, did not affect days to 50 % flowering and days to 50 % maturity. These variables,however, were significantly (p< 0. 01) affected by the compost application rates. The growth variables were also not significantly affected by the interaction effects of <b>compost</b> and <b>mulch</b> thickness. Except single fruit weight per plant and fruit shape index, all yield and yield component variables were significantly affected by the interaction effects of <b>mulch</b> thickness and <b>compost</b> application rate. Yield obtained from the treatment combination of 6 ton/ha compostrate and 10 cm mulch thickness was agronomically and economically remunerative by 15. 56 %for farmers. Nevertheless, because of the slow releases of nutrient from <b>compost</b> and organic <b>mulch,</b> long term effect of this rate needs further investigation. Global Affairs Canad...|$|R
30|$|There is {{no doubt}} that {{sustainable}} agricultural practices can supply synergies that limit serious effects of the climate change. The report of the FAO stated that sustainable agriculture helps to counteract climate change by restoring soil organic matter content as well as reducing soil erosion and improving soil physical structure (Scialabba and Hattam 2002). Furthermore, global warming increases the rate of soil organic matter mineralization. The evidence for increased carbon sequestration in organic soils seems clear: the addition of manures, <b>compost,</b> <b>mulches,</b> and cover crops restored organic matter (Mae-Wan and Li Ching 2008). Enormous quantities of vegetable wastes are produced annually from the horticultural industries. Composting can be a feasible treatment to stabilize horticultural wastes and, thus, to improve their properties for use as organic fertilizers (Gavilanes et al. 2016). The organic agricultural waste from animal breeding and horticultural production consist mainly of (1) cattle manure and (2) crop residues. The crop residues are considered as plant by-products (Ballerini 2006). In the Souss-Massa region (South Western Morocco), the production of such plant by-product has reached 406, 045 tons·year− 1 (ORMVA/SM 2009). The development of the agricultural production can cause several types of pollution (Elasri and Afilal 2016). Those agricultural wastes, which are not well managed, can lead to serious sanitary and environmental complications, such as soil, air, and groundwater pollution. The good management of those wastes would be an effective means of organic matter restoration through carbon restitution of the depleted soils through organic amendments.|$|R
