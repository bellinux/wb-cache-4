40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to compare direct and {{indirect}} detectors {{in terms of their}} <b>system</b> <b>linearity,</b> presampled modulation transfer function (MTF), Wiener spectrum (WS), noise equivalent quanta (NEQ), and power spectrum. Measurements were made on two flat-panel detectors, GE Revolution XR/d (indirect) and Shimadzu Safire (direct) radiographic techniques. The <b>system</b> <b>linearity</b> of the systems was measured using a time-scale method. The MTF of the systems was measured using an edge method. The WS of the systems was determined for a variable range of exposure levels by two-dimensional Fourier analysis. The NEQ was assessed from the measured MTF, WS, and estimated ideal signal-to-noise ratios. Power spectrum analyzed the chest phantom within artificial lesions. <b>System</b> <b>linearity</b> was excellent for the direct systems. For the direct system, the MTF was found to be significantly higher than that for the indirect systems. For the direct system, the WS was relatively uniform across all frequencies. In comparison, the indirect system exhibited a drop in the WS at high frequencies. At lower frequencies, the NEQ for the indirect system was noticeably higher than for the direct system. Power spectrum for the direct system was relatively flat and similar to that for white noise. The indirect system exhibited significant reduction at high spatial frequencies. In general, the direct systems exhibit improved image quality over indirect systems at comparable exposure dose...|$|E

This operation is performed in the complete test circuit by injecting across the terminals of the device under test a known charge generated by a traceable calibrator.

40|$|ASCE. Fluid-saturated {{fractured}} rock {{is well-known}} to exhibit a pronounced attenuation of elastic waves at low seismic frequencies {{due to the}} equilibration of wave-induced pressure gradients by pressure diffusion. At low seismic frequencies, the Poiseuille flow model results in a Darcy-type behavior for the pressure diffusion along the fractures. Moreover, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that pressure diffusion occurs on a length scale much smaller than the seismic wave length, and we, therefore, consider it as a local process. On the geological scale the material can then be interpreted as a viscoelastic medium. In the present contribution we aim to develop a computational homogenization scheme substituting the heterogeneous fractured medium by a homogeneous viscoelastic substitute model. We make use of the <b>system's</b> <b>linearity</b> and derive a reduced order formulation for the upscaling problem.

40|$|Often the {{analysis}} of time-dependent chemical and biophysical systems produces high-dimensional time-series data for which {{it can be difficult}} to interpret which individual features are most salient. While recent work from our group and others has demonstrated the utility of time-lagged co-variate models to study such <b>systems,</b> <b>linearity</b> assumptions can limit the compression of inherently nonlinear dynamics into just a few characteristic components. Recent work in the field of deep learning has led to the development of variational autoencoders (VAE), which are able to compress complex datasets into simpler manifolds. We present the use of a time-lagged VAE, or variational dynamics encoder (VDE), to reduce complex, nonlinear processes to a single embedding with high fidelity to the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate how the VDE is able to capture nontrivial dynamics in a variety of examples, including Brownian dynamics and atomistic protein folding. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for analyzing the VDE model, inspired by saliency mapping, to determine what features are selected by the VDE model to describe dynamics. The VDE presents an important step in applying techniques from deep learning to more accurately model and interpret complex biophysics. Comment: Fixed typos and added reference...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} transfer rate provides an objective and rigorous way to quantify how much information is being transmitted through a communications channel whose input and output consist of time-varying signals.
