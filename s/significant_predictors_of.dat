25|$|To {{investigate}} {{the salience of}} religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some {{studies have shown that}} greater religious attitudes may be <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups. These effects are often conceptualized under the framework of intergroup bias, where religious individuals favor members of their ingroup (ingroup favoritism) and exhibit disfavor towards members of their outgroup (outgroup derogation). Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification. Many studies regarding religion and prejudice implement religious priming both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings with evidence supporting the perpetuation of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in individuals who are high in religiosity.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study by}} Fischer and Born, 2009, {{previous}} knowledge of monetary reward and post-training sleep are proven to be <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> overall finger sequence tapping performance. Subjects were presented with two different finger sequence tasks {{that would have to}} be replicated at a later time. The subjects were told that there would be a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A control group was not given any knowledge of a reward. The subjects were separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and final testing for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being able to sleep displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake retention period.|$|E

[...] The significant independent predictors of CVD in Native American women were diabetes, age, obesity, LDL, albuminuria, triglycerides, and hypertension. In men the <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> CVD were diabetes, age, LDL, albuminuria, and hypertension. Interestingly, and unlike other ethnic groups, Native Americans appear to have an increasing frequency of coronary heart disease, possibly related to the high and increasing prevalence of diabetes in these communities. Although total and LDL-cholesterol levels are lower than the U.S. average, importance of LDL cholesterol as a contributor to CHD in this group should not be underestimated. Moreover, {{because of the high}} frequency of type 2 diabetes, many Native Americans will have an even lower LDL goal. [...] The evidence for differences in baseline risk between Native American and white populations is not strong enough to justify separate guidelines for Native American populations.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{projected}} increase of Hispanic Spanish-speaking English language learners (ELLs), researchers have begun examining {{issues related to}} their high levels of school dropout, largely stemming from academic underachievement. The focus {{of this study is}} to examine the impact of teacher expectations, parent expectations, and academic self-efficacy on the achievement of Hispanic Spanish-speaking ELLs. Participants in this study were from a medium-size school district in southwest Texas and included 99 2 nd, 5 th, and 8 th grade students identified as limited English proficient, their parent, and their teacher. Norm-referenced achievement measures and researcher developed measures were utilized in this study. Findings from this study indicate that teacher expectations was a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> all measures of achievement, while parent expectations was a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> English reading and students? academic self-efficacy was a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> Spanish reading. Second, this study determined the best predictor for reading and math achievement was teacher expectations in 2 nd grade, but there were no <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> in 5 th and 8 th grade. Third, this study addressed the possibility of academic self-efficacy functioning as a mediator, but the analysis was not conducted because academic self-efficacy did not serve as a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> all measures of achievement. Findings from additional analyses indicate that students' English language proficiency was determined to be a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> English reading achievement and parent expectations. Furthermore, students' Spanish proficiency was positively associated with their grade levels, and Spanish proficiency was negatively related to English proficiency. Academic self-efficacy was separated by domains (i. e., math self-efficacy and reading self-efficacy). In the overall sample math self-efficacy was not a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> math achievement. Math self-efficacy served as a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> for 5 th and 8 th grade math achievement. In the overall sample, reading self-efficacy did not significantly predict English or Spanish reading.

In a cross-sectional paper-based study, 50 consecutive non-selected patients attending the teaching hospital completed a disease-specific McMaster quality of life tool. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected from patients’ records. The t-test and Mann–Whitney test were used to determine the probability of significant differences between quality of life domains and independent variables. Multiple linear regression was used to determine quality <b>of</b> life <b>predictors.</b> Younger and highly educated patients had higher social scores. Those with shorter disease durations had higher systemic scores. Patients in remission had higher systemic, social, bowel and overall scores. Relapse was a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> decreased systemic, social, bowel and overall scores. Long disease duration was a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> decreased systemic and overall scores.
