40|$|Abstract. Cobalt-boron complex were {{prepared}} as a novel adhesion promoter. It {{was characterized by}} the infrared spectrum and the UV spectrum. The maximum absorption wavelength of cobalt-boron complex is in 285 nm by the UV spectrum. And the fluorine rubber / metal composite sealing boards {{were prepared}} with cobalt-boron complex. The {{results show that the}} sample with cobalt-boron complex has better scratch resistance, higher impedance resistance than that without cobalt-boron complex; meanwhile the sample with cobalt-boron complex also has a better bonding situation. In the most optimal process conditions, the scratch resistance value of the composite <b>sealing</b> <b>board</b> is 3800 g...|$|E

5000|$|There is {{no known}} {{sketch of a}} Hopkinson flag—either U.S. or naval—in {{existence}} today. Hopkinson, however, did incorporate elements of the two flags he designed in his rough sketches of the Great Seal of the United States and his design for the Admiralty <b>Board</b> <b>Seal.</b> The rough sketch of his second Great Seal proposal has 7 white stripes and 6 red stripes. The impression of Hopkinson’s Admiralty <b>Board</b> <b>Seal</b> has a chevron with 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes. The Great Seal reflects Hopkinson’s design for a governmental flag and the Admiralty <b>Board</b> <b>Seal</b> reflects Hopkinson’s design for a naval flag. Both flags were intended to have 13 stripes. Because the original stars used in the Great Seal had six points, Hopkinson's U.S. flag might also have intended the use of 6-pointed stars. This is bolstered by his original sketch [...] that showed asterisks with six points.|$|R

Three armed Libyans seized commercial tanker , which Rear Admiral John Kirby, Pentagon Press Secretary, called a “stateless vessel,” early in March 2014. The ship carried oil owned by the Libyan government’s National Oil Corporation, but illicitly obtained from that country’s port of As-Sidra. The Libyan and Cypriot governments requested assistance. In addition to Elrod, the destroyers [...] and , deployed as part of Carrier Strike Group 2, were tasked to assist. A Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team, attached to Special Operations Command Europe, was also deployed to Roosevelt. Just after 1500 on 16 March, the <b>SEALs</b> <b>boarded</b> and took control of Morning Glory in international waters just southeast of Cyprus, capturing the hijackers and freeing the crewmembers. Stout dispatched a team of sailors that boarded the tanker and relieved the SEALs, and which then helped sail the ship to Libyan waters. Elrod relieved Stout on 19 March. Elrod turned Morning Glory over to the Libyan authorities in international waters outside Libya, and they brought the ship into Zawiya, Libya, on 22 March.|$|R

30|$|To {{improve the}} {{properties}} of particleboard, boards were produced using a sealed press. With the <b>sealed</b> press, <b>boards</b> were processed under high-temperature and high-pressure steam. This increased the saturation temperature, causing a dramatic rise in temperature inside the board, faster curing of the binder, and a shorter pressing time. The boards were bonded with urea formaldehyde resin, melamine urea formaldehyde resin, or poly(methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) (PMDI). The sealed press improved the internal bond strength and thickness swelling of boards regardless of the binder used during the reduced pressing time. The increased bonding strength improved the board properties, allowing PMDI with a lower resin content {{to be used for}} bonding the boards.|$|R
