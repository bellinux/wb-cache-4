Actually, it would be inefficient to use the same balance in either country (because of the relative availability of either input factor) but, in principle this would be possible. Another way of <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that the per-capita productivity is the same in both countries in the same technology with identical amounts of capital.|$|E

Their main reason for <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the novelty of the containment procedures required combined with the possibility of human error and mission design mistakes, either during the return flight or after return of the samples. They urge more in situ studies on Mars first, and preliminary biohazard testing in space before the samples are returned to Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{eigenvalues}} of unitary matrices {{are pure}} phases, {{so that the}} value of a unitary conserved quantity is a complex number of unit magnitude, not a real number. Another way of <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that a unitary matrix is the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix, so that the additive conserved real quantity, the phase, is only well-defined up to an integer multiple of 2π. Only when the unitary symmetry matrix is part of a family that comes arbitrarily close to the identity are the conserved real quantities single-valued, and then the demand that they are conserved become a much more exacting constraint.|$|E

25|$|A {{function}} or map {{from one}} topological space to another is called continuous if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the real numbers {{to the real}} numbers (both spaces with the Standard Topology), then this definition of continuous {{is equivalent to the}} definition of continuous in calculus. If a continuous function is one-to-one and onto, and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. But the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.|$|E

25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.|$|E

On September 11, 2012 Brown released a similar image, tweeting, [...] "'Don't Judge Me' video coming soon!". The video premiered on Vimeo on September 27, 2012. It begins with Brown walking through the desert, while intercut scenes of himself sitting in front of a couch (with his girlfriend, played by Runa Lucienne, sleeping behind him) are shown. As the chorus begins for the first time, Brown is seen catching a ride from an army truck. He eventually arrives at an army base to prepare for a [...] "suicide mission", which involves him riding a spacecraft into outer space to save the world from an alien ship invading Earth. A news reporter at the base (Brown's girlfriend) runs to him with the question, [...] "People are <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a suicide mission, why are you doing this?" [...] Brown replies, [...] "I'm doing a service for my country and my planet. If that means saving the people I love and I care about, then that's what I'll do." [...] As the spacecraft takes off, tears run down Brown's face before the spacecraft crashes into the alien ship, killing him. Brown and his girlfriend are then shown, hugging on the couch.|$|E
500|$|At this moment, cries {{are heard}} from the Knights (""): a flying swan has been shot, and a young man is brought forth, a bow {{in his hand and}} a quiver of {{matching}} arrows. Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad, <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a holy place. He asks him outright if he shot the swan, and the lad boasts that if it flies, he can hit it ("") Gurnemanz tells him that the swan is a holy animal, and asks what harm the swan had done him, and shows the youth its lifeless body. Now remorseful, the young man breaks his bow and casts it aside. Gurnemanz asks him why he is here, who his father is, how he found this place and, lastly, his name. To each question the lad replies, [...] "I don't know." [...] The elder Knight sends his squires away to help the King and now asks the boy to tell what he does know. The young man says he has a mother, Herzeleide (Heart's Sorrow) and that he made the bow himself. Kundry has been listening and now tells them that this boy's father was Gamuret, a knight killed in battle, and also how the lad's mother had forbidden her son to use a sword, fearing that he would meet the same fate as his father. The youth now recalls that upon seeing knights pass through his forest, he had left his home and mother to follow them. Kundry laughs and tells the young man that, as she rode by, she saw Herzeleide die of grief. Hearing this, the lad first lunges at Kundry but then collapses in grief. Kundry herself is now weary for sleep, but cries out that she must not sleep and wishes that she might never again waken. She disappears into the undergrowth.|$|E

2500|$|However, [...] This {{means that}} 10-adic numbers {{do not always}} have multiplicative inverses i.e. valid reciprocals, which in turn implies that though 10-adic numbers form a ring they do not form a field, a {{deficiency}} that makes them much less useful as an analytical tool. Another way of <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that the ring of 10-adic numbers is not an integral domain because they contain zero divisors.
