40|$|Abstract. A variational {{technique}} {{to describe the}} ground and scattering states below the break–up threshold for a three-nucleon system is developed. The method consists in expanding the wave function in terms of correlated Harmonic Hyperspherical functions suitable to handle the large repulsion contained in the nuclear potential at short distances; three body forces have also been considered. The inclusion of the pp Coulomb repulsion in the p–d processes does not cause any particular problem, since no partial wave decomposition of the interaction is performed. Accurate numerical results are given for ground state properties and scattering lenghts, phase shifts and mixing parameters at three different energies of the incident nucleon. The agreement with other available results and with experimental analyses is higlly <b>satisfactory.</b> <b>1...</b>|$|E
40|$|Communicated by Huanshui Zhang) Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a class of}} optimal control problems involving time delayed dynamical systems and subject to continuous state in-equality constraints. We show {{that this type of}} problem can be approximated by a sequence of time delayed optimal control problems subject to inequal-ity constraints in canonical form and with multiple characteristic time points appearing in the cost and constraint functions. We derive formulae for the gradient of the cost and constraint functions of the approximate problems. On this basis, each approximate problem can be solved using a gradient-based optimization technique. The computational method obtained is then applied to an industrial problem arising in the study of purification process of zinc sulphate electrolyte.
