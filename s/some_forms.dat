5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals. <b>Some</b> <b>forms</b> have characteristics {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E

5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in <b>some</b> <b>forms</b> of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views of}} {{pornography}} range from condemnation of pornography {{as a form}} of violence against women, to an embracing of <b>some</b> <b>forms</b> of pornography as a medium of feminist expression.

5|$|Nine {{species of}} Perovskia are recognized. P.abrotanoides shares {{much of the}} range of P.atriplicifolia, but is {{distinguished}} by its bipinnate leaves. Hybrids between these two species may occur naturally. Restricted to Turkestan in its native range, P.scrophularifolia is less upright; <b>some</b> <b>forms</b> have white flowers. The flowers of P.scabiosifolia are yellow.|$|E

Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle.

Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. <b>Some</b> <b>forms</b> of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E

In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E

Some {{of the most common}} causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits. Cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants.

Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre.
