The filtering and modulation is done with frequency-warped recursive filters that have been implemented in real-time on a modern DSP processor.

40|$|This is {{a special}} edition of a Wageningen University Working Papers in Evolutionary Governance Theory (EGT). EGT offers a new {{perspective}} on the way markets, institutions and societies evolve together. It can be of use to anyone interested in market and public sector reform, development, public administration, politics and law. Theoretically, the approach draws on a wide array of sources: institutional & development economics, systems theories, post- structuralism, actor- network theories, discourse theory, planning theory and legal studies. In this working paper we use the EGT perspective to make an argument for greater reflexivity in planning and design education. Reflexivity is understood as a sustained reflection on the positionality of knowledge and presented as an opportunity to strengthen the academic dimension of planning and design curricula. The planning and design curricula, we argue, cannot tackle these issues without a deeper and more systematic self-reflection, a reflection on the disciplines, their teaching, on the role of planners and designers in society. We will show how research and outreach can play a transformative role in the development and delivery of professional landscape architecture and planning curricula (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>www.</b> governancetheory. com) ...|$|R

40|$|Too often, {{we assume}} great streets are defi ned by great buildings. Yet many streetscapes {{distinguish}} themselves {{by the presence}} of fl ower or vegetable gardens, front yards or backyards, allotment gardens, community playing fi elds or parks. Gardens, as a substantial element of low-density (and even high-density) neighbourhoods, articulate a highly qualitative relationship between private and public properties, between shared spaces and those used individually and between domestic spaces that can be separated or joined. As a consequence, streetscapes need to be considered as spaces delimited not only by building façades but also by configurations of garden walls, fences, strips of grass, tree lines, muddy roads or concrete slabs for parking: these are the territorial borders that indicate how and to what extent collective spaces can be interpreted and appropriated by their users. This paper presents a theoretical framework that studies gardens as structural elements of streetscapes and it discusses a case study in Williamsburg, New York, that is part of the international Streetscape Territories Research Project being conducted by the Department of Architecture of the University of Leuven on different cases of streetscapes in New York, Barcelona, Ghent, Brussels, Havana, Addis Ababa and so on (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>www.</b> streetscapeterritories. wordpress. com).  Additional international references to recent uses of space in diff erent sociocultural contexts are provided to broaden the perspective of the research.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{autochthonous}} human case of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) in the Bordeaux area, southwestern France. The patient was a farmer who had severe encephalomyelitis. ELISA and neutralization assay of serum and cerebrospinal fl uid established the diagnosis. This potential new endemic focus for TBE virus should be further investigated. Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) {{is the most}} important human arboviral infection of the central nervous system in Europe and Russia (1, 2). The disease is endemic to areas where transmission vectors (Ixodes ricinus, I. persulcatus) are distributed. During the past 10 years, the incidence of the disease has increased, particularly in Lithuania, Germany, Switzerland, and Poland, and human cases have been reported from new areas (3 – 5; <b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>www.</b> tbe-info. com/ tbe. aspx). Tickborne encephalitis viruses (TBEV), such as dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, belong to the family Flaviviridae. Among the TBEV, 3 genotypes have been described (6) : the European subtype transmitted by I. ricinus and the Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes transmitted by I. persulcatus. Large mammals, such as goats, sheep, and cattle, are important bloodfeeding hosts for adult ixodid ticks. Because the virus is excreted in milk, small outbreaks may result from consumption of raw milk from sheep or goats. To our knowledge, only viruses of the western genotype have been isolated in Western Europe. In central and Western Europe, cases occur between April and November, and peak in June–July and September–October in relation to tick activity (1, 2). The progression of incidence follows the development of tourism, trekking, and camping/hiking in virus-endemic countries (3). The European subtype virus usually produces a biphasic illness. The incubation period lasts an average of 7 – 14 days (range 2 – 28 days). Primary infection is generally associated with a flulike syndrome, but infection ma...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} an analytic {{study of the}} process used by John Chowning for the composition of Stria. This article is intended to complete {{the description of the}} compositional process given in a previous work (Meneghini 2003), largely restated by Bossis in a subsequent paper (Bossis 2005). Stria was composed in 1977 and was fully generated by means of computer algorithms (Chowning 1977 c) and the corresponding input files (Chowning 1977 a,b) : all the parameters of the sounds generated in Stria are determined and calculated by these algorithms on the basis of specific mathematical rules and of numerical parameters chosen by Mr. Chowning as input for the programs. For this reason, an accurate analysis of these algorithms is-fundamental for a complete comprehension of the compositional process. This analysis has three degrees of interest: at first, it enables a study of the composer's intentions regarding the piece's characteristics. Secondly, it complements the comprehension of Stria obtainable from listening with analytic data on the properties of the sounds. Finally, it provides information on the characteristics of the piece {{that can be used for}} the re-writing of the algorithms and for the analysis and re-synthesis of the piece (Baudouin 2007; Dahan 2007). The work described in this article began in 2002, and it started with the study of the programming language SAIL) used for the generation of the algorithms (Smith 1976; <b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>www.</b> xidak. com/mainsail/ documentation_set_ 1630 _html/docset. html), which was necessary for the understanding of the programs. The algorithms (Chowning 1977 c) have been then carefully analyzed, line by line, to achieve a complete understanding on how the parameters of each sound generated in Stria are determined. Personal communication with the composer was indispensible for the interpretation of some of the procedures used, and for the understanding of Mr. Chowning's intentions related to programming choices. © 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R
40|$|Scone is a knowledge-base system {{developed}} {{specifically to}} support human-like common-sense reasoning and {{the understanding of}} human language. One of the unusual features of Scone is its multiple-context system. Each context represents a distinct world-model, but a context can inherit most of the knowledge of another context, explicitly representing just the differences. We explore how this multiple-context mechanism {{can be used to}} emulate some aspects of human mental behavior that are difficult or impossible to emulate in other representational formalisms. These include reasoning about hypothetical or counter-factual situations; understanding how the world model changes over time due to specific actions or spontaneous changes; and reasoning about the knowledge and beliefs of other agents, and how their mental state may affect the actions of those agents. The Scone Knowledge-Base System Scone is a knowledge representation and reasoning system – a knowledge-base system or KB system – that has been developed {{over the last few years}} by the author’s research group at Carnegie Mellon University (Fahlman 2006; <b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>www.</b> cs. cmu. edu/~sef/scone/). Scone, by itself, is not a complete AI or decision-making system, and does not aspire to be; rather, it is a software component – a sort of smart active memory system – that is designed to be used in a wide range of software applications, both in AI and in other areas. Scone deals just with symbolic knowledge. Things like visualization, motor memory, and memory for sound sequences are also important for human-like AI, but we believe that those will have specialized representations of their own, linked in various ways to the symbolic memory. Scone has been used in a number of applications at Carnegie Mellon and with a few selected outside partners; we plan a general open-source release of Scone in the nea...|$|R
40|$|Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar affective {{disorder}} (BPAD) (formerly termed manic-depressive illness) are severe, disabling psychiatric {{illnesses that}} feature promi-nently in the top ten causes of disability worldwide (Lopez and Murray 1998). Each will affect about 1 % of the pop-ulation in their lifetime. The cost of providing treatment for mental illness in the UK National Health Service is es-timated at 10 % of total expenditure. The total costs (med-ical, social, economic) are estimated at £ 32 billion per an-num for the population of 50 million in England (Bird 1999; <b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>www.</b> mentalhealth. org. uk). World Health Organization predictions indicate that major depression will be second only to heart disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by 2020 (Lopez and Murray 1998). Research into the causes of these devastating dis-orders {{and the development of}} improved interventions is a high scientific, social, individual, and public health prior-ity. Unfortunately, these remain Cinderella disorders com-pared to cancer and heart disease, both in terms of gov-ernmental and societal recognition and national and international research support. Despite their high preva-lence and, indeed, decades of neuroscience research, little is known with certainty about their cellular and molecular bases. Consequently, treatments remain largely empirical and palliative. This apparent impasse, however, justifies neither complacency nor despondency, because the one consistent, replicable finding is that family, twin, and adoption studies demonstrate a major genetic component in both SCZ and BPAD (Merikangas and Risch 2003). A decade ago only a handful of genes for monogenic disor-ders had been positionally cloned through linkage studies. Over the past five years, as the Human Genome Project and associated tools have developed, that number has soared to over 1000. As the Human Genome Project passes from formal completion to full development as a universal biological tool, we can expect accelerated progress in tackling the much more difficult task of genet-ically dissecting the common complex disorders including major mental illness...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere {{is a joke}} where a {{physicist}} and a mathematician are asked to herd cats. The physicist starts with an infinitely large pen which he reduces until it is of reasonable diameter yet contains all the cats. The mathematician builds a fence around himself and declares the outside to be the inside. Defining memory models is akin to herding cats: both the physicist's or mathematician's attitudes are tempting, but neither can go without the other. When executing shared-memory concurrent programs, modern multiprocessors (e. g. Intel x 86, IBM Power or ARM) exhibit be-haviours (e. g. store buffering or load delaying) that contradict the programming model we have been taught at school, namely Lam-port's Sequential Consistency (SC) [4]. Indeed, for performance reasons, multiprocessors implement weak memory models. Ideally, we believe that these models would benefit from stating principles that underpin weak memory as a whole, not just one par-ticular architecture or language. Not only would it be aesthetically pleasing, but it would allow more informed decisions {{on the design of}} high-level memory models, ease the conception and proofs of compilation schemes, and allow the reusability of simulation and verification techniques from one model to another. We outline our work below – full details can be found in [1]. As foundation, we propose an axiomatic generic framework for mod-elling weak memory hardware. We have four axioms: (1) SC PER LOCATION expresses memory coherence; (2) NO THIN AIR defines the minimal causality constraints enforced by deployed hardware; (3) OBSERVATION reflects the ordering of writes induced by mem-ory fences, as observed by an external thread; (4) PROPAGATION states how one can use memory fences to restore SC on top of a weak memory model. We instantiate our framework for SC, TSO, C++ restricted to release-acquire atomics, Power, and ARM. For Power, we compare our model to a preceding operational model [5, 6] in which we found a flaw. To facilitate the comparison, we define in the Coq proof assistant an operational model that we show equivalent to our axiomatic model (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>www.</b> We <b>also</b> propose a model for ARM, based on extensive testing of ARM hardware, and its presumed proximity to Power hard-ware (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> diy. inria. fr/cats/model-arm).

This system is a pair of G 0 main-sequence stars with age about 3 Gyr at a distance of ~ 139 pc and projected separation of ~ 1550 AU. The transit signal has a period of 4. 46529 days and depth of 0. 015 mag. From follow-up photometry and spectroscopy, we find that the object is a "hot Jupiter" planet with mass about 0. 53 M_jup and radius ~ 1. 36 R_jup traveling in an orbit with semimajor axis 0. 055 AU and inclination about 85. 9 deg, thus transiting the star at impact parameter 0. 74 of the stellar radius.

40|$|Recent {{educational}} discourse has {{concentrated on}} {{the central role of}} occupation and occupational science in OT curricula and in the evolution of a 2 ̆ 2 self-defined 2 ̆ 2 profession (Yerxa, 1998). Scholarship related to occupation and occupational science in education has addressed conceptualization and design of curricula (Wood, et al., 2000; Yerxa, 1998), content and faculty development (e. g. Krishnagiri, Pierce, 2 ̆ 6 Primeau, 1998; <b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>www.</b> aotf. org/html/faculty) and teaching methods believed appropriate to occupational therapy (e. g. Nolinski 2 ̆ 6 Millis, 1999; Royeen, 1995; Stern, 1997). Very little research has explored the nature of occupation-centered education as it is enacted within a community of faculty. Without understanding the aims, beliefs, assumptions, and practices enacted in occupation-centered education, it is possible to build new curricula upon former assumptions and thwart the hopes that occupation-centered education will aid OT in becoming 2 ̆ 2 self-defined 2 ̆ 2 (Baxter Magolda, 1999). This 8 -week case study of one graduate program, noted for the central role of occupation and occupational science in its curriculum, explored: How do faculty understand and implement occupation-centered education and how have those understandings developed and changed? What beliefs about learners, learning and knowing are reflected in the practice of occupationcentered education? And what methods are associated with occupation-centered education? The researcher interviewed faculty, attended classes, collected course documents, and attended curriculum meetings. Data were recorded through audiotape, videotape, and fieldnotes, and analyzed using both segmental coding of texts and whole narrative analysis. The results suggest that, in this case, occupation-centered education could not be defined solely as a set of content, preferred learning processes, or overall curriculum design, even while these were vital and important. Beyond content and teaching methods, occupationcentered education was deeply connected to the biographies of the faculty, including their ways of knowing, experiences in the profession, and relationship with the subject of occupation. Students were invited into similar 2 ̆ 2 self-projects 2 ̆ 2, including constructing a self in relation to: authority, occupation, knowing, and major change. This study suggested that occupation-centered education can be conceptualized as an epistemological, intrapersonal, and biographical endeavor through which faculty not only 2 ̆ 2 cover the content 2 ̆ 2 but co-author knowledge, their own lives, and the lives of students...|$|R

40|$|Our article {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the European Union (EU) on border conflicts, in particular how integration and association are related to conflict transformation. We approach this issue from a theoretically as well as empirically grounded constructivist perspective. On this basis we propose a stage model of conflict development, based on the degree of securitization and societal reach of conflict communication. We argue that the EU can transform border conflicts and propose a four pathway-model of EU impact. This model comprises forms of EU impact that are, on the one hand, either actor-driven or indirectly caused by the integration process and have, on the other hand, as their main target either particular policies or the wider society in border conflict areas. We then apply this model to a comparative study of border conflicts, thereby analyzing the conflicts in Northern Ireland, Greece-Turkey, Cyprus, Europe s North (EU-Russia) and Israel-Palestine. We finish with a specification of the conditions of positive and negative EU impact.
