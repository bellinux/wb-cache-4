25|$|Furthermore, a devadasi was {{believed}} to be immune from widowhood and was called akhanda saubhagyavati ("woman never separated from good fortune"). Since she was wedded to a divine deity, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the especially welcome guests at weddings and was regarded as a bearer of good fortune. At weddings, people would receive a string of the tali (wedding lock) prepared by her, threaded with a few beads from her own necklace. The presence of a devadasi on any religious occasion in the house of an upper caste member was regarded as sacred and she was treated with due respect and was presented with gifts.|$|E

[...] She identified the most difficult parts as the ones where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> angry, and the transitioning between being normal and [...] "crazy". In an interview, Leandersson recalled how she went totally into her role, {{to the point of}} [...] "becoming" [...] the character Eli, but affirmed that there are few similarities between herself and her character, describing Eli as more mature and contemplative.

500|$|Luke's line, [...] "Welcome to the O.C., bitch", {{which he}} says after beating up Ryan, became a tagline for the show. TV Land placed the line as 83rd in its 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases in 2006. Hadley Freeman of The Guardian noted that the teen-focused show made many {{cultural}} references due to a [...] "renewed interest in the teen market", adding {{that the use of}} cropped tops, micro-minis, and beaded flip-flops showed a [...] "decidedly West Coast approach to fashion". The episode's cultural references to fashion included Julie Cooper's question to her pre-pubescent daughter, [...] "Do you like my hair this straight or is it too Avril Lavigne?", while another mother complains, [...] "What are you doing putting my daughter in Calvin Klein? <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Vera Wang!"

A princess from the Croatian House of Šubić of Dalmatia {{was sent by}} her father, Grgur, {{to the court of}} their {{relative}} Tvrtko I, the ban of Bosnia. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raised and married by Tvrtko's mother Jelena. Jelena was the daughter of George II Šubić, whose maternal grandfather was Serbian King Dragutin Nemanjić. The ban and his mother approved of Vukašin's idea to join the Šubić princess and Marko, and the wedding was imminent. However, in April 1370 Pope Urban V sent Tvrtko a letter forbidding him to give the Catholic lady in marriage to the [...] "son of His Magnificence, the King of Serbia, a schismatic" [...] (filio magnifici viri Regis Rascie scismatico). The pope also notified King Louis I of Hungary, nominal overlord of the ban, of the impending [...] "offence to the Christian faith", and the marriage did not occur. Marko subsequently married Jelena (daughter of Radoslav Hlapen, the lord of Veria and Edessa and the major Serbian nobleman in southern Macedonia).|$|E

As a result, he decides to resume dating {{with the help of the}} office employees, even going so far as threatening to fire them if they do not help. No one in the office wants to set up any of their friends with Michael, but when Michael learns that the chair model had died in a car crash some time ago, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) takes pity and sets him up on a blind date with her landlady (Brooke Dillman). The date does not go well, beginning with Michael pretending he is not who <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> meeting. After Michael admits his own blind date was a failure, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) convinces him that he needs closure on this person he loved who is gone. The two end up in a cemetery at the grave of the chair model, where Michael [...] "grieves". They are both singing [...] "American Pie" [...] by Don McLean and dancing on her grave.|$|E

Unlike most other R videos, the video for [...] "Fallin'" [...] was a low-key clip with no dancing. The video {{opens with a}} radio playing [...] "Girlfriend", where Keys is sitting at a piano. The plot has Keys traveling to a prison to visit her incarcerated boyfriend. The plot is continued in the video for Keys' next single, [...] "A Woman's Worth", which explores what happens when Keys' boyfriend is released and, with her help, adjusts back to regular life.

She bore the count many children, and erected for him a magnificent castle by her magical art. Their harmony was uninterrupted until the prying husband broke the conditions of their union, by concealing himself to behold his wife make use of her enchanted bath. Hardly had Melusina discovered the indiscreet intruder, than, transforming herself into a dragon, she departed with a loud yell of lamentation, and was never again visible to mortal eyes; although, even {{in the days of}} Brantome, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the protectress of her descendants, and was heard wailing as she sailed upon the blast round the turrets of the castle of Lusignan the night before it was demolished.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{spent most}} of his early career at Universal Studios until The Thing, after which he left for Lucasfilm to work on Return of the Jedi at the {{invitation}} of Howard Kazanjian. From that point on, Brown's career has taken on a freelance aspect that has allowed him to work on an eclectic list of films and with some of the top actors in the business including Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Samuel L. Jackson, and Kevin Bacon. During the filming of a scene with Barbra Streisand on All Night Long in which Streisand was playing a character who could not sing, Brown remembered, [...] "...when we started to film that scene, she opened her mouth and this incredible voice came out.
