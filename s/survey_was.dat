40|$|All social {{surveys of}} residents' {{reactions}} to environmental noise in residential areas which were described in English language publications from 1943 to 1989 are identified. A total of 318 <b>surveys</b> <b>are</b> described. The <b>surveys</b> <b>are</b> indexed by country, noise source, and data of survey.

5|$|In 2010 {{a further}} <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> {{carried out by}} Bath and Camerton Archaeological Society and the Bath and North East Somerset Archaeological Officer.

50|$|Magnetic <b>survey</b> <b>is</b> one of {{a number}} of methods used in archaeological geophysics. Magnetic surveys record spatial {{variation}} in the Earth's magnetic field.

5|$|The Mahanoy Water Company sought {{permission}} {{to construct a}} dam on Messers Run as early as 1913. The stream {{was used as a}} water supply as early as the early 1900s.

The rationale for UV <b>surveys</b> <b>is</b> explained, and the detectors and instrumentation considered for future UV <b>surveys</b> <b>are</b> described. It is noted that for the wavelength range from 1000 to 2000 A, detectors and instrumentation are already available to provide an all-sky UV survey of moderate resolution (10 to 30 arcsec) and moderate sensitivity (reaching hot stars as faint as 18 th visual magnitude in direct imagery and 11 th magnitude spectrographically with 2 -A resolution) ...|$|R

5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1763 {{descriptions}} of the giant appeared in contemporary magazines. The earliest known <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> published in the Royal Magazine in September 1763. Derivative versions subsequently appeared in the October 1763 St James Chronicle, the July 1764 Gentleman's Magazine, and the 1764 edition of The Annual Register. The Gentleman's Magazine account in particular was prominent, and contained the oldest known drawing of the figure. In 1774, the antiquarian John Hutchins reviewed various previous accounts in his book The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset. In it, he wrote that the carving had only been done the previous century.|$|E

5|$|Between 1963 and 1965, {{archaeological sites}} and remains were located {{with the help}} of aerial photographs, and a ground <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> carried out as well to {{determine}} the periods that were present at each site. Between 1965 and 1970, foreign archaeological missions carried out systematic excavations at the sites of Mureybet (United States), Tell Qannas (Belgium), Habuba Kabira, Mumbaqa (Germany), Selenkahiye (Netherlands), and Emar (France). With help from UNESCO, two minarets at Mureybet and Meskene were photogrammetrically measured, and a protective glacis was built around the castle Qal'at Ja'bar. The castle was located on a hilltop that would not be flooded, but the lake would turn it in an island. The castle is now connected to the shore by a causeway.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, {{concerns}} {{had grown}} {{about the condition}} of the castle and discussions took place between the Penard Golf Club, who owned the site, the Royal Institution and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. A joint committee was formed to raise the funds for repairs to the stonework but the costs appear to have been excessive and instead the gatehouse was patched with concrete between 1923 and 1924. Much of the remaining southern wall collapsed at the beginning of 1960 and an archaeological <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> conducted between 1960 and 1961. Urgent masonry repairs were then carried out in 1963, paid for by a combination of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, the Gower Society, the golf club and a public appeal launched by local newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Edward Seymour {{fell from}} power in 1549, {{and after his}} removal a new <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> carried out by Captain William Tyrell, in part {{to confirm that the}} new fortifications were {{suitably}} located across the islands. Building work across the Scilly Isles continued, expanding to include the neighbouring island of St Mary's, and at least 540 oak trees from South Wales were dispatched to the islands in early 1550, since the islands lacked suitable sources of timber of their own. Orders were given in 1551 to send bows, arrows and the ingredients required to make gunpowder to the islands, where construction teams were kept at work through to the end of 1552.|$|E

5|$|In 1793 {{a further}} <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} by John Rennie, and {{the route of}} the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of the Bruce Tunnel in the Savernake Forest. On 17April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 John Scott {{decided to}} sell the island and castle; the local mayor, Alfred Barrow, intervened and the {{following}} the year the Duke instead agreed to give the castle and island to the local authorities as a memorial {{to those who had}} lost their life in World War I. The castle passed into the care of central government in 1973, and is now controlled by English Heritage, who operate the site as a tourist attraction. An archaeological <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> commissioned by English Heritage in 1984, carried out by Rachel Newman of Lancaster University; the findings of the survey led to a program of restoration work, completed in 1991.
