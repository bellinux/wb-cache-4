5|$|Princeton University {{built the}} chapel {{to replace the}} Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall <b>stand</b> <b>until</b> it {{burned to the ground}} in 1920. The {{location}} for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel would rise from the ashes of the old one, and practically, it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward.|$|E
5|$|Hodad's is a {{small chain}} of {{hamburger}} restaurants in San Diego, United States, established in 1973 by husband and wife Byron and Virginia Hardin, who operated from a single burger <b>stand</b> <b>until</b> 1979.

Mike Hardin died in 2015, leaving the business to his children Shane and Lexi.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, 1986, Righetti {{once again}} made history against the Red Sox when he saved both games of a doubleheader against them, {{finishing}} {{the season with}} 46 saves, and breaking the major league record shared by Dan Quisenberry and Bruce Sutter. The record would <b>stand</b> <b>until</b> Bobby Thigpen saved 57 games for the Chicago White Sox in 1990, which would also be Righetti's last season with the Yankees. Righetti retained the single-season record for left-handers until 1993, when Randy Myers saved 53 games for the Chicago Cubs; Righetti still owns the AL record for left-handers.|$|E

5|$|The four ends of {{the ground}} are called the North Stand, the West Stand, the South Stand, and the BT Stand (east). The South Stand was {{previously}} known as the Hyder <b>Stand,</b> <b>until</b> Hyder was sold. The stadium has three tiers of seating {{with the exception of}} the North Stand, which has two tiers.

5|$|Anfield could {{accommodate}} {{more than}} 60,000 supporters at its peak, {{and had a}} capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater stadium {{in time for the}} 1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276. The findings of the Taylor Report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary <b>Stand</b> <b>until</b> 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 26,500 spectators for sports, of which 14,000 are standing spectators. When hosting concerts, the stadium can host 25,000 spectators when {{the stage is}} on either long side of the stadium, or up to 40,000 when it is {{placed in front of}} either short side. It comprises two main stands on each of the long sides of the pitch: the Southern Stand and the Northern Stand, both of which have two tiers. The lower tier of the Northern Stand is terraced, and was the only tier of the <b>stand</b> <b>until</b> the upper, seated tier was built in 1992. The short sides of the pitch feature two minor terracing sections, respectively named the Eastern Stand and the Western Stand. When Malmö FF were based at the ground, the Northern Stand terracing was the section with the most season ticket holders, while the Eastern Stand was the section used to house away fans.|$|E
