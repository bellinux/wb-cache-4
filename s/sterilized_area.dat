50|$|The {{procedure}} is usually performed using a dermal punch or needle. When a dermal piercing {{is done with}} a punch, the pouch is made in a different way. When using a needle, the pouch is made by separating the skin. When using a dermal punch, the pouch is made by removing a bit of tissue. A microdermal punch is less painful and therefore commonly used. The process starts by identifying the point of piercing on the <b>sterilized</b> <b>area</b> that will be marked with a surgical marker. The micro dermalpunch is then used to remove skin tissues. The anchor is then placed under the skin {{and a piece of}} jewelry is placed using surgical forceps.|$|E

Face {{down on the}} kitchen table is a barely conscious Porter (Mel Gibson), severely wounded with two large bullet wounds in his back. The doctor pours whiskey on Porter's back to <b>sterilize</b> the <b>area</b> and digs out the bullets. Porter spends five months recuperating. Porter narrates that he had $70,000 taken from him and that is {{what he was going to}} get back.|$|R
40|$|The recent neoadjuvant {{treatments}} by combined use of chemoterapy, radiotherapy or {{a combination}} of both before surgical treatment, has changed the histologic features of the surgical specimens. Therefore, the neoadjuvant therapies may affect the natural history of a tumour, by decreasing the volume of the tumour, reducing the percentage of compromised lymph nodes, <b>sterilizing</b> the <b>area</b> where the tumour should be surgically treated, and cleaning any neoplastic residue. The concept of “down staging” is emerged, meaning an improvement of the behaviour of the tumour at the surgical time. In the present work, we show the efficacy and the toxicity of new radiosensitive drugs, specifically oral fluoropyrimidines(capacitabine), in a group of 47 patients studied in our unit...|$|R

50|$|The MFA {{technology}} has potential uses beyond levitating skateboards. Applications of MFA technology include structural isolation, recreation and entertainment, industrial automation and transportation, according to Arx Pax, Inc. Hovering robots cleaning and <b>sterilizing</b> key <b>areas</b> {{of a medical}} facility, industrial tools such as fork lifts incorporating MFA Technology for a safer and more efficient workplace, and even a magnetic tractor beam through a partnership with NASA have been envisioned. Additionally, once you join MFA technology to the Internet of Things (IoT), the possibilities may seem endless. There are wearables; Arx Pax envisions something called movables, making the environment the MFA technology is employed in a smarter landscape. Employment into the IoT provides the ability to continually respond to space and time.|$|R
50|$|Conch piercings are {{cared for}} just like other piercings {{in the ear}} cartilage. Sea salt soaks are {{recommended}} twice daily at a minimum to clean the piercing and jewelry, soften dried lymph, partially <b>sterilize</b> the <b>area</b> (via the salt), alleviate soreness and swelling, and promote {{blood flow to the}} area with the warm water in order to aid the healing process. Over-washing, the use of things such as alcohol and peroxide, and the use of antibiotic ointments should be avoided, as the former two will cause the wound to dry out, and the latter will cut off the air supply, both of which will inhibit healing. A competent piercer will recommend the best jewelry to wear while healing, and jewelry should not be removed or changed for at least eight weeks.|$|R
40|$|S ince the April 2004 {{release of}} the CDNA(NH&MRC) Infection Control Guidelines,greater {{attention}} has been placed within everyday infection control onto risk management strategies. Tracking of critical instruments is exactly that- a risk management action which can be taken {{on the part of}} the practice at very low cost, but which can help prevent the potentially catas-trophic consequences of the following two scenarios (amongst others) : • A trainee or junior staff member who returns a set of oral surgical instruments to circulation from the <b>sterilizing</b> <b>area,</b> thinking that they have already been sterilized, when this is not the case (they have only been cleaned and packaged in preparation for sterilization). These instruments are then used unwittingly on other patients, raising the spectre of cross-contamination between patients; or • A patient who develops a post-surgical infection and then launches litigation against the practitioner for damages, alleging that the instruments used for surgery were not sterile at the point of use. Tracking critical instruments used in certain clin-ical procedures (such as oral surgery) back to a particular autoclave cycle is an administrative pro-cess which requires several actions: • Maintaining a comprehensive log of autoclave cycles at the time of loading; • Identifying which cycles critical instruments will be processed in; • Instituting a batch numbering system, either manually or with a labeling gun; • Placing batch codes on instrument packs; • Checking packs after autoclaving for batch num-bering data; • Completing the sign-off of the cycle release based on physical and chemical indicator results; and • Entering batch codes into patient records after surgical procedures. Rationale for tracking The recommendation for tracking critical instru-ments is contained in section 3. 5 of the 2004 CDNA guidelines. Tracking is recommended only for critical instruments, i. e. those that intentionally enter or penetrate a sterile tissue, cavity or the bloodstream, because of the risk of introducing infection into these sites. Single use instruments do not require tracking, however any reusable instruments used for the following procedures should be tracked:...|$|R
50|$|The rook {{piercing}} is also {{cared for}} much {{like any other}} ear cartilage piercing. Salt soaks (warm water (optimally sterilized by boiling) mixed {{with a small amount}} of sea salt) are recommended twice a day for the first month or two. These soaks will soften any dried lymph, clean the piercing as well as the jewellery, partially <b>sterilize</b> the <b>area</b> due to the salt, and alleviate swelling and soreness. The warm water also encourages blood flow to the area aiding in the healing process. Washing the area once a day gently with liquid soap and warm water will decrease the chances of infection. Ideally an antimicrobial soap should be used, but for most people a fragrance-free and dye-free liquid antibacterial soap will suffice. One must be careful not to over-wash the area as this can lead to drying the area out. Alcohol and peroxide should also not be used for the same reason. Antibacterial and antimicrobial ointments (such as Neosporin) should never be used as they seal off the wound from receiving any air. One should avoid touching the area as much as possible, and if necessary, wash their hands beforehand. Care should be taken when changing shirts so that the jewellery isn't tugged as well as when using a telephone as the receiver may spread germs to the wound and the pressure can delay healing. Otherwise for most people the area is tucked into the ear more so than most other cartilage piercings and is less susceptible to incidental bumps and knocks.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} implementation of a portable scalable surface-sterilizer using dielectric barrier plasma as the sterilizing mechanism. There has been increasing interest in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma at atmospheric pressure as a sterilizing mechanism. Plasma sterilization has potential of becoming a new practical and effective method of sterilization. It has broad applications, from medical devices to food preparation equipment. However, {{there has not been a}} development on the electronics that would allow for a system that is portable.   Portability of such system can be of great benefit in scenarios such as natural disaster relief efforts or war triage. This work outlines the design of portable electronics that can generate DBD plasma at atmospheric pressure. A complete system is implemented consisting of multiple electrodes powered up in a duty cycling fashion. This allows the surface to <b>sterilize</b> only contaminated <b>areas</b> while discriminating clean ones. An analysis of load conditions is studied and its effects on the design of the system is presented. Also, the relationship between power delivered vs. load conditions is outlined, while emphasizing the limitations of the technology and further improvements. Furthermore, the generation of plasma from a remote power source is explored in the last section. Using the inductively coupled pair of coils, the voltage necessary to generate plasma is transferred. Wireless power transfer/trasnsmission is a technology that can further boost the potential of plasma and its applications. Its advantages and limitations are briefly investigated and presented to encourage further research in this field...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: One of {{the topic}} issues in animal welfare {{activities}} is the free roaming dog welfare especially in developing countries such as Serbia. The way of controlling population of free roaming dogs is their reproduction with the method of "Catch-Neuter-Release. " This complex process consists of capturing free roaming dogs in public <b>areas,</b> <b>sterilizing,</b> and returning them to the public area from which they were temporarily removed. Ovariohysterectomy present the period with a high intensity of stress reaction since many veterinarians in Serbia do not use analgesia for this group of dogs. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the serum cortisol concentration before and after ovariohysterectomy and the level of post-operative pain and sedation in a group of free roaming female dogs treated with carprofen after surgical intervention and in a group with no treatment. Materials and Methods: The study was performed on a total of 20 female dogs under the program for free roaming dog control. Free-roaming dogs were captured in public areas by the communal animal hygiene service and were transported between 30 and 45 min to the clinic of a veterinary practice. Treatment began at 10 : 00 h on the next day and the bitches were kept in cages until they were returned to public locations from which they were temporarily removed to be sterilized. The G 2 group received before closing the incision line carprofen in one dosage of 4 mg/kg given by subcutaneous injection into the scruff. Rescue protocol with carprofen was provided for G 1 after 24 h following ovariohysterectomy same dosage as G 2. Blood (2 ml) was collected from the cephalic vein of each dog in disposable plastic syringes, containing heparin (1 : 1000) 4 times: Before ovariohysterectomy, 30, 120 min and 24 h following ovariohysterectomy. Cortisol concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The multifactorial pain and sedation scale were used for the assessment of pain and sedation. Results: In both groups, the lowest values of serum cortisol concentration were obtained before ovariohysterectomy. Cortisol levels in both groups were significantly higher (p< 0. 01) 30 and 120 min after ovariohysterectomy and showed a decreasing trend toward the end of the observation period (24 h). The results obtained 15 and 30 min after the surgical intervention have revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups (p< 0. 05) showing that female dogs treated with carprofen had a lower value on the pain scale and a higher value on the sedation scale compared to the group with no treatment. Conclusion: Carprofen provides both a restful consequence of sedation and a rapid return to a more normal physiological and behavioral state in dogs after ovariohysterectomy...|$|R
