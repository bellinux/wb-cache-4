40|$|Abstract In an eye {{movement}} countermanding paradigm it is demonstrated {{for the first}} time that a tactile stimulus can be an effective <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> when human participants are to inhibit saccades to a visual target. Estimated <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> processing times were 90 – 140 ms, comparable to results with auditory <b>stop</b> <b>signals,</b> but shorter than those commonly found for manual responses. Two of the three participants significantly slowed their reactions in expectation of the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> as revealed by a control experiment without <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> All participants pro-duced slower responses in the shortest <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> delay condition than predicted by the race model (Logan and Cowan 1984) along with hypometric saccades on stop failure trials, suggesting that the race model may need to be elaborated to include some component of interaction of <b>stop</b> and go <b>signal</b> processing...|$|R

30|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>signal</b> {{reaction}} time (SSRT) {{was used as}} a measure of individual response inhibition. SSRT is an estimate of the time it takes for a stop process to finish once it is initiated by a <b>stop</b> <b>signal.</b> The finishing time of the stop process was estimated by taking the ith percentile of the go trial distribution, where i corresponded to the percentage of successfully stopped trials in the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> condition (Ridderinkhof, Band, & Logan, 1999). The average <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> delay was subtracted from the estimated finishing time of the stop process {{in order to determine the}} <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> {{reaction time}}. A smaller SSRT indicated faster inhibition when responding to the primary task. The task took approximately 10 min to complete.|$|R
30|$|The <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> task (Blackwell, Chatham, Wiseheart, & Munakata, 2014) {{was used}} to measure {{response}} inhibition. First, in a reaction time block consisting of 16 trials, participants were required to press the letter “f” on the keyboard when they saw a blue circle on the screen or the letter “j” when they saw a red circle, as quickly and accurately as possible. No cues were provided and the mean reaction time was used as a baseline to compare performance on the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> trials. Next, participants performed a practice <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> block consisting of 16 trials, where they were presented with go and no-go trials. On the no-go trials, participants were required to inhibit their response (i.e. not press “f” or “j” in response to the circle on the screen) when they heard a <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> (i.e. the verbal prompt “stop”). This block allowed participants to become better acquainted with the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> portion of the task and allowed for calibration of the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> delay.|$|R
40|$|Performance in the stop-signal {{paradigm}} {{involves a}} balance between going and stopping, and one way that this balance is struck is through shifting priority away from the go task, slowing responses after a <b>stop</b> <b>signal,</b> and improving the probability of inhibition. In 6 experiments, the authors tested {{whether there is a}} corresponding shift in priority toward the stop task, speeding reaction time to the <b>stop</b> <b>signal.</b> Consistent with this hypothesis, stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) decreased on the trial immediately following a <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> in each experiment. Experiments 2 – 4 used 2 very different <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> within a modality, and stopping improved when the stop stimulus repeated and alternated. Experiments 5 and 6 presented <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> in different modalities and showed that SSRT improved only when the stop stimulus repeated within a modality. These results demonstrate within-modality post-stop-signal speeding of response inhibition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe stop-signal or countermanding task probes {{the ability}} to control action by {{requiring}} subjects to withhold a planned movement in response to an infrequent <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> which they do with variable success depending on the delay of the <b>stop</b> <b>signal.</b> We investigated whether performance of humans and macaque monkeys in a saccade countermanding task was influenced by stimulus and performance history. In spite of idiosyncrasies across subjects several trends were evident in both humans and monkeys. Response time decreased after successive trials with no <b>stop</b> <b>signal.</b> Response time increased after successive trials with a <b>stop</b> <b>signal.</b> However, post-error slowing was not observed. Increased response time was observed mainly or only after cancelled (signal inhibit) trials and not after noncancelled (signal respond) trials. These global trends were based on rapid adjustments of response time in response to momentary fluctuations in the fraction of <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> trials. The effects of trial sequence on the probability of responding were weaker and more idiosyncratic across subjects when <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> fraction was fixed. However, both response time and probability of responding were influenced strongly by variations in the fraction of <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> trials. These results indicate that the race model of countermanding performance requires extension to account for these sequential dependencies and provide a basis for physiological studies of executive control of countermanding saccade performance...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of {{frequency}} of occurrence of <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> in the stop-signal paradigm. Presenting <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> less frequently resulted in faster reaction times to the go stimulus and a lower probability of inhibition. Also, go stimuli elicited larger and somewhat earlier P 3 responses when <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> occurred less frequently. Since the amplitude effect was more pronounced on trials when go signals were followed by fast than slow reactions, it probably reflected a stronger set to produce fast responses. N 2 and P 3 components to <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> were observed to be larger and of longer latency when <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> occurred less frequently. The amplitude enhancement of these N 2 and P 3 components were more pronounced for unsuccessful than for successful stop-signal trials. Moreover, the successfully inhibited stop trials elicited a frontocentral P 3 whereas unsuccessfully inhibited stop trials elicited a more posterior P 3 that resembled the classical P 3 b. P 3 amplitude in the unsuccessfully inhibited condition also differed between waveforms synchronized with the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> and waveforms synchronized with response onset whereas N 2 amplitude did not. Taken together these findings suggest that N 2 reflected a greater significance of failed inhibitions after low probability <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> while P 3 reflected continued processing of the erroneous response after response execution...|$|R
50|$|A {{particular}} {{signal box}} may control {{one or more}} <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> on each running line. In a traditional mechanically signalled area, it is most common for a signal box to have two <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> governing each line. The first reached by a train {{is known as the}} home <b>signal.</b> The last <b>stop</b> <b>signal,</b> known as the starting or section signal, is usually located past the points etc. and controls entry to the block section ahead. The distance between the home and starting signals is usually quite short (typically a few hundred yards), and allows a train to wait for the section ahead of it to clear without blocking the line {{all the way back to}} the previous <b>stop</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|During a <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> task the frontocentral N2 is {{sensitive}} to time pressure, in that when individuals are asked to respond {{as quickly as possible}} the amplitude of the N2 increases. This increase in amplitude is larger within individuals who have what is considered a fast <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> reaction time and thus who are able to inhibit a preponent response very quickly. The N2 amplitude is also reduced over right frontal electrodes sites in ADHD children. The N2 latency during the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> task is longer in unsuccessful than successful trials suggesting that the mental process is taking too long to evaluate the <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> and therefore not fully processing the signal enough to inhibit a motor response.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn a <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> {{paradigm}} {{to investigate}} the control of human saccades subjects were instructed to make a saccade to a visual target appearing suddenly l 5 ° {{to the left or}} {{to the right of the}} fixation point. In 25 % of the trials an auditory <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> was presented after a variable delay that required the subject to inhibit the saccade. The <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> was presented randomly at the target position, at the opposite side, or at fixation. Using different estimation techniques the average time needed to inhibit a saccade (<b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> processing time, or SSPT) was estimated on the basis of the race model. The SSPT estimates ranging from 50 to 100 ms (depending on subject) are shorter than those from previous studies with visual <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> Position of the auditory <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> did not show an effect on countermanding effectiveness. We found saccadic response times consistent with the race model predictions for two subjects, while a third subject showed small but consistent violations. Moreover, all subjects showed a tendency towards hypometric saccades for responses that could not be inhibited. These findings are discussed with respect to recent neurophysiological results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Response {{inhibition}} in <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> tasks {{has been}} explained as {{the outcome of}} a race between GO and STOP processes (e. g., Logan, 1981). Response choice in two-alternative perceptual categorization tasks has been explained as {{the outcome of a}}n accumulation of evidence for the alter-native responses. To begin unifying these two powerful inves-tigation frameworks, we obtained data from humans and macaque monkeys performing a <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> task with re-sponses guided by perceptual categorization and variable degrees of difficulty, ranging from low to high accuracy. Comparable results across species reinforced the validity of this animal model. Response times and errors increased with categorization difficulty. The probability of failing to inhibit responses on <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> trials increased with <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> delay, and the response times for failed <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> trials were shorter than those for trials with no <b>stop</b> <b>signal.</b> Thus, the Logan race model could be applied to estimate the duration of the stop-ping process. We found that the duration of the STOP process did not vary across a wide range of discrimination accuracies. This is consistent with the functional, and possibly mechanis-tic, independence of choice and inhibition mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Exposure to {{palatable}} {{foods in}} the environment can trigger impulsive reactions to obtain them, which may lead to unhealthy food choices and eating behaviour. Two studies tested the fundamental question whether impulsive unhealthy food choices can be altered by means of linking unhealthy palatable foods to behavioural <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> DESIGN: Study 1 adopted a 2 (<b>signal</b> condition: <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> vs. control) by 2 (appetite: low vs. high) between-subjects design. Study 2 adopted a 2 (<b>signal</b> condition: <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> vs. control) between-subjects design with frequency to consume unhealthy palatable foods as a continuous factor. METHODS: Participants performed a task in which behavioural <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> were either consistently (or not) presented in close temporal proximity to unhealthy palatable snack foods. Next, participants were {{given the opportunity to}} select snacks {{that they would like to}} consume. RESULTS: Two studies showed that participants were less likely to select unhealthy palatable foods that had been presented near <b>stop</b> <b>signals,</b> and that they selected healthy foods instead. Importantly, this reduction in choices for palatable foods was especially observed when participants' appetite was relatively high (Study 1), or when this food was part of their habit to frequently consume this food (Study 2). CONCLUSION: These findings show that a short <b>stop</b> <b>signal</b> intervention in which palatable foods are presented in close temporal proximity of <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> can reduce palatable food choices by modifying an impulsive determinant of eating behaviour. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Exposure to unhealthy palatable foods {{in the environment}} can lead to impulsive food choices. People's habits towards unhealthy palatable foods and their current state of appetite are important determinants of such impulsive food choices. This impulsive behaviour is hard to change. What this study add? Linking unhealthy palatable foods to behavioural <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> reduces choices for these foods, and increases healthy food choices. This effect is particularly strong when people's food choices are driven by their current state of appetite or habits. Behavioural <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> foster healthy eating behaviour by modifying an impulsive determinant of behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive control allows {{humans to}} {{overrule}} and inhibit habitual responses to optimize performance in challenging sit-uations. Contradicting traditional views, recent {{studies suggest that}} cognitive control processes can be initiated unconsciously. To further capture the relation between consciousness and cog-nitive control, we studied the dynamics of inhibitory control processes when triggered consciously versus unconsciously in {{a modified version of}} the stop task. Attempts to inhibit an im-minent response were often successful after unmasked (visible) <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> Masked (invisible) <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> rarely succeeded in instigating overt inhibition but did trigger slowing down of re-sponse times. Masked <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> elicited a sequence of dis-tinct ERP components that were also observed on unmasked <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> The N 2 component correlated with the efficiency of inhibitory control when elicited by unmasked <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> and with the magnitude of slowdown when elicited by masked <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> Thus, the N 2 likely reflects the initiation of inhibi-tory control, irrespective of conscious awareness. The P 3 compo-nent was much reduced in amplitude and duration on masked versus unmasked stop trials. These patterns of differences and similarities between conscious and unconscious cognitive con-trol processes are discussed in a framework that differentiates between feedforward and feedback connections in yielding con-scious experience. ...|$|R

Furthermore, the effect of the distractors on going was smallest in the central stop-signal condition, medium in a condition in which no signals could occur, and largest in the condition in which <b>stop</b> <b>signals</b> could occur in the periphery. The results show that an important component of stopping is finding a balance between ignoring irrelevant information in the environment and monitoring for the occurrence of occasional <b>stop</b> <b>signals.</b> These findings highlight the importance of sensory detection processes when stopping and could shed new light on a range of phenomena and findings in the response inhibition literature...|$|R
