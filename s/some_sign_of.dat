500|$|As the day progressed, British {{reinforcements}} {{that were}} originally left {{to guard the}} camp near the Modder River started to arrive—first the Gordon Highlanders and later the 1st and 2nd Coldstream Guards. At the same time, Cronjé launched a fresh attack on the British southern (right) flank {{in an attempt to}} extend a salient to the left and behind the remaining Highlanders, cutting them off from the main British force. Initially the Seaforths attempted to stem this attack and ran into the Scandinavian Corps, which they quickly neutralised. [...] The Seaforths then had to regroup, which prevented them from further action to halt the Boer attempts to encircle the Highland Brigade. The Grenadier Guards, with five companies of the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, were moved to counter the attack. [...] The British only showed <b>some</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> success after the freshly arrived battalions of the Coldstream Guards were committed too. [...] But once the Coldstreams were committed, Methuen had engaged all of his reserves.|$|E
2500|$|Although Fermi's name is most {{commonly}} associated with the paradox, {{he was not the}} first to ask the question. An earlier implicit mention was by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in an unpublished manuscript from 1933. He noted [...] "people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe" [...] because [...] "(i) if such beings exist they would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed then they would have given us <b>some</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> their existence." [...] This was not a paradox for others, who took this to imply the absence of ETs, but it was for him, since he himself was a strong believer in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel. [...] Therefore, he proposed what is now known as the zoo hypothesis and speculated that mankind is not yet ready for higher beings to contact us. That Tsiolkovsky himself {{may not have been the}} first to discover the paradox is suggested by his above-mentioned reference to other people's reasons for denying the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.|$|E
