5|$|Smith's death {{resulted}} in a succession crisis. Smith had proposed <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> choose his successor, but had never clarified his preference. Smith's brother Hyrum, had he survived, {{would have had the}} strongest claim, followed by Smith's brother Samuel, who died mysteriously a month after his brothers. Another brother, William, was unable to attract a sufficient following. Smith's sons Joseph III and David also had claims, but Joseph III was too young and David was yet unborn. The Council of Fifty had a theoretical claim to succession, but it was a secret organization. Some of Smith's chosen successors, such as Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, had left the church.|$|E

5|$|There are <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes {{were defined}} in Ancient Greece {{to describe the}} weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus {{on the effects of}} climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E
