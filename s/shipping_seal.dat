5000|$|In 1988, Chaykin created {{perhaps his}} most {{controversial}} title: Black Kiss, a 12-issue series published by Vortex Comics which contained his most explicit depictions {{of sex and}} violence yet.

Even though Black Kiss <b>shipped</b> <b>sealed</b> in an [...] "adults only" [...] clear plastic bag, its content drew much criticism.

5000|$|Having been at sea for a year, and {{suffering}} some damage from a scrape with a merchant <b>ship,</b> <b>Seal</b> {{was due to}} return to dry-dock at Chatham. However her sister ship [...] had been rammed and needed serious attention in the dry-dock. Some repairs to Seal were carried out at Blyth, Northumberland, and she was required to take over Cachalots minelaying duties. She was assigned to Operation DF 7, a mine-laying mission in the Kattegat between Denmark and Sweden. This was a particularly daunting task, especially for a submarine the size of Seal. Captain Bethall, the commanding officer of the flotilla, failed to persuade Admiral Horton to reconsider his orders.|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} the Lübeck shield is not certain, but thought {{to be derived from}} the Hanseatic flag, first seen on a <b>ship's</b> <b>seal</b> in 1230. This is also the oldest {{reference}} to its own national emblem of the city, with the Imperial eagle appearing a little later, first seen on early 14th-century coins. The colors of the shield are thought not to come from the County of Holstein, but from the Imperial arms. From around 1450 the two arms were found combined, the eagle bearing the Hanseatic coat of arms as breast shield. Its continued use today makes it not the oldest coat of arms of Schleswig-Holstein. The oldest coat of arms of Flensburg is older.|$|R
