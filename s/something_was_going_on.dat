25|$|The final {{orders for}} the strike were issued at 17:30 hrs on Friday 3 December 1971. The first {{formations}} were in flight and heading for their targets by 17:40 hrs. Officially, it was announced via government channels that the airstrikes were launched in response to attacks along the western border on Pakistan Rangers' outposts by regular troops of the Indian army, which the Indian Air Force was providing support to. The Indians would later deny any engagement on the Western Front. However, the Indian air defence radars failed to detect the approaching formations. The first indications for the Indians of the impending assault was {{the roar of the}} strike aircraft over their airfields, while in Delhi, the air-raid sirens were the first indications for newsmen, gathered for the daily brief of the East-Pakistan situation, that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1864 Wagner's {{financial}} position was transformed by his new patron, the 18-year-old King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who paid off the composer's debts and awarded him a generous annual stipend. Ludwig also provided Wagner with a lakeside retreat at Lake Starnberg, and a grand house in Munich. [...] At Wagner's instigation, von Bülow accepted a post as Ludwig's [...] "royal pianist"; he and Cosima moved to Munich, {{and took a}} house conveniently close to Wagner's, ostensibly so that Cosima could work as the composer's secretary. From 29 June 1864 Cosima {{spent more than a}} week alone with Wagner at Lake Starnberg, before von Bülow joined them on 7 July. According to Wagner's housekeeper, Anna Mrazek, [...] "it was easy to tell that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> between Frau Cosima and Richard Wagner". [...] Mrazek said that later in the visit von Bülow found his wife in Wagner's bedroom, but nevertheless made no demands for an explanation, either from Wagner or from his wife. Nine months after this visit, on 10 April 1865, Cosima gave birth to a daughter, Isolde. Such was von Bülow's devotion to Wagner that he accepted the child as his own, and registered her as [...] "the legitimate daughter" [...] of Hans and Cosima von Bülow. [...] Wagner attended the Catholic baptism on 24 April. On 10 June 1865, at the Munich Hofoper, von Bülow conducted the premiere of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde.|$|E
2500|$|In 1910, {{they settled}} in Burns in an {{engineering}} camp known as the [...] "Boston tents". Mary and Mott had one child, Glen, who learned from his mother {{how to play the}} fiddle starting at a young age. A classically trained violinist with a [...] "love of children and... a deeply democratic view about making music", Dodge began teaching local children how to play string instruments, first in resident tents then in a photography studio. With assistance from parents and a professional flautist from Italy, who taught the children how to play wind instruments and conducted, Dodge assembled a small orchestra. According to former violin student Ruth Saunders, [...] "All of the sighing, tooting and drumming soon made the citizens aware that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and due to her powers of persuasion, they found themselves devoting their time, talents, money and children {{to the creation of the}} Sagebrush Orchestra." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early June 1918, O'Keeffe {{moved to}} New York from Texas after Stieglitz promised he would provide {{her with a}} quiet studio where she could paint. Within a month he took {{the first of many}} nude {{photographs}} of her at his family's apartment while his wife Emmy was away, but she returned while their session was still in progress. She had suspected <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> between the two for a while, and told him to stop seeing her or get out. Stieglitz left and immediately found a place in the city where he and O'Keeffe could live together. They slept separately for more than two weeks. By the end of July they were in the same bed together, and by mid-August when they visited Oaklawn [...] "they were like two teenagers in love. Several times a day they would run up the stairs to their bedroom, so eager to make love that they would start taking their clothes off as they ran." ...|$|E
2500|$|The usual {{method of}} {{disposing}} of sand {{from all the}} digging was to scatter it discreetly on the surface. Small pouches made of towels or long underpants were attached inside the prisoners' trousers; as they walked around, the sand could be scattered. Sometimes, they would dump sand into the small gardens {{they were allowed to}} tend. As one prisoner turned the soil, another would release sand while they both appeared to be in conversation. The prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges from the sand, and were referred to as [...] "penguins" [...] because of their supposed resemblance. In sunny months, sand could be carried outside and scattered in blankets used for sun bathing; more than 200 were used to make an estimated 25,000 trips. The Germans were aware that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> but failed to discover any of the tunnels until much later. In an attempt to break up any escape attempt, nineteen of the top suspects were transferred without warning to Stalag VIIIC. Of those, only six had actually been involved with tunnel construction.|$|E

5000|$|Picht {{recalls his}} uncle Weizsäcker told him {{afterwards}} about Heidegger's political engagement: I'm pretty sure it's a misunderstandingsuch a thing happens often in history of philosophy.

5000|$|It {{is common}} for Pike to {{threaten}} to set his mum on either Captain Mainwaring, his commanding officer, or Sergeant Wilson if he is shouted at or forced to do something.

6000|$|... "Now, my dear, don't be angry; I {{was only}} teasing you in fun. Tom took {{it into his}} foolish head that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and I felt a natural interest, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Rowly {{felt that}} <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> before her {{which she could}} not understand. Anything of this man's saying which she could not fathom {{must be at least}} dangerous; so she {{determined}} to spoil his purpose, whatever it might be.|$|E

50|$|Muslims are persecuted unjustly. The German {{people were}} told Jews were a threat. The same is {{happening}} here. This is a persecuting {{course of action}} {{that the government has}} taken. They have invented this perception of a threat. To justify that, they have to maintain incidents to prove <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The song {{talks about}} a husband trying to {{convince}} his wife to visit her sister out west, but the narrator (the wife) notices that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> which her husband is trying to hide. She believes he is thinking of having an affair, which she calls [...] "evil on your mind".|$|R
5000|$|On Shima and Kaori’s day off, {{they visit}} Tanabe-san’s sweets shop, {{only to find}} App working there instead. Things aren’t sweet at all, though, when a robber busts in at closing time.

6000|$|She paused, and I {{could see}} that she suffered--suffered horribly. There was in her eyes a hunted look, which no man can, unmoved, see in the eyes of his beloved. I was about to interrupt, when her father's eyes, glancing round with a fierce determination, met mine. I stood silent, almost spellbound; so also the other men. <b>Something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> before us which we did not understand! ...|$|E
60|$|Feeling {{that the}} child was in good hands, I hurried away, for I saw <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> upon the hill-top. When I got to the hill-top, I was shocked to find some people tossing an old woman in a blanket. I begged them to stop; but one of the men, who, I found, was a Welchman, by the name of Taffy, told me the old lady liked it.|$|E
60|$|The clanking {{sound came}} nearer, {{and in the}} ghostly grey of the dawning we could make out long files of men, some fifty or so in all, slowly {{creeping}} up the stair. They were now at the half-way standing place that rested on the great flying arch; and here, perceiving that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> above, they, to our great gain, halted {{for three or four}} minutes and consulted, then slowly and cautiously advanced again.|$|E
50|$|Greenhill {{maintains}} {{his innocence}} but {{shows signs of}} irrational behavior that make Haines wary of him. She assigns her longtime investigator Moe (Jack Warden) to do some digging and he begins to unearth the defendant's shady past. Greenhill in the meantime starts showing up unexpectedly in Haines's social life, stalking her and dropping hints that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> between them.|$|R
50|$|Back in {{the motel}} room, the {{officers}} question Linden. Jack tells Linden {{he needs to}} go to the bathroom, from which he climbs out the window. Linden pretends to take a call, leaves the room, and meets Jack at the car. They drive off, she apologizes to him, and he acts coldly toward her. She leaves another message for Holder, warning him that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R
50|$|In an {{encounter}} between {{the soldiers and}} the rebels, Alexander and Javier met, and since then they tried to learn about each other's lives and family. The two brothers often switch lives and both {{fell in love with}} their female counterparts, Javier with Gabrielle and Alexander with Krista. The people surrounding them start to suspect that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that neither of them knows.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} moment there rose from the house a rending, {{crashing}} sound of woodwork, broken or thrown about, mixed with a quick scream so appalling that Adam, stout of heart as he undoubtedly was, felt his blood turn into ice. Instinctively, despite the danger and their consciousness of it, husband and wife took hands and listened, trembling. <b>Something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> close to them, mysterious, terrible, deadly! The shrieks continued, though less sharp in sound, as though muffled. In the midst {{of them was a}} terrific explosion, seemingly from deep in the earth.|$|E
60|$|Every {{one wanted}} to get rid of every one else except Mrs. Edmonstone; for all but Charlotte guessed at the state of the case, and even she {{perceived}} that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> Lady Eveleen was in a state of great curiosity; but she had mercy, she knew that they must tell each other before it came to her turn, and very good-naturedly she invited Charlotte to come into the garden with her, and kept her out of the way by a full account of her last fancy ball, given with so much spirit and humour that Charlotte could not help attending.|$|E
6000|$|Down {{near the}} end of Orr's Island, facing the open ocean, stands a brown house of the kind that the natives call [...] "lean-to," [...] or [...] "linter,"--one of those large, {{comfortable}} structures, barren in the ideal, but rich in the practical, which the workingman of New England can always command. The waters of the ocean came up within a rod of this house, and the sound of its moaning waves was even now filling the clear autumn starlight. Evidently <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> within, for candles fluttered and winked from window to window, like fireflies in a dark meadow, and sounds as of quick footsteps, and the flutter of brushing garments, might be heard.|$|E
5000|$|Gabriel Case then {{tells them}} {{the story of}} Elsewhere, telling them a doctor who once lived there killed his young wife and himself so they both became the ghosts of Elsewhere. Gabriel Case also {{introduces}} his servant, and it <b>is</b> evident that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> between the two because, after an argument between Terrence and Joan, Gabriel Case tells the servant, [...] "See she forgives him." ...|$|R
50|$|Soon, {{the entire}} city is affected. The New Warriors slowly come to the {{realization}} that it has been August 27th for five days now. Genetech, who have police-ordered custody over the remnants of Asylum's group, also realize <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> They eventually realize it is Thomas, who states that 'reality is a constant only by collective perception'. He wonders why it just can't be August 27.|$|R
60|$|Joseph's face, when {{he opened}} the door, at once {{informed}} me that <b>something</b> extraordinary <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the house.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} {{the door of the}} {{farmhouse}} flew open, and a man stepped out with a dog at his heels. The man looked up at Blacky, and he knew by Blacky's actions that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> back of the barn. Right away he guessed that there must be a Fox there, and calling the dog to follow, he ran around to see what was happening. Of course Reddy heard him coming, and with a little snarl of anger at Blacky the Crow, he seized the fat hen by the neck, threw her body over his shoulder, and started for the near-by swamp as fast as his legs could take him.|$|E
60|$|Jerry Muskrat {{had been}} {{home at the}} Smiling Pool for several days. But he couldn't stay there long. Oh, my, no! He just {{had to get back}} to see what his big cousin, Paddy the Beaver, was doing. So {{as soon as he was}} sure that {{everything}} was all right at the Smiling Pool he hurried back up the Laughing Brook to Paddy's pond, deep in the Green Forest. As soon as he was in sight of it, he looked eagerly for Paddy. At first he didn't see him. Then he stopped and gazed over at the place where Paddy had been cutting aspen trees for food. <b>Something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> there, something queer. He couldn't make it out.|$|E
6000|$|Turning {{her eyes}} from this, Jill became aware that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> {{at the other side}} of the desk, and she {{perceived}} that a second young man, the longest and thinnest she had ever seen, was in the act of rising to his feet, length upon length like an unfolding snake. At the moment of her entry he had been lying back in an office-chair, so that only a merely nominal section of his upper structure was visible. Now he reared his impressive length until his head came within measurable distance of the ceiling. He had a hatchet face and a receding chin, and he gazed at Jill through what she assumed were the [...] "tortoise-shell cheaters" [...] referred to by her recent acquaintance, Mr. Brown.|$|E
50|$|Jeremy and Matt {{navigate}} the caves under the city, {{trying to find}} the gas line. Liz successfully gathered the travelers at the Grill and tries {{to find a way to}} leave before Markos figures out that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> Markos suspects <b>something,</b> so Liz stays for a drink to convince him nothing is happening. Matt and Jeremy find the gas line, break it to cause the leak and they leave.|$|R
