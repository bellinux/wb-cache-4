40|$|Many {{information}} technology artefacts {{can be found}} in today’s cars. The interaction with these artefacts is the driver’s secondary task while driving the car in a safe way is the primary task. When designing interfaces for in-vehicle usage, measures have to be taken {{in order to make the}} interaction with the artefact suit the in-vehicle environment. One of these measures is to have the appropriate <b>screen</b> <b>density</b> level, which is the amount of information present on the screen. This thesis compares the usability of two integrated in-vehicle display prototypes, one with low <b>screen</b> <b>density</b> and one with high <b>screen</b> <b>density.</b> The usability comparison considers both safety and user preferences. Safety was measured by a Lane Change Test (LCT) which measures distraction of a primary task while performing a secondary task, and user preferences was measured with a questionnaire. Before the comparison was made, controls and a graphical user interface were designed. Results showed no significant difference in driver distraction between performing tasks on the high <b>screen</b> <b>density</b> display and the low <b>screen</b> <b>density</b> display. However, a vast majority of the users preferred high <b>screen</b> <b>density</b> over low. Furthermore, the distraction levels for both the high and the low <b>screen</b> <b>density</b> displays were below the proposed 0. 5 meter limit for allowed driver distraction. The results indicate that in-vehicle displays can have a high level of <b>screen</b> <b>density</b> without imposing a level of distraction on the driver that is unsuitable for driving...|$|E

Hundreds of coursewares, aim to increase learners ’ learning outcomes were developed. However, to have a courseware fits with learners ’ characteristics many issues need to be explored. Referring to Resnick’s (1989) definition of learning as knowledge construction, it is critical for coursewares to support learners in the process of acquiring, retaining, and retrieving different kinds of knowledge and performance. In acquiring, retaining, and retrieving information learners use procedures known as cognitive strategies. It is assumed that cognitive strategies are integral to the process of learning, but initiation of their use may come from the learner’s self-instruction, or, from an instructional unit or system.

30|$|The {{importance}} of these interactions must be dully underscored, as DESs have shown that they promote cellular failure through an increase in membrane porosity (Hayyan et al. 2015). In order to {{have an idea of}} what unfolds upon NADESs treatment on cell surface, we used a computational methodology using the COSMO-RS software. COSMO-RS is a very useful and fast tool for the prediction of thermophysical and chemical properties of fluid mixtures (Klamt 2005). It is a model that combines an electrostatic theory of locally interacting molecular surface descriptors with statistical thermodynamics. Although mostly used to predict the thermodynamic properties of a mixture without prior experimental data; it can also be applied to life sciences and molecular studies. Examples include the prediction of drug’s partition coefficients and the computation of proteins pKa (Andersson et al. 2013; Buggert et al. 2009). Two major steps are involved in the COSMO-RS prediction process. The first step involves the creation of virtual conductor surroundings for the molecule by using the continuum solvation model. After performing the quantum chemical calculation through the density functional theory, a <b>screening</b> charge <b>density</b> known as sigma (σ) forms on the nearby conductor. The distribution of the <b>screening</b> charge <b>density</b> {{on the surface of the}} molecule is then converted into a function of surface composition, known as the σ-profile. The second step applies statistical thermodynamic principles to compute the molecular energy due to the electrostatic misfit, hydrogen bond, and Van der Waals interactions (Klamt and Eckert 2000). COSMO-RS can also be used to study the possible thermodynamic behaviour of an individual component in a mixture and its affinity or interactions with the other components through the σ-profile and σ-potential, respectively. The σ-profile describes the molecule polarity properties. Each peak in the σ-profile plot for a molecule corresponds to its constituent atoms depending on their <b>screening</b> charge <b>densities.</b> The negative partial charges of atoms cause positive <b>screening</b> charge <b>densities,</b> and vice versa.|$|R

40|$|The <b>screened</b> Coulomb hybrid <b>density</b> {{functional}} theory {{developed in}} this work extends the applicability of hybrid functionals to large molecules and solids. Traditional hybrid functionals have been applied to medium sized molecules and some insulating solids with excellent results. However, the fundamentally long range of the Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange interaction limits their use for biomolecules and semi-conducting or metallic solids. The large spatial extent of the HF exchange can be reduced by utilizing a screened Coulomb potential. Such potentials {{have been widely used}} in solid state physics. Efforts of employing them in quantum chemistry were not as successful due to the unsatisfactory accuracy of the resulting methods. This work takes a new approach by combining a screened HF potential with both short and long range <b>screened</b> <b>density</b> functionals. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) <b>screened</b> Coulomb hybrid <b>density</b> functional is designed to produce exchange energies comparable to traditional hybrids while only using the short range, screened HF exchange. The accuracy of the HSE functional is assessed {{on a wide range of}} molecules and solids. Enthalpies of formation, geometries and vibrational frequencies of the G 3 set of 223 molecules are predicted with performance equivalent to the best traditional hybrids. A set of 21 insulating, semi-conducting and metallic solids was used to determine the accuracy of lattice constants and bulk moduli. Both properties show significantly improved accuracy, compared to pure density functionals. HSE also accurately predicts band gaps of semi-conductors whereas pure density functionals severely underestimate the band gaps. Benchmarking of HSE in several semi-conducting and metallic solids shows a drastic decrease in computational cost, compared to established hybrid functionals. HSE achieves linear scaling for medium size systems (greater than 15 A) whereas regular hybrids scale as O (N 2. 5) for systems up to 100 A and scale linearly only beyond that. This late cross-over makes it computationally prohibitive to treat complex solids with traditional hybrid functionals. HSE circumvents this bottleneck and produces superior results while increasing computational cost by a factor of only two to four, compared to pure density functional theory...|$|R
