5|$|About 298 {{million years}} ago Permian forests started to cover the continent, and there were tundras as late as 15 {{million years ago}}, but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow {{extensive}} vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor <b>soil</b> <b>quality,</b> lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes. There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts, but only three species of flowering plants, {{all of which are}} found in the Antarctic Peninsula: Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic hair grass), Colobanthus quitensis (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native Poa annua (annual bluegrass). Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, and <b>soil</b> <b>quality,</b> and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and people, {{when they become}} concentrated {{as a result of}} industrial activities. Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease, in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Dietary {{regimes of}} lemurs include folivory, frugivory, and omnivory, with some being highly {{adaptable}} while others specialize on {{foods such as}} plant exudates (tree gum) and bamboo. In some cases, lemur feeding patterns directly benefit the native plant life. When lemurs exploit nectar, they may act as pollinators {{as long as the}} functional parts of the flower are not damaged. In fact, several unrelated Malagasy flowering plants demonstrate lemur-specific pollination traits, and studies indicate that some diurnal species, such as the red-bellied lemur and the ruffed lemurs, act as major pollinators. Two examples of plant species that rely on lemurs for pollination include traveller's palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) and a species of legume-like liana, Strongylodon cravieniae. Seed dispersal is another service lemurs provide. After passing through the lemur gut, tree and vine seeds exhibit lower mortality and germinate faster. Latrine behavior exhibited by some lemurs may help improve <b>soil</b> <b>quality</b> and facilitate seed dispersal. Because of their importance in maintaining a healthy forest, frugivorous lemurs may qualify as keystone mutualists.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and <b>soil</b> <b>quality.</b> A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E

40|$|<b>Soil</b> {{physical}} <b>quality</b> {{is fundamental}} for {{the sustainability of}} agro ecosystems. <b>Soil</b> physical <b>quality</b> assessment must be developed using parameters that describe physical behavior. S, a new soil physical parameter has recently been introduced for assessing the <b>soil</b> physical <b>quality.</b> A good <b>soil</b> physical <b>quality</b> {{has been associated with}} values of S > 0. 035 in soils from temperate climates. However, S has not been evaluated in tropical soils yet. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that S is a reliable <b>soil</b> physical <b>quality</b> indicator of a Typic Hapludox cropped with maize under no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT). Undisturbed samples were collected from each tillage system in the row and interrow positions. Soil bulk density was determined in the samples and the S parameter was calculated using a pedotransfer function from the same samples. The parameter S was able to differentiate tillage and position with S NT < S CT independent of the row and interrow sampling positions. Higher S values were verified in row position than in the interrow in both tillage systems. With the use of a pedotransfer function it was also possible to establish a negative relationship between S and soil compaction. The results confirmed our hypothesis and suggest that further studies should be carried out to evaluate S in other tropical soils and management systems...|$|R

25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new approach to}} restoring land is to inoculate soil with AM fungi when reintroducing vegetation in ecological restoration projects (phytoremediation). It has enabled host plants to establish themselves on degraded soil and improve <b>soil</b> <b>quality</b> and health. Soils' quality parameters were significantly improved long-term when a mixture of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species was introduced compared to noninoculated soil and soil inoculated with a single exotic species of AM fungi. The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher soil organic matter content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation {{in the presence of}} AMF, better water infiltration, and soil aeration due to soil aggregation.|$|E
25|$|Ectomycorrhizas provide many {{benefits}} to their host plants, with enhanced nutrient uptake, growth and establishment in disturbed habitats ranked highly among them. Thus, it seems logical that EcM fungi {{could be used}} in restoration projects aimed at re-establishing native plant species in ecosystems disrupted by a variety of issues. In addition to providing a certain degree of protection to seedlings in harsh circumstances, such as increased salinity or heavy metal pollution, the fungi are also instrumental in improving <b>soil</b> <b>quality.</b> They are able to achieve this through allowing the establishment of early vegetation and subsequent organic litter, preventing erosion, and binding soil particles together yielding stability and soil aggregation. Since the disappearance of mycorhizal fungi from a habitat constitutes a major soil disturbance event, its re-addition {{is an important part of}} establishing vegetation and restoring habitats.|$|E
