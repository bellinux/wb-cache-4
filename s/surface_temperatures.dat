The following month, the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26.7, indicating a slightly above average season. Over next two months, however, fluctuations in sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures,</b> particularly those in the Central Pacific, caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast.

5|$|The Indian Ocean Dipole is an atmospheric–oceanic {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} differences in sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> between {{the eastern and}} western sections of the tropical Indian Ocean. Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section of the tropical Indian Ocean is cooler (lower sea surface temperature) and the western section is warmer than normal (higher sea surface temperature). On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> on the eastern section and cooler sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> on the western section of the tropical Indian Ocean.

Hot white dwarfs, with <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> in excess of 30,000K, have been observed to be sources of soft (i.e., lower-energy) X-rays.

The developed model would predict the average annual <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> based on the known weather parameters. The predicted <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> model for asphalt pavements was very reliable and can be utilized while designing a pavement.
