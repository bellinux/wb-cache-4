The Yo-Yo tests incorporate 2 [*]×[*] 20  m shuttles interspersed with 10  s of active recovery with <b>speed</b> <b>increments</b> regulated by audio signals from a CD player. Participants continue until they can no longer maintain the speed imposed by audio signals, and the distance covered at that moment is the test result [10, 12]. Yo-Yo IR 1 begins at lower speed (10  km/h) than Yo-Yo IR 2 (13  km/h) with slighter <b>speed</b> <b>increments.</b> The Yo-Yo IR 1 assesses an individual’s capacity to repeatedly perform aerobic exercise leading to maximal activation of the aerobic system whilst the Yo-Yo IR 2 focuses on the ability to recover from repeated high intensity exercise with a large anaerobic contribution alongside a significant aerobic component [10]. In untrained participants, the Yo-Yo IR 1 elicits this physiologic response. In trained participants, the Yo-Yo IR 1 typically lasts 15 – 20  min whilst Yo-Yo IR 2 lasts 5 – 15  min. Accordingly, Yo-Yo IR 1 [6, 7] has been reported to be more suitable for recreational players whereas the Yo-Yo IR 2 is more applicable to trained subjects [10]. Both Yo-Yo recovery tests allow for quick determination of maximal heart rate in participants, with faster increases in heart rate observed in Yo-Yo IR 2 [10]. Increased blood lactate and muscle lactate accumulation is elicited in Yo-Yo IR 2, as well as lower creatine phosphate levels on completion of the test and a higher rate of average muscle glycogen utilization during Yo-Yo IR 2 [36, 87].|$|R

Hierarchical mul-tiresolution triangulation and level-of-detail rendering algorithms over regular structures of grid digital elevation models have been widely used for interactive terrain visualization. The main drawbacks of these are the large cost of memory storage required and the possible over-sampling of highresolution terrain models. Triangulated irregular networks (TIN) can reduce the amount of vertices at the expense of more complex and slower memory data access. We present a hyper-block quadtree based triangulated irregular networks approach, where the notion of vertex-selection is extended to block-selection. The hyper-block structure allows to store different pre-calculated triangulations. This reduces the vertex selection time per frame and removes the calculations needed to build the geometric rendering primitives (triangle strips) of the scene at the expense of a larger number of selected vertices.

This concern has motivated the aim of this research promoted by Airbus Defence and Space. The purpose of this research is the numerical simulation of bird impact on semi-spherical transparencies similar to observation bubbles in the C- 295 aircraft in order to obtain a rst approach of the structural behaviour under this fact. The study is divided into three stages: - Firstly, the characterization of the bird is performed against rigid at metallic targets. Experimental data coming from CRAVHI project and analytical interpretation based on Willbeck's theory have been used to validate the results. - Secondly, the characterization of the transparency is achieved, and although the lack of experimental results complicated the labour, some researches and analytical results have been used to find a suitable model. Two analyses on at transparencies have been carried out in parallel, a monolithic transparency and a laminated model (similar to spotter windows and cabin windshields respectively). - Finally, the semi-spherical bubble has been modelled. The explicit numerical simulation code Environment", formerly PAM-CRASH, has been used for the simulation of these impacts. The results show the high dependence of acrylic materials on strain rates and the need to take it into consideration in the modelization of the finite element model. Moreover, the results expressed in terms of ballistic limits show that the current spotter window monolithic design would not fail in case of a bird striking the bubble until speeds about 50 m/s, making the advantages of laminated model (in terms of weight reduction and limit <b>speed</b> <b>increment)</b> of interest for further works.

40|$|Heavy duty vehicle (HDV) {{platooning}} {{is currently}} a big topic both in the academic world and in industry. Platooning is a smart way to solve problems such as safety, traffic congestion, fuel consumption and hazardous exhaust emissions since its concept enables several vehicles to drive {{close to each other}} while maintaining all the security requisites. This way, each vehicle will use the so called slipstream effect, an atmospheric drag reduction that occurs behind a traveling vehicle, consuming less fuel and consequently reducing the exhausted gases. Furthermore, it increases the traffic flow since the distance between vehicles is significantly reduced. The concept and idea of platooning is not particularly new, but only in the last few decades new technology made it possible. HDV platooning scenarios for scale model trucks were developed in the completely renovated Smart Mobility Lab, in KTH, Stockholm. A LabVIEW application was developed giving a robust and stable control of the trucks while following and driving on a newly designed and built road network. The trucks are able to follow a predefined trajectory, change lane and road, platoon with each other with different platooning distances, overtake when the platoon master is changed in order to take the lead of the platoon and change speed to catch up, among other features. The last part of this thesis covers the analysis of the scenarios developed in the testbed. These scenarios represent several situations of HDV platooning, particularly the platoon catch-up case. The main object of this study was the saved fuel due to platooning, and the break-even point, i. e. the distance ratio when neither driving alone nor catching up a platoon ahead would be more feasible. Using real HDV models and their fuel consumption models, simulations were performed in order to check the benefits of platooning and the data got from the scenarios was analyzed. Finally, conclusions were drawn from the experiments where the parameters such as HDV weight, <b>speed</b> <b>increment</b> when catching up and intermediate distance when platooning were different in each trial. It was concluded that a single HDV has to travel 8 to 15 times more than the initial distance that separates it from the HDV(s) ahead and it can save 5 to 13 % of fuel depending if catching up a single HDV or a platoon an already existing platoon. Furthermore, it is less beneficial for a platoon already formed to decide to catch up another HDV...|$|E
40|$|The {{machining}} instability {{onset of}} chatter {{occurs when a}} complex interaction between machining structural systems and the cutting process especially in machining difficult-to-cut materials (titanium and nickel based alloy). This is because, the dynamic deflection of tool and workpiece systems generates unstable cutting forces when machining with a high material removal rate. Here, sudden large vibration amplitudes occur when energy input exceeds the energy dissipated from the system, leading to self-excited vibration or chatter. Previous study proposed that the so called ‘process damping’ phenomenon is particularly important for variable helix milling tools. Consequently, the contribution of this thesis is a study of variable helix and pitch tool on the process damping performance. Testing was performed for tools with different helix and pitch angle and process parameters onto the performance of process damping under the flexible condition. In addition to that, the effect of modal analysis and cutting force stiffness was also studied. By using flexural condition at 390 Hz of frequency neutral, all tool were tested in machining titanium alloy in order to stimulate the process damping phenomena by examining the chatter behaviour from acceleration signal in time domain data collection. The result obtained shows that uniform tool with 42 o is the best helix angle compared to 37 o, 45 o and 52 o with process damping wavelength, λc= 0. 24 mm. While, the effect of tool geometries shows that variable helix (48 o, 53 o, 51 o, and 47 o) and variable pitch tools (60 o, 63 o, 107 o, and 88 o) has the highest process damping wavelength at 0. 66 mm compared to uniform, variable helix uniform pitch and uniform helix variable pitch tools. In this study, the performance of process damping was {{in accordance with the}} attainment of cutting force results. In order to improvise process damping of variable helix and pitch tool, a study the influence of process machining parameters in terms of material removal rate and surface roughness was also conducted. The results obtained show that the machining parameter with 2. 4 mm radial depth of cut was able to increase material removal rate at 8, 103 mm 3 /min meanwhile the increment of spindle speed has shown to reduce the surface roughness and increased process damping wavelength to 0. 68 mm. In this study, the effect of spindle <b>speed</b> <b>increment</b> percentage was also investigated. The results obtained shows that the occurrence of process damping was initiated at 2. 5 % as compared to 5 % and 7. 5 %. In conclusion, this study shows that the employment of variable helix and variable pitch tools in process damping has given the highest impact to suppress the chatter. Therefore, the variable helix and variable pitch endmill should represent as a promising tool to decrease the chatter effect in milling process especially for difficult-to-cut materials...|$|E
40|$|Regolith Rockets as a {{means to}} help the Exploration and the {{eventual}} Colonization of Mars. This comparison study presents the different methods of propulsion that can be employed to return 5, 000 tonnes of asteroid regolith into a cycling orbit between Earth and Mars. While the returned regolith mass can be arbitrary, calculations are performed for the minimum requirement to provide a Mars-Earth Cycler (M-EC) habitat for a crew of ten, support various research activities, and/or produce materials for living needs during journeys to and from Mars. The return of mined materials to the cycler orbit from Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) is relatively easy when compared to doing it from other planets or moons (including Phobos and Deimos) as sources, especially with respect to energy requirements. Currently, there are an estimated one thousand NEAs in orbit around the Sun and many have values of return <b>speed</b> <b>increments</b> (delta-v) lower than 100 m/s. Numerous propulsion schemes have been put forward to accomplish this task however the direct use of asteroid regolith as a fuel shows orders of magnitude improvements in energy, power consumption, spacecraft weight at launch from Earth, and ultimately mission cost...|$|R
