50|$|In two-pole {{single-phase}} motors, {{the torque}} goes to zero at 100% slip (zero speed), so these require alterations to the stator such as shaded-poles to provide starting torque. A single phase induction motor requires separate starting circuitry {{to provide a}} rotating field to the motor. The normal running windings within such a single-phase motor can cause the rotor to turn in either direction, so the <b>starting</b> <b>circuit</b> determines the operating direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of a traditional emergency lighting system is the supply of a minimum illuminating level when a line voltage failure appears. Therefore, they have to store energy in a battery module to supply the lamps in that case of failure.

50|$|A starter {{will contain}} {{protective}} devices for the motor. At a minimum this {{would include a}} thermal overload relay. The thermal overload is designed to open the <b>starting</b> <b>circuit</b> and thus cut the power to the motor {{in the event of}} the motor drawing too much current from the supply for an extended time. The overload relay has a normally closed contact which opens due to heat generated by excessive current flowing through the circuit. Thermal overloads have a small heating device that increases in temperature as the motor running current increases.|$|E

Is {{the availability of the}} power source acceptable (some renewables are only available when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing)? To the more technical: How should the generator start (some turbines act like a motor to bring themselves up to speed in which case they need an appropriate <b>starting</b> <b>circuit)?</b> What is the mechanical speed of operation for the turbine and consequently what are the number of poles required?

50|$|A {{split-phase}} motor has {{a secondary}} startup winding that is 90 electrical {{degrees to the}} main winding, always centered directly between the poles of the main winding, and connected to the main winding {{by a set of}} electrical contacts. The coils of this winding are wound with fewer turns of smaller wire than the main winding, so it has a lower inductance and higher resistance. The position of the winding creates a small phase shift between the flux of the main winding and the flux of the starting winding, causing the rotor to rotate. When the speed of the motor is sufficient to overcome the inertia of the load, the contacts are opened automatically by a centrifugal switch or electric relay. The direction of rotation is determined by the connection between the main winding and the <b>start</b> <b>circuit.</b> In applications where the motor requires a fixed rotation, one end of the <b>start</b> <b>circuit</b> is permanently connected to the main winding, with the contacts making the connection at the other end.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Two chaos {{generator}} circuits using dual-output second-generation current conveyors [DO-CCIIs] {{as active}} devices with grounded passive components are realized. The <b>starting</b> <b>circuit</b> is a voltage-mode four-phase sinusoidal quadrature oscillator [VMFPSQO] circuit for realizing both the chaos generators. The first chaos generator is derived by modifying the VMPFSQO by inserting an additional frequency dependent negative resistor [FDNR].

In the second chaos generator, non-linearity in the sinusoidal oscillator is introduced by using an additional block consists of an FDNR followed by a differentiator. The use of all grounded passive components makes both the generator circuits most suitable for monolithic implementation in contemporary IC technologies. The chaos generators are designed and verified using PSPICE simulation with good results. Index Terms—Sinusoidal oscillators, CCIIs, chaos generator. I...|$|E

40|$|A low power, dc arcjet {{thruster}} {{was tested}} for starting reliability using hydrogen-nitrogen mixtures simulating the decomposition products of hydrazine.
