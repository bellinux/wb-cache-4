40|$|AbstractBased on {{simplified}} Volterra model, a behavior-level {{simulation analysis}} approach of electromagnetic susceptibility (EMS) for radio frequency (RF) receiver {{is presented in}} this article. Third order simplified Volterra model is adopted to analyze receiver EMS. A general criterion for EMS is proposed according to EMS response characteristics in frequency domain, and then the simulation flow charts for calculating susceptibility thresholds are given. This approach is superior to the previous EMS analysis method on receiver, which mainly relies on experiments but lack simulation analysis. Take the dual frequency GPS receiver and zero IF receiver interfered by continue wave as examples for in-band and out-of-band <b>susceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> calculation.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} pressures to allow wireless devices on aircraft, the susceptibility of aircraft receivers to interference from Portable Electronic Devices (PEDs) becomes an increasing concern. Many investigations {{were conducted in}} the past, with limited success, to quantify device emissions, path loss, and receiver interference susceptibility thresholds. This paper outlines the recent effort in determining the receiver susceptibility thresholds for ILS, VOR and GPS systems. The effort primarily consists of analysis of data available openly as reported in many RTCA and ICAO documents as well as manufacturers data on receiver sensitivity. Shortcomings with the <b>susceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> data reported in the RTCA documents are presented, and an approach for an in-depth study is suggested. In addition, intermodulation products were observed and demonstrated in a laboratory experiment when multiple PEDs were in the proximity of each other. These intermodulation effects generate spurious frequencies that may fall within aircraft communication or navigation bands causing undesirable effects. Results from a preliminary analysis are presented that show possible harmful combinations of PEDs and the potentially affected aircraft bands...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Ankylosing {{spondylitis}} (AS) affects 0. 25 - 1. 0 % of the population, and its etiology is incompletely understood. Susceptibility to {{this highly}} familial disease (lambda(s) = 58) is primarily genetically determined. There {{is a significant}} sex bias in AS, and {{there are differences in}} recurrence risk to the offspring of affected mothers and fathers, suggesting that there may be an X-linked recessive effect. We undertook an X-chromosome linkage study to determine any contribution of the X-chromosome to AS susceptibility. METHODS: A linkage study of the X-chromosome using 234 affected sibling pairs was performed to investigate this hypothesis. RESULTS: No linkage of the X-chromosome with susceptibility to AS was found. Model-free multipoint linkage analysis strongly excluded any significant genetic contribution (lambda > or = 1. 5) to AS susceptibility encoded on the X-chromosome (logarithm of odds [LOD] or = 1. 3) were also found to be unlikely (LOD <- 1. 0). CONCLUSION: The sex bias in AS is not explained by X-chromosome-encoded genetic effects. The disease model best explaining the sex bias in occurrence and transmission of AS is a polygenic model with a higher <b>susceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> in females...|$|E

It is {{manifested}} in three forms: localized CL (LCL), mucosal CL (MCL) and diffuse CL (DCL). Unresponsiveness to sodium stibogluconate (Sb(V)) is common in Ethiopian CL patients. Using the amastigote-macrophage in vitro model the susceptibility of 24 clinical isolates of L. aethiopica derived from untreated patients was investigated. Eight strains of LCL, 9 of MCL, and 7 of DCL patients together with a reference strain (MHOM/ET/ 82 / 117 / 82) were tested against four antileishmanial drugs: amphotericin B, miltefosine, Sb(V) and paromomycin. In the same order of drugs, IC(50) (μg/ml±SD) values for the 24 strains tested were 0. 16 ± 0. 18, 5. 88 ± 4. 79, 10. 23 ± 8. 12, and 13. 63 ± 18. 74. The <b>susceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> of isolates originating from the 3 categories of patients to all 4 drugs was not different (p> 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractSleep {{disturbance}} {{is common}} in several epilepsy types, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Genetic background could increase susceptibility to seizure and sleep abnormalities. From this perspective, a susceptibility gene for sleep disturbance or chronotype could contribute to the genetic <b>susceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> for epilepsy and vice versa. Accordingly, we investigated whether functional clock gene polymorphisms (PER 2 111 C>G, CLOCK 3111 T>C, and PER 3 VNTR) might influence the risk for JME. All these polymorphisms have recently {{been reported to be}} associated with sleep disturbance, diurnal variation, and neurological diseases. The polymorphisms were genotyped in 97 patients and 212 controls using polymerase chain reaction or restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. No significant differences were observed in the genotypic and allelic frequencies of these polymorphisms between cases and controls even when analyses were restricted to patients that presented a diurnal preferential seizure occurrence. We also tested for interactions between polymorphisms by multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis. None of the combined genotypes differed significantly between the groups. These results present no evidence for an association of these polymorphisms with JME. Further studies including other types of epilepsy and/or other functional polymorphisms are required to investigate the possible relationship between clock genes and the genetic susceptibility to chronic seizure...|$|E

40|$|Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP) {{occurs in}} {{nearly one-third of}} mechanically ventilated patients in the Intensive Care Unit. Piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) is currently recommended in the empirical treatment of VAP, but intermittent dosing may result in inadequate serum concentrations. The efficacy and costs of continuous infusion (CI) of TZP, using therapeutic drug monitoring for real-time dose adjustment, was assessed in a prospective pilot study of 16 patients with VAP. TZP was given as a loading dose of 2. 0 / 0. 25 g followed by a CI of 10. 0 / 1. 25 g daily. Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing {{was used to determine}} the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogens. TZP concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography before and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after the onset of administration. Dosages were adjusted to maintain piperacillin concentrations four-fold above the MIC (T> 4 × MIC) of the pathogen, with a maximum dose of 16. 0 / 2. 0 g. The cost of the total TZP administered was compared with the cost of a standard TZP regimen (16. 0 / 2. 0 g) if given over the same period of time. The median MIC for TZP was 1 μg/mL (range 0. 025 - 32 μg/mL). TZP concentrations were adequate for 71 % of pathogens {{on the first day of}} therapy. Clinical cure was achieved in 9 / 10 patients who had adequate drug concentrations and in 3 / 6 patients with insufficient levels. The daily dose of TZP received by CI was 37. 5 % less than that of a standard regimen, which corresponds to a saving of € 15 on daily therapy costs compared with the standard regimen. In conclusion, CI of TZP achieved optimal drug concentrations in most patients with VAP, with a favourable impact on costs. Adequate drug concentrations were achieved for MIC ≤ 4 μg/mL, but higher dosages should be considered for the treatment of pathogens with low <b>susceptibility</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Journal ArticleSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Distinct {{channels}} of interaction {{in a complex}} networked system define network layers, which co-exist and co-operate for the system's function. Towards realistic modeling and understanding such multiplex systems, we introduce and study a class of growing multiplex network models in which different network layers coevolve, and examine how the entangled growth of coevolving layers can shape the overall network structure. We show analytically and numerically that the coevolution can induce strong degree correlations across layers, as well as modulate degree distributions. We further show that such a coevolution-induced correlated multiplexity can alter the system's response to dynamical process, exemplified by the suppressed <b>susceptibility</b> to a <b>threshold</b> cascade process.

40|$|This paper summarises {{the first}} {{results of a}} geomorphological study we {{carried out in the}} area struck by the 30 th April 2006 landslides, in Ischia island. This study aimed at the {{documentation}} of the landslide traces, and at providing new evidences on the role played by the pre-existing landforms in the location of the source areas, in landslide propagation and motion, and in the distribution of localized and distal accumulation. This was done through field surveys (started soon after the events), and by analyses of aerial photographs, topographic maps and of DTM. Besides the reconstruction of the main stages of landscape evolution of the Ischia sector including the area struck by the landslides, a detailed landscape analysis of the latter area was carried out. This allowed classification of the study area in terms of dip values and land systems, and identification of minor geomorphic elements which compose each unit. Afterwards, the relationships among the features of the single units/elements and landslide initiation, propagation and accumulation were investigated. Although the Ischia case provided a small population of phenomena, it they may be considered as a representative study case for the pyroclastic earth slides which have been affecting the Campania region in the last decennia. The integration of the collected evidences with those deriving from the pre-existing record of cases highlights, above others, the important control exerted by steep elements breaking the hillslopes not only on initiation, but also on propagation of the landslides. The recognised role of subvertical elements suggests the crucial importance of their detection in landsliding susceptibility assessment. As a consequence, in cases where the presence of such elements is not proved but only inferred, the <b>susceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> slope angle should be prudentially lowered...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Although the World Health Organization {{recommends}} replacing quinine (QN) by artesunate {{due to its}} increased {{efficacy and}} the higher tolerance to the drug in both adults and children, QN remains a first-line treatment for severe malaria, especially in Africa. Investigations of microsatellite Pfnhe- 1 [*]ms 4760 polymorphisms in culture-adapted isolates {{from around the world}} have revealed that {{an increase in the number}} of DNNND amino acid motifs was associated with decreased QN susceptibility, whereas an increase in the number of DDNHNDNHNND motifs was associated with increased QN susceptibility. METHODS: In this context, to further analyse associations between Pfnhe- 1 [*]ms 4760 polymorphisms and QN susceptibility, 393 isolates freshly collected between October 2009 and January 2010 and July 2010 and February 2011, respectively, at the Hôpital Principal de Dakar, Senegal were assessed ex vivo for QN susceptibility, and their genes were amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: Of the 393 Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates collected, 145 were successfully cultured. The 145 QN IC 50 s ranged from 2. 1 to 1291 nM, and 17 isolates (11. 7 %) exceed the QN reduced <b>susceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> of 611 nM. Among the 393 P. falciparum clinical isolates, 47 different alleles were observed. The three most prevalent profiles were ms 4760 - 1 (no[*]=[*] 72; 18. 3 %), ms 4760 - 3 (no[*]=[*] 65; 16. 5 %) and ms 4760 - 7 (no[*]=[*] 40; 10. 2 %). There were no significant associations observed between QN IC 50 values and i) the number of repeats of DNNND in block II (p[*]=[*] 0. 0955, Kruskal-Wallis test); ii) the number of repeats of DDNHNDNHNND in block V (p[*]=[*] 0. 1455, Kruskal-Wallis test); or iii) ms 4760 profiles (p[*]=[*] 0. 1809, Kruskal-Wallis test). CONCLUSIONS: Pfnhe- 1 [*]ms 4760 was highly diverse in parasite isolates from Dakar (47 different profiles). Three profiles (ms 4760 - 1, ms 4760 - 3 and ms 4760 - 7) were predominant. The number of repeats for block II (DNNND) or block V (DDNHNDNHNND) was not significantly associated with QN susceptibility. New studies, and especially in vivo studies, are necessary to confirm the role of Pfnhe- 1 [*]ms 4760 as a marker of QN resistance...|$|E
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease affecting peripheral joints. Persistent inflammation causes cartilage deterioration with severe joint deformations as a consequence. The etiology is largely unknown but complex interactions between genetic {{and environmental factors}} contribute to the disease. The disease is also clinically heterogeneous which further hampers etiological investigations. Analogs of certain disease pathways can be studied in experimental models mimicking RA. A more thorough characterization of such disease pathways may tell us of discrete disease subsets of RA. Numerous experimental models for RA exists, both spontaneous and induced. The DA rat is remarkably arthritis prone, an intradermal injection of a mineral oil is sufficient to induce arthritis. The difference in arthritogenicity between the arthritis inducers depends on the genetic <b>susceptibility</b> <b>threshold</b> of each rat strain. The general aim of this thesis was to by a genome - inducer approach identify a suitable experimental system to use for mapping arthritis susceptibility genes in the rat, and through this approach identify genes of equal importance in humans, ultimately to provide new insights for pathway characterization of RA. I characterized the arthritis susceptibility {{in a set of}} recombinant congenic strains overlapping several arthritis regulating regions on rat chromosome 4, in five arthritis models; collagen type H-induced arthritis, pristane-induced arthritis, mycobacteria-induced arthritis, squalene-induced arthritis and oil-induced arthritis. All five induced arthritis-models were regulated by chromosome 4 genes. A 10 cM fragment that harbor the Oia 2 locus mediated arthritis down-regulation in collagen type H induced arthritis and squalene-induced arthritis. Oil-induced arthritis was completely prevented. Further fine mapping was continued in oilinduced arthritis. By using 18 Oia 2 intra-recombinant congenic strains the arthritis regulating interval was fine-mapped to 1. 2 Mb. The arthritis regulating interval was further mapped to 600 kb that only harbor a Ctype lectin gene complex denoted Aplec. Comparison of gene sequences identified a nonsense mutation in Dcar 1 in the DA strain as the most possible arthritis-regulating rat gene. The human homolog to rat Dcir, one of the other genes in the complex, was tested in a patient 1 control material. One SNP showed significant association to RA. Association was pronounced in RF-negative patients The genome - inducer approach was also applied in mapping of the arthritis regulating region, Oia 3, on rat chromosome 10 in the F 7 generation of an advanced intercross (AIL) between the arthritis susceptible rat strain DA, and the arthritis resistant PM I AV I. To chose the most appropriate arthritis model for linkage mapping in the AIL pristane-induced arthritis, squaleneinduced arthritis and oil-induced arthritis was induced. Pristane-induced arthritis was the most appropriate for the population. Aplec and the newly identified arthritis regulating gene Ncf 1 was also mapped to determine the mapping resolution. Linkage mapping of Oia 3 identified two distinct quantitative trait loci (QTL), one at D 10 Rat 13 at 97. 2 Mb, and an other at D 10 Got 158 at 105. 2 Mb. The placement for the Ncf 1 gene, and the Aplec were both less than 100 kb, 200 kb surrounding the Oia 3 peak marker was considered as the confidence interval. The proximal Oia 3 QTL contains the Protein kinase C alpha gene together with a set of calcium channel voltage-dependent gamma subunit genes. The distal Oia 3 QTL contain a cluster of dendritic cell derived Ig-like receptors, among them the homolog to the human CMRF 35 gene previously associated to psoriasis. In conclusion the search for appropriate experimental systems to map arthritis susceptibility regions, subsequent congenic mapping in oil induced arthritis, lead to the identification of Aplec, a C-type lectin complex, that codes for genes important in a number of immunological processes. The human homolog to rat showed association to RA in a patient/control material...|$|E

40|$|Models for sexually {{transmitted}} diseases generally assume {{that the size of}} the core group is fixed. Publicly available information on disease prevalence may influence the recruitment of new susceptibles into highly sexually active populations. It is assumed that the recruitment rate into the core population is low while disease prevalence is high, core group members mix only with each other, disease levels outside the core are negligible, and some core group members reduce their risk {{through the use of a}} partially effective vaccine or prophylactics. A demographic-epi demic model is formulated in which the combined size of the core and non-core population is constant. A simpler version models the epidemic in an isolated core population of constant size under the influence of educational programs and measures that reduce <b>susceptibility.</b> The <b>threshold</b> condition for an endemic infec tion is determined. Backward bifurcations, multiple infective stationary states, and hysteresis phenomena can be observed even in the simplified version. Abrupt changes in disease prevalence levels may result from small changes in the disease management parameters and do not occur in the absence of such a program. The general conclusion is that partially effective vaccination or education programs may increase the total number of cases while decreasing the relative frequency of cases in the core group. The study throws some new light on the role of the reproduction number in connection with elimination attempts. It shows that although the repro duction number defines the threshold for the spread of the disease in a susceptible population, it is of limited value when elimination of an existing epidemic is planned...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Heavy {{metals content}} {{as well as}} {{magnetic}} and electrical properties of leachate from Sarimukti, West Java were studied {{in an attempt to}} seek correlation between heavy metals content and magnetic/electrical properties. Such correlation is expected to open the way for the use of magnetic/electrical properties as proxy indicators for the concentration of heavy metals in the leachate. The number of leachate samples studied is 21; 15 were taken spatially at depth of 1 m while the remaining 6 samples were taken vertically at a particular point. Measurement results showed that the heavy metals content in the leachate has a smaller concentration, except for Fe. The correlation between magnetic susceptibility and heavy metals content was found to be not so significant. The best correlation coefficient between magnetic susceptibility with heavy metals in leachate was found in Zn. Correlation between electrical conductivity and heavy metal is also not so significant, except for Zn and Cd. The use of magnetic properties as proxy indicator for heavy metals content in leachate is plausible provided that the magnetic <b>susceptibility</b> exceeds certain <b>threshold</b> value.
