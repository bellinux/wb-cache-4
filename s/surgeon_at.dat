5|$|Returning to Australia, Downes was {{discharged}} from the AIF, but remained in the Army as a reservist. He became an honorary consulting <b>surgeon</b> <b>at</b> the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne and Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, and honorary <b>surgeon</b> <b>at</b> Prince Henry's Hospital. He was a founding fellow of the College of Surgeons of Australasia in 1927, and {{became president of the}} Victorian branch of the British Medical Association in 1935. He established {{a reputation as one of}} Melbourne's leading paediatric surgeons, but found himself in disagreement with certain medical practices then in vogue. In a 1922 paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia, he examined 100 cases of tonsillectomy in children, and concluded that the majority of them were unnecessary. It would be another four decades before the medical profession in Australia accepted this. He lectured on medical ethics at the University of Melbourne from the late 1930s until his death in 1945, and wrote a course textbook on the subject, entitled Medical Ethics, which was published in 1942.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, the Negus {{family moved}} to Haslemere, Surrey. During the Second World War, Negus again served in a medical capacity, {{this time with the}} Emergency Medical Service (EMS) at Horton Hospital, Epsom, from 1939 to 1946. In 1940, on the {{retirement}} of his colleague Charles Hope, he had been appointed senior <b>surgeon</b> <b>at</b> King's College Hospital, and in 1946 he reached the peak of his profession as a consulting surgeon. During this post-war period one of Negus's patients was the former (and future) prime minister Winston Churchill, who in 1950 was diagnosed by Negus with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Negus retired from clinical and teaching work in 1952 at the age of 65.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Negus {{worked on}} aspects of both throat surgery and {{the anatomy of}} the larynx, the latter work {{contributing}} to his degree of Master of Surgery (1924). His surgical innovations included designs for laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes, oesophagoscopes, an operating table, and tracheotomy equipment. His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929) and {{his work on the}} clinical text Diseases of the Nose and Throat, starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology.

5|$|Some of Bellerophons timber {{was bought}} at auction by George Bellamy, {{who had been}} Bellerophons <b>surgeon</b> <b>at</b> the Nile. Bellamy {{incorporated}} them into a cottage he was building at Plymstock. Captain Maitland bought part of her figurehead {{and some of her}} stern ornaments, later depositing them in the collections of what eventually became the Royal Naval Museum. The National Maritime Museum holds several relics relating to Bellerophon and the people connected with her, including Captain John Cooke's dirk, sword and pistol, and a trophy presented to Admiral Pasley by Lloyd's of London. Their collections also contain artefacts relating to her connection with Napoleon, including the couch from Maitland's cabin, and the skull of a goat which supplied milk for Napoleon and his suite.|$|E
5|$|After the {{breakout}} of the First World War, Morton travelled to Labrador {{to work in}} the Mission Hospitals there, {{before being}} made a special commissioner of the Red Cross to take supplies from Paris to the Macedonian Front and work at the field hospitals in Macedonia. Following the success of her male family members, Morton was the first women to become the Attending <b>Surgeon</b> <b>at</b> the Vanderbilt Clinic of Columbia University's Physicians and Surgeons in 1916. After returning to New York Morton, alongside Mary M. Crawford, led the American Women's Hospitals Service from 1917 after it was founded by the Medical Women's National Association with the aim of establishing American hospitals in Europe. After her request to send one thousand medical women who had volunteered for foreign service was opposed by the General Medical Board in Washington, she raised over $300,000 in 10 days through a national fundraising drive to send them. At the recommendation of William C. Gorgas, Morton was made chairman of the committee of women physicians on the United States Council of National Defense, where she represented over 7000 female doctors.|$|E

5|$|Deane was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1911, {{after a period}} as house <b>surgeon</b> <b>at</b> the Adelaide Hospital, Dublin. In 1913, he was posted to India and served in Burma. He was stationed in Meerut {{at the start of}} the First World War. From there, he travelled to France with the Garhwal Brigade of the Indian Expeditionary Force, landing in Marseille in September 1914. He was deployed immediately to the Western Front, where he served first with the 20th Field Ambulance and then as medical officer of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Leicestershire Regiment. His unit saw much active service. On 22 August 1915, he was awarded the Military Cross after running out under machine gun fire to rescue four men who had been wounded by artillery fire. A month later, his regiment participated in the Battle of Loos, and was almost entirely obliterated. He was shot dead after going to help some injured soldiers: his action earned him a mention in despatches. Deane was one of 60 RCSI doctors to receive the Military Cross in the First World War, and one of 17 to be killed in action.|$|E
5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior <b>surgeon</b> <b>at</b> the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E
5|$|In 1799 Joseph Fox {{started to}} give a series of lectures on dental surgery at Guy’s Hospital, and was {{appointed}} dental surgeon in the same year. Thomas Bell succeeded Fox as dental surgeon either in 1817 or 1825. Frederick Newland Pedley, who was appointed assistant dental <b>surgeon</b> <b>at</b> Guy’s Hospital in 1885, advocated {{the establishment of a}} dental school within the hospital, and he flooded the two dental schools in London, the Metropolitan School of Dental Science and the London School of Dental Surgery, with patients to prove that a further hospital was needed. In December 1888, Guy’s Hospital Dental School was established. Guy’s Hospital Dental School was recognised as a school of the University of London in 1901. In the 1970s, since there was a decline in the demand for dental services, the Department of Health of the UK suggested {{that there should be a}} decrease in the number of dental undergraduate students as well as the duration of all courses. In response to the recommendations, Royal Dental Hospital of London School of Dental Surgery amalgamated with the Guy’s Hospital Dental School of the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals on 1 August 1983.|$|E
