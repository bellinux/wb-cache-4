The recent collapse of Wordie Ice <b>Shelf,</b> Prince Gustav Ice <b>Shelf,</b> Mueller Ice <b>Shelf,</b> Jones Ice <b>Shelf,</b> Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice <b>Shelf</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice <b>shelf</b> systems are.|$|R

5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice <b>shelves</b> (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice <b>shelves</b> around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice <b>shelves</b> may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E

40|$|Modern <b>shelf</b> {{morphology}} is {{the result}} of the interplay between short and long term sedimentary processes. The relation between rates of sediment supply/carbonate growth and accommodation space creation will not only control coastal transgression and regression, but will also define the <b>shelf</b> sedimentary regimes acting to shape the seabed. Herein, <b>shelf</b> morphology and sedimentology are investigated in order to discuss how these characteristics can be representative of distinct sedimentary regimes. The study area is the eastern Brazilian <b>shelf</b> where coastal transgression and regression coexist with the most important coral reef system of the South Atlantic. A compilation of existing published and unpublished data was carried out in order to produce morphological and faciological maps and compare the mapped features with high-resolution seismic and sonographic data. The results show three major regions or morphological compartments: Abrolhos <b>Shelf,</b> Doce River <b>Shelf</b> and the Paleovalleys <b>Shelf.</b> In terms of <b>shelf</b> sedimentary domain, rhodolith beds predominate over the outer <b>shelf</b> along the entire area, coralline reefs are present along the northern Abrolhos inner <b>shelf</b> and a significant terrigenous mud deposit is observed associated to the Doce River adjacent inner <b>shelf</b> beds. The rest of the <b>shelf</b> is composed by bioclastic or terrigenous mud sand and gravel. Terrigenous sedimentation is always restricted to the shoreface or inner <b>shelf</b> shallower areas and carbonate sands and gravels are predominant elsewhere. The Abrolhos <b>shelf</b> shows two distinct sectors; the northern area is a typical mixed sediment environment that has a supply regime along the coast/shoreface, mainly due to longshore transport and a carbonate regime along the inner and outer <b>shelf.</b> The southern <b>shelf</b> morphology and sedimentation are controlled by the antecedent topography and is typically a accommodation regime <b>shelf</b> with associated rhodolith beds. The Doce river <b>shelf</b> is a supply regime environment with the formation of a 5 to 8 m thick regressive deposit with downlapping clinoforms. Southward from the Doce river <b>shelf,</b> a significant shift in sedimentary regime is observed as the morphology becomes very irregular with associated hardbottoms and unfilled paleovalleys. This sector of the <b>shelf</b> (Paleovalley <b>shelf)</b> is characterized by an accommodation regime. The interpretation shows that the entire study area can be defined as a mixed sedimentation <b>shelf,</b> showing supply and accommodation regimes. <b>Shelf</b> morphology worked as an indicator of these changes. Carbonate/terrigenous deposition during a highstand/regressive phase coeval along the eastern Brazilian <b>shelf,</b> either laterally and across <b>shelf.</b> This lateral/along coast variation in sediment supply and carbonate production leads to distinct lateral facies and geometry. These spatial changes in morphology and facies, with coexistence of carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentation, are very important for the correlation and interpretation of the geological record, especially stratigraphic surfaces and sequence units...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} oceanographic {{observations}} {{made at the}} northern end of Larsen C Ice <b>Shelf</b> in the western Weddell Sea.

MWDW is observed at the ice front, having tracked west along the northward facing slopes of depressions that reach to the <b>shelf</b> break. Ice <b>Shelf</b> Water observed near the ice front is not, however, derived from MWDW directly, but from MWDW pre-conditioned by winter cooling and by salinification from sea ice production.

5000|$|The <b>shelf</b> usually ends at a {{point of}} {{increasing}} slope (called the <b>shelf</b> break). The sea floor below the break is the continental slope. Below the slope is the continental rise, which finally merges into the deep ocean floor, the abyssal plain. The continental <b>shelf</b> and the slope {{are part of the}} continental margin. The <b>shelf</b> area is commonly subdivided into the inner continental <b>shelf,</b> mid continental <b>shelf,</b> and outer continental <b>shelf,</b> each with their specific geomorphology and marine biology. The character of the <b>shelf</b> changes dramatically at the <b>shelf</b> break, where the continental slope begins. With a few exceptions, the <b>shelf</b> break is located at a remarkably uniform depth of roughly 140 m; this is likely a hallmark of past ice ages, when sea level was lower than it is now. The continental slope is much steeper than the shelf; the average angle is 3°, but it can be as low as 1° or as high as 10°. The slope is often cut with submarine canyons.
