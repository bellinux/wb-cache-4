5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
25|$|Social work is an {{academic}} discipline and profession that concerns itself with individuals, families, groups and communities {{in an effort}} to enhance <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> and overall well-being. <b>Social</b> <b>functioning</b> refers {{to the way in which}} people perform their social roles, and the structural institutions that are provided to sustain them. Social work applies social sciences, such as sociology, psychology, political science, public health, community development, law, and economics, to engage with client systems, conduct assessments, and develop interventions to solve social and personal problems; and create social change. Social work practice is often divided into micro-work, which involves working directly with individuals or small groups; and macro-work, which involves working communities, and within social policy, to create change on a larger scale.|$|E

40|$|The {{educational}} sphere has {{an internal}} function relatively agreed by social scientists. Nonetheless, the contribution that educational systems provide {{to the society}} (i. e., their <b>social</b> <b>function)</b> {{does not have the}} same degree of consensus. Taking into consideration such theoretical precedent, the current article raises an analytical schema to grasp the <b>social</b> <b>function</b> of education considering a sociological perspective. Starting from the assumption that there is an intrinsic relationship between the internal and <b>social</b> <b>functions</b> of <b>social</b> systems, we suggest there are particular stratification determinants modifying the internal pedagogical function of education, which impact on its <b>social</b> <b>function</b> by creating simultaneous conditions of equity and differentiation. Throughout the paper this <b>social</b> <b>function</b> is considered a paradoxical mechanism. We highlight how this paradoxical dynamic is deployed in different structural levels of the educational sphere. Additionally, we discuss eventual consequences of this paradoxical <b>social</b> <b>function</b> for the inclusion possibilities that educational systems offer to individuals...|$|R

40|$|Background: Early-onset major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) (EOD) {{is often}} particularly malignant due to its special clinical features, accompanying impaired <b>social</b> <b>function,</b> protracted recovery time, and frequent recurrence. This study aimed to observe the effects of age onset on clinical characteristics and <b>social</b> <b>function</b> in MDD patients in Asia. Methods: In total, 547 out-patients aged 18 - 65 years who were from 13 study sites in five Asian countries were included. These patients had MDD diagnose according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th Edition criteria. Clinical features and <b>social</b> <b>function</b> were assessed using Symptom Checklist- 90 -revised (SCL- 90 -R) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Quality of life was assessed by a 36 -item Short-form Health Survey (SF- 36). Analyses were performed using a continuous or dichotomous (cut-off: 30 years) age-of-onset indicator. Results: Early-onset MDD (EOD, < 30 years) was associated with longer illness (P = 0. 003), unmarried status (P < 0. 001), higher neuroticism (P ≤ 0. 002) based on the SCL- 90 -R, and more limited <b>social</b> <b>function</b> and mental health (P = 0. 006, P = 0. 007) based on the SF- 36 and SDS. The impairment of <b>social</b> <b>function</b> and clinical severity were more prominent at in-patients with younger onset ages. Special clinical features and more impaired <b>social</b> <b>function</b> {{and quality of life}} were associated with EOD, as in western studies. Conclusions: EOD often follows higher levels of neuroticism. Age of onset of MDD may be a predictor of clinical features and impaired <b>social</b> <b>function,</b> allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment...|$|R

25|$|While not as profoundly {{disabling}} as {{the physical}} symptoms of these diseases, PBA can significantly influence individuals' <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> and {{their relationships with}} others. Such sudden, frequent, extreme, uncontrollable emotional outbursts may lead to social withdrawal and interfere with activities of daily living, social and professional pursuits, and reduce overall healthcare. For example, patients with ALS and MS are often cognitively normal. However, the appearance of uncontrollable emotions is commonly associated with many additional neurological disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, and migraines. This may lead to severe embarrassment and avoidance of social interactions for the patient, which in turn impairs their coping mechanisms and their careers.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} the elderly who were {{benzodiazepine}} dependent found withdrawal could be carried out with few complications and could lead to improvements in sleep and cognitive abilities. At 52 weeks after successful withdrawal, a 22% improvement in cognitive status was found, as well as improved <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Those who remained on benzodiazepines experienced a 5% decline in cognitive abilities, {{which seemed to be}} faster than that seen in normal aging, suggesting the longer the intake of benzodiazepines, the worse the cognitive effects become. Some worsening of symptoms were seen in {{the first few months of}} benzodiazepine abstinence, but at a 24-week followup, elderly subjects were clearly improved compared to those who remained on benzodiazepines. Improvements in sleep were seen at the 24- and 52-week followups. The authors concluded benzodiazepines were not effective in the long term for sleep problems except in suppressing withdrawal-related rebound insomnia. Improvements were seen between 24 and 52 weeks after withdrawal in many factors, including improved sleep and several cognitive and performance abilities. Some cognitive abilities, which are sensitive to benzodiazepines, as well as age, such as episodic memory did not improve. The authors, however, cited a study in younger patients who at a 3.5-year followup showed no memory impairments and speculated that certain memory functions take longer to recover from chronic benzodiazepine use and further improvements in elderly people's cognitive function may occur beyond 52 weeks after withdrawal. The reason it took 24 weeks for improvements to be seen after cessation of benzodiazepine use was due to the time it takes the brain to adapt to the benzodiazepine-free environment.|$|E
500|$|An {{example of}} the low {{threshold}} {{is a point of}} Donetsk psychiatrist Valentine Pekhterev, who argues that psychiatrists speak of the necessity of adapting oneself to society, estimate the level of man's <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> his ability to adequately test the reality and so forth. In Pekhterev's words, these speeches hit point-blank on the dissidents and revolutionaries, because all of them are poorly functioning in society, are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements. They turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into the view that the company breaks step and only they know how to help the company restructure itself. The dissidents regard the cases of personal maladjustment as a proof of public ill-being. The more such cases, the easier it is to present their personal ill-being [...] as public one. They bite the society's hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society. Unlike the dissidents, the psychiatrists destroy the hardly formed defense attitude in the dissidents by regarding [...] "public well-being" [...] as personal one. The psychiatrists extract teeth from the dissidents, stating that they should not bite the feeding hand of society only because the tiny group of the dissidents feel bad being at their place. The psychiatrists claim the need to treat not society but the dissidents and seek to improve society by preserving and improving the mental health of its members. After reading the book Institute of Fools by Viktor Nekipelov, Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers.|$|E
