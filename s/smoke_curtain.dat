5000|$|Madam Pheip is his wife. She is a pipe-smoking bully, {{loyal to}} her kids, herself, her husband, {{and her friends}} (in that order). When necessary, she can make a <b>smoke</b> <b>curtain</b> with her pipe.|$|E
5000|$|The M10 smoke tank, {{also known}} as <b>Smoke</b> <b>Curtain</b> Installation, was an {{aircraft}} under wing tank used by the United States Army Air Forces to lay smoke screens or dispense chemical weapons such as tear gas. The tanks held a maximum of 30 gallons, and weighed, when full 588 pounds and could lay a smoke screen about 2,000 feet long.|$|E
30|$|Thus, this {{research}} models the <b>smoke</b> <b>curtains</b> and ceiling signboards as parametric {{elements in the}} Revit model. Among predefined system family types in Revit, the Wall element is most appropriate for modeling parametric <b>smoke</b> <b>curtains</b> and ceiling signboards. By means of modifying several Wall properties, such as base constraint, base offset, top constraint, top offset, and thickness, the appearance of Wall elements can resemble <b>smoke</b> <b>curtains</b> and ceiling signboards. The elements with different locations, heights and sizes can be easily and parametrically modeled in the BIM model.|$|R

50|$|After leaving Funchal {{at sunset}} on 13 October, São Miguel {{came under fire}} at 06:15 AM on 14 October from the German {{submarine}} U-139, {{one of the more}} and better equipped submarines of the German Navy, armed with two powerful 150 mm cannons and six torpedo launch tubes, and under the command of the famous Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière. In order to protect the São Miguel, and after using all the smoke boxes available for creating a <b>smoke</b> <b>curtain</b> while repeatedly firing the stern cannon, de Araújo gave orders for the NRP Augusto de Castilho to turn to port, describing half a circle, and advance towards the German U-139, taking gunfire from the submarine, thus giving São Miguel time to escape at full speed.|$|E
50|$|Tucker {{pulled the}} plane into a sudden 15 degree climb, {{throwing}} Sanders, Peterson and Calloway {{out of the}} cockpit and into the galley. To try to throw Calloway off balance, Tucker then turned the plane into a left roll, almost on its side. This rolled the combatants along the <b>smoke</b> <b>curtain</b> onto {{the left side of}} the galley. Eventually, Tucker had rolled the plane nearly upside down at 140 degrees, while attempting to maintain a visual reference of the environment around him through the windows. Peterson, Sanders and Calloway were then pinned to the ceiling of the plane. Calloway managed to reach his hammer hand free and hit Sanders in the head again. Just then, Tucker put the plane into a steep dive. This pushed the combatants back to the seat curtain, but the wings and elevators started to flutter. At this point Tucker could hear the wind rushing against the cockpit windows. At 530 mph (853 km/h), the elevators on the plane became unresponsive due to the disrupted airflow. Tucker realized this was because the throttles were at full power. Releasing his only usable hand to pull back the throttles to idle, he managed to pull the plane out of the dive while it slowed down.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe 1 / 15 reduced-scale {{experiments}} were conducted using the Froude number conservation to investigate smoke diffusion characteristics in tunnel fires with natural ventilation. The effects of some factors such as: heat release rate, shaft distance, shaft size, train blockage and <b>smoke</b> <b>curtain</b> were studied. A porous bed propane burner, {{placed on the}} tunnel floor, was used to simulate the fire source. A series of K- type thermocouples were used to measure tunnel ceiling smoke temperatures. A hotwire anemometer {{was used to measure}} smoke volume rate and smoke temperature in the ventilation shaft. The experimental results indicated that all factors, except for the <b>smoke</b> <b>curtain,</b> have no major effect on the dimensionless ceiling temperatures in the fire section of the tunnel. Moreover, the fire size and train blockage do not {{have a significant effect on}} the dimensionless ceiling temperatures in the non-fire section of the tunnel. Nevertheless, the dimensionless ceiling temperatures in the non-fire section of the tunnel decreased with the decrease of the shaft distance and the increase of the shaft size. When the <b>smoke</b> <b>curtain</b> is used in the tunnel, the dimensionless ceiling temperatures in the fire channel are higher than in the case when the <b>smoke</b> <b>curtain</b> is not used. Moreover, there is no smoke in the evacuation channel. The fire size and train blockage do not have a considerable effect on the dimensionless temperatures and smoke volume rates in the shaft. Nonetheless, the dimensionless smoke temperatures in the shaft decrease with the increase in the shaft distance or the shaft size. Moreover, dimensionless smoke flow rates through the shaft increase with the decrease in the shaft distance or the increase in the shaft size...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} examine any design {{conflicts}} between CCTV systems and other systems, several architectural components in an MRT station that may block {{the views of the}} CCTV cameras need to be modeled as parametric elements in the BIM model. These include <b>smoke</b> <b>curtains</b> and ceiling signboards.|$|R

The applications are only limited by your imagination and ability to position the projector. Some examples include: a window space to see outside, a mirror to show symbolic representations of character, floor space to create a pool of water, <b>smoke,</b> <b>curtains</b> etc.|$|R
5000|$|Madam Pheip's most {{colourful}} {{character trait}} {{is the fact}} that she is a woman who smokes pipe. She is such a professional smoker that she can produce <b>smoke</b> <b>curtains.</b> In [...] "Het Vredesoffensief van Nero" [...] ("Nero's Peace Initiative") (1951-1952) it is revealed that she is a member of the V.V.V.P. ("Flemish Organisation of Pipe Addicts"). Her addiction has one major downside. Every ten minutes she has to catch her breath. Madam Pheip has tried to quit smoking twice, but always fell back into her old bad habits.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evacuation}} dynamics {{of a crowd}} wanting to escape from a complex geometry {{in the presence of}} a fire as well as of a slowly spreading <b>smoke</b> <b>curtain.</b> The crowd we have in view is composed of two populations of individuals: one knowing the map of the building and one unaware of the given geometry, relying exclusively on potentially informed neighbors to identify a path of motion towards the exit. We aim at capturing the effect the knowledge of the environment has on the interaction between evacuees and their residence time in the presence of fire and evolving smoke. Our approach is genuinely multiscale - we employ a hybrid (continuum-discrete-stochastic) model that can distinguish between compressible and incompressible pedestrian flow regimes and allows for two-scale (micro and macro) pedestrian interactions. Simulations illustrate the expected qualitative behavior of the model. Comment: 17 pages, 15 figure...|$|E

30|$|One of {{the aims}} of this {{research}} is to take advantage of BIM technology for inspecting in the design phase whether a desired location for CCTV camera installation is suitable in the future construction phase. Once CCTV screen views can be simulated via Revit cameras, it is simple to check if anything blocks the view of the CCTV camera in the BIM model. Examples of these are <b>smoke</b> <b>curtains</b> and ceiling signboards, which can be modeled as parametric elements in the BIM model of the MRT station. Such design conflicts must be discovered in advance and eliminated to reduce the installation and adjustment time required for the setup of CCTV cameras.|$|R
50|$|The {{proliferation}} of thermal imaging FLIR systems on the battlefields necessitates {{the use of}} obscurant smokes that are effectively opaque in the infrared part of electromagnetic spectrum. To achieve this, the particle size and composition of the smokes has to be adjusted. One of the approaches is using an aerosol of burning red phosphorus particles and aluminium coated glass fibers; the infrared emissions of such <b>smoke</b> <b>curtains</b> hides the weaker emissions of colder objects behind it, but the effect is only short-lived. Carbon (most often graphite) particles present in the smokes can also serve to absorb the beams of laser designators. Yet another possibility is a water fog sprayed around the vehicle; the presence of large droplets absorbs in infrared band and additionally serves as a countermeasure against radars in 94 GHz band. Other materials used as visible/infrared obscurants are micropulverized flakes of brass or graphite, particles of titanium dioxide, or terephthalic acid.|$|R
50|$|The {{centre of}} the {{building}} is constructed from a grid of concrete pillars, 14 m (46 ft) apart, supporting cantilevered concrete slab floors. The exterior is clad in 890 dark <b>smoked</b> glass <b>curtain</b> wall. The use of dark glass, a curtain wall and lack of right angle corners mirrors the art deco Express Building in Manchester - one of Norman Foster's favourite buildings. The central escalator well leads up to a rooftop staff restaurant surrounded by a rooftop garden (360 panorama).|$|R
5000|$|His 1957 {{experimental}} film Kineformy (Cineforms) {{consisted of}} projecting moving abstract models onto a screen using a special image-distorting lens. Pawlowski devised a light machine with two crank-like handles {{to move the}} models and the lenses. The light, passing through the lenses, distorted the forms, resulting {{in a series of}} very complex images - wispy <b>smoke,</b> diaphanous <b>curtains,</b> passing ghosts and then suddenly solid organic forms. This light performance was then filmed. It became an international success and today {{is one of the leading}} examples of avant-garde film and video in Poland.|$|R
500|$|Three {{hundred and}} two {{aircraft}} from eight different airfields in the Moresby and Dobodura areas, made a rendezvous over Tsili Tsili at 10:07, flying through clouds, {{passes in the}} mountains, and over the top. [...] "Not a single squadron," [...] wrote General Kenney, [...] "did any circling or stalling around but all slid into place like clockwork and proceeded on the final flight down the Watut Valley, turned to the right down the Markham, and {{went directly to the}} target." [...] Leading the formation were 48 B-25s from the 38th and 345th Bombardment Groups whose job was to [...] "sanitise" [...] the drop zones by dropping their loads of sixty [...] fragmentation bombs and strafing with the eight [...]50-calibre machine guns mounted in their noses. They were followed by seven A-20s of the 3rd Bombardment Group (Light). Each carried four M10 smoke tanks mounted under the wings. The smoke tanks were each filled with [...] of the smoke agent FS. In two groups of two and one of three flying at [...] at , they laid three <b>smoke</b> <b>curtains</b> adjacent to the three drop zones. The lead aircraft discharged two tanks, waited four seconds, then discharged the other two. The following aircraft went through the same procedure, creating a slight overlap to insure a continuous screen. Conditions were favourable, while the 85% humidity kept the screens effective for five minutes and stopped their dispersal for ten.|$|R

50|$|The Telstra Corporate Centre is a sleek, black {{signature}} for a corporatised government monopoly, to {{some extent}} comfortable and very recognisable that sits well in the skyline. The design at the corporate scale is to accept a complicity with the value system {{of the city that}} is to accept the primary role of the other discourses such as the economic and speculative.The aerial view of the telecom building shows us the glazed tower wrapped around the core. The overall configuration of the tower, as an object, is sculptural rather than elevational with the <b>smoked</b> class <b>curtain</b> walls that cover the majority of the building's exterior facade, reflecting the city on its surface as well as keeping its interior private. Its glass curtain walls coil around the grey tilted lift core, offering the different aspects of its composition as the viewer circles the city. The telecom corporate building by Perrott Lyon Mathieson is an evolution of the tower type in Melbourne as it is able to reconfigure the tower {{as a response to the}} city in the round, or a reading of the city as an object. As part of the skyline, this view of the collective aspirations of a society is critical in placing that society within world culture, but also in designating its difference.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposed}} a new smart home {{system that is}} designed based on ZigBee network and STM 32 F 407 mi-croprocessor. The system architecture, the basic circuit diagram and the flowchart of the software system are also provid-ed. This smart home system integrates home appliances, lighting system, entry guard system, <b>smoke</b> sensors, automatic <b>curtains</b> and other equipment by connecting them to a ZigBee network. An STM 32 F 407 MCU is used as the main control microprocessor to implement the interconnection among ZigBee, GPRS and WiFi networks. Users can use the smart home system by operations on a touch screen connecting STM 32 F 407. By using a smart phone or tablet connected to a WiFi or GPRS network, users can also remotely monitor and control all home appliances in the smart home system...|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 {{shows an}} example of visual transparency. The image could arise {{from a number of}} {{different}} physical causes. For example, a square of tissue paper could be in front of a dark grey circle; or a circular shadow could be cast on a plane containing a light grey square; or a dark circular filter could be lying on top of a light grey square. Although the physics is uncertain, one can perceive the image as a combination of two more primitive images. Figure 1 We use the term &quot;transparency &quot; to cover the general case of such image combination, including what would be called &quot;translucency &quot; in ordinary language. Many physical phenomena can produce transparency. For example, dark filters, specular reflections, puffs of <b>smoke,</b> gauze <b>curtains,</b> and cast shadows, all combine with patterns behind them in a transparent manner. When an image has been formed by the combination of two primitive images, then it is usually more parsimonious to describe the image in terms of that combination; thus it is advantageous for a visual system to parse the image into the primitive images along with a combination rule. This parsimony does not depend on assigning a unique physical interpretation to the primitive images; figure 1 can be parsed into a circle and a square, {{even in the absence of}} a decision about the underlying physics. We suggest that visual transparency may be initially analysed at a &quot;prephysical&quot; level, which does not include the physical specificity of a full intrinsic image analysis [1]. The representation at this level consists of a set of primitive image layers which are ordered in depth. Each layer contains filled regions which modify the appearance of the layers beneath them, and unfilled regions which are perfectly clear. The filled regions of different layers combine with 77 each other according to simple rules such as multiplication and addition. Figure 2 shows {{an example of}} the layers which might give rise to figure 1. In the simplest layered model luminance only propogates from the lower layers to the higher ones (i. e. toward the viewer). The significance of X junctions...|$|R
