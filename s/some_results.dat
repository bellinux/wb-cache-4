25|$|Because {{these models}} are {{necessarily}} simplifying natural conditions (often {{based on the}} assumption that weeds, disease and insect pests are controlled), it is not clear whether the results they give will have an in-field reality. However, <b>some</b> <b>results</b> are partly validated with an increasing number of experimental results.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>results</b> in {{constructive}} {{set theory}} use the axiom of countable choice or the axiom of dependent choice, {{which do not}} imply {{the law of the}} excluded middle in constructive set theory. Although the axiom of countable choice in particular is commonly used in constructive mathematics, its use has also been questioned.|$|E
25|$|Madhava {{laid the}} {{foundations}} {{for the development of}} calculus, which were further developed by his successors at the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. (It should be noted that certain ideas of calculus were known to earlier mathematicians.) Madhava also extended <b>some</b> <b>results</b> found in earlier works, including those of Bhāskara II.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, in any {{geometric}} {{problem we}} have an initial set of symbols (points and lines), an algorithm, and <b>some</b> <b>results.</b> From this perspective, geometry is equivalent to an axiomatic algebra, replacing its elements by symbols. Probably Gauss first realized this, {{and used it to}} prove the impossibility of some constructions; only much later did Hilbert find a complete set of axioms for geometry.|$|E
25|$|Also Hermann Minkowski said in 1908 {{that the}} transformations which play the main {{role in the}} {{principle}} of relativity were first examined by Voigt in 1887. Voigt responded in the same paper by saying that his theory {{was based on an}} elastic theory of light, not an electromagnetic one. However, he concluded that <b>some</b> <b>results</b> were actually the same.|$|E
25|$|The first {{divergence}} between oviparous (egg-laying) and viviparous (offspring develop internally) mammals {{is believed to}} have occurred during the Triassic period. However, there is still some disagreement on this estimated time of divergence. Though most findings from genetics studies (especially those concerning nuclear genes) are in agreement with the paleontological findings, <b>some</b> <b>results</b> from other techniques and sources, like mitochondrial DNA, are in slight disagreement with findings from fossils.|$|E

25|$|A very {{important}} point to consider is that weeds would undergo the same acceleration of cycle as cultivated crops, and would also benefit from carbonaceous fertilization. Since most weeds are C3 plants, {{they are likely to}} compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, <b>some</b> <b>results</b> make it possible to think that weedkillers could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.|$|E
25|$|On 3 June 2008, Eriksson {{was officially}} signed to become {{manager of the}} Mexico {{national}} team. He formally started the role after Mexico's World Cup qualifier against Belize on 21 June. On 20 August 2008, he debuted as manager of Mexico in a CONCACAF World Cup qualifier versus Honduras.

25|$|Laver had a long-running, {{friendly}} {{rivalry with}} Ken Rosewall between 1963, {{when he started}} out as a pro, and 1976, when both were semi-retired from the main tour.
