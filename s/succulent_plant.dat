5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century saw {{increasingly}} sophisticated educational, visitor service, and interpretation services. Botanical gardens started to cater for many interests and their displays reflected this, often including botanical exhibits on themes of evolution, ecology or taxonomy, horticultural displays of attractive flowerbeds and herbaceous borders, plants from different parts of the world, special collections of plant groups such as bamboos or roses, and specialist glasshouse collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, cacti and orchids, as well as the traditional herb gardens and medicinal plants. Specialised gardens like the Palmengarten in Frankfurt, Germany (1869), one of the world's leading orchid and <b>succulent</b> <b>plant</b> collections, have been very popular. There was a renewed interest in gardens of indigenous plants and areas dedicated to natural vegetation.|$|E
25|$|Hoodia, a <b>succulent</b> <b>plant,</b> {{originates}} {{from the}} Kalahari Desert of South Africa. For generations {{it has been}} known to the traditionally living San people as an appetite suppressant. In 1996 South Africa’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research began working with companies, including Unilever, to develop dietary supplements based on hoodia. Originally the San people were not scheduled to receive any benefits from the commercialization of their traditional knowledge, but in 2003 the South African San Council made an agreement with CSIR in which they would receive from 6 to 8% of the revenue from the sale of Hoodia products.|$|E

25|$|Aloeae is a {{tribe of}} {{succulent}} {{plants in the}} subfamily Asphodeloideae of the family Asphodelaceae, consisting of the aloes and their close relatives. The taxon may also be treated as the subfamily Alooideae by those botanists who retain the narrower circumscription of Asphodelaceae adopted prior to the APG III system. Typically, plants have rosettes of more or less succulent leaves, {{with or without a}} distinct stem. Their flowers are arranged in racemes and tend to be either small and pale, pollinated by insects, or larger and more brightly coloured, pollinated by birds. , 11 genera are recognized, most created since 2010 by splitting off another five genera from Aloe and another two from Haworthia. Only two genera, Aloe and Aloidendron, are native outside southern Africa, extending northwards to the Arabian Peninsula. Seven genera are restricted to South Africa, some with small ranges. Members of the Aloeae are cultivated by <b>succulent</b> <b>plant</b> enthusiasts; Aloe species especially are used in temperate climates as ornamental garden plants. Some species are used in traditional medicine. Aloe vera and Aloe ferox are cultivated for their extracts, whose uses include moisturizers and emollients in cosmetics.|$|E
500|$|European glasswort {{is picked}} between May and September and sold locally as [...] "samphire". It is a fleshy plant which when blanched or steamed has a taste {{which leads to}} its {{alternative}} name of [...] "sea asparagus", and it is often eaten with fish. It can also be eaten raw when young. Glasswort is also a favourite food for the rabbits, which will venture onto the saltmarsh in search of this <b>succulent</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1984, it {{was decided}} that the Cactaceae Section of the International Organization for <b>Succulent</b> <b>Plant</b> Study should set up a working party, now called the International Cactaceae Systematics Group (ICSG), to produce {{consensus}} classifications down to the level of genera. Their system has been used as the basis of subsequent classifications. Detailed treatments published in the 21st century have divided the family into around 125–130 genera and 1,400–1,500 species, which are then arranged into a number of tribes and subfamilies. The ICSG classification of the cactus family recognizes four subfamilies, the largest of which is divided into nine tribes. The subfamilies are: ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{species are}} {{cultivated}} by <b>succulent</b> <b>plant</b> enthusiasts; Aloe species {{in particular are}} used in temperate climates as ornamental garden plants. Aloe vera and Aloe ferox are used in traditional medicine and cosmetics for their moisturizing and emollient effects. Industries based on these two species were reported to be worth [...] "millions of dollars per year" [...] in South Africa alone. Injured leaves of many species of Aloe exude a gel that contains aloin (also known as barbaloin). Aloin {{has been used as}} a laxative, and also to add a bitter taste to foods. Some species of Haworthia and Gasteria are also used in traditional medicine.|$|E
2500|$|Some cost {{can also}} be {{attributed}} to maintenance. [...] Extensive green roofs have low maintenance requirements but they are generally not maintenance free. [...] German research has quantified the need to remove unwanted seedlings to approximately 6 seconds/m2/year. [...] Maintenance of green roofs often includes fertilization to increase flowering and <b>succulent</b> <b>plant</b> cover. [...] If aesthetics are not an issue, fertilization and maintenance are generally not needed. [...] Extensive green roofs should only be fertilized with controlled-release fertilizers {{in order to avoid}} pollution of the storm water. [...] Conventional fertilizers should never be used on extensive vegetated roofs. [...] German studies have approximated the nutrient requirement of vegetated roofs to 5gN/m2. [...] It is also important to use a substrate that does not contain too many available nutrients. [...] The FLL guidelines specify maximum-allowable nutrient content of substrates.|$|E

60|$|Many splendid gardens {{like this}} exist {{on what is}} {{sometimes}} styled the barren Karroo; but the land is anything but barren. All it requires is a copious supply of water, and wherever farmers have taken the trouble to form dams and store the heavy though infrequent rains, gardens of the most prolific kind have been the result. The Karroo-bush itself, which gives name to these plains, is a <b>succulent</b> <b>plant,</b> which thrives in the almost waterless soil, and forms a rich pasturage for sheep and cattle. Hobson's garden--copiously watered by streams led out from his large dams--was a beautiful shady oasis of green and gold, {{in the midst of}} what, to some eyes, might have appeared a desert, but which, if irrigated properly, would become a perfect paradise of fertility.|$|E
60|$|The {{reason for}} this bellicose {{disposition}} {{on the part of}} the cactuses is a tolerably easy one to guess. Fodder is rare in the desert. The starving herbivores that find themselves from time to time belated on the confines of such thirsty regions would seize with avidity upon any <b>succulent</b> <b>plant</b> which offered them food and drink at once in their last extremity. Fancy the joy with which a lost caravan, dying of hunger and thirst in the byways of Sahara, would hail a great bed of melons, cucumbers, and lettuces! Needless to say, however, under such circumstances melon, cucumber, and lettuce would soon be exterminated: they would be promptly eaten up at discretion without leaving a descendant to represent them in the second generation. In the ceaseless war between herbivore and plant, which is waged every day and all day long the whole world over with far greater persistence than the war between carnivore and prey, only those species of plant can survive in such exposed situations which happen to develop spines, thorns, or prickles as a means of defence against the mouths of hungry and desperate assailants.|$|E
