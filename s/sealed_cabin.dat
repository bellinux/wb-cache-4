With the cabin structure <b>sealed,</b> <b>cabin</b> air was dumped overboard at a controlled rate through a dump valve and replaced with oxygen, from storage bottles, maintaining oxygen levels roughly constant.

Piccard developed a frost-free window, that was used on this flight and later by the Navy and Air Force in the B-24 Liberator or B-26 Marauder. He used blasting caps and TNT for releasing the balloon at launch and for remote release of external ballast from inside the <b>sealed</b> <b>cabin.</b> This was the first use of pyrotechnics for remote-controlled actuating devices in aircraft, an unpopular, revolutionary idea at the time.

40|$|Under an interagency {{agreement}} with the United States Coast Guard, working in collaboration with an industry consultant, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers evaluated carbon monoxide (CO) exposures on ten express cruiser boats from several manufacturers. The evaluated boats were new and included several different models. These boats had gasoline-powered propulsion engines and used gasoline-powered generators to provide electricity for onboard appliances. This study was performed for the U. S. Coast Guard to better understand how CO poisonings may occur on express cruisers, identify the most hazardous conditions, and {{begin the process of}} identify controls to prevent/reduce CO exposures. Boats were evaluated while stationary and at multiple speeds, ranging from 5 to 25 miles per hour. CO concentrations were measured by multiple real-time instruments, which were placed at different locations on the boats with overhead, enclosing canopies set at various configurations. Many of the evaluated boats generated hazardous CO concentrations: peak CO concentrations often exceeded 1, 100 parts per million (ppm), while average CO concentrations were well over 100 ppm at the stern (rear). Two boats with a combined exhaust system (exhausting at the sides and underwater) had dramatically lower CO concentrations {{than any of the other}} evaluated boats (about 40 % lower). Based on the results and observations made in this report, the following major findings are summarized below: 1. When the canvas is deployed and boat is underway, CO concentrations exceeded the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) level near the swim platform for many of the evaluated boats. 2. The combination of travel at low speeds into the wind with the canvas fully deployed and no forward hatches, windows or front panels opened maximized the station wagon effect, pulling significant amounts of CO into the cockpit. 3. Different exhaust configurations have a major impact on how CO concentrations are entrained into the cockpit and other occupied areas. Accordingly, boats equipped with underwater exhaust exhibited significantly lower CO concentrations than vessels equipped with other exhaust designs. 4. CO concentrations are typically higher at the stern of the boat and become gradually lower toward the front of the boat. 5. Stationary smoke tests in the engine compartment showed satisfactory sealing of the bulkhead between the engine and adjacent compartments on all boats. Based on the preceding findings, the following recommendations are made to reduce CO concentrations on express cruisers: 1. Boat manufacturers should consider underwater exhaust that will significantly reduce CO concentrations inside the cockpit and other occupied areas compared to surface exhaust. 2. Because of the station wagon effect, some canvas configurations should not be used while boat is moving or propulsion and/or generator engines are running. 3. The possibility of adding force draft blowers into the cabin, creating a positive pressure to minimize potential CO intrusions, should be studied. Auxiliary blowers can be fitted and routed to ventilate the cockpit and swim platform areas in order to minimize negative pressure areas throughout the vessel. 4. Since properly <b>sealed</b> <b>cabin</b> doors directly influenced the CO concentration in the cabin area, door suppliers should be encouraged to develop better sealing methods and designs. 5. Windshield manufacturers should be encouraged to study the possibility of maximizing ventilation of occupied areas by improving the design of the center and side wings of the windshield. 7. Due care should be exercised when designing the powered ventilation system on the engine compartment, locating the air intake on the opposite side of the generator exhaust. Also, potentially moving the intake much farther forward on the vessel would help minimize the intake of CO exhaust into the engine compartment. 8. The development of cleaner burning engines (propulsion and generators) with catalytic converters should continue since they have the potential to greatly reduce CO concentrations to safer levels. 9. The American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) should examine their standards and emphasize ventilation problems that can lead to CO intrusions, taking a strong position against surface exhaust designs for propulsion engines.

5000|$|Following the depressurization, {{the pilots}} {{did not receive}} {{supplemental}} oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation. The wreckage indicated that the oxygen bottle pressure regulator/shutoff valve was open on the accident flight. Further, although one flight crew mask hose connector {{was found in the}} wreckage disconnected from its valve receptacle (the other connector was not recovered), damage to the recovered connector and both receptacles was consistent with both flight crew masks having been connected to the airplane's oxygen supply lines at the time of impact. In addition, both flight crew mask microphones were found plugged into their respective crew microphone jacks. Therefore, assuming the oxygen bottle contained an adequate supply of oxygen, supplemental oxygen should have been available to both pilots' oxygen masks.A possible explanation for the failure of the pilots to receive emergency oxygen is that their ability to think and act decisively was impaired because of hypoxia before they could don their oxygen masks. No definitive evidence exists that indicates {{the rate at which the}} accident flight lost its cabin pressure; therefore, the Safety Board evaluated conditions of both rapid and gradual depressurization.If there had been a breach in the fuselage (even a small one that could not be visually detected by the in-flight observers) or a <b>seal</b> failure, the <b>cabin</b> could have depressurized gradually, rapidly, or even explosively. Research has shown that a period of as little as 8 seconds without supplemental oxygen following rapid depressurization to about [...] may cause a drop in oxygen saturation that can significantly impair cognitive functioning and increase the amount of time required to complete complex tasks.A more gradual decompression could have resulted from other possible causes, such as a smaller leak in the pressure vessel or a closed flow control valve. Safety Board testing determined that a closed flow control valve would cause complete depressurization to the airplane's flight altitude over a period of several minutes. However, without supplemental oxygen, substantial adverse effects on cognitive and motor skills would have been expected soon after the first clear indication of decompression (the cabin altitude warning), when the cabin altitude reached [...] (which could have occurred in about 30 seconds).Investigations of other accidents in which flight crews attempted to diagnose a pressurization problem or initiate emergency pressurization instead of immediately donning oxygen masks following a cabin altitude alert have revealed that, even with a relatively gradual rate of depressurization, pilots have rapidly lost cognitive or motor abilities to effectively troubleshoot the problem or don their masks shortly thereafter. In this accident, the flight crew's failure to obtain supplemental oxygen in time to avoid incapacitation could be explained by a delay in donning oxygen masks; of only a few seconds in the case of an explosive or rapid decompression, or a slightly longer delay in the case of a gradual decompression.In summary, the Safety Board was unable to determine why the flight crew could not, or did not, receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation.|$|R
