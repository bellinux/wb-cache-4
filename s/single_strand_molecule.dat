40|$|It is {{suggested}} that computations using DNA molecules as computing units may sometimes be simpler to carry out and less error prone if double <b>stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> are used rather than the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>molecules</b> currently being used. A detailed illustration is given of a biomolecular algorithm that uses double stranded DNA for {{the solution of the}} directed Hamiltonian path problem. 1 Introduction Following the method used by Adleman [1] in his DNA solution of a seven vertex instance of the directed Hamiltonian path (DHP) problem, researchers continue to use the annealing of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA in their molecular computing efforts. <b>Single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> (ssDNAs) are capable of behaviors that obstruct the desired annealings. Through partial self annealing they may form undesired hairpin structures. Undesired partial annealings between distinct ssDNAs may result in undesired ligations. <b>Single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> are undesirably flexible. Researchers devote substantial e [...] ...|$|R

[...] Utilizing this improved specificity, a group at the University of Washington has proposed using double stranded DNA (dsDNA) between each <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>molecule</b> to hold the base in the reading section of the pore. The dsDNA would halt the base in the correct section of the pore and enable identification of the nucleotide.

40|$|T-region {{transfer}} from wild-type Agrobacterium strains {{is thought to}} be an orientated process, starting at the right border repeat and terminating at the left border repeat of the T-region. Here we demonstrate that a right border repeat in the inverted orientation relative to the onc-genes can also mediate transfer of the T-region to the plant cell, although with lower efficiency as a border repeat in the native orientation. Transfer mediated by an inverted right border repeat is stimulated by the presence of the T-region transfer enhancer. Similar <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>molecules,</b> comprising the bottom strand of the T-DNA, were isolated from acetosyringone induced bacteria, irrespective of the orientation of the right border. These findings show that border repeats work bidirectionally to some extent...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} I present a novel {{approach}} {{to the use of}} biomolecules as constructive material for an autonomous DNAbased platform on which is possible to do sensing consequently actuating the object after the transduc-tion of an environmental signal. The new approach is based on a DNA origami obtained by folding a long polynucleotide with hundreds of shorter oligonucleotides and resulting in a well defined and ordered disks of a diameter of about 100 nm. Each disk is composed of two main parts, an external ring and an internal disk, connected each other in only two diametrically opposite points. A linear <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA <b>molecule,</b> the probe, is inserted on the upper face of the internal mov-ing disk, perpendicularly to the connections and to the axis of constrain; as far as the probe remains <b>single</b> <b>stranded,</b> the DNA-object appears planar, but when it gets in contact with its complementary ssDNA called “target”, forming a double stranded DNA, it opens the origami’s structure. The realization of such autonomous organic structure is preliminary to its application in many contests. The actuation principle was first applied {{for the development of a}} revertable biosensing platform, where the addition of a third <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>molecule,</b> displaces the target from the probe restoring the initial state of the origami. The same principle was also improved with real samples such as viral RNAs. In this thesis, I report the setting up of the single components of the device: complex DNA based objects, the switching mechanism, the validation with real samples and the possible applications of the whole system...|$|R

50|$|Exonic {{splicing}} silencers work by inhibiting the splicing of pre-mRNA strands or promoting exon skipping. The <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> pre-mRNA <b>molecules</b> need to {{have their}} intronic and exonic regions spliced {{in order to be}} translated. ESSs silence splice sites adjacent to them by interfering with the components of the core splicing complex, such as the snRNP's, U1 and U2. This causes proteins that negatively influence splicing to be recruited to the splicing machinery.|$|R
40|$|Micro RNAs are {{evolutionarily}} conserved, <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>molecules</b> {{of about}} 22 nucleotides {{in length and}} function post-transcriptionally by partial binding (partial complementarity) to the mRNA of genes. Binding of a specific miRNA to its target on an mRNA can inhibit its expression {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Although the most common mechanism is translational repression as a result of miRNA binding to the 3 'UTR of an mRNA, mechanisms involving mRNA degradation and destabilization have also been described. Micro RNAs are currently considered as "master regulators" of gene expression. Since a single miRNA can bind and consequently regulate the expression of more than 100 different transcripts {{it has been estimated that}} miRNAs may be able to regulate up to 30 % of the protein-coding genes in the human genome. As a result, miRNAs receive widespread attention on their potential role in complicated biological processes and multifactorial diseases. In this review we are discussing the biogenesis of miRNAs, their mode of action as well as their role in human diseases through genetic variations on their target sites...|$|R

50|$|This {{method of}} {{sequencing}} utilizes binding {{characteristics of a}} library of short <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> (oligonucleotides), also called DNA probes, to reconstruct a target DNA sequence. Non-specific hybrids are removed by washing and the target DNA is eluted. Hybrids are re-arranged such that the DNA sequence can be reconstructed. The benefit of this sequencing type {{is its ability to}} capture a large number of targets with a homogenous coverage. A large number of chemicals and starting DNA is usually required.

40|$|Two {{nucleic acid}} gel {{electrophoresis}} techniques were tested {{as a possible}} tool for analyzing junctional diversity in rearranged T cell receptor (TcR) sequences in order to define the extent of T cell heterogeneity. For this purpose {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) as well as non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (nDGE) techniques have been studied. Detection of junctional diversity is based on mobility shifts, caused by nucleotide sequence polymorphism, of polymerase chain reaction amplified rearranged TcR sequences. DGGE as well as nDGE procedures are suitable for the detection of junctional diversity in TcR V gene family sequences based on sequence dependent separation. Compared to DGGE, nDGE of DNA is a relatively simple and rapid procedure, with a high separation potential. nDGE permits separation of double <b>stranded</b> (homoduplexes) and/or <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA <b>molecules</b> of the majority of TcR chain encoding sequences. Formation and detection of unique heteroduplex <b>molecules</b> combined with <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA <b>molecule</b> analysis in nDGE permits the recognition of the remaining sequences, thus providing additional information on the degree of T cell heterogeneity. In conclusion, these nucleic acid gel electrophoresis techniques allow a direct assessment of the heterogeneity and clonality of T cell populations by the detection of junctional diversity in TcR chain encoding sequences. This analysis can be performed without the need of cell propagation and/or cellular cloning procedures, thereby eliminating the risk of introducing technical artefacts...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHairpin {{completion}} is {{a formal}} operation inspired from biochemistry. Here we consider a restricted variant of hairpin completion called bounded hairpin completion. Applied to a word encoding a <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>molecule</b> x such that either a suffix or a prefix of x is complementary to a subword of x, hairpin completion produces {{a new word}} z, which is a prolongation of x to the right or to the left by annealing. Although this operation is a purely mathematical one and the biological reality is just a source of inspiration, it seems rather unrealistic to impose no restriction {{on the length of}} the prefix or suffix added by the hairpin completion. The restriction considered here concerns the length of all prefixes and suffixes that are added to the current word by hairpin completion. They cannot be longer than a given constant. Closure properties of some classes of formal languages under the non-iterated and iterated bounded hairpin completion are investigated. We consider the bounded hairpin completion distance between two words and generalize this distance to languages and discuss algorithms for computing them. Finally also the inverse operation, namely bounded hairpin reduction, as well as the set of all primitive bounded hairpin roots of a regular language are considered...|$|R

Thus, padlock probes are only useful for detecting DNA molecules with known sequences.|$|R
40|$|The structure–activity {{relationship}} of the complex between thrombin and thrombin binding aptamers (TBA) was evaluated by differential pulse voltammetry at a glassy carbon electrode and atomic force microscopy at a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite electrode. The effects on the interaction with thrombin of TBA primary and secondary structures {{as well as of}} its folding properties in the presence of alkaline metals were investigated. The complex between thrombin and <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> aptamers involved the coiling of the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>molecules</b> around thrombin structure leading to the formation of a robust TBA–thrombin complex that maintains the symmetry and conformation of the thrombin molecule. Monitoring both thrombin and TBA oxidation peaks, showed that the thrombin oxidation peaks occur at more positive potentials after TBA–thrombin complex formation. In the presence of K+ ions, the aptamers fold into quadruplex structures that facilitate the interaction with thrombin molecules. The TBA–thrombin complex adsorbs at the surface with the aptamer quadruplex always in preferential contact with the surface, and the thrombin molecules on top of the aptamer quadruplex structure, thus being less accessible to the electrode surface leading to the occurrence of thrombin oxidation peaks at less positive potentials.

Recent studies showed that VKORC 1 gene contains an highly evolutionary conserved binding site for mir- 133. Moreover, in human hepatocytes mir- 133 is constitutively co-expressed with VKORC 1. Since VKORC 1 protein is the target of warfarin treatment, the aim of this study was to verify if genetic variations in MIR 133 A 1, MIR 133 A 2 and MIR 133 B could contribute to warfarin dose variability. By direct sequencing, we identified 4 SNPs in MIR 133 A 2 gene and 1 SNP in MIR 133 B gene. Three SNPs in MIR 133 A 2 were in complete linkage disequilibrium and correlated with warfarin dose: indeed, for each SNP, patients carrying the GA or AA genotype required a MWWD significantly higher than the wildtype genotype (P= 0. 019). We also inferred the haplotypes in MIR 133 A 2 gene. The GC haplotype required a MWWD significantly lower than AT haplotype (P= 0. 012). The multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that rs 45547937 (as tag SNP) in MIR 133 A 2 could be involved in warfarin dosing variability, (P= 0. 016).

Until recently there were no effective therapies for these conditions, but antisense oligonucleotides, {{a new class of}} synthetic <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>molecules</b> of nucleic acids, have demonstrated promising experimental results and are at different stages of regulatory approval. The antisense oligonucleotides can modulate the protein expression via targeting hnRNAs or mRNAs and inducing interference with splicing, mRNA degradation, or arrest of translation, finally, resulting in rescue or reduction of the target protein expression. Different classes of antisense oligonucleotides are being tested in several clinical trials, and limitations of their clinical efficacy and toxicity have been reported for some of these compounds, while more encouraging results have supported the development of others. New generation antisense oligonucleotides are also being tested in preclinical models together with specific delivery systems that could allow some of the limitations of current antisense oligonucleotides to be overcome, to improve the cell penetration, to achieve more robust target engagement, and hopefully also be associated with acceptable toxicity.
