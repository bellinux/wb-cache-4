5|$|The dermal punch: A dermal punch is used {{to remove}} a {{circular}} area of tissue, into which jewellery is placed, and may be useful for larger cartilage piercings.

50|$|Generally, in articulatory phonetics, <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> {{articulation}} (or {{point of}} articulation) of a consonant is <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> contact, where an obstruction {{occurs in the}} vocal tract between an active (moving) articulator (typically <b>some</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue) and a passive (stationary) articulator (typically <b>some</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth).|$|R
5|$|Throughout the world, hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are taken by humans, {{though it is}} illegal to hunt them in many countries. In <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, hawksbill sea turtles are eaten as a delicacy. As far back as the fifth century BC, sea turtles, {{including}} the hawksbill, were eaten as delicacies in China.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast. The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. <b>Some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastline consist of machair, a low lying dune pasture land.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{surveys of}} the site have {{confirmed}} {{that there was a}} very large artificial enclosure, roughly circular in shape, within which are what is left of several circular and rectangular basins. The basins may be identified with the artificial pools described by the court poet Ali ibn Muhammad el-Iyadi, which surrounded the palace. The foundations have been revealed through archaeological excavations. Traces of the great hall's columns are still visible. <b>Some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal can still be seen.|$|E

50|$|Each part {{should be}} washed {{thoroughly}} {{in such a}} way that the water reaches the skin. Special care should be taken while washing the head; the hair should be combed (e.g., with your fingers) so that water reached the hair-roots.

5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing {{a nuclear power plant}} network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E
5|$|At least initially, <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle were occupied, {{possibly}} {{including the}} remains of the original manor house. The castle continued to be owned by the Hastings family until around 1630, when it was purchased by Sir Robert Banaster, and then by William Wollaston. Over the course {{of the rest of the}} century, Kirby Muxloe Castle was abandoned; it was robbed for its building materials, and became used for agricultural purposes.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E

5|$|Dairy {{products}} such as milk, butter, ghee, yoghurt, buttermilk and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle, though the milk of sheep, goat, yak, and buffalo is also used in <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world and for gourmet products. For example, buffalo milk is used to make mozzarella in Italy and gulab jamun dessert in India, while sheep milk is used to make blue Roquefort cheese in France.|$|E
5|$|Dense {{vegetation}} (such as that {{of tropical}} rainforests) and urban habitats are not ideal {{for the establishment of}} the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the sylvatic habitat and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly deforested areas, piassava palm culture areas, and <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amazon region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Creek's steady flow, warmth, deep pools, {{and small}} waterfalls attract {{visitors}} who wade, swim, float, kayak, and snorkel in its waters. Four named hiking paths intersect the Fossil Creek corridor: the Flume–Irving, Fossil Springs, Mail, and Deadman Mesa trails. The U.S. Forest Service allows dispersed camping in <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area but has made other parts, such as riparian zones, off-limits to overnight stays. Other {{activities in the}} area include wildlife viewing, photography, fishing, and visits to {{the remains of the}} Childs-Irving infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation in <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western United States. This belief was so deeply ingrained that the reintroduction of condors to the Grand Canyon was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|E
5|$|In <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, {{especially}} army ants, {{are used}} as surgical sutures. The wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes {{the edges of the}} wound in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound. The large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of {{speciality}} health care, Karnataka's private sector competes with {{the best in the}} world. Karnataka has also established a modicum of public health services having a better record of health care and child care than most other states of India. In spite of these advances, <b>some</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state still leave much to be desired when it comes to primary health care.|$|E
50|$|Coherentism accepts any {{belief that}} is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a {{coherent}} system of beliefs. In contrast, P can cohere with P1 and P2 without P, P1 or P2 being true. Instead, Coherentists {{might say that}} it is very unlikely that the whole system would be both untrue and consistent, and that if <b>some</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system was untrue, it would almost certainly be inconsistent with <b>some</b> other <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system.|$|R

50|$|For <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> {{an antenna}} <b>the</b> total RCS {{can be divided}} into two {{separate}} components as Structural Mode RCS and Antenna Mode RCS. <b>The</b> two components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RCS relates to the two scattering phenomena that takes place at the antenna. When an electromagnetic signal falls on an antenna surface, <b>some</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic energy is scattered back to the space. This is called structural mode scattering. <b>The</b> remaining <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy is absorbed due to <b>the</b> antenna effect. <b>Some</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absorbed energy is again scattered back into the space due to the impedance mismatches, called antenna mode scattering.|$|R
5|$|Mountains such as Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain and Penobscot Mountain are {{partially}} in the watershed.

Yellow birch, sugar maple, and hemlock trees grow on the {{tributary}} Bearfield Run.|$|E
50|$|Electric and {{electronic}} devices consume electric energy to generate desired output (i.e., light, heat, motion, etc.). During operation, <b>some</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy—depending on the electrical efficiency—is consumed in unintended output, such as waste heat.|$|R
