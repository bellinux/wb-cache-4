40|$|Abstract: Crawler combine {{harvester}} walking system is various transmission technology are organic and reasonable matching, foster strengths and circumvent weaknesses, complementary drive system {{so as to}} achieve the best overall. Stepless speed walking is particularly suitable for complex condition changes, the demand of drive system for a more comprehensive, more comprehensive, objective stepless speed walking in transmission system innovation or seek better performance, and as a mechanical transmission device of the planetary gear has the advantages of small volume transfer large torque, high efficiency. The combination of both realizes stepless transmission, and has the advantages of low speed and high torque. Hydraulic drive system is mainly to achieve stepless speed regulation, commutation, planetary gear drive mainly reduce speed, increase the torque to. Composite transmission mode that can greatly improve the transmission ability, expand the scope of speed adjustment. In fact, combine the <b>stepless</b> <b>variable</b> speed running and control technology can greatly improve {{the performance of the}} product, especially the effect on production efficiency, durability, controllability, environment adaptability, green characteristics were significantly...|$|E
50|$|Leonardo da Vinci, in 1490, {{conceptualized}} a <b>stepless</b> continuously <b>variable</b> transmission. Milton Reeves {{invented a}} variable-speed transmission for saw milling in 1879, which he applied {{to his first}} car in 1896. The first patent for a friction-based belt CVT for a car was filed in Europe by Daimler and Benz in 1886, and a US patent for a toroidal CVT was granted in 1935.|$|R
