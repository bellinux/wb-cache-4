2500|$|The {{digital data}} on a CD begins {{at the center of}} the disc and {{proceeds}} toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different <b>size</b> <b>formats</b> available. <b>Standard</b> CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is [...] in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity. This capacity was reportedly specified by Sony executive Norio Ohga in May 1980 so as to be able to contain the entirety of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on one disc. This is a myth according to Kees Immink, as the code format had not yet been decided in May 1980. The adoption of EFM one month later would have allowed a playing time of 97 minutes for 120mm diameter or 74 minutes for a disc as small as 100mm. The 120mm diameter has been adopted by subsequent formats, including Super Audio CD, DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc. The 80mm diameter discs ("Mini CDs") can hold up to 24 minutes of music or 210MiB.|$|R
