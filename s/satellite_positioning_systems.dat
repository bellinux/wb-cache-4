50|$|As {{early as}} the mid-1960s, {{advanced}} electronic and computer systems had evolved enabling navigators to obtain automated celestial sight fixes. These systems were used aboard both ships and US Air Force aircraft, and were highly accurate, able to lock onto up to 11 stars (even in daytime) and resolve the craft's position to less than 300 ft. The SR-71 high-speed reconnaissance aircraft was one example of an aircraft that used a combination of automated celestial and inertial navigation.

50|$|In 1956 Australia adopted decimal/metric {{scales for}} mapping, largely for {{military}} interoperability with major allies {{and the global}} trend. After the '1 mile' military maps were discontinued in 1959, and although Defence preferred 1:50,000 maps for tactical operations, it recognised the resources needed for such a programme over large regional areas of Australia and accepted the 1:100,000 map as a practical substitute with 1:50,000 maps over specific areas of interest and military training areas. Then in 1983 Defence endorsed a program for more than 2600 scale 1:50,000 maps in Defence priority areas in north and north-west Australia, its territories and the main land communication routes. By 1996 the Corps had completed more than 1900 of these maps by - field surveys using mainly US TRANSIT and GPS <b>satellite</b> <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> and aircraft mounted laser terrain profiling, new coverage aerial photography, aerotriangulation, compilation and cartographic completion on computer assisted mapping systems and produced both digital and printed topographic products.|$|E

Therefore, the GPS-based (or GLONASS-based) navigation is useful in a conflict with a technologically unsophisticated adversary.

During {{the course}} of {{studying}} how to improve and optimize the anti-jamming ability of the <b>satellite</b> navigation and <b>positioning</b> <b>system,</b> the <b>satellite</b> channel was faced with many types of jamming signals.

That is adopting the jamming cognitive method combined with the time-frequency domain jamming type recognition, power analysis and jamming DOA estimation. Also, the anti-jamming architecture design of the <b>satellite</b> navigation and <b>positioning</b> <b>system</b> is given based on the jamming cognition.
