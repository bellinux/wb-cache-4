50|$|Vertebral {{osteomyelitis}} (also termed spinal osteomyelitis, <b>spondylodiskitis,</b> or disk-space infection), {{is a type}} of osteomyelitis (which is {{infection and}} inflammation of the bone and bone marrow). Vertebral osteomyelitis is a rare bone infection concentrated in the spinal region. Cases of vertebral osteomyelitis are so rare that only 2-4% of all bone infections are attributed to the disease. The infection can be classified as acute or chronic depending on the severity of the onset of the case, where acute patients often experience better outcomes than those living with the chronic symptoms that are characteristic of the disease. Although vertebral osteomyelitis is found in patients across a wide range of ages, the infection is commonly reported in young children and older adults. Vertebral osteomyelitis often attacks two vertebrae and the corresponding intervertebral disk, causing narrowing of the disc space between the vertebrae. The prognosis for the disease is dependent on where the infection is concentrated in the spine, the time between initial onset and treatment, and what approach is used to treat the disease.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} cases of two {{patients}} with <b>spondylodiskitis</b> due to Candida albicans who were success-fully treated with fluconazole. On the basis of findings from these cases and a review of 52 mycologically proven cases in the literature, we describe the main characteristics of candidal <b>spondylodiskitis.</b> In 60 % of the cases, candidal <b>spondylodiskitis</b> was a late complication of candidemia (mean delay, 5. 2 months); it {{was determined to be}} a complication {{on the basis of the}} results of previously positive blood cultures (19 cases), and it was presumed to be a complication in iv drug addicts (12 cases). As <b>spondylodiskitis</b> can be a late complication of candidemia, all episodes of candidemia should be treated with systemic antifungal agents. Clinical and radiological signs of candidal <b>spondylodiskitis</b> were nonspecific. Any bone or joint symptoms in a patient who has had candidemia should be considered to be of fungal origin at the time of presentation. The definitive diagnosis of candidal <b>spondylodiskitis</b> was made on the basis of the results of percutaneous puncture in 26 of 30 cases. The overall prognosis for patients with candidal <b>spondylodiskitis</b> was good, with the full recovery rate ranging from 67 % to 100 %. The preliminary results of treating candidal <b>spondylodiskitis</b> with triazole derivatives, particularly flucona-zole, were satisfactory; there was excellent tolerance of this drug.

40|$|SUMMARY: Psoas abscess {{secondary}} to tuberculous <b>spondylodiskitis</b> {{is usually a}} complication of thoracolumbar vertebrae disease. The psoas abscess may be difficult clinically to diagnose because of its rarity, insidious onset of the disease, and nonspecific clinical presentation. We report multidetector CT and MR imaging findings of a psoas abscess {{secondary to}} primary tuberculous <b>spondylodiskitis</b> of the spine from the T 3 to L 2 vertebrae, which presented as a flank mass. Spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s disease) is common in endemicregions. 1 - 3 Vague symptoms and signs make the clinical diagnosis of psoas abscess with tuberculous <b>spondylodiskitis</b> a challenge. 1, 3 We report imaging findings of a case with exten-sive tuberculous <b>spondylodiskitis</b> accompanied by a psoas ab-scess, which presented as a soft-tissue flank mass beneath the skin.

40|$|<b>Spondylodiskitis</b> with {{epidural}} abscess due to brucellosis is {{very rare}} and serious complication, and it may result in neurological deficits. Here, we report a 29 year-old male patient with brucellosis causing <b>spondylodiskitis</b> and spinal epidural abscess resulting in neurological deficits such as paresis. Surgical therapy is the main approach {{in the treatment of}} the abscess. However, the patient did not accept the surgery. Therefore, initial drug combination therapy (doxycycline and rifampicin) was changed to another therapeutic protocol (streptomy-cin and doxycycline and rifampicin), and the treatment period was extended to three months. He was completely cured in aspect of the disorder and complications. In conclusion, brucellar spinal epidural abscesses are a rare complication of brucellosis.

40|$|Introduction: Enterococcal {{endocarditis}} generally manifests as classical subacute {{infection and}} when metastatic events occur, the embolic events {{are almost always}} bland in nature rather than causing metastatic infection. We present a patient with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) aortic valve endocarditis which presented with lumbar <b>spondylodiskitis,</b> a very unusual manifestation of enterococcal endocarditis. Case Report: A 87 year old man with diabetes and a recent cerebrovascular event was evaluated for increasing lumbar spine pain without fever, chills or other constitutional symptoms. An outpatient MRI revealed fluid in the L 2 -L 3 disk space with enhancement of the L 2 and L 3 vertebrae and bilateral adjacent psoas muscle. An Interventional Radiology-facilitated aspirate showed many PMNs on Gram stain {{and culture of the}} aspirate as well as 4 blood cultures revealed vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis. Retrospectively, the patient had had several urine cultures in the past 2 months which also revealed the same organism. He gave a history of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillin. Because of the unusual cause of the diskitis and multiple positive blood cultures, a trans-esophageal echocardiogram was performed which revealed a vegetation on the right coronary cusp of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s aortic valve. A diagnosis of VRE aortic valve endocarditis was made associated with secondary lumbar <b>spondylodiskitis.</b> He was begun on intravenous daptomycin and the blood cultures became negative. A review of the literature found only several cases of this scenario previously reported and none were linked to VRE as the etiology. Conclusion: Extravalvular secondary infections associated with enterococcal endocarditis as in this case are quite rare. This case is the first known of endocarditis with secondary <b>spondylodiskitis</b> caused by VRE...|$|E
40|$|Background: Brucellosis, as an {{endemic disease}} in Iran, has bone and joint complications. The {{musculoskeletal}} involvement {{is among the}} most common complication of the disease. Here we review 5 cases of brucella <b>spondylodiskitis.</b> Case Presentation: Three out of 5 cases were male and 2 remaining female. The Mean age of patients was 58. 8 ± 16. 3 years. The most common clinical symptom was low back pain. There was a familial history of brucellosis in one case. Three cases had previous history of brucellosis. Three cases had consumed unpasteurized diary. All cases were positive for agglutination tests and all 5 cases had lumbar vertebral involvement in their MRI. Para-vertebral abscess were developed in 2 cases. All cases were cured with long-term medical treatment. Conclusion: Regarding to high prevalence of brucellosis and the high frequency of its skeletal involvement, brucella <b>spondylodiskitis</b> should be considered among the differential diagnosis of low back pain. The early diagnosis and treatment of the disease could prevent the paravertebral abscess and other life-threatening nervous complications...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: For {{evaluation}} of suspected infectious spondylitis, 19 consecutive patients underwent imag-ing-guided spine biopsy with needle aspiration and a percutaneous diskectomy device {{to determine if}} the diskectomy device provided diagnostic value. In 79 % of cases, the diskectomy device yielded a specimen when needle aspiration failed. A significantly greater yield of specimen was observed with the diskectomy device, and 50 % of cases with failed needle aspiration had biopsies positive for infection. Infectious <b>spondylodiskitis</b> is an uncommon spinal disorder,which remains difficult to diagnose. A major potential ob-stacle to microbiologic and histopathologic diagnosis is the adequacy of specimen yield associated with spine biopsy. 1 The “traditional ” biopsy technique is based on an imaging-guided percutaneous needle (25 - to 18 -gauge caliber) placement and aspiration. When the aspiration is “dry ” or yields no specimen, then a lavagewith sterile normal saline is often performed. The objective of disk biopsy should be addressed with a technique that obtains a satisfactory amount of the disk tissue to be an-alyzed. Toward this end, we used a percutaneous diskectom...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of deep-seated candidal infection is increasing, but candidal vertebral osteomyelitis is still rare. We describe 6 patients recently treated in our hospital. Conservative treatment failed in all. We reviewed {{the literature and}} identi®ed 59 additional cases of candidal vertebral osteomyelitis. Candidemia was documented in 61. 5 % of them. The interval between the diagnosis of candidemia and the onset of symptoms of vertebral osteomyelitis varied widely, from days to 11 year. In patients without documented candidemia, there was a similar interval between the occurrence of risk factors for candidemia (present in 72 % of the patients) and the onset of symptoms of vertebral osteomyelitis. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological ®ndings are not speci®c for candidal <b>spondylodiskitis.</b> Final diagnosis is determined by means of culture of a biopsy specimen from the infected vertebra or disk. Treatment consisted of prolonged antifungal treatment, and it often included surgery. On {{the basis of our}} experience (for all 6 patients, initial conservative treatment with only antifungals failed), we recommend consideration of early surgical debridement in combination with prolonged antifungal therapy. The rate of {{incidence of}} invasive candidal infection is increasing. The widespread use of central intravascular catheters, invasive procedures, immunosuppression, and broad-spectrum antibiotics predisposes a patien...|$|E
40|$|Background. Bone {{aspergillosis}} {{remains a}} rare but potentially devastating fungal disease. Although voriconazole is effective for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, evidence of its efficacy for aspergillosis located in bone is limited. Methods. We report our experience with voriconazole in 4 cases of invasive bone aspergillosis. In addition, all cases of probable and definite bone aspergillosis from the Pfizer clinical database were reviewed and analyzed {{to determine the}} safety and efficacy of voriconazole treatment. Global response was evaluated {{at the end of}} therapy {{on the basis of a}} composite assessment of overall clinical, radiological, and mycological responses. Results. Twenty patients are described, of whom 18 had definite bone involvement diagnosed (<b>spondylodiskitis</b> in 9, sternum/rib osteomyelitis in 6, and peripheral bone involvement in 5). Of 20 patients, 14 were immuno-compromised. Oral or intravenous voriconazole was given as salvage therapy for 18 patients; 2 patients received voriconazole as first-line therapy. Median duration of voriconazole treatment was 83. 5 days (range, 4 – 395 days). Global response at end of therapy was satisfactory in 11 (55 %) of 20 patients, including complete responses in 4 patients and partial responses in 7 patients; there were no relapses of infection in the 4 patients with complete response to therapy with voriconazole. Treatment was generally well tolerated. Conclusions. Long-term voriconazole treatment is a new therapeutic option for invasive aspergillosis with bone involvement...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} eighties, the {{advantages}} of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) (reduced costs, no hospitalization trauma in children, no immobilization syndrome in elderly, reduction in nosocomial infections by multiresistant organisms) were identified in the United States, and suitable therapeutic programs were established. Currently, more than 250, 000 patients per year are treated according to an OPAT program. In {{order to understand the}} different ways of managing OPAT and its results, a National OPAT Registry was set up in 2003 in Italy. Analysis of data concerning osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, prosthetic joint infection and <b>spondylodiskitis,</b> allowed information to be acquired about 239 cases of bone and joint infections, with particular concern to demographics, therapeutic management, clinical response, and possible side effects. Combination therapy was the first-line choice in 66. 9 % of cases and frequently intravenous antibiotics were combined with oral ones. Teicoplanin (38 %) and ceftriaxone (14. 7 %), whose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties permit once-a-day administration, were the two top antibiotics chosen; fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) were the most frequently utilized oral drugs. Clinical success, as well as patients' and doctors' satisfaction with the OPAT regimen was high. Side-effects were mild and occurred in 11 % of cases. These data confirm that the management of bone and joint infections in an outpatient setting is suitable, effective and safe...|$|E
