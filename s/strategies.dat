5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of <b>strategies</b> for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive <b>strategies</b> have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant <b>strategies,</b> whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent <b>strategies,</b> unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E

The proposed <b>strategy</b> {{is based on the}} Maximum Payoff <b>Strategy</b> (MPS) and the Best Neighbor <b>Strategy</b> (BNS). In this <b>strategy,</b> every node plays a packet forwarding game with its neighbors and records the total payoff of the game. After one round of play, each player chooses the MPS or BNS <b>strategy</b> for certain probabilities and updates the <b>strategy</b> accordingly. In MPS <b>strategy,</b> each node chooses a <b>strategy</b> that will get the maximum payoff according to its neighbor’s <b>strategy.</b> In BNS <b>strategy,</b> each node follows the <b>strategy</b> of its neighbor with the maximum total payoff and then enters the next round of play. The simulation analysis has shown that MPS-BNS <b>strategy</b> is able to evolve to the maximum expected level of average payoff with faster speed than the pure BNS <b>strategy,</b> especially in the packets forwarding beginning with a low cooperation level. It is concluded that MPS-BNS <b>strategy</b> is effective in fighting against selfishness in different levels and can achieve a preferable performance...|$|R
