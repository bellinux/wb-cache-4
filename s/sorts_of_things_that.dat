"I {{wanted to}} put two {{characters}} of flesh and bone {{in the middle of}} all these artificial creatures," [...] Henson explained, [...] "and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity, with his sexuality, his disturbing aspect, all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> characterize the adult world". Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the U.S. for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson continued to pursue Bowie for the role of Jareth, and sent him each revised draft of the film's script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud's concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Discussing why he chose to be involved in the film, Bowie explained, [...] "I'd always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and I must say that Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies. So I was pretty hooked from the beginning." ...|$|E

Its strategy was to legalize all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were illegal in California ... after easy divorce came easy marriage and casino gaming. Even prostitution is legal in Nevada, in any county that decides to allow it. Quite a few of them do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Freud {{was well}} aware of such {{possible}} linkages. In a letter of 1919, he wrote that regarding [...] "the theme of death, [...] have stumbled onto an odd idea via the drives and must now read all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> belong to it, for instance Schopenhauer". Indeed, Ernest Jones (who like many analysts was not convinced of the need for the death drive, over and above an instinct of aggression) considered that [...] "Freud seemed to have landed in the position of Schopenhauer, who taught that 'death is the goal of life'".|$|E

2500|$|Other {{orthodox}} Marxists or economists {{inspired by}} Marx (including Karl Kautsky, Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, Nikolai Bukharin, Rudolf Hilferding, Rosa Luxemburg, Vladimir Lenin, Otto Bauer, Fritz Sternberg, Natalia Moszkowska, Paul Sweezy, Kozo Uno and Makoto Itoh) provided alternative crisis theories, focusing variously on the anarchy of capitalist production, sectoral disproportions, underconsumption and realization problems, labor-shortage and population pressures, credit insufficiency, excess capital and wages squeezing profits. According to Professor Costas Lapavitsas, [...] "both Hilferding and Lenin – indeed {{most of the}} leading Marxists of their time – treated crises as complex and multifaceted phenomena {{that could not be}} reduced to a simple theory of the rate of profit to fall. The notion that the normal state of capitalist production is to malfunction due to a persistently excessive organic composition of capital, or even due to falling 'surplus' absorption, would have been alien to classical Marxists." [...] Implicitly or explicitly, it was argued by these Marxist economists that economic crises, although they are a fairly regular occurrence in the last two centuries of capitalist development, do not all have exactly the same causes. There are all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can go wrong with capitalism, throwing the markets out of kilter.|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of Katharine in this atmosphere was extremely incongruous, {{and had the}} effect of making Mary remember all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> she had been glad to forget.|$|E

6000|$|... "Papa," [...] said Busy Bee, [...] "I {{am afraid}} I know the reason but too well. It was my foolish {{way of talking}} about the Careys; I used to tease poor Fred about Roger's having taken him for Philip, and say all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I did not really mean." ...|$|E
60|$|My dear, {{you know}} that I--Arthur Little--would do {{anything}} to please you and that I care {{very much for the}} happiness of Anne and the welfare of Ronald Parry.

6000|$|... "Well, {{here we are}} at the fort. I {{guess we}} may as well make our camp outside. If you go in you have got to picket your horse here and put your baggage there and come in at gun-fire, and all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{troubles}} a man who is accustomed to act as he likes." ...|$|E
60|$|Algernon. Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear fellow. It's a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> runs in families. You {{had much}} better say a severe chill.|$|R

60|$|Sir Leicester is majestically wroth. Volumnia {{never heard}} <b>of</b> such a <b>thing.</b> 'The debilitated cousin holds <b>that</b> it's <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that's</b> sure tapn slongs votes--giv'n--Mob.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, you {{see there}} it is, Captain Gills,' said Mr Toots, with a {{perceptible}} increase in the nervousness of his manner. 'It's {{not for me to}} say what may have taken place, or what may not have taken place. Indeed, I don't know. I get mixed up with all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I don't quite understand, and I think there's something rather weak in my--in my head, in short.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But!'--implored Mr. Darton. And with a {{burst of}} real eloquence {{he went on to}} declare all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he would do for her. He would drive her to see her mother every week--take her to London--settle so much money upon her--Heaven knows what he did not promise, suggest, and tempt her with. But it availed nothing. She {{interposed}} with a stout negative, which closed the course of his argument like an iron gate across a highway. Darton paused.|$|E
60|$|We are so {{brought up}} upon the Bible, {{we are so}} used to it long before we begin to think hard about it, that all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are really very {{striking}} about it, the facts {{that the history of}} Judah and Israel is told twice over and that the gospel narrative is repeated four times over for example, do not seem at all odd to us. How else, we ask, could you have it? Yet these are very odd features if we are to regard the Bible as the compactest and most perfect statement of essential truth and wisdom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gee!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "The <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{one reads}} about, eh, and only half believes. Who's the French Johnny who arrived last night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two and two make four," [...] said he; [...] "there {{is no need}} of any {{theory about}} that, and <b>that's</b> the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> suits me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} be much the same <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> they have {{published}} before. I can't understand why the Chronicle takes such an interest in Jimmy Crocker." ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{the keeper}} began to jump about {{just as the}} fox had done when it set its paw in the trap, {{shouting}} and saying all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> somehow I don't think I ought to repeat here. Round and round he went with the fox hanging to his hand, like hares do when they dance together, for he couldn't get it off anyhow. At last he tumbled down into a pool of mud and water, {{and when he got}} up again all wet through I saw that the fox was really dead. But it had died biting, and now I know that this pleased it very much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but I don't {{think he}} spoke lower than I do, mother, or {{than the rest}} of us. O mother!" [...] he went on, after a while, [...] "isn't he good? Just to think of his {{spending}} {{an hour and a half}} sitting here, showing me how to construe. Why, I see the whole thing in a different way now; he has made clear all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I could not understand; and he said he would come again too, and I am quite sure that when he says a thing he means to do it. I don't believe he could tell a lie if he tried. And is he not good-looking too?" ...|$|E
60|$|All <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{a man of}} twenty-eight {{would not}} dream of hiding from a coeval he had hidden from me. For some days I had to remain in his house, I {{had to go through}} his papers, handle all those {{intimate}} personal things that accumulate around a human being year by year--letters, yellowing scraps of newspaper, tokens, relics kept, accidental vestiges, significant litter. I learnt many things I had never dreamt of. At times I doubted whether I was not prying, whether I ought not to risk the loss of those necessary legal facts I sought, and burn these papers unread. There were love letters, and many such touching things.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Wonderful Wizard escaped in a balloon," [...] he continued. [...] "We don't {{know how}} to make a balloon, of course; but any <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, just {{a little}} ... what shall I say? ... a little touch of what-d'you-call-it {{and a bit of}} thingummy. You know the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing!</b> <b>That's</b> all it wants." ...|$|R
5000|$|In her autobiography, Stanford wrote: [...] "Madaming is the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{happens to}} you—like getting a {{battlefield}} commission or becoming {{the dean of}} women at Stanford University." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I CAN'T marry," [...] he said. [...] "The trouble {{has gone}} too far. I've lost my nerve in the {{presence}} of women. I don't like them any more. They come at one--done up in a lot of ridiculous clothes, and chattering about all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> don't matter...." [...] He surveyed his friend's thoughtful attitude. [...] "I'm getting to hate women, Benham. I'm beginning now to understand the bitterness of spinsters against men. I'm beginning to grasp the unkindliness of priests. The perpetual denial. To you, happily married, a woman is just a human being. You can talk to her, like her, you can even admire her calmly; you've got, you see, no grudge against her...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have none}} of us the least idea what will be required," [...] she said. [...] "It will be far better to pay {{somewhat}} higher prices for what we really do want out there than to cumber ourselves with all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> may be useless to us. We have already {{a considerable amount of}} baggage. There are our clothes, linen, and books, your father's two double-barrelled guns, which, by the way, I do not think he has ever used since we have been married. The only thing we had better get, as far as I see, will be four rifles, which no doubt we can buy cheap second-hand, and four revolvers.|$|E
6000|$|Turnbull made {{a humorous}} grimace; then he said: [...] "We {{seem to be}} talking {{in a kind of}} shorthand; but I won't pretend not to {{understand}} you. What you mean is this: that you learnt about all your saints and angels {{at the same time as}} you learnt about common morality, from the same people, in the same way. And you mean to say that if one may be disputed, so may the other. Well, let that pass for the moment. But let me ask you a question in turn. Did not this system of yours, which you swallowed whole, contain all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were merely local, the respect for the chief of your clan, or such things; the village ghost, the family feud, or what not? Did you not take in those things, too, along with your theology?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Frankly," [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "this {{adventure}} is altogether uncongenial to me. It is the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{has never happened}} in my life. This highway coupling--" ...|$|R
60|$|It was nothing--only the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{had been}} bothering {{him in the}} morning. And soon after, putting the high guard before the blazing fire, he stole downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Was {{there any}} {{tendency}} {{in all this}} imaginative stuff to concentrate? To group itself about a single figure, the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> Victorians would have called an ideal?" ...|$|R
