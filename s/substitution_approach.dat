From 1950 until Salazar's death, Portugal saw its GDP per capita increase {{at an annual}} average rate of 5.66 per cent. The rise of new technocrats in the early 1960s with a background in economics and technical-industrial expertise led to a new period of economic fostering, with Portugal as an attractive country for international investment. Industrial development and economic growth would continue throughout the 1960s. During Salazar's tenure, Portugal participated in {{the founding of the}} European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1961. In the early 1960s, Portugal also added its membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. This marked the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy. Portuguese foreign trade increased by 52 per cent in exports and 40 per cent in imports. The economic growth and levels of capital formation from 1960 to 1973 were characterised by an unparalleled robust annual growth rates of GDP (6.9 per cent), industrial production (9 per cent), private consumption (6.5 per cent) and gross fixed capital formation (7.8 per cent).|$|E

40|$|Expression in the {{majority}} of fra(10) (q 25) cases is either induced or enhanced by the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in the culture medium. BrdU is known to exert its effects on cells via two primary mechanisms: substitution-dependent and concentration-dependent. BrdU incorporation into DNA and BrdU concentration in the culture medium can be resolved as independent variables. The results of such experiments indicate that at three fixed levels of BrdU substitution, 100 -fold variation of BrdU concentration had little or no effect on fra(10) (q 25) expression. At a fixed BrdU concentration, the level of fra(10) (q 25) expression rises as a function of increased BrdU <b>substitution,</b> <b>approaching</b> 100 % expression at 100 % substitution. Thus, BrdU induction or enhancement of fra(10) (q 25) expression is clearly substitution-dependent. Iododeoxyuridine, another halogenated pyrimidine, has a similar effect. The critical time of incorporation is between 8 and 9 hrs before mitosis. After this time, removal of BrdU (and fluorodeoxyuridine [FdU]) from the culture medium followed by addition of deoxythymidine does not reverse the BrdU effect on fra(10) (q 25) expression...|$|R

Societal functions are fulfilled by socio-technical systems, which consist of a cluster of aligned elements, e. g. artefacts, knowledge, user practices and markets, regulation, cultural meaning, infrastructure, maintenance networks and supply networks. To understand how transitions from one socio-technical system to another come about, the article describes a conceptual multi-level perspective. The perspective is illustrated with a historical case study: the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles in the USA (1860 - 1930). The case study shows that technological <b>substitution</b> <b>approaches</b> to this transition are too simple, because they neglect the electric tram and bicycle, which acted as important stepping stones. The case study also corrects another mistake, namely that the gasoline car won by chance from steam and electric automobiles.

40|$|Recently, a lot {{of effort}} has been spent in the {{efficient}} computation of kriging predictors when observations are assimilated sequentially. In particular, kriging update formulae enabling significant computational savings were derived. Taking advantage of the previous kriging mean and variance computations helps avoiding a costly matrix inversion when adding one observation to the TeX already available ones. In addition to traditional update formulae taking into account a single new observation, Emery (2009) proposed formulae for the batch-sequential case, i. e. when TeX new observations are simultaneously assimilated. However, the kriging variance and covariance formulae given in Emery (2009) for the batch-sequential case are not correct. In this paper, we fix this issue and establish correct expressions for updated kriging variances and covariances when assimilating observations in parallel. An application in sequential conditional simulation finally shows that coupling update and residual <b>substitution</b> <b>approaches</b> may enable significant speed-ups.

Advances in sight restoration now utilize the other intact senses to provide information that is normally sensed visually through sensory substitution to replace missing visual information. Sensory substitution devices translate visual information from a sensor, such as a camera or ultrasound device, into a format that the auditory or tactile systems can detect and process, so the visually impaired can see through hearing or touch. Online control of action is essential for many daily tasks such as pointing, grasping and navigating, and adapting to a sensory substitution device successfully requires extensive learning.

40|$|Background: In {{observational}} studies, {{analyses of}} blood pressure (BP) typically require some correction {{for the use}} of antihypertensive medications by study participants. Different approaches to correcting for treatment have been compared, but the impact of pharmacogenetic interactions that influence the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments on estimates of genetic main effects has not been considered. This work demonstrates the potential influence of pharmacogenetic interactions in genetic analyses of BP. Methods: A simulation study is conducted to test the influence of pharmacogenetic interactions on approaches to the analysis of BP. Results from three plausible scenarios are presented. Results: Informative BP approaches (Fixed Treatment Effect, Non-parametric adjustment, Censored Normal Regression) perform well when there is no pharmacogenetic interaction, but yield biased estimates of the main effects of particular genetic variants when pharmacogenetic interactions exist. <b>Substitution</b> <b>approaches</b> (Binary Trait, Fixed Substitution, Random Substitution, Median Method) are unaffected by pharmacogenetic interactions, but consistently perform sub-optimally. Conclusions: We recommend that the Informative BP approaches remain the most appropriate methods to use in practice, but stress that caution is required in the interpretation of their results-especially when an interaction between treatment and a genetic variant of interest is suspected. We make some suggestions as to how to check for possible interactions and confirm the results from genetic analyses of BP, but warn that these should be reviewed when data on real pharmacogenetic interactions become available.
