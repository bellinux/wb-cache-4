5|$|Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler {{crabs and}} <b>shrimp,</b> among the {{mangroves}} also occupy a significant {{place in the}} local economy. While {{a large number of}} <b>shrimp</b> species inhabit the Senegambian area, a single family exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink <b>shrimp</b> (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. <b>Shrimp</b> collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed {{the extent to which the}} <b>shrimp</b> population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported <b>shrimp</b> and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of vacuum packaging on occurrence of melanosis and bio-chemical quality of sodium metabisulphite (30 g/kg) treated <b>shrimps,</b> {{in comparison with}} sulphite treated, air packed <b>shrimps</b> was studied. All these samples were stored in ice and were subjected for melanosis and biochemical quality evaluation at regular intervals. Treated <b>shrimps</b> packed in both vacuum and air package showed absence of melanosis throughout the storage. The biochemical quality of treated vacuum packed <b>shrimps</b> {{was better than the}} <b>shrimps</b> packed with normal air. Based on the results, it is observed that a combination of vacuum packaging and sulphite treatment significantly delays the occurrence of melanosis and keeps the quality of <b>shrimps</b> for longer periods in ice, compared to normal air packaging...|$|R
40|$|Experiments in {{freezing}} of cooked, {{peeled and}} unpeeled <b>shrimps</b> {{have been carried}} out in order to find out the effect of vacuum-packing and use of carbon dioxide gas in packing of the <b>shrimps</b> during storing at temperatures of - 25 ° and - 16 °C. <b>Shrimps</b> stored both in vacuum and in carbon dioxide gas maintained quality better than similar samples stored in air at the same temperature. Especially the vacuum-packed samples were definitely better than the others both in colour, taste and texture. The samples stored in carbon dioxide did not keep quite so well, and the samples of <b>shrimps</b> stored in air at the same temperature and in similar packing material were pronounced inferior to the others. Vacuum-packing is therefore considered to be preferable in freezing and storing of <b>shrimps.</b> With a satisfactory vacuum-tight packing it is found possible to store frozen <b>shrimps</b> longer and obtain a higher quality than now is common in commercial freezing of <b>shrimps.</b> The plastic bags used in the experiments were vacuum-tight and strong enough for the packing of peeled <b>shrimps,</b> but the bags were easily penetrated during the packing of unpeeled <b>shrimps.</b> A better method would probably be to freeze unpeeled <b>shrimps</b> in alginate. The experiments also confirmed that the storage temperature is very important in storing of <b>shrimps,</b> and in storing at a temperature of - 25 °C the quality was much better than at a temperature of - 16 °C...|$|R

5|$|The {{northern}} arm of {{the lake}} has a much higher salinity, {{to the point that}} the native brine <b>shrimp</b> cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine <b>shrimp</b> to survive, while water in the northern bay is too salty. The salinity of northern {{arm of the}} lake will likely drop as lower salinity from the southern arm of the lake flows into the northern arm. The brine <b>shrimp</b> harvesting industry could benefit from the causeway allowing a freer flow of water. There were concerns from the brine <b>shrimp</b> harvesting industry that the lake conditions in the southern arm of the lake were becoming too saline for the brine <b>shrimp</b> due to several years of lower precipitation in the lake's watershed. The precipitation in the watershed has been above normal for the current water year that begins its tracking October 1, 2016. This additional precipitation has allowed the levels of both arms of the lake to rise, and at least for the near future the conditions for a healthy brine <b>shrimp</b> population seem good.|$|E

Cumacea and Isopoda are both known from the Carboniferous, as are the first true mantis <b>shrimp.</b> In the Decapoda, prawns and polychelids appear in the Triassic, and <b>shrimp</b> and crabs appear in the Jurassic; however, the great radiation of crustaceans occurred in the Cretaceous, particularly in crabs, {{and may have been}} driven by the adaptive radiation of their main predators, bony fish.

40|$|Although the {{red colour}} of brine <b>shrimps</b> has {{previously}} been supposed {{to be associated with}} cestode parasitism, no evidence has been provided that red and transparent brine <b>shrimps</b> differ in their role for cestode circulation. We compared the cestode infections in 100 red and 100 transparent Artemia parthenogenetica collected from the Odiel salt pans in Spain. Seven cestode species were recorded in red, and only four of them were recorded in transparent brine <b>shrimps.</b> The red brine <b>shrimps</b> were more infected with cysticercoids than transparent individuals (prevalence, 87 vs 21 %; mean intensity, 1. 56 vs 1. 00; mean abundance, 1. 35 vs 0. 21).

40|$|High {{temperature}} (32 to 33 °C) {{has been}} shown to reduce mortality in white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) -infected <b>shrimps,</b> but the mechanism still remains unclear. Here we show that in WSSV-infected <b>shrimps</b> cultured at 32 °C, transcriptional levels of representative immediate-early, early, and late genes were initially higher than those at 25 °C. However, neither the IE 1 nor VP 28 protein was detected at 32 °C, suggesting that high temperature might inhibit WSSV protein synthesis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis revealed two proteins, NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and the proteasome alpha 4 subunit (proteasome α 4), that were markedly upregulated in WSSV-infected <b>shrimps</b> at 32 °C. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of members of the heat shock protein family also showed that hsp 70 was upregulated at 32 °C. When aldh, proteasome α 4, and hsp 70 were knocked down by double-stranded RNA interference and <b>shrimps</b> were challenged with WSSV, the aldh and hsp 70 knockdown <b>shrimps</b> became severely infected at 32 °C, while the proteasome α 4 knockdown <b>shrimps</b> remained uninfected.
