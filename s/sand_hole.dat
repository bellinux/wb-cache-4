40|$|Ostracods were {{obtained}} from two cores in the southern North Sea area: the <b>Sand</b> <b>Hole</b> and Swarte Bank Formations of Tappin (1991) in BGS borehole 81 / 52 A, cored from the Inner Silver Pit, southern North Sea, and a core from Shoeburyness in Essex, borehole S 1. The faunal assemblages in 131 - 181 / 52 A were dominated by Sarsicytheridea punctillata, Elo/sonella concinna and Acanthocvthereis clunelmnensis. The assemblages recovered reflect a transition from glacio-marine conditions in the Swarte Bank Formation up into a cold-temperate marine environment in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Hole</b> Formation with deteriorating temperatures indicated {{at the top of}} the interval studied. In BHSI a freshwater to brackish transition occurred in the core, the freshwater section being dominated by Darwinula slevensoni and llyocypris spp., and the brackish section by Cyprideis torosa and C ytheromor pha fiiscata. The palaeoecology of the ostracod assemblages recovered is compared to other palaeoecological data from the same sections in each core and to ostracod data from other Hoxnian/l lolsteinian sites in north western Europe. These data are also discussed in the light of evidence indicating that there was a barrier across the southern North Sea when the sediments examined were deposited. Sarsicytheridea spp. and (yprideis terosa were used for trace element (Mg: Ca, Sr: Ca) and stable isotope (cS'"O, ö' 3 C) analyses. A calibration equation for the calculation of temperature from Mg: Ca ratio was successfully established from analysis of modern Sarsicytheridea. Modern Sr: Ca data could not be used to establish a calibration for salinity since there was too much scatter in the data. (' prideis torosa has been used for trace element and stable isotope work by other authors who have published relationships between ('yprideis and the water chemistry. Ostracods were also analysed down core to examine the changing ratios of Mg and Sr as a proxy for temperature and salinity changes in the I-loxnian of the southern North Sea. In BH 81 / 52 A, Mg: Ca data indicated a deterioration in temperature from 36. 20 m to the top of the section studied of 9 °C. Oxygen stable isotopic analyses from the same species, measured through the same core intervals, did not exhibit a trend, but their values were indicative of normal marine salinities. Carbon stable isotope analyses, performed at the same time as the oxygen analyses, indicate that there may have been high productivity in the region of deposition of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Hole</b> Formation, implying deposition in a region of freshwater influence. However, C/N analyses indicated that the sediments in the Inner Silver Pit were deposited under fully marine conditions. In III ISI, both the Mg: Ca and Sr: Ca data suggested that salinity had increased upcore. Ilowever, there was a lot of scatter in the data, indicating that the estuarine environment, under which the palaeoecology suggests the sediments were deposited, was a highly fluctuating one. These data compare favourably with previously published records. Published partition coefficients were used to compare the trace element data obtained to mean river and seawater value...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a report of study on the casting defects occurable to cement-bonded and molasses-added mold, {{concerning}} to the permeability of mold and the pressure of gas from core in pouring process of cast iron and aluminum alloy. Results are obtained as follows: 1) Permeability of the testing sand after 24 hours' drying at room temperature shows 210 - 290. This figure means that the cement-bonded molds have good permeability. 2) The pressure of gas from core changes under influence of water and molasses. Higher gas pressure caused by higher water content tends to produce more gas-originated defects. 3) Improper decrease of water content tends to cause other type of casting defects, such as rough surface, <b>sand</b> <b>hole,</b> sand inclusion. So, a proper mixing ratio of additions should be selected to produce sound castings; for example, weight ratio of sand 100, cement 10, water 5 ～ 6, and molasses 3 ～ 4, for our experimental conditions, can be recommended...|$|E

We focus specifically on <b>sand</b> reservoirs in <b>Hole</b> Alaminos Canyon 21 A (AC 21 -A), Hole Green Canyon 955 H (GC 955 -H) and Hole Walker Ridge 313 H (WR 313 -H). Using a new logging-while-drilling directional resistivity tool and a one-dimensional inversion developed by Schlumberger, we resolve the resistivity of the current flowing parallel to the bedding, R‖ and the resistivity of the current flowing perpendicular to the bedding, R⊥. We find the <b>sand</b> reservoir in <b>Hole</b> AC 21 -A to be relatively isotropic, with R‖ and R⊥ values close to 2 Ω m. In contrast, the gas hydrate-bearing <b>sand</b> reservoirs in <b>Holes</b> GC 955 -H and WR 313 -H are highly anisotropic. In these reservoirs, R‖ is between 2 and 30 Ω m, and R⊥ is generally {{an order of magnitude}} higher.

The research program was limited in scope, focusing on causes of surface defects in castings products that are attributable to the bentonite-containing sand and the mould system. One of the potential roots of surface defects is heterogeneity of sand grains, containing lumped ball-shaped grains and irregular pellets with a layered-structure. The moisture contents of those lumped grains is different than the moisture level required in the process, besides these grains may contain various elements and metallic compounds which, when cast into moulds, may react with molten metals in an uncontrolled manner. As a result, surface defects are produced, such as surface blowholes, burst penetration, <b>sand</b> <b>holes,</b> slag inclusions, pinhole porosity.

In the present study the depth of scour hole is measured experimentally around a cylindrical pier due to different depth of flow.

The density of the sand placed around the pile can be correlated to the height from which it is dropped into the chamber.

The bladder is filled with a certain air pressure that will increase the stresses of the sand, which simulates deeper soils. Loads will then be applied by a hydraulic cylinder and the deflections measured until the pile fails. The amount of load applied to the cylinder will be measured by two methods, using a load cell and by multiplying the pressure applied to the cylinder by its area. Then, by knowing the area of the pile in contact with the soil and the load, the friction resistance of the piles can be calculated. So far, only preliminary test has been conducted.

A SLM system was designed and developed by ourselves, which is consisted of an Yb-fiber laser, an optical scanner, a powder coating device, a gas purification system and a control system, the process parameters were investigated systematically and optimized, finally fabricated removable partial denture frameworks with stainless steel and titanium materials successfully by using the SLM system under optimized parameters. The tests showed that the frameworks have an average dimension precision of ± 0. 172 mm. The wearing experiments on the plaster mouth molds demonstrated the removable partial denture frameworks fabricated by SLM can be fully applied to clinic after some post- processing procedures...|$|R
