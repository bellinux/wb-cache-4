5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>directed</b> at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E

25|$|Central Instrument, a key {{instrument}} {{that is a}} calculator that calculates how weapons <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>directed</b> to hit a target. The first key instruments developed in the early 1900s. Until the mid 1900s consisted of analogue mechanical calculators. Nowadays they consist of computers and used {{for all types of}} weapons systems. Anti-aircraft defense must quickly and accurately align the cannons and other artillery before introducing air defense computers (main instrument) and remote control. Flight speeds increased during World War II. This hampered the optical detection, recognition and tracking, but the fire control radar air defense could retain and expand their firepower. A fire-control system is a number of components working together, usually a gun data computer, a director, and radar, which is designed to assist a weapon system in hitting its target. It performs the same task as a human gunner firing a weapon, but attempts to do so faster and more accurately.|$|E

25|$|An {{article in}} the American journal for Economics has {{addressed}} the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth. The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy {{is the best way to}} make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>directed</b> to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruist movement.|$|E
25|$|In {{addressing}} {{the future of}} the medium, many researchers have argued for the improvement of the gaming industry to appeal to a more general gender-neutral audience and others have suggested that the appeal <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>directed</b> to females in particular. One of the earliest attempts to broaden the market to include females could be seen in Sega's use of the increased number of female protagonists in fighting games. Other examples of this include games like Mass Effect 3, Remember Me, and the Last of Us, which include a female option for the main character. The decision to use strong female characters in important roles, however, is often met with skepticism by marketers concerned with sales. Examination of IGN's Big Games at E3 2012 and Big Games at E3 2013 shows growth of the female protagonist in video games, rising 4% from 2012 to 2013. Other efforts outside of making games with female characters have also started to occur. One example is that Women in Games International has teamed up with the Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles {{in order to create a}} video game patch which the two organizations hope will encourage Girl Scouts to develop an interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. Activism and specifically female-targeted LAN parties in Scandinavia have helped boost female game playing.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} Monday, December 11, 1989, and lasted for seven days. The episode was {{directed}} by David Carson, who had only filmed one other Next Generation episode before [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise". Carson felt that his relative lack of experience helped {{because he had no}} preconceptions about how episodes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>directed.</b> Since much of the episode took place in the darker alternate universe, Carson wanted to emphasize the toll that decades of war had taken on the crew and the bridge. [...] "Picard really looked tired and worn and like a battle-weary commander, and that's what we wanted the bridge to look like—a battle weary bridge. I had lots of thoughts about making it as strong as possible using a lot of low lights, a lot of dark blues, making it very much more moody", he said. To heighten the impact of the physical set changes, Carson took a different approach to how he constructed shots. [...] "It was my intention to make it as much like a submarine as possible and to use low-angle lighting; basically, to do everything the opposite way that the Enterprise was normally shot." [...] The cameras were equipped with longer lenses than usual {{in order to reduce the}} depth of the scenes and provide a grittier feel. The use of low angles forced the lighting to be modified to prevent the scene from, in Carson's words, looking [...] "like a hotel lobby".|$|E

500|$|One of Walker's tasks was {{to rewrite}} the {{bombardment}} text. He felt it was flawed because it failed to drive home {{what he saw as}} the most important fact, that [...] "bombardment aviation is the basic arm of the air force". Following the views of air power theorists Billy Mitchell, Hugh Trenchard, and Giulio Douhet, Walker enunciated two fundamental principles: that bombardment would take the form of daylight precision bombing; and that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>directed</b> against critical industrial targets. In his article [...] "Driving Home the Bombardment Attack", published in the Coast Artillery Journal in October 1930, he argued that fighters could not prevent a bombing attack and that [...] "the most efficacious method of stopping a bombardment attack would appear to be an offensive against the bombardment airdrome." [...] The Bomber Mafia argued that bombers flew too high and too fast to be intercepted by fighters, that even if they were intercepted, the bombers had enough firepower to drive off their attackers, and enough armor and resilience to absorb any damage their attackers might attempt to inflict. The Air Corps Tactical School developed a doctrine that became known as industrial web theory, which called for precision attacks against carefully selected critical industrial targets. [...] Walker drove home his belief in bombardment with a famous dictum from his lectures: [...] "A well-organized, well-planned, and well-flown air force attack will constitute an offensive that can not be stopped." ...|$|E
