50|$|In 1990, California {{residents}} passed Propositions 108, 111 and 116. Combined, {{the three}} measures authorized the sale of nearly $3 billion in bonds {{for the creation of}} rail services across the state including commuter rail and intercity rail. With this new source of money, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) set out to specify a standardized railcar for the state that would be <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> operations across the state. The result of this effort were original designs for both intercity and commuter rail cars, optimized for California service within the volume defined by the Amtrak Superliner. While the commuter rail version was never built, the intercity version has become very successful.|$|E
5000|$|In 1853, {{the road}} which used the Old Tejon Pass was {{surveyed}} by Robert Stockton Williamson of the U.S. Army for suitability as a rail-bed for the planned transcontinental railroad into California. It was found wanting. The {{commander of the}} expedition particularly found the wagon road over the pass to be [...] "one of the worst" [...] he had ever seen. [...] He much preferred the Grapevine Canyon route, a much better road further west. Williamson scouted it and found {{it would be far}} more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> lines and wagons if the bulk of the traffic henceforth went that way. The name [...] "Tejon" [...] was transferred west to the [...] "Fort Tejon Pass," [...] {{an integral part of the}} Stockton - Los Angeles Road, which was established through Grapevine Canyon. From then on, the old pass was used less and less; and eventually lost its designation on official maps. Afterward, Fort Tejon was abandoned, and the [...] "Fort" [...] was eventually dropped from the pass' name, becoming simply, the Tejon Pass as it is known today.|$|E
5000|$|In 1919, the Westervelt Board {{described}} the ideal heavy gun for future development having a bore of 194mm to 8-inches, a projectile of about 200 lbs, {{and a range}} of 35,000 yards. More striking was that it be must be road transportable. At this time no other country had such a road transportable field gun. Low priority design work occurred until 1924. Serious development began in June 1940 of an 8-inch (203 mm) gun that would have a range of 33500 yd, a road speed of 25 mi/h km/h, be transported in 2 loads weighing no more than 44000 lb and be <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> movement. The gun used the same projectile as the 8 inch coastal gun and the US Navy's 8 inch cruiser gun. [...] Using the same carriage as the 240 mm howitzer M1 eased development, but the gun was very troublesome and wasn't standardized until January 1942. The main problems were excessive bore wear and poor accuracy, but it was felt that nothing better could be produced in a timely manner. Thus it entered production at a low rate and in small numbers. The gun tube was produced by Watervliet Arsenal and the recoil system was produced by Hannifin Manufacturing. Watertown Arsenal, Bucyrus-Erie, and the S. Morgan Smith Company manufactured the carriage. Only 139 weapon systems were produced before production ceased in 1945.|$|E
50|$|Capron {{suggested}} {{the construction of}} rails from Horonai to the port of Muroran, {{as part of a}} plan to ship the coal from there; meanwhile, Lyman's plan involved the construction of rails instead to Horomuibuto (today Ebetsu), and intended to use a system of river boats on the Ishikari River for shipping the coal to Otaru, where they could be transferred to a larger ship. The government decided Lyman's plan was cheaper, and in March 1878, they invited yet another American engineer, to begin land surveys in preparation for construction. Crawford quickly determined that much of the land, being swampy, was not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>rails,</b> stations, or other buildings, and that the river would freeze over in winter, rendering this shipping plan feasible for only around 150 days each year. His suggestion to extend the rail lines from Horomui Futoshi to Otaru, and to build rails straight to the piers, was approved by the Settlement Envoy, Kuroda Kiyotaka.|$|R

50|$|On completion, the CBT {{will be an}} {{important}} feeder in the south for the Gotthard Base Tunnel as the existing, proportionally steep track over Monte Ceneri is not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> or heavy freight trains.

50|$|Like its {{predecessor}} Class GB, the heavier Class GC {{was also a}} branch line locomotive and its maximum axle load of 11 lt 16 lcwt kg made it <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> light <b>rail.</b> It was a more powerful development of the Class GB and was {{very similar to the}} Class GK Garratts which had been acquired by the New Cape Central Railway (NCCR) in 1923, but 2 lt kg heavier and with 1 in smaller diameter cylinders with a 1 in longer stroke.|$|R
5000|$|The model 244 {{diesel engine}} {{used in the}} RSC-24 program saw their {{horsepower}} derated to [...] In {{order to make the}} locomotive <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> weight-restricted light <b>rail</b> branch lines, MLW built the locomotives using a switcher frame as a start, resulting in the [...] "squashed" [...] appearance of a road switcher. This was largely the result of a very short rear hood housing the electrical cabinet, whereas electrical cabinets were normally located in the long hood on most road switcher designs. In order to make the locomotive <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> weight-restricted light <b>rail</b> branch lines, MLW spread the weight over the rail surface using A1A-A1A trucks (2 powered axles, 1 unpowered axle) which were manufactured by Dominion Foundries and Steel (DOFASCO); this same truck was also adopted for the MLW RSC-13. This resulted in less traction, hence the need to de-rate the engine horsepower to avoid wheel slippage.|$|R

5000|$|In 1937, the South African Railways (SAR) placed one [...] Class 21 steam {{locomotive}} with a Texas wheel arrangement in service, {{designed as a}} mixed traffic locomotive <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> light <b>rail.</b> It was designed by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, and built by the North British Locomotive Company in Glasgow. Only the one locomotive was built, at the time representing the maximum power obtainable on Cape gauge from a ten-coupled non-articulated locomotive that was limited to a 15 LT axle load on [...] rail. To enable it to negotiate tight curves, {{the third and fourth}} sets of coupled wheels were flangeless.|$|R
50|$|Watson disliked {{articulated}} locomotives and his aim was {{to develop}} a powerful non-articulated mixed traffic branch line locomotive with an axle load <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> light <b>rail.</b> To enable it to negotiate tight curves of 300 ft radius, the third and fourth coupled wheelsets were flangeless. In addition, a total side play of 1+3/4 in was provided on the leading coupled wheels and spherical bearings were fitted to the leading coupling rods. Its 5 in bar frames extended from the front to the hind buffer beams and were stayed by cross stretchers of a light fabricated construction. It used a Watson Standard no. 3B boiler, the same as that used in the Classes 15E, 15F and 23.|$|R
40|$|A gouging {{phenomenon}} with a hypervelocity sliding {{electrical contact}} in railgun not only shortens the rail lifetime but also affects the interior ballistic performance. In this paper, a 3 -D numerical model {{was introduced to}} simulate and analyze the generation mechanism and evolution of the rail gouging phenomenon. The results show that a rail surface bulge {{is an important factor}} to induce gouging. High density and high pressure material flow on the contact surface, obliquely extruded into the rail when accelerating the armature to a high velocity, can produce gouging. Both controlling the bulge size to a certain range and selecting <b>suitable</b> materials <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> surface coating will suppress the formation of gouging. The numerical simulation had a good agreement with experiments, which validated the computing model and methodology are reliable...|$|R
50|$|In 2008 the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) {{purchased}} 14 Comet IB coaches from New Jersey Transit for $75,000 per car {{to relieve}} overcrowding {{on the popular}} San Joaquin route.

30|$|The {{technology}} of continuously welded rails (CWRs) {{is important in}} modern railway track structures. To measure rail stress, resistance strain gauges are preferred due to their good stability, sensitivity, and resistance to external interference. Based on the bi-directional strain method, we present a new method <b>for</b> measuring longitudinal <b>rail</b> stress using resistance strain gauges and develop a monitoring device <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> stress to realize long-term and multi-point measurement. Also relevant experimental verification and analysis are conducted. Results indicate that under various constraints the rail stress–strain values can be calculated just with the measured total longitudinal strain and total vertical strain. Considering the measurement error caused by sectional feature of sensors, we put forward a correction equation applicable to different stress conditions. Although the temperature values of the four full-bridge stress gauges can offset each other, the measurement error caused by rail flexural strain can also be eliminated {{to a certain extent}} at the same time, the non-uniform distribution of rail cross section temperature and unbalanced flexural strain still affect the measurement error. The experimental results also show that the developed rail-stress-monitoring sensor is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> measuring <b>rail</b> stress with reliable working performance.|$|R

40|$|Although snakes {{are both}} predators and prey of {{birds in the}} Rallidae family {{in other parts of}} the world, there are few {{documented}} observations of interactions between these groups in Australia. Here we describe four separate observations of Buff-banded Rails Gallirallus philippensis following snakes in a deliberate manner. Because of the large size of the different snake species encountered by the Buff- banded Rails during our observations, we consider that it is unlikely that the snakes were viewed as potential prey. The behaviours observed in our accounts, and of flufftails Sarothrura spp. in Africa, suggest that rails are aware of the predatory threat of snakes, and follow them to ensure that they move outside the rails’ area of concern. We suggest that this behaviour is likely to be a deliberate response to encountering a potential (or perceived) terrestrial predator, such as a snake, or that the snake’s movements potentially flush prey <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> Buff-banded <b>Rails...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Cast iron used in rails proved {{unsatisfactory}} {{because it}} was brittle and broke under heavy loads. The wrought iron invented by John Birkinshaw in 1820 replaced cast iron. Wrought iron (usually simply referred to as [...] "iron") was a ductile material that could undergo considerable deformation before breaking, making it more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> iron <b>rails.</b> But iron was expensive to produce until Henry Cort patented the puddling process in 1784. In 1783 Cort also patented the rolling process, which was 15 times faster at consolidating and shaping iron than hammering. These processes greatly lowered the cost of producing iron and rails. The next important development in iron production was hot blast developed by James Beaumont Neilson (patented 1828), which considerably reduced the amount of coke (fuel) or charcoal needed to produce pig iron. Wrought iron was a soft material that contained included slag or dross. The softness and dross tended to make iron rails distort and delaminate and they lasted less than 10 years. Sometimes they lasted as little as one year under high traffic. All these developments {{in the production of}} iron eventually led to replacement of composite wood/iron rails with superior all iron rails.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study on constructing a tunable secondary suspension for high-speed trains using magneto-rheological fluid dampers (referred to as MR dampers hereafter), {{in the interest}} of improving lateral ride comfort. Two types of MR dampers (type-A and type-B) with different control ranges are designed and fabricated. The developed dampers are incorporated into a secondary suspension of a full-scale high-speed train carriage for rolling-vibration tests. The integrated rail vehicle runs at a series of speeds from 40 to 380 km/h and with different current inputs to the MR dampers. The dynamic performance of the two suspension systems and the ride comfort rating of the rail vehicle are evaluated using the accelerations measured during the tests. In this way, the effectiveness of the developed MR dampers for attenuating vibration is assessed. The type-A MR dampers function like a stiffness component, rather than an energy dissipative device, during the tests with different running speeds. While, the type-B MR dampers exhibit significant damping and high current input to the dampers may adversely affect the ride comfort. As part of an ongoing investigation on devising an effective MR secondary suspension for lateral vibration suppression, this preliminary study provides an insight into dynamic behavior of high-speed train secondary suspensions and unique full-scale experimental data for optimal design of MR dampers <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> applications.
