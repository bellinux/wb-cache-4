5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at <b>some</b> <b>not</b> too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, {{it would be hard to}} maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, in the last year of his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with <b>some</b> <b>not</b> recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal manipulation based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of {{hundreds of billions of}} US dollars per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and <b>some</b> <b>not.</b> These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E
