40|$|I do {{not know}} where to begin thanking the people involved. My Ph. D. study and this {{dissertation}} would not have been successful without the guidance, encouragement and love from the following people: My advisor, Dr. Barry Boehm: He is the best advisor I have ever known. He has never told me exactly what I had to do. Instead he gave me advice to point me in the right direction. His guidance is invaluable. He still looks after me after my graduation. Prof. Robert Neches: His advice from his system engineer and philosophy standpoints made the dissertation even more complete. Prof. Steve Jacobs: He is the one who gave me the opportunity to continue my Ph. D study. He is not only my teacher, my boss and part of my PhD committee, but he is also my wonderful friend. The students in his class called him the “Professor with Heart ” because he has the strong intention to see the students succeed. Prof. Bert Steece: Thank you for the advice on statistics. Winsor Brown: Thank you for seeding the idea of this dissertation in my brain. Office –mate: Alex Lam, Jesal Bhuta, Apuva Jain, thank you for advice and suggestions on my presentation. CSSE Friends: Ye Yang, Supannika Koolmanojwong, Yue Chen, Gustavo Perez, Steve Meyers, Di Wu, thank you for your support. ii All people who participated in my experiments: This research could not have published without them. My family and friends in Thailand: Even though, they are living thousands of miles from LA, I can always feel their love, their understanding and their support. My Boyfriend, Jessy Lu and his family: Thank you for giving me a home, comfort and love when I am apart from my family. Without all of you, I could not call LA as my home. Last but not least, USC: The place where I <b>strengthen</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> experience. The place where I met all the wonderful professors and friends...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{highlights}} {{the contribution of}} the academic teaching which I have received at the University of London within the MA in Understanding and Securing of Human Rights in 2002 – 3. The course content and its themes have contributed to <b>strengthening</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> skills for the human rights field, which have enabled me to have better opportunities to contribute to human rights protection and promotion. Throughout the last years, I have worked extensively to transfer the knowledge gained into projects and practical programmes in the field of human rights, namely, capacity building through Technical Cooperation Programmes (TCPs). 1 In this chapter, I will use three examples to show the contribution of TCPs in building <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> skills to promote and protect human rights. The first example will focus on TCPs during conflict and insecurity; the second will show building skills during transition; and the third will show the country specific programme during stability...|$|R
40|$|Transnational higher {{education}} (TNE) involves the offering overseas of ‘home university’ award courses by, or with, overseas partners, or directly through an overseas {{branch of the}} university. TNE is growing in significance {{in the context of}} the internationalisation of {{higher education}} and the increasing mobility of information and people in a more globalised world. TNE has become an important and distinctive avenue of access for many students. However, TNE is a complex and demanding activity for institutional managers. The context for the study is the relative paucity of research on the management of TNE, compared with the teaching-learning area, coupled with my own professional interest in understanding and improving TNE management. The study involved a thematic analysis of documentary sources in the form of institutional audit reports by the Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA). The specific objectives were to identify and analyse the patterns and themes in AUQA’s concerns and commendations, in order to draw out the implications for improving the development and management of TNE. Finally, using a strategic management perspective, the main challenges confronting senior institutional managers in TNE initiatives were examined. A total of 204 concerns and 31 commendations were identified by a systematic review of TNE management in 27 university audit reports. The concerns and commendations were categorised using a structured, 6 -dimensional analytical framework to produce a comprehensive overview of management issues in TNE. Almost half the concerns and commendations related to institutional strategy and management, with significant numbers also relating to governance and quality assurance. In relation to the 235 concerns and commendations, 21 themes, or areas of recurring concern, were identified. Major themes included weaknesses in academic and corporate governance processes, alignment of TNE initiatives with overall university strategy, and senior management oversight. For each theme, implications for improving management practice were developed by drawing on relevant literature and my own professional experience. Adopting a strategic management perspective suggested that the 21 themes could be grouped meaningfully into 3 clusters relating to: Integrating the TNE venture into institutional structure and processes; Determining the nature and form of the TNE partnership and associated contract; and Managing and sustaining the TNE initiative. A model was developed to illustrate the interrelationship between the 3 clusters and the role of strategic leadership. The study contributes to developing a deeper and more systematic understanding of the nature of TNE and the sources for concerns that arise from its inherent complexity and risk. The study also extends the broad knowledge base for consultants, institutional managers, practising academics and quality assurance and accreditation agencies in Australia and other countries. Finally, the study contributes to <b>strengthening</b> <b>my</b> own professional <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice as a consultant to Australian and overseas universities and private higher education institutions who are developing TNE programs...|$|R
