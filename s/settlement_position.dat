40|$|The Ebla tell {{structure}} can {{be considered}} as an unicum comparing to other Near Eastern sites: actually its topographic construction points out the location of the decisional centre, the Acropolis, and the defensive perimeter of the wall delimiting the Lower City, in a striking and monumental way. As a strong continuity is attested by the same <b>settlement</b> <b>position</b> - in both main phases (Early Bronze IV A-B and Middle Bronze I-II) - and that continuity seems not have been determined just by functional aims, this contribution would detect some ideological and cultural elements that influenced the space organisation. In other words, the hypothesis is that the unconscious reaction to the contrast between the ordered urban territory - immediately known in its spatial limits - and everything out of it - unlimited and unknown - caused some of the peculiar classification forms, archeologically understandable through the administrative expressions of the royal power...|$|E
50|$|The name Podreber {{is derived}} from a prepositional phrase in which the noun has lost its case ending: pod 'below' + reber 'slope'. The name {{therefore}} means 'below the slope' and refers to the <b>settlement's</b> <b>position</b> on the south slope of Kucelj Hill.|$|R

40|$|Limited {{discovery}} {{is one of}} the regularly cited advantages of international arbitration, as opposed to international litigation, particularly in contrast to litigation in the US. courts. Recent decisions by US. courts, however, have threatened to upend this comparative advantage. Invoking a little known US. law, 28 U. S. C. section 1782, these courts have permitted parties in an arbitration to petition for subpoenas issued by US. courts against their adversaries or third parties. Bucking the trend in the academic literature, which largely supports this development, this article opposes reading section 1782 to authorize subpoenas in support of an arbitration. Not only does this undermine the sensible limits on discovery in arbitration, it risks undermining the entire arbitral process by creating an asymmetrical tactical device that systematically disfavors US. companies:foreign parties can use section 1782 petitions as a tool both to extract information from their US. adversaries and to bolster their <b>settlement</b> <b>position.</b> To avoid these deleterious results, section 1782 should be interpreted not to encompass international arbitral tribinals...|$|E
40|$|The bryozoan Electra posidoniae Gautier {{is found}} {{solely on the}} leaves of the Neptune grass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, {{dominating}} the leaf epifauna of this seagrass. Epiphytes of marine angiosperms (or seagrasses) often {{play an important role in}} ecosystem functioning, for example as food web suppliers. As dysfunction of epiphytic compartment is often implied in human-induced seagrass decline, it is important to understand the dynamics and life traits of this community in pristine areas. This study involved the monthly assessment of colonization dynamics, biomass seasonality and diet composition through stable isotopes measurements of E. posidoniae at a depth of 10 m in the Revellata Bay (Corsica, Mediterranean Sea). Ancestrulae (i. e. colony founders) appeared towards the end of winter and were very selective in their <b>settlement</b> <b>position</b> along the P. oceanica leaves. A maximum of 100, 000 colonies per square meter was recorded. E. posidoniae colonies dominated the epiphytic community biomass in early spring, and were over-covered by epiphytic algae in June. Food shortage could be also involved in this decrease. Although stable isotope ratios of C, N and S showed that this suspension feeder mainly relies on the water column productivity for its food, other food sources such as re-suspended epiphytic diatoms could be important in late spring (i. e. after the phytoplanktonic bloom). Additionally, a contribution of seagrass phytodetritus to the diet of this species cannot be excluded. The species was almost absent in winter, raising the question of its recruitment in spring. This study confirms the quantitative importance of this species in the seagrass meadow and explores its role in the relationship between the water column and this seagrass ecosystem.

40|$|International {{sales of}} commodities, often involve {{large sums of}} money and large {{shipments}} of goods. The CIF contract has been chosen as subject for my analysis on the ground that it is the contract most commonly used in international commodity sales. Commonly, the original contracting parties are only part of string sales, the tendered documents will have to be passed down the string until they reach the final buyer. Because commodity markets are subject to drastic fluctuations, the contracts that take place in them are likely to be time sensitive in regards to the tendering and passing on of the notices and documents, these time limits must be strictly complied with it. Furthermore, because of the short time within which these documents must be considered and passed on, it is obviously important that the buyer should be able to determine his termination rights immediately after he becomes aware of any non-conformity disclosed in the documents. This important commercial decision whether to refuse the tender of non-conforming documents should not be complicated by asking the buyer to consider what the likely effect of any loss will be. The existence of predictable termination rights allow the buyer and seller to know exactly where they stand when such breach has occurred and will avoid timely and costly litigations. Termination {{is one of the most}} practically effective remedies in the context of international documentary sales of commodities. It can be considered as nearly eternal legal problem for the parties in the context of the commodities sales. It has a reappearing tendency on the agenda of sales lawyers, banks and insurance companies. Also, the commodities traders are very much interested in accurate assessment of their negotiating and <b>settlement</b> <b>position.</b> This question will be addressed under two major legal sources, i. e. English law and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 1980 (hereinafter CISG or the Convention) because of their significance in the international trade law. The debate about what law is best for dealing international commodities and documentary trade often centers on the comparison of the English law and the CISG. The thesis should be therefore considered as an attempt to contribute to this debate further by examining the right of termination within the documentary and commodities trade...|$|E

40|$|The {{shipping}} market {{is characterized by}} high fluctuation range and obvious periodicity, which affects not only the fleet planning of shipowners but also the charterers ability to meet their obligations. When the market falls substantially, the charterer {{might not be able}} to meet hire payments out of earnings on the employment of the vessel. Often the charterer will write to the owner, seeking reduction in agreed rates. The shipowner may in turn persist on the fulfillment of the original contract. The charterer may respond by attempting to negotiate a lower rate in exchange for a longer duration, etc. If the worst comes to the worst, the charterer may redeliver the vessel early, in breach of contract. Another scenario is a ”plain” premature redelivery of the vessel, without connection to a market downturn, i. e. one month prior to the expiry of the charterparty. In both situations, the shipowner and the charterer will be interested in grasping their legal position – what are the legal consequences of such repudiation and what rights and obligations does such breach confer on them. The question of primary concern is whether the shipowner has the right to reject the charterer´s repudiation and affirm the contract. If the answer is negative, the shipowner is obliged to take the possession of the ship and his only remedy will be a claim for damages with the corresponding duty to mitigate. In practice, a considerable level of uncertainty, in respect of the shipowner´s right to affirm the contract, has led to a prevalent policy of accepting repudiation with a consequent claim for damages, even in situations where the charterer was not insolvent. That way, owners avoid potential significant losses which could arise should the shipowner wrongly interpreted his legal position, affirmed and performed the contract, and subsequently learned from arbitrator´s/court´s decision that he was only entitled to a claim in damages. Early delivery can be considered as a nearly eternal problem in the context of the charter-party relationship. It has a reappearing tendency on the agenda of maritime lawyers, defence clubs and defence departments of P&I clubs. Also, shipowners and charterers are very much interested in the accurate assessment of their negotiating and <b>settlement</b> <b>position.</b> Even though, the right of affirmation within a charterparty relationship was in England and internationally subject to a considerable interest during the years, there was to my knowledge no publication specifically devoted to a systematic research of the topic. The thesis should be therefore considered as an attempt to fill this gap...|$|E

40|$|Well {{known in}} Australian history are the arrivals of Greeks. Less {{acknowledged}} are the attempts of Greeks {{to define themselves}} within {{the contours of the}} Australian nation and the implications of such endeavours. In 1898, a group of “Greek Gypsies” arrived in South Australia. Coincidentally their arrival coincided with the establishment of the Greek community of Melbourne and the emergent politics of Australian nationbuilding. As a group of semi-nomadic, questionably “Greek” migrants they were treated in contradictory ways. They received charitable assistance from some settlers while others — predominantly immigration restrictionists and the Greek-Melbournians — regarded them as a burden to colonial progress. How and why the Greek community of Melbourne chose to discredit these people was linked to the colonial ideal of respectability, which fostered the social traits of independence and permanent <b>settlement.</b> <b>Positioning</b> themselves within the attainable confines of respectability vindicated the Greeks of Melbourne as valued settlers...|$|R
