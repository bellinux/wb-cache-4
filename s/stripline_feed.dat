These satellite systems require low-profile, high gain, light weight and low cost antennas for communications to and from Earth {{as well as for}} inter-satellite links (ISL). At higher mm-wave frequencies, the conductor loss of conventional microstrip line is high and consequently the feed network loss of patch antenna arrays is also high.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (M. S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2017. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 107 - 111). Point-to-point (P 2 P) communication is utilized where each communication node knows the physical or electrical {{positions of the}} other. In this type of communication, only two nodes transmit/receive message between each other and no other node is included in this process. P 2 P communication o ers some advantages such as lower power consumption, better information safety, lower vulnerablity to jamming and better channel capacity usage. With these properties, it is preferred frequently in military. Directional antennas with high gain and low side lobe level (SLL) are desired for P 2 P communication {{in order to achieve}} higher e ective communication distance, lower power consumption and to decrease the interference between channels, respectively. Another requirement is caused by Multiple-Input-Multiple- Output capability, which is a technique to use dual or circularly polarized transreceiver antennas instead of using separate transmitter and receiver antennas in the system. For dual-polarized MIMO antennas, high cross polarization isolation values are desired to separate the transmitting and receiving channels in order to prevent them e ecting each other. In this study, a C-band dual-polarized strip-fed aperture coupled stacked patch antenna array for P 2 P communication is designed. To satsify the requirements of P 2 P communication, the re ection coe cient of the designed antenna is - 10 dB. The gain is 20 dB and SLL is better than - 15 dB in the cardinal and intercardinal planes of the antenna for both polarizations. Additionally, 40 dB cross polarization isolation can be achieved. The idea is based on planar array of strip-fed dual-polarized aperture coupled patch antennas with <b>stripline</b> <b>feed</b> networks. By adjusting the amplitude distribution on the feed network, - 15 dB SLL in both cardinal and intercardinal planes is achieved for both polarizations. In order to block the coupling between feed networks for di erent polarizations and prevent distortion on amplitude and phase distributions, <b>stripline</b> <b>feed</b> networks are chosen. In this way, cross polarization isolation can be increased as well. Hence, a novel antenna element, dual-polarized strip-fed aperture coupled stacked patch antenna is proposed. The parameters that a ect the impedance behaviour of this type of antenna are investigated and examined in detail. Required feed networks to achieve - 15 dB SLL in cardinal and intercardinal planes are designed. The proposed antenna elements are placed in array sturucture, connected to feed networks and the resulted antenna array is optimized and analyzed. by Caner Asbaş. M. S...|$|E
40|$|The Archimedean spiral antenna is {{well-known}} for its broadband characteristics with circular polarization {{and has been}} investigated for several decades. Since their development in the late 1950 's, establishing an analytical expression for the characteristics of spiral antenna has remained somewhat elusive. This has been studied qualitatively and evaluated using numerical and experimental techniques with some success, {{but many of these}} methods are not convenient in the design process since they do not impart any physical insight into the effect each design parameter has on the overall operation of the spiral antenna. This work examines the operation of spiral antennas and obtains a closed-form analytical solution by conformal mapping and transmission line model with high precision in a wide frequency band. Based on the analysis of spiral antenna, we propose two novel design processes for the stripline-fed Archimedean spiral antenna. This includes a <b>stripline</b> <b>feed</b> network integrated into one of the spiral arms and a broadband tapered impedance transformer that is conformal to the spiral topology for impedance matching the nominally-high input impedance of the spiral.

The measured impedance bandwidth, radiation patterns and gain of the proposed MSR integrated antenna are compared with the obtained results from numerical simulation, and a good compliance can be observed between them. The investigation shows that utilization of MSR structure has significantly broadened the - 10 dB impedance bandwidth than the conventional patch antenna: from 540 to 632 MHz (17), 467 to 606 MHz (29) and 758 MHz to 1062 MHz (40) for three distinct operating bands centered at 0. 9, 3. 5 and 5. 5 GHz.

A moment method analysis is developed to analyze these arrays. Many previously unknown results pertaining to their radiation and polarization characteristics are presented. With two orthogonally polarized elements, virtually any arbitrary polarization of wave can be transmitted provided (1) amplitude and phase control is used and (2) neither antenna is blind at the operating frequency and scan angle.

Horizontal and vertical polarization can be generated as well if the amplifiers are switched on and off. ^ A new class of resonance was discovered for the dual-polarized array.

40|$|In {{choosing}} an antenna topology for ultra wideband (UWB) design, several factors {{must be taken}} into account including physical profile, compatibility, impedance bandwidth, radiation efficiency, and radiation pattern. The main challenge in UWB antenna design is achieving the very broad bandwidth with high radiation efficiency and small in size. Accordingly, many techniques to broaden the impedance bandwidth of small antennas and to optimize the characteristics of broadband antennas have been widely investigated in many published papers as listed in references. Some examples of the techniques used to improve the impedance bandwidth of the planar monopole antenna include the use of beveling technique (Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006), (Giuseppe R. & Max J. Ammann, 2006), (M. C. Fabres(a) et al., 2005), semi-circular base (X. N. Qiu et al., 2005), cutting notches at bottom (Seok H. Choi, et al., 2004), (H. Ghannoum et al., 2006), an offset feeding (Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006), (Giuseppe R. & Max J. Ammann, 2006), (M. J. Ammann & Z. N. Chen, 2004), a shorting pin (Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006), (E. Lee et al., 1999), and a dual/triple feed (Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006), (S. Boris et al., 2005), (K. L. Wong et al., 2005), (H. Ghannoum et al., 2006), (E. Antonio-Daviu et al., 2003), magnetic coupling (N. Behdad & K.

The radiators may be slotted to improve the impedance matching, especially at higher frequency(Z. N. Chen(a) et al., 2006),(Z. N. Chen(b) et al., 2006).

40|$|Accurate now-casting and {{forecasting}} {{could prevent}} losses and reduce risks caused by severe weather. Key observation {{to improve our}} knowledge of the weather is the ocean vector wind. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is embarking on an ambiguous but needed effort to launch a new satellite-based instrument called the Dual Frequency Scatterometer (DFS) that will provide accurate global mapping of the ocean vector wind in a timely manner. The Advanced Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (AWRAP) can play a pivotal role for this mission by providing critical measurements to improve the geophysical model function that DFS will relay on to estimate the winds. AWRAP requires a novel antenna to collect dual-polarized, dual-wavelength measurements. This work develops a subarray for the AWRAP antenna that will enable it acquire the necessary measurements from the NOAA WP- 3 D aircraft. By sharing the aperture for both C (5. 3 GHz) and Ku (13. 8 GHz) bands, this antenna array utilizes the given circular area as efficiently as possible. In both bands, the array is capable of forming and scanning a narrow beam in the x-z plane in the range 40 °- 60 ° o normal within 10 % of frequency bandwidth, for both vertical and horizontal polarizations. Each subarray consists of nine dual-polarized Ku-band microstrip patch antennas and two perpendicular C-band slot antennas, sharing the aperture. Microstrip patches and their <b>stripline</b> <b>feed</b> networks are integrated into an 8 -layer printed circuit board (PCB) and the slots are formed on an aluminum plate under the PCB. The PCB covers the slots, but they can radiate through the openings in the ground planes of the PCB. The C-band slots are positioned between Ku-band patches every third patch spacing. In total, four separate feed networks are required to drive the antenna elements in two bands for two polarizations. In order to achieve lower loss and higher antenna efficiencies in a small space, several transmission line technologies (namely, rectangular waveguides, suspended striplines and striplines) are used to deliver the power to the antenna elements. In order to pass the signal between different media, a broad-band perpendicular E-plane waveguide-to-suspended stripline transition is designed and fabricated in Ku band. A frequency bandwidth of 12 % and an insertion loss as low as 0. 09 dB are achieved in measurement. Measured input return loss of the Ku-subarray is more than 9 dB in the entire frequency bandwidth and realized gains are better than 10 dBi. Cross-polarization levels are less than - 20 dB in the lower frequencies. However, in the higher frequencies, cross-polarization levels increase to - 15 dB. It is proposed to use mirrored feed technique to improve cross-polarization levels of the array. For the C-subarray, measured input return loss is better than 12 dB in the entire frequency bandwidth.

30|$|In both scenarios, the {{backscattering}} {{signals from}} an UWB antenna were {{measured in the}} frequency domain {{by means of a}} vector network analyzer in the 2 - 12 GHz band with steps of 5 MHz. Two Horn Lindgren 3117 antennas were employed as reference antennas. They were placed in a quasi-monostatic configuration, separated by 18 cm, guaranteeing a high isolation between the transmit and receive channels as shown in Figure 2. Two kinds of UWB scattering antennas were tested, namely, a balanced antipodal Vivaldi (BAV) and a monopole dual <b>feed</b> <b>stripline</b> (DFMS) antennas [36]. In particular, the DFMS is a small planar antenna of dimensions 40 × 24 × 3 mm 3 characterized by moderately directional and non-dispersive properties, which make it quite suitable for RFID tags [37]. Three different load conditions (open-circuit, short-circuit, and matched) and several antenna orientations were considered. Inside the anechoic chamber, the antenna under test was placed on a 3 D positioner at distance dref = 1.46 m (DFMS) and dref = 1.44 m (BAV) from the reference antennas dressed with absorbers to create a quasifree-space condition. The laboratory environment consisted of a room of dimension 5.13 × 4.49 m 2, where a rectangular grid of nine points as shown in Figure 2, spaced out of about 1 m in depth and 70 cm in width, was defined. The tag DFMS antenna was positioned alternatively in each point on a vertical support still dressed with absorbers. For both cases, a simple data post-processing was performed to obtain the antenna backscattering response from the measured parameter S 21 = H(f; dref, X, Θ). The collected data were first windowed in the frequency domain to avoid ringing effect. Then, applying the inverse Fourier transform, the signal in the time domain was derived. In the post-processing phase, the transmitted pulse has been chosen to obtain a transmitted signal compliant with the 3.1 - 10.6 GHz FCC mask. Specifically, the 6 th derivative Gaussian monocycle has been considered [15].|$|R
