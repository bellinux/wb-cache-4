40|$|Introduction: Leksel Gamma Knife® (LGK) {{radiosurgery}} is a {{safe and}} efficient therapeutic approach for vestibular schwannoma (VS) with low side effects. The goal of radiosurgery is not necessarily to cause significant tumour necrosis or to obtain a complete radiographic response, but to halt the tumour's growth permanently through its biological elimination. The 2 major aims of radiosurgery for VS are long-term tumour control and functional hearing preservation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to report our experience with LGK radiosurgery in the management of VS and to evaluate the hearing preservation rate after a minimum one-year follow-up. Material and methods: Between January 2000 and January 2011, 415 patients with unilateral VS underwent LGK radiosurgery at the University Erasmus Hospital of Brussels. There were 349 patients with previously untreated VS (86 grade I, 96 grade II, 141 grade III, 9 grade IVa, 17 unknown grades, according to Koos) and 66 patients with post-operative residual tumour. All patients in our series underwent evaluation with high resolution neurodiagnostic imaging including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical evaluation as well as audiological tests that included tonal and <b>speech</b> <b>audiometries.</b> The Gardner Robertson (GR) classification is used to report the results of this study. We identified 276 patients treated for VS with LGK, tested and retested with <b>speech</b> and tonal <b>audiometries</b> by the same team, and followed for a minimum of one year. Results: Before LGK, 144 patients had serviceable (85 GR class I and 59 GR class II) hearing; 95 (65. 97 %) of these patients had preservation of serviceable hearing (Pure tone average ≤ 50 db and Speech discrimination 2 : 50 %) at minimum one-year audiological follow-up. It was observed that 44 of the 85 GR class I patients (51. 76 %) maintained their level of audition and 66 of these (74. 64 %) preserved serviceable hearing. In the 34 patients with preradiosurgery non-serviceable hearing (GR class III-IV) 25 of these patients (73. 52 %) maintained their hearing. The tumour was stable or declining in size in 90. 44 % of cases. Conclusion: LGK radiosurgery provides excellent tumour control in vestibular schwannomas and has low toxicity even after long-term follow-up. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to use <b>Speech</b> Pattern <b>Audiometry</b> (SPA) to compare phoneme {{perception}} performance between SPEAK and ACE processing strategies with children using the Nucleus 24 cochlear implant. Listeners were evaluated in terms of ability to identify two synthetic word pairs, one signalling a voicing contrast and the other signalling a place of articulation contrast. For both word pairs, ACE was associated with more normal phoneme boundaries than SPEAK. There was also a non-significant trend for better identification ability with ACE compared to SPEAK. The study suggests that there may be a place for SPA as part of the clinical battery of tests used for evaluation of cochlear implant speech processing strategies in children...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The paper {{presents}} {{historical data}} on development of audiology {{as a medical}} specialty. It gives the chronological overview {{of the most significant}} discoveries which have contributed to the progress and constant development of the science of hearing. The insights and discoveries encompass the ancient, medieval and contemporary medical science. The term "audiology" and first associations of audiologists The paper reviews the origin of the term “audiology” and the time of its occurrence. The First World Congress of Audiologists was held in 1948, and the Conference of Audiologists and Phoniatrists of Yugoslavia was established in 1974. Historical overview The ancient scientists and philosophers mentioned in the paper are as follows: Democritus, Hippocrates, Empedocles, Plato, Aristotle, and Galenus. Discoveries of Vesalius, Fallopio, Eustachio, Duverney, Schelhammer, Catugno and Helmholtz marked their epochs and made a great contribution {{to the development of the}} entire medical science, including audiology. A significant contribution to audiology was made by Schwartz in 1920 and Fletcher in 1926, constructors of audiometers. Fowler, Weigel and Fletcher promoted an audiogram in 1922. Wever and Bray first introduced the cochlear microphonic potentials. The first modern audiometer with a flat zero line for all pitches was constructed in 1937. In 1947, Békésy constructed the automatic audiometer, and the theory of mobile waves was introduced in 1928. Fletcher and Steinberg promoted <b>speech</b> <b>audiometries</b> in 1929. Mendel and Goldstein described medium latency responses in 1969. The first hearing aids worn within the ear appeared in the same year. William House pioneered the cochlear implantation in adults in 1969, and the program of infant cochlear implants. Jewett described the evoked auditory potentials in 1970. James Jerger classified tympanometric curves into three tympanogram types (A, B, C). Portmann and Arran introduced transtympanic electrocochleography in 1971. Kemp introduced otoacoustic emission in 1978. Instead of conclusion Finally, the paper lists the titles of available dissertations and subspecialisations in the field of audiology defended in Novi Sad and Belgrade...|$|R

The process of developing the <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> set is presented in this thesis. The five-word sentences are of the form Name-verb-numeral-adjetive-noun. Hagerman developed this sentence type for Swedish <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> in the 1980 s, but for Norwegian the sentences were developed using a new diphone-splitting method. For each word category ten alternatives exist, makings it possible to generate a number of lists with the same phonemic content but with different sentences. A noise was developed from the speech material. This is intended for use together with the speech for the purpose of speech recognition threshold in noise measurements. The material is very suitible for performing repeated measurements on the same person, which is often a requisite for hearing aid evaluation or psychoacoustical testing. The three-word utterances are of the form numeral-adjective-noun. The words are identical with the last three words used in the five-word sentences. The three-word utterances are intended for speech recognition threshold measurement. The noise developed for five-word sentences can be used together with the three-word utterances for speech recogniton threshold in noise measurements. Monosyllabic word lists were developed mainly for the purpose of measuring maximum speech recogniton score or the performance-intensity function. The recorded lists earmarked for testing children were developed by Rikshospitalet University Hospital in Oslo.

40|$|THE DISSERTATION IS IN AFRIKAANS: The multi-linguistic and multi-cultural {{population}} of South Africa poses some unique challenges for {{valid and reliable}} service delivery by South African audiologists and acousticians, specifically when conducting valid and reliable <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> evaluations. This is examined in the South African context, and set the base for the main aim of this study, namely the comparison of the ideal criteria for <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> with the South African clinical practice of <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Many variables can be identified {{in the course of}} the test stimuli and subsequent response when conducting <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry.</b> These variables can be divided into two categories, namely stimulus related variables (test content and test procedure) and test subject related variables. The variables are examined in light of the multi-linguistic and multi-cultural South African context, because of the challenges posed by this context to the South African audiologist. The study is conducted in three different phases, according to three sub aims. A thorough review of the subject literature was done to identify ideal criteria for <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry.</b> A questionnaire was sent to South African audiologists and acousticians, to examine the present clinical practice of <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> in South Africa, and compare it to the criteria suggested in the literature in order to investigate the attainability of criteria and to identify problem areas. The results show low comparison regarding test content between the ideal criteria and South African clinical practice, especially because South African audiologists do not use a test battery consisting of different types of test material. Low comparison can be seen regarding the selection of test items, length of lists and degree of difficulty. Low comparison can also be seen with test procedure, mainly because audiologists rarely use pre-recorded test materials. High levels of comparison are found regarding presentation levels and test environment. With test subject variables, a discrepancy is also found between the ideal criteria and South African clinical practice, mainly because tests are not always conducted in the test subjects’ first language. By using the identified deficiencies in the clinical practice of <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> in South Africa as a starting point, one can use further research to reach the ideal, namely the ideal criteria of conducting <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry.</b> The conclusions of this study can be used as suggestions for solutions for the unique problems that the practicing audiologist in South Africa has to deal with. The complexity of these problems will need further attention from researchers in this and other fields of study. Dissertation (MCommunication Pathology) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

Methods: The items used in the test setting included 1 base, 1 hammer, 1 wooden structure with 4 sticks, and 5 rings of different colors and 20 lists with 5 verbal tasks per list. The VTMR test and bisyllabic <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> were evaluated in normal-hearing subjects with and without cognitive impairment and in subjects with sensorineural hearing loss. Results: All normal-hearing subjects without cognitive impairment performed the VTMR tasks (100 %) correctly at 35 dB sound pressure level. In subjects with sensorineural hearing loss, the percentage of correct answers was significantly higher for the VTMR test than for bisyllabic <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> above 50 dB sound pressure level. This percentage was higher for the VTMR also in normal-hearing subjects with poor cognitive skills. Conclusions: The VTMR might make it easier to check patients ’ ability to understand verbal commands than does tradi-tional <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry,</b> in particular in those patients with poor test-taking skills...|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} study comparing <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> with self-assessed hearing disability and {{an analysis of}} other factors influencing {{the quality of life}} was conducted. In the Veneto region (Italy), a representative sample of 2700 independently living individuals of 65 years of age and older was selected for the study. All participants were administered a comprehensive questionnaire and a brief examination at their home, including a general physical examination, <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry,</b> Sanders' Speech Disability test, part I and III, Mini Mental State Examination, CES-D scale for depression, visual acuity, self-reported diseases and physical function. Auditory function was worst in the older individuals: auditory performance was within acceptable limits up to the 75 - 79 age group, while it rapidly deteriorates in the older groups. This trend is consistent with self-reported auditory disability (Sanders' test). A detailed analysis of the type of errors made in the <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> was conducted for each subject. <b>Speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> is a good indicator of real hearing difficulties faced by the elderly, and it might be preferred to pure-tone audiometry, since hearing deficits with age are not always limited to an increased detection threshold, but include other aspects of hearing such as distortion of sounds, comprehension of speech and noise discrimination...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the reliability of}} the Bone Conduction-HeadBand (BC-HB) test for predicting the postoperative functional outcome of a round-window (RW) vibroplasty. Study Design: Within-subject comparison of the functional results of the BC-HB test, which is routinely used for the preoperative evaluation of a bone-conduction transducer, with an active middle ear implant (AMEI) placed onto the round window. Setting: Tertiary referral university hospital center. Patients: Seven patients with similar anatomic (absent stapes superstructure) and functional (moderate, mixed hearing loss) sequelae from open tympanoplasty technique. Intervention: All subjects underwent preoperative audiologic assessment with the BC-HB. Subsequently, all subjects underwent surgical placement of an AMEI onto the round window. Main Outcome Measure: Pure tone and <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> in quiet and noise were assessed. Additionally, evaluation of specific satisfactory targets was performed using the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement. Results: Pure tone and <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> in quiet established that both devices had very similar performance and provided remarkable improvement compared with the unaided condition. However, high-frequency gain and <b>speech</b> <b>audiometry</b> in noise demonstrated better performance with RW-AMEI. Conclusion: In patients presenting with mixed hearing loss as a sequela from middle ear surgery, the preoperative BC-HB test may be helpful in predicting the final functional outcome and patient satisfaction with RW-AMEI...|$|E
40|$|Conclusions. The results {{indicate}} that SOM of extreme duration, and maybe also the treatment of SOM, are risk factors for developing permanent hearing loss, both conductive and sensorineural. Objective. Fluctuating or persisting hearing loss of varying degrees is known to accompany secretory otitis media (SOM). The {{aim of this study}} was to detect possible hearing sequelae in young adults who had suffered from "refractory'' SOM during childhood. Material and methods. A total of 33 subjects (age 16 - 25 years) with previous SOM that had persisted for a mean of 11 years (range 6 - 19 years) were retrospectively examined at a mean of 18 years after their first myringotomy or tube insertion and compared to 15 healthy controls. The follow-up included audiometric examinations (pure-tone <b>audiometry,</b> distorted <b>speech</b> and impedance <b>audiometry),</b> otomicroscopy and scrutiny of medical records. Results. The SOM group had poorer hearing at all frequencies with the exception of 1. 5 kHz in the range 0. 125 - 16 kHz. Those with the greatest number of myringotomies and tube insertions and those with the longest duration of SOM had significantly poorer hearing at high frequencies (8 - 16 kHz) than those with fewer tube insertions and a shorter duration of SOM. The SOM group scored lower on distorted speech tests than the controls...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Determining the {{frequency}} of hearing disorders and hearing aid using in the clients referring to the Avesina education and health center, audiometry clinic, 1377. Method and Material: This is an assesive-descriptive survey that conducted on more than 2053 (1234 males and 819 females) who referred for audiometry after examination by a physician. Case history, otoscopy, PTA, <b>speech</b> and immittance <b>audiometry</b> were conducted for all the clients. The findings were expressed in tables and diagrams of frequency. The age and sex relationship. All types of hearing losses {{and the number of}} the hearing-impaired clients need a hearing aid were assessed. Findings: 56 % of this population were hearing-impaired and 44 % had normal hearing were hearing. 60 % were males and 40 % females. Of the hearing-impaired, 44 % had SNHL, 35. 6 % CHL and 8. 2 % mixed hearing loss. The hearing aid was prescribed for 204 (83 females and 121 males) if they need that only 20 females and 32 males wear it. Conclusion: It this sample, SNHL is of higher frequency. According to this survey, the more the age, the more the hearing aid is accepted (85 % of wearer are more than 49) the prevalence of the hearing impaired males are more than females (60 % versus 40 %). Only 25 % of the hearing-impaired wear hearing aids...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} a rare case of central auditory dysfunction induced by cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A 55 -year-old {{woman who was}} admitted after aneurysmal SAH developed cerebral vasospasm on Day 3 affecting mainly the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and partly the left MCA. The vasospasm became refractory to conventional therapy and was ultimately improved by intraarterial infusion of nimodipine in the right MCA and angioplasty. Severe auditory dysfunction was apparent from Day 10 as the patient was not reactive to speech or environmental sounds. Brain MRI on Day 17 demonstrated infarcted areas mainly in the right hippocampus, medial occipital lobe, and thalamus. The patient underwent further examination using <b>audiometry,</b> <b>speech</b> testing, auditory evoked potentials, functional MRI, and cerebral PET. The initial diagnosis was extended nonverbal agnosia and total pure word deafness. The central auditory dysfunction improved over 6 months, with persisting hyperacusis, tinnitus, and amusia. Central auditory dysfunction is a rare complication after SAH. While cortical deafness {{may be associated with}} bilateral lesions of the temporal cortex, partly reversible central auditory dysfunction was observed in this patient after prominently unilateral right temporal lesions. The role of the interthalamic connections can be discussed, as well as the possibility that a less severe vasospasm on the left MCA could have transiently impaired the left thalamocortical auditory pathways...|$|R
