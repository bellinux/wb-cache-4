40|$|Mutations {{resulting}} in overexpression of intracellular Notch 1 (ICN 1) are frequently observed in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We have determined {{the consequences of}} ICN 1 overexpression from retroviral vectors introduced into bone marrow cells. Early consequences are the generation of polyclonal nontumorigenic CD 4 + 8 + T cell receptor (TCR) -αβ+ cells that do not qualify as tumor precursors despite the observation that they overexpress Notch 1 and c-Myc and degrade the tumor suppressor E 2 A by posttranslational modification. The first tumorigenic cells are detected among more immature CD 4 − 8 +TCR-αβ− cells {{that give rise to}} monoclonal tumors with a single, unique TCR-β chain and diverse TCR-α chains, pinpointing malignant transformation to a stage after pre-TCR signaling and before completion of TCR-α rearrangement. In T-ALL, E 2 A deficiency is accompanied by further transcriptional up-regulation of c-Myc and concomitant dysregulation of the c-Myc-p 53 axis at the transcriptional level. Even though the tumors consist of phenotypically heterogeneous cells, no evidence for tumor stem cells was found.

40|$|Some marker {{chromosomes}} and chromosome rearrangements {{are difficult}} to identify using G-bands by Giemsa staining after trypsin treatment (G-banding) alone. Molecular cytogenetic techniques, such as <b>spectral</b> <b>karyotyping</b> (<b>SKY)</b> and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), can help to detect chromosomal aberrations precisely. We analyzed the karyotypes in 6 cases of multiple congenital abnormalities and 1 case of spontaneous abortion (case 2). Three cases (cases 1, 6, and 7) had marker chromosomes, and 4 cases (cases 2 - 5) had chromosomal rearrangements. The karyotypes in cases 1, 2, and 3 were determined using FISH with probes based on the clinical findings and family histories. <b>Spectral</b> <b>karyotyping</b> (<b>SKY)</b> analysis in cases 4 - 7 showed that this method is useful and saves time. The combination of SKY and FISH analyses defi ned the range of the ring chromosome in case 7. We demonstrated that a combination of G-banding, FISH, and SKY can be applied effectively to the investigation of chromosomal rearrangement and to the detection of marker chromosome origins.

40|$|Abstract Background Cell lines {{constitute}} a powerful model to study cancer, {{and here we}} describe three new epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines derived from poorly differentiated serous solid tumors (TOV- 1946, and TOV- 2223 G), {{as well as the}} matched ascites for one case (OV- 1946). Methods In addition to growth parameters, the cell lines were characterized for anchorage independent growth, migration and invasion potential, ability to form spheroids and xenografts in SCID mice. Results While all cell lines were capable of anchorage independent growth, only the TOV- 1946 and OV- 1946 cell lines were able to form spheroid and produce tumors. Profiling of keratins, p 53 and Her 2 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. Somatic TP 53 mutations were found in all cell lines, with TOV- 1946 and OV- 1946 harboring the same mutation, and none harbored the commonly observed somatic mutations in BRAF, KRAS or germline BRCA 1 / 2 mutations found to recur in the French Canadian population.

40|$|AbstractThe way {{in which}} {{cytogenetic}} aberrations develop in prostate cancer (Cap) is poorly understood. <b>Spectral</b> <b>karyotype</b> (<b>SKY)</b> analysis of Cap cell lines has shown that they have unstable karyotypes and also have features associated with chromosomal instability (CIN). To accurately determine the incidence of de novo structural and numerical aberrations in vitro in Cap, we performed SKY analysis of three independent clones derived from one representative cell line, DU 145. The frequent generation of new chromosomal rearrangements and a wide variation {{in the number of}} structural aberrations within two to five passages suggested that this cell line exhibited some of the features associated with a CIN phenotype. To study numerical cell-to-cell variation, chromosome 8 aneusomy was assessed in the LNCaP, DU 145, and PC- 3 cell lines and a patient cohort of 15 Cap primary tumors by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This analysis showed that a high frequency of numerical alteration affecting chromosome 8 was present in both in vitro and in Cap tissues. In comparison to normal controls, the patient cohort had a statistically significant (P<. 05), greater frequency of cells with one and three centromere 8 copies. These data suggest that a CIN-like process may be contributing towards the generation of de novo numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities in Cap...|$|E

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on the DNA extracted from cultured amniocytes revealed no genomic imbalance. The sSMC was characterized by <b>spectral</b> <b>karyotyping</b> (<b>SKY)</b> using 24 -color SKY probes and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) using a whole chromosome paint (wcp) probe and a CEP 11 (D 11 Z 1) probe. The result was 47,XX,+mar. ish(11) (SKY+, wcp 11 +, D 11 Z 1 +) [16]/ 46,XX[4], indicating that the sSMC was derived from chromosome 11. A healthy female baby was delivered at 37 weeks of gestation with no phenotypic abnormalities. The cord blood had a karyotype of 47,XX,+mar[32]/ 46,XX[8]. Polymorphic DNA marker analysis of the blood excluded uniparental disomy 11. The female infant was normal in growth and psychomotor development during follow-ups at two months of age. Conclusion: aCGH, SKY and FISH are useful in {{prenatal diagnosis}} of an sSMC derived from the centromeric region of a non-acrocentric chromosome...|$|R
