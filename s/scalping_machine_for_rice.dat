50|$|Sukhdeo Mahto - Sukhdeo Mahto {{was active}} in 80s and 90s. He {{played a pivotal role}} in {{integrating}} the village economy by opening the door for Mushahar and other poor people. It is with his effort that Mushahars were able to trade their small earnings in the commercial center, he established {{at the heart of the}} village. He is also considered as the driving force behind replacement of Jaata (a primitive machine used to manually produce flour from wheat), Dhenki (a traditional mechanical <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> furnishing <b>rice</b> from paddy grains) and Samaath (a manual instrument used to furnish rice) with automated machines, which helped the farmers and particularly poor people in investing more time in their core activities. Introduction of automated <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> flour and <b>rice</b> furnishing also paved way to many small children to enter school, since they were no longer required to spend several hours in helping their parents make the grain ready for cooking.|$|R
50|$|The museum {{focuses on}} the history of {{agriculture}} and timber. Upstairs exhibits include photographs and a <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> cutting <b>rice</b> stalks, displays of early dental and medical equipment, pictures of war maneuvers during World War II, and a letter from Confederate States of America soldier David Dunn to his wife. Dunn was the grandfather of William T. Dunn, founder of Dunnsville, which became Oakdale. An education room contains displays on Louisiana High School Hall of Fame sports figures Curtis Cook of Oakdale, Johnny Buck of Kinder, and Hoyle Granger of Oberlin. Granger, an inductee of the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame who starred for the Houston Oilers, addressed the grand opening of the museum. Other exhibits focus on the Coushatta Indians and Courir de Mardi Gras or the country way of celebrating Mardi Gras in Allen Parish.|$|R
40|$|For food {{industry}} processes packaging machines with high throughput are required {{and one way}} to improve the overall machine efficiency is to increase its working speed. However, testing of prototypes is time and cost expensive. Therefore, simulation is {{used to evaluate the}} process and adapt it. Optimization can help to find better machine designs by using simulations to evaluate one solution. This work uses the Discrete Element Method to model a vertical tubular bag <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> packaging basmati <b>rice.</b> The Covariance Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy optimizes the simulation model and results in a significant machine speedup. This work is a guidance to adapt this method for similar problems...|$|R

The remaining {{part of the}} tract, which contains in the whole more than 2000 acres, consists of oak and hickory, and well timbered pine land. There is a large and complete water <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> cleaning out <b>rice,</b> with barns, overseers houses, and other suitable plantation buildings, well constructed, and in good repair. There is also a convenient and well finished Dwelling House with suitable outbuildings, and an excellent garden, containing a variety of shrubs and trees both for use and ornament.|$|R
5000|$|Economic tension {{intensified}} {{during the}} Second World War. The Japanese occupation of Malaya began in 1941 {{and from that}} point onwards the [...] "export of primary products {{was limited to the}} relatively small amounts required for the Japanese economy." [...] This led to large areas of rubber plantations being abandoned and many mines closing. The latter was progressively affected by a shortage of spare parts <b>for</b> <b>machines.</b> <b>Rice</b> imports, which made up {{a large portion of the}} Malayan diet, fell rapidly due to limited trade and thus the population was forced to focus their efforts on producing enough food to stay alive. Many people believed that the British would soon return and ‘save’ them so they did not attempt to learn the farming skills that would be essential for survival. This then led to severe famine in Malaya from 1942.|$|R
500|$|In the {{destruction}} following the Tokyo bombings, starvation was rampant and Ono {{and her family}} were forced to beg for food while pulling their belongings with them in a wheelchair. It was during this period in her life, Ono said, that she developed her [...] "aggressive" [...] attitude and understanding of [...] "outsider" [...] status when children who were once well-to-do taunted her and Keisuke. [...] Other stories tell of her mother bringing {{a large number of}} goods with them to the countryside, where the goods were bartered for food. In one anecdote, her mother bartered a German-made sewing <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> [...] of <b>rice</b> in order to feed the family. During this time, Ono's father, who had been in Hanoi, was believed to be in a prisoner of war camp in China. However, unbeknownst the them, he remained in the city. Ono told Amy Goodman of Democracy Now on October 16, 2007, that [...] "He was in French Indochina, which is Vietnam actually.... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp." ...|$|R

The reseach is conducted: (i) {{to examine the}} relationships between riil price <b>for</b> <b>rice</b> at retail level and riil price <b>for</b> rough <b>rice</b> at producer level, (ii) to examine the relationships between riil price <b>for</b> <b>rice</b> at retail level and riil price <b>for</b> impor <b>rice.</b> The causality is analysed by error correction representation, and the asymmetry of price transmmision is analysed by error correction model approach. It is used monthly time series data from 1998 – 2008. Results of the research show that: (i) the riil price <b>for</b> <b>rice</b> at retail level is integrated to the riil price <b>for</b> rough <b>rice</b> at producer level in the longrun; (ii) there is a causality direction from riil price <b>for</b> <b>rice</b> at retail level to riil price <b>for</b> rough <b>rice</b> at producer level, and no reverse, (iii) the price transmmision of relationship between riil price <b>for</b> <b>rice</b> at retail level and riil price <b>for</b> rough <b>rice</b> at producer level is asymmetry. Price adjusment of rough rice at raising price is slower than at falling price...|$|R

This new technique is called targeted phototherapy which includes excimer laser, intense pulse light system (IPL), photodynamic therapy and ultraviolet (UV) light source with a sophisticated delivery system which is easy to be operated by hands. The mechanisms of action of targeted phototherapy systems {{are similar to those}} in conventional UVB/UVA therapy. They have many advantages like less chances of side effects, avoidance of exposure of unnecessary sites, faster response, shortening of the duration of treatments. But they have disadvantages like high costs and inability to use for extensive areas. This review article discusses targeted phototherapy in considerable to the mechanism of actions and advantages and disadvantages in comparison to the conventional phototherapy...|$|R
