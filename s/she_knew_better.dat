2500|$|On 3 March 1916, Gen. Clayton {{abruptly}} sent Bell to Basra, which British {{forces had}} captured in November 1914, to advise Chief Political Officer Percy Cox regarding an area <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> {{than any other}} Westerner. [...] Cox found her an office in his headquarters, where she was employed for the two days per week she was not at Military GHQ Basra. She drew maps to help the British army reach Baghdad safely. [...] She became the only female political officer in the British forces and received the title of [...] "Liaison Officer, Correspondent to Cairo" [...] (i.e. to the Arab Bureau {{where she had been}} assigned). She was St. John Philby's field controller, and taught him the finer arts of behind-the-scenes political manoeuvering.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to {{make the}} mistake of denial. After all, it was an absurdly unequal contest.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than this. She {{had seen}} {{elemental}} fire flaming from his eyes, and dared not remain. With proud lift of head she walked away, leaving him penitent, bewildered, crushed.|$|E
5000|$|Wombat (voiced by Courtney Shaw) is P. King's sidekick. She assists P. King in his plans, {{even when}} <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't, William," [...] Katharine interposed; [...] "Cassandra {{has heard}} us; she can judge what we are; <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> {{than we could}} tell her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Albinia, 'one cannot but honour her motives, though I {{think she}} is mistaken; and I am sorry for her; but <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than {{to be afraid of}} me.' ...|$|R
60|$|Anne was a red-hot Conservative, out {{of loyalty}} to Matthew's memory, but she said nothing. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to get Mrs. Lynde started on politics. She had a letter for Marilla, postmarked from a town in British Columbia.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, I am not, good gentleman,' {{answered}} Miggs, {{shaking her}} head {{with an air of}} self-denial which seemed to imply that she might be if she chose, but she hoped <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b> 'No, I am not, good gentleman. Don't charge me with it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Belllounds {{spoke in}} an even, heavy tone, without any {{apparent}} feeling. Always he was mercilessly frank and never spared the truth. But Columbine, {{who knew him}} well, felt how this news flayed him. Resentment stirred in her toward the wayward son, but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to voice it.|$|E
50|$|Brenda Bezares (born Brenda Yamile Jiménez Loya on April 26, 1968 in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico) is a Mexican actress, singer, TV hostess {{and former}} model. <b>She</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> for Vamos a ayudarnos, Liliana and Mi vida eres tú.|$|R
50|$|Rosángela Balbó (April 16, 1941 - November 3, 2011, born Rosa Angela Giovanna Balbó Rosso) was an Italian born-Mexican actress. <b>She</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> for the Argentine films Amorina, Buscando a Mónica, Los que verán a Dios and Los hipócritas.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Ave and I {{have been}} {{down to the}} churchyard; Ave does care, poor girl. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> what it is now, and {{she was glad to}} have me to talk to again, though Miss Mary has been so kind to her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How, Percy--how?" [...] she moaned, for {{her heart}} was aching with {{intolerable}} pain; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than he did the precautions which were being taken against his escape, and she saw more clearly than he realised it himself the terrible barrier set up against that escape by ever encroaching physical weakness.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the next}} day, I fully {{expected}} {{to receive a}} visit from Mrs. Tenbruggen. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than that. I only got a polite little note, thanking me for the address, and adding an artless concession: [...] "I earn more money than I {{know what to do}} with; and I adore Irish lace." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Stevens {{could not}} be hopeful under the circumstances, for <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than did Dick how slight was the chance that the injured man could live where it was {{impossible}} to care properly for the wound; but she would not deprive the boy of hope, and turned to do as he suggested.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who, I?--nothing," [...] {{answered}} Varney, {{but with}} sunken head and sullen voice; [...] "nothing but communicated to her her lord's commands, which, if the lady list not to obey, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> {{how to answer}} it than I may pretend to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|New York Times, Sep. 16, 1984 - [...] "Miss Jones {{is still}} looking for {{direction}} on The Magazine. She doesn't {{want to be one}} more pop songwriter, but <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than to go off the deep end. The Magazine leaves us awaiting Miss Jones's next step, and provides some enigmas while we wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Torrance nodded sympathetically. [...] "Still, if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> no <b>better</b> than that, I wouldn't worry. Jo had a cast in his eye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{all went}} on so, and made so sure," [...] said Elvira, hanging her head, [...] "and I never did {{know the real}} way the will was found till Janet told me. Babie, if you had heard Lady Clanmacnalty clear her throat when people talked about the will being found, you would have {{believed}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than anyone." ...|$|E
60|$|As Miss Knag {{had never}} yet known {{what it was}} to gain one, it followed, very nearly as a matter of course, that she didn't know {{what it was to}} lose one; so she said, in some haste, 'No, indeed I don't,' and said it with an air {{intending}} to signify that she should like to catch herself marrying anybody--no, no, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than that.|$|E
60|$|She had an {{impatient}} movement of her shoulders without detaching {{herself from the}} back of the chair. Time! Of course? It was less than forty-eight hours since she had followed him to London.--I am no great clerk at those matters but I murmured vaguely an allusion to special licences. We couldn't tell what might have happened to-day already. But <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better,</b> scornfully. Nothing had happened.|$|E
5000|$|Domino is the on/off confidante, lover, and {{teammate}} of Cable. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> Cable <b>better</b> {{than most}} and is scared and excited {{about what might}} happen if he succeeds.|$|R
60|$|Madame la Vicomtesse bit her lip. Had <b>she</b> <b>known</b> me <b>better,</b> <b>she</b> {{might have}} smiled. As for me, I was wholly puzzled {{to account for}} these {{fleeting}} changes in her humor.|$|R
50|$|Sofía Álvarez (born Sofía Calzadilla Bichara on April 29, 1958 in Mexico) is a Mexican {{actress and}} writer. <b>She</b> is <b>known</b> <b>better</b> for Contando con Sofía (1978), Sofiando (1984) and Ladies Night (2003).|$|R
60|$|The very {{roughness}} which, in Mr. Schwirtz, had abraised her, interested her in Mr. Sidney. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> now how {{to control}} human beings. She was fascinated by a comparison of her four average citizens--four men not vastly varied as seen in a street-car, yet utterly different to one working with them: Schwirtz, the lumbering; Troy Wilkins, the roaring; Truax, the politely whining; and Bob Sidney, the hesitating.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No disrespect to your sister, to whom I did greater {{injustice}} than I knew, {{in asking}} her to seal my mistake. I threw away a rough diamond because its sharp edges scratched my fingers, and, in my fit of passion, tried to fill up its place with another jewel. Happily you and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better!</b> Now I see the diamond sparkling, refined, transcendent, with such chastened lustre as even I scarce dared to expect! ...|$|E
60|$|A {{little girl}} wrote me from New Zealand {{in a letter}} I {{received}} yesterday, stating that her father said my proper name was not Mark Twain but Samuel Clemens, but that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better,</b> because Clemens {{was the name of}} the man who sold the patent medicine, and his name was not Mark. She was sure it was Mark Twain, because Mark is in the Bible and Twain is in the Bible.|$|E
50|$|Anne's estranged husband, Steve, {{a police}} officer, refuses {{to listen to}} Anne about her wanting {{to have a look}} at the body, because <b>she</b> needs to <b>know</b> what happened. The death does not seem to match the attack pattern by any of the marine life in this area, which <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> than anyone. For her not to know what killed a diver is a {{dangerous}} sign. Steve intercepts Gabby, a dynamite fisherman, and his son, and threatens to confiscate their boat, but as Gabby explains, Steve, Anne, and he, are old friends.|$|R
50|$|George manipulates Olga's feelings, {{reviving}} the love she once felt for him. Though <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> {{and tries to}} resist, she eventually succumbs to his charms, and they sleep together. This gives Myra the opportunity to sneak away to meet Steve. Myra returns later that night, terribly upset after having been taken advantage of by Steve. When Olga starts berating her for going off with her boyfriend, she responds by revealing she saw George leaving Olga's bedroom. The two miserable women then comfort each other.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> is <b>better</b> <b>known</b> to {{the world}} as the Queen of Sheba.|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than that. Her suspicions {{were now}} fully {{confirmed}} and she sought {{to evade the}} detective in just the way any inexperienced girl might have done. Turning {{in the opposite direction}} she hastily crossed the street, putting a big building between herself and the depot, and then hurried along a cross-street. She looked back now and then and found she had not been followed; so, to insure escape, she turned another corner, giving a fearful glance over her shoulder as she did so.|$|E
6000|$|The sick soldier laughed thinly, {{saying to}} the schoolmistress: [...] "Oh yes, they are fine chaps. But it was folly. D'Annunzio is a world poet--a world wonder--but Fiume was a mistake you know. And these chaps have got to learn a lesson. They got beyond themselves. Oh, they aren't short of money. D'Annunzio had wagon-loads of money there in Fiume, and he wasn't {{altogether}} mean with it." [...] The schoolmistress, {{who was one of}} the sharp ones, gave a little disquisition to show why it was a mistake, and wherein <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than the world's poet and wonder.|$|E
6000|$|Then, to {{make matters}} worse, Suzanne must needs throw her arms round her father's neck and begin to cry--thanks be to my {{bringing}} up of her, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to throw them round mine. [...] "Good Lord!" [...] I said, losing my temper, [...] "what is the girl at now? She has got the husband for whom she has been craving, {{and the first thing}} she does is to snivel. Well, if I had done that to my husband I should have expected him to box my ears, though Heaven knows that I should have had excuse for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was scared, and {{impatient}} {{to be getting}} out of this peril, and it distressed and worried me to have Joan apparently set herself to work to make delay and increase the dangerstill, I thought <b>she</b> probably <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than I what to do. The officer said: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>She</b> is <b>better</b> <b>known</b> to {{the public}} through her efforts in {{outreach}} and education.|$|R
6000|$|... "Elizabeth need have no {{fears of}} a prison," [...] she said. [...] "She is a silly child to be frightened; but when she sees that the other {{children}} like school, and that nothing happens to them, <b>she</b> will <b>know</b> <b>better.</b> Don't beat her, it will only frighten her more." ...|$|R
