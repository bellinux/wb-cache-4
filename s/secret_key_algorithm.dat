Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor's algorithm applies, like the McEliece cryptosystem based on a problem in coding theory. Lattice-based cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, which would break many lattice based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem. It has been proven that applying Grover's algorithm to break a symmetric (<b>secret</b> <b>key)</b> <b>algorithm</b> by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2n/2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2n in the classical case, meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have the same security against an attack using Grover's algorithm that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see Key size).

Symmetric key cryptography is the oldest type whereas asymmetric cryptography is only being used publicly since the late 1970 ’s 1. Asymmetric cryptography was a major milestone {{in the search for}} a perfect encryption scheme. <b>Secret</b> <b>key</b> cryptography goes back to at least Egyptian times and is of concern here. It involves the use of only one key which is used for both encryption and decryption (hence {{the use of the term}} symmetric). Figure 2. 1 depicts this idea. It is necessary for security purposes that the <b>secret</b> <b>key</b> never be revealed To accomplish encryption, most <b>secret</b> <b>key</b> <b>algorithms</b> use two main techniques known assubstitutionandpermutation. Substitution is simply a mapping of one value to another whereas permutation is a reordering of the bit positions for each of the inputs. These techniques are used a number of times in iterations called rounds. Generally, the more rounds there are, the more secure the algrithm. A non-linearity is also introduced into the encryption so that decryption will be computationally infeasible 2 without the <b>secret</b> <b>key.</b> This is achieved with the use of S-boxes which are basically non-linear substitution tables where either the output is smaller than the input or viceversa.

Their attack is based on algebraic properties of modular arithmetic, and thus it is applicable only to public key cryptosystems such as RSA, and not to <b>secret</b> <b>key</b> <b>algorithms</b> such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES). In this paper, we describe a related attack, which we call Differential Fault Analysis, or DFA, and show that it is applicable to almost any <b>secret</b> <b>key</b> cryptosystem proposed so far in the open literature. Our DFA attack can use various fault models and various cryptanalytic techniques to recover the cryptographic secrets hidden in the tamper-resistant device.
