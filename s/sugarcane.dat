5|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening {{in most parts of}} the world. Originally, people chewed raw <b>sugarcane</b> to extract its sweetness. <b>Sugarcane</b> was a native of tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. Different species seem to have originated from different locations with Saccharum barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming from New Guinea. One of the earliest historical references to <b>sugarcane</b> is in Chinese manuscripts dating back to 8th century BC that state that the use of <b>sugarcane</b> originated in India.|$|E
5|$|Brazil <b>sugarcane</b> ethanol fuel program {{success and}} {{sustainability}} {{is based on}} the most efficient agricultural technology for <b>sugarcane</b> cultivation in the world, uses modern equipment and cheap sugar cane as feedstock, the residual cane-waste (bagasse) is used to process heat and power, which results in a very competitive price and also in a high energy balance (output energy/input energy), which varies from 8.3 for average conditions to 10.2 for best practice production.|$|E
5|$|Brazil’s {{production}} of ethanol fuel from <b>sugarcane</b> {{dates back to}} the 1970s, as a governmental response to the 1973 oil crisis. Brazil is considered the biofuel industry leader and the world's first sustainable biofuels economy. In 2010 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated Brazilian <b>sugarcane</b> ethanol as an advanced biofuel due to EPA's estimated 61% reduction of total life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, including direct indirect land use change emissions.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the Brazilian {{research}} unit of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices. concluded that the major driver behind the 2007–2008 rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also concluded that expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian <b>sugarcane</b> cultivated area and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of <b>sugarcane</b> was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that <b>sugarcane</b> fields are {{traditionally}} burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the <b>sugarcane</b> plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the risk of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for <b>sugarcane</b> production, such as the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of <b>sugarcane</b> plantations are located at least 2,000km from the Amazon, and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also far away from the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government supported this argument.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a sustainable development of ethanol production, in September 2009 the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict <b>sugarcane</b> growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas. According to the new criteria, 92.5% of the Brazilian territory is not suitable for <b>sugarcane</b> plantation. The government considers that the suitable areas are {{more than enough to}} meet the future demand for ethanol and sugar in the domestic and international markets foreseen for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Indian medicine (āyurveda), the sugercane is known by the name Ikṣu and the <b>sugarcane</b> juice is known as Phāṇita. Its varieties, synonyms and charactericss are defined in nighaṇṭus such as the Bhāvaprakāśa (1.6.23, group of sugarcanes).|$|E
5|$|Richard Fitzpatrick, by {{that time}} the owner of a {{successful}} plantation with coconut and lime trees, plantains, and <b>sugarcane,</b> pressed for the appointment of Cooley as Justice of the Peace in 1831, making Cooley responsible for adjudicating disputes of persons and property, punishment of minor offenders by fines and whippings, and oversight of the activities of wreckers. Serious offenders were jailed in Key West. By that time, Cooley owned a schooner and took trips not only to take prisoners but to trade coontie, <b>sugarcane,</b> and tropical fruit with Cape Florida, Indian Key, Key West and Havana.|$|E
5|$|The art of {{preparing}} wine {{is described in}} Manasollasa from grape and <b>sugarcane,</b> with unusual sources being based on brewing of Talimadya (palm), Narikelasava (coconut) and Khajurasava (date).|$|E
5|$|A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for <b>sugarcane</b> plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and {{those parts of the}} forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the <b>sugarcane</b> plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{damage was}} widespread. Across the country 40% of the <b>sugarcane</b> crop, 80–100% of the banana crop, 75% {{of the coffee}} trees under three years old, and 20% of {{the top layer of}} the cocoa crop were lost to the storm. Insured damage in Jamaica was {{initially}} estimated at around US$1.5billion, but post-storm analysis showed that it was closer to US$310million.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} first landfall, Hurricane Dean damaged crops {{throughout}} its impact area. In Puebla it destroyed 135,000ha (335,000acre) {{of corn and}} more than 22,000ha (54,000acre) of coffee, while in Veracruz 15,000ha (37,000acre) of various crops were lost. Unlike in Belize and the Eastern Caribbean, the storm spared the <b>sugarcane</b> crop in Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of <b>sugarcane,</b> tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the storm damaged at least 16,000homes and about 250square kilometers (60thousand acres) of land used for cattle. In addition over 420square kilometers (103 thousand acres) of various crops, including <b>sugarcane,</b> corn and bananas, were flooded. Many boats were also lost {{as a result of}} Jose. 90active medical brigades were sent to the region {{to reduce the risk of}} infections amongst the affected population.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{measures}} were {{undertaken by the}} Ayyubids to increase agricultural production. Canals were dug to facilitate the irrigation of agricultural lands throughout the empire. Cultivation of <b>sugarcane</b> was officially encouraged to meet the great demand of it by both the local inhabitants and the Europeans. Several new plants were introduced to Europe in trade with both the Zengids and Ayyubids, including sesame, carob, millet, rice, lemons, melons, apricots, and shallots.|$|E
5|$|Oana {{was born}} at Waipahu, Hawaii, {{the site of the}} former Oahu Sugar Company plantation, in 1910. His father, Henry Kawaihoa Oana, Sr., was a Native Hawaiian from Waialua and a 1896 {{graduate}} of Kamehameha School, who later worked as a bookkeeper at the <b>sugarcane</b> plantation and as a station agent at the local railroad depot. His mother Mary was of Portuguese descent.|$|E
5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} made from raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from <b>sugarcane</b> or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined sugar or white sugar.|$|E
5|$|Though {{inhabited}} {{prior to}} the 16th century, {{little is known about}} Barbadian music before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1536 and then the English in 1627. The Portuguese left little influence, but English culture and music helped shape the island's heritage. Irish and Scottish settlers emigrated in the 17th century, working in the tobacco industry, bringing still more new music to the island. The middle of the 17th century saw the decline of the tobacco industry and the rise of <b>sugarcane,</b> as well as the introduction of large numbers of African slaves. Brazilian exiles however, along with <b>sugarcane</b> introduced Samba to the island which featured a mixture of Latin music with African influences which soon developed into Soca-Samba which is indigenous to Barbados. Modern Barbadian music is thus largely a combination of English and African elements, with Irish, Scottish, and modern American and Caribbean (especially Jamaican) influences as well.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shyamaladandakam, Matangi plays a ruby-studded veena {{and speaks}} sweetly. The Dhyana Mantra {{describes}} {{her to be}} four-armed, with a dark emerald complexion, full breasts anointed with red kumkum powder, and a crescent moon on her forehead. She carries a noose, a goad, a <b>sugarcane</b> bow and flower arrows, which the goddess Tripura Sundari is often described to hold. She is also described to love the parrot and is embodied in the nectar of song.|$|E
5|$|Aduja {{was born}} in Ilocos Sur in the Philippines and emigrated with his family {{at the age of}} eight to Hilo, Hawaii. He was raised in nearby Hakalau, Hawaii, while his father worked on a <b>sugarcane</b> {{plantation}} as a sakada. He attended Hilo High, where he was the student body president and an Eagle Scout, graduating with the class of 1941 as salutatorian. After high school, he went on to the University of Hawaii to major in government and history; while attending university Aduja worked as a timekeeper at Pearl Harbor. In 1944, he joined the United States Army, and along with 50 other individuals volunteered for the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture was the empire's {{main source}} of income through taxes on land and produce. The {{majority}} of the people lived in villages and worked farming the staple crops of rice, pulses, and cotton in the dry areas and <b>sugarcane</b> in areas having sufficient rainfall, with areca and betel being the chief cash crops. The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from their labor.|$|E
5|$|Akshaya Tritya is {{considered}} holy and supremely auspicious by Jains. It {{is believed that}} Rishabhanatha took his first ahara (alms) after becoming an ascetic on this day. Rishabhanatha, Jains believe, was the first monk of the present half cycle of time (avasarpini). Therefore, people {{did not know how}} to offer food (ahara) to monks. King Shreyansa of Hastinapur offered <b>sugarcane</b> juice (ikshu-rasa) to Rishabhanatha. Jains attach great importance to this day as it was only after one year that Rishabhanatha was offered food. The day is celebrated in the Jain tradition on the third day of the bright fortnight of the month Vaishaka (usually April).|$|E
5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, {{despite the effort}} to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The <b>sugarcane</b> crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1840s, the cane toad had been {{introduced}} into Martinique and Barbados, from French Guiana and Guyana. An introduction to Jamaica was made in 1844 {{in an attempt to}} reduce the rat population. Despite its failure to control the rodents, the cane toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging the <b>sugarcane</b> plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by the beetles, prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|From {{the trade}} {{overseas}} and over land, the Chinese acquired peaches from Samarkand, date palms, pistachios, and figs from Greater Iran, pine nuts and ginseng roots from Korea and mangoes from Southeast Asia. In China, {{there was a}} great demand for sugar; during the reign of Harsha over North India (r. 606–647), Indian envoys to the Tang brought two makers of sugar who successfully taught the Chinese how to cultivate <b>sugarcane.</b> Cotton also came from India as a finished product from Bengal, although it was during the Tang that the Chinese began to grow and process cotton, and by the Yuan dynasty it became the prime textile fabric in China.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, cattle {{were brought}} by George Vancouver {{as a tribute}} to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped {{confinement}} and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended KamehamehaI, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today. Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the native forest for the construction of <b>sugarcane</b> plantations and houses.|$|E
5|$|In August 1492, Christopher Columbus {{stopped at}} La Gomera in the Canary Islands, for wine and water, {{intending}} to stay only four days. He became romantically {{involved with the}} governor of the island, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, and stayed a month. When he finally sailed, she gave him cuttings of <b>sugarcane,</b> which became the first to reach the New World. The first sugar cane harvest was conducted in Hispaniola in 1501, and many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s. The Portuguese took sugar cane to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800 cane sugar mills in Santa Catarina Island and another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, Demarara, and Surinam.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} {{commissioned}} by the Dutch government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for <b>sugarcane</b> and ethanol production. This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar cane production is lower than in citric, corn, coffee and soybean cropping. The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control {{and is one of}} the primary objectives of Brazil’s cane genetic improvement programs. Disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane.|$|E
5|$|Industry representatives {{complained that}} the final rule overstated the {{environmental}} effects of corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of ILUC as an unfair penalty to domestic corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} was being tied to U.S. ethanol production. The 2011 limit for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol failed, unless current carbon intensity was reduced. Oil industry representatives {{complained that the}} standard left oil refiners with few options, such as Brazilian <b>sugarcane</b> ethanol, with its accompanying tariff. CARB officials and environmentalists counter that time and economic incentives will allow produces to adapt.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the site}} of an ancient Hawaiian {{fertility}} ritual, which was stopped by Christian missionaries during the 1830s. The island was given by Kamehameha I to Spanish deserter Francisco de Paula Marín, and later returned to the monarchy. After the island was bought at auction by James Isaac Dowsett and sold to Caroline Jackson, it became the property of Dr. Seth Porter Ford by marriage and was renamed Ford Island. After Ford's death, his son sold the island to the John Papa ʻĪʻī estate and it was converted into a <b>sugarcane</b> plantation.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing, {{agriculture}} {{and the loss}} of wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the African crake in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with <b>sugarcane.</b> In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears to be under no real threat.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century the Everglades {{have been a}} subject of {{interest}} for agricultural development. The first attempt to drain the Everglades occurred in 1882 when a Pennsylvania land developer named Hamilton Disston constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating <b>sugarcane</b> and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of <b>sugarcane</b> and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs {{naturally}} alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
5|$|The Everglades Forever Act, {{introduced}} by Governor Lawton Chiles in 1994, {{was an attempt}} to legislate the lowering of phosphorus in Everglades waterways. The act put the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500ppb in the 1980s). The SFWMD built Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) near <b>sugarcane</b> fields where water leaving the EAA flows into ponds lined with lime rock and layers of peat and calcareous periphyton. Testing has shown this method to be more effective than previously anticipated, bringing levels from 80ppb to 10ppb.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Ages saw further {{improvements}} in agriculture. Monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers {{for the collection}} of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The manorial system allowed large landowners to control their land and its laborers, {{in the form of}} peasants or serfs. During the medieval period, the Arab world was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents. Besides transporting numerous crops, they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to Europe and developed the beginnings of the plantation system of <b>sugarcane</b> growing through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation.|$|E
