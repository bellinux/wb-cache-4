40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that there is a linkage between strategies and human resource <b>staffing</b> <b>policies.</b> Our aim with the dissertation was to test if such a linkage could be proven in Swedish MNCs. Also, indications spoke for ethnocentric tendencies in MNCs. We wanted to test if this was the reality for Swedish companies. In order to test the linkage we had to categorise the companies’ strategies and human resource <b>staffing</b> <b>policies.</b> By a survey we concluded that there was not full consistency in the companies’ answers regarding which strategy and <b>staffing</b> <b>policy</b> they belonged to. An apparent linkage between strategy and human resource <b>staffing</b> <b>policy</b> could not be proven. Also, we found no evidence of ethnocentrism in Swedish MNCs...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which multinational corporations (MNCs) whose <b>staffing</b> <b>policies</b> approach the genuine multinational model are free of the dysfunctions found by the authors in earlier studies of ethnocentric MNCs. The findings are based on comparative research in 51 MNCs, and intensive diagnostic studies of seven subsidiaries of MNCs operating and headquartered in four continents. The findings may be summed up as follows: (1) certain, but very few, morale problems have indeed been eliminated; (2) others are still present; (3) others are still present and their effect has intensified; and (4) new problems have appeared which are unique to the <b>staffing</b> <b>policy</b> approximating to the genuine multinational model. These findings shed new light on several of the assumptions underlying this model. The general conclusion is that each prevalent type of <b>staffing</b> <b>policy</b> has several sources of morale problems [...] some inherent in its uniqueness, and others shared by the alternative <b>staffing</b> <b>policies</b> [...] irrespective of the personal qualifications of the managers. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect that a change toward the genuine multinational model would solve the basic morale problems prevalent in the dominant type of MNCs. ...|$|R

This research questions whether the Marine Corps’ manning and <b>staffing</b> <b>policies</b> are adequately setting the conditions for infantry battalions to achieve optimal readiness prior to deployment. The clearest snapshot of an infantry battalion’s readiness is displayed during the unit’s mission rehearsal exercise. According to this research, the Marine Corps manning and <b>staffing</b> <b>policies</b> accomplish the commandant’s guidance, but the results from the models in this study identify weaknesses in current policy metrics. In fact, the Marine Corps manpower process is underperforming the task of stabilizing infantry battalions prior to deployment. The resulting effect is a negative contribution toward unit cohesion and readiness. This study recommends including a stability metric in the current readiness model, adjusting the staffing window, and prioritizing the staffing of the statistically significant unit groups identified in this study. The Marine Corps can improve the readiness of infantry battalions by modifying the manning and <b>staffing</b> <b>policy</b> guidelines and enforcing the initiative known as the Deployed Unit <b>Staffing</b> Cohesion <b>policy.</b> Major, United States Marine Corp...|$|R
