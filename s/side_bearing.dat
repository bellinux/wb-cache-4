25|$|The {{municipal}} {{area was}} crossed by the Limes Germanicus, {{a line of}} frontier forts begun in AD 86 by the Romans which stretched from near Bonn on the Rhine to near Regensburg on the Danube. It divided the Roman Empire from the unconquered Germanic tribes. The area of the town that stands today lay on the Germanic <b>side.</b> <b>Bearing</b> obvious witness to the Limes is a replica of a watchtower towards Niedernhausen near Dasbach on the Dasbacher Höhe (heights). Even the Dasbach churchtower supposedly stands on {{the foundation of a}} Roman watchtower. Within the limits of neighbouring Taunusstein is likewise found such a replica near Orlen, right beside the remains of the castrum Zugmantel.|$|E

[...] As the fungus matures, the fruiting body cracks open and forms a stalk with tapering arms, a volva, and a spore mass {{known as a}} gleba. The mature fruiting body is typically [...] in height, with arms that are 2–5 times {{the length of the}} stipe. The stipe itself does not extend past the volva, and is hollow, thin-walled, chambered, wrinkled, and flares towards the upper end. The color of the stipe is white or grayish-white; it is [...] in height, and [...] thick at the widest diameter. The three or four arms extending from the stipe average [...] in length (ranging from , and wrinkled on the <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> the gleba. The arms, which are joined at the top, are shaped like a lance (...) , pointed towards the apex; they are orange-colored. The internal structure of the arms is made of chambers; one large chamber towards the outside, and typically three smaller chambers {{on the inside of the}} arm. The gleba is commonly found on the upper two-thirds of the inside surface of the arms, and is dark green and slimy. The fetid odor of the gleba, described by one author as comparable to [...] "fresh pig manure", attracts insects that help to disperse the spores.|$|E
60|$|Now came a {{numerous}} {{company of}} Priests, in flowing and funereal robes, bearing banners, inscribed {{with the various}} titles of their Queen; on some was inscribed Hecate, on others Juno Inferna, on others Theogamia, Libera on some, on others Cotytto. Those that bore banners were crowned with wreaths of narcissus, and mounted on bulls blacker than night, and of a severe and melancholy aspect. Others walked by their <b>side,</b> <b>bearing</b> branches of cypress.|$|E

50|$|Paraceltites is a genus of ammonoid {{cephalopods}} in the ceratitid family Paraceltitidae, {{known from}} the Middle and Upper Permian of Sicily, the Alps, Crimea, Texas and Mexico. The shell of Paraceltities is evolute with whorls compressed, venter arched and smooth, <b>sides</b> <b>bearing</b> ribs that slant somewhat forward dorso-ventrally. The suture is simple and goniatitic.|$|R
60|$|The waiter {{had come}} to Jimmy's <b>side,</b> <b>bearing</b> cheese; but Jimmy looked at it with dislike {{and shook his head}} in silent negation. He was about to depart from this place. His {{capacity}} for absorbing home-truths about himself was exhausted. He placed a noiseless sovereign on the table, caught the waiter's eye, registered renunciation, and departed soft-footed down the aisle. The waiter, a man who {{had never been able to}} bring himself to believe in miracles, revised the views of a life-time. He looked at the sovereign, then at Jimmy, then at the sovereign again. Then he took up the coin and bit it furtively.|$|E
60|$|If you, as one {{of those}} refugee householders, came in from {{business}} after dark--and this was the business time here--you stealthily crossed the moor, approached the border of the aforesaid brook, and whistled opposite the house to which you belonged. A shape thereupon made its appearance on the other <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> the bridge on end against the sky; it was lowered; you crossed, and a hand helped you to land yourself, together with the pheasants and hares gathered from neighbouring manors. You sold them slily the next morning, and the day after you stood before the magistrates with the eyes of all your sympathizing neighbours concentrated on your back. You disappeared for a time; then you were again found quietly living in Mixen Lane.|$|E
60|$|General Remarks.--Under {{the head}} of L. anserifera, I have made some remarks on the {{diagnostic}} characters of this species. In the thinness of the valves,--form of the carina, with the rim connecting the prongs being not, or scarcely, reflexed,--and in the shortness and narrowness of the peduncle, there is some approach to L. australis, and thence to L. fascicularis. In {{the form of the}} maxillæ,--in one specimen having the mandible on one <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> only four teeth,--and in the frequent absence of filamentary appendages, there is some approach to the genus Pæcilasma; but there is no such approach in the characters derived from the capitulum. We have seen that, as in so many other species of this genus, most of the parts are variable, and this is the case to a most unusual extent {{in the form of the}} maxillæ. Dr. Leach has attached eight specific names to the specimens preserved in the British Museum.|$|E

6000|$|The {{streets were}} {{scarcely}} awake; {{there was little}} to amuse the eye; and the young man's attention centred on the dumb companion of his drive. A card was nailed upon one <b>side,</b> <b>bearing</b> the superscription: [...] "Miss Doolan, passenger to Dublin. Glass. With care." [...] He thought with a sentimental shock that the fair idol of his heart was perhaps driven to adopt the name of Doolan; and, as he still studied the card, he was aware of a deadly black depression settling steadily upon his spirits. It was in vain for him to contend against the tide; in vain that he shook himself or tried to whistle: the sense of some impending blow was not to be averted. He looked out; in the long, empty streets, the cab pursued its way without a trace of any follower. He gave ear; and over and above the jolting of the wheels upon the road, he was conscious of a certain regular and quiet sound that seemed to issue from the box. He put his ear to the cover; at one moment, he seemed to perceive a delicate ticking; the next, the sound was gone, nor could his closest hearkening recapture it. He laughed at himself; but still the gloom continued; and it was with more than the common relief of an arrival, that he leaped from the cab before the station.|$|E
6000|$|Bubbles {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fascinating}} of sports. There is the soft foamy mass, like driven snow, or like whipped cream. Blanche bends down to blow [...] "a honeycomb," [...] holding the bowl of the pipe in the water; at her gurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger, clearer bubbles, each reflecting the whole scene, and sparkling with rainbow tints, until Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand, and Mary pronounces it stiff enough, and presents a pipe to little Daisy, who, drawing the liquid into her mouth, throws it away with a grimace, and declares that she does not like bubbles! But Aubrey stands with swelled cheeks, gravely puffing at the sealing-waxed extremity. Out pours a confused assemblage of froth, but the glassy globe slowly expands the little branching veins, flowing down on either <b>side,</b> <b>bearing</b> an enlarging miniature of the sky, the clouds, the tulip-tree. Aubrey pauses to exclaim! but where is it? Try again! A proud bubble, as Mary calls it, a peacock, in blended pink and green, is this transparent sphere, reflecting and embellishing house, wall, and shrubs! It is too beautiful! It is gone! Mary undertakes to give a lesson, and blows deliberately without the slightest result. Again! She waves her disengaged hand in silent exultation as the airy balls detach themselves, and float off on the summer breeze, with a tardy, graceful, uncertain motion. Daisy rushes after them, catches at them, and looks at her empty fingers with a puzzled [...] "All gone!" [...] as plainly expressed by Toby, who snaps at them, and shakes his head with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth, while the kitten frisks after them, striking at them with her paw, amazed at meeting vacancy.|$|E

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of the}} accident was {{the failure of the}} 18th rail car to properly negotiate a curve because of the inadequate <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> clearance of the B-end truck assembly, likely due to a broken <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> wedge plate attachment bolt, which caused a wheel to climb the rail, which derailed the car. Contributing to the derailment was (1) the undesirable contact of the truck bolster bowl rim with the car body center plate and (2) the hollow worn wheels on the 18th car, which further diminished the steering ability of the truck assembly.|$|E

40|$|A halogen {{dance of}} a benzoxazole-conjugated bromofuran derived from {{furfural}} is described. The reaction proceeds through a benzoxazole-directed lithiation {{to provide the}} a-lithiofuran, which is subjected to Negishi coupling to give a-arylated benzoxazole-conjugated furan derivatives.

60|$|It was {{not until}} the next {{afternoon}} that the absolutely necessary repairs to the three vessels were completed, the holes near the water-line covered by planks over which pitched canvas was nailed, the ropes shot away replaced by new ones, and the brigantine's gaff repaired. Then sail was hoisted again, and the three vessels set sail for Kingston, where they arrived on the evening of the third day after starting. No little excitement was caused in the harbour when the Arrow, with her sails and <b>sides</b> <b>bearing</b> marks of the engagement, sailed in, followed by the brigantine flying the British ensign over the black flag, and the Thames with the same flags, but with the addition of the merchant ensign under the black flag, following her. There were two or three ships of war in the port, and the crews saluted the Arrow with hearty cheers. The flag-ship at once ran up the signal for her commander to come on board, and, leaving Lippincott to see to the operation of anchoring, Nat ordered the gig to be lowered, and, taking his place in it, was rowed to the flag-ship.|$|R
