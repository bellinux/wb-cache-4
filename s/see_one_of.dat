5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E

25|$|Less {{than a year}} later, the Oakland Seals were in {{financial}} difficulty and having trouble drawing fans. An apparent deal was in place to move the team to Vancouver, but the NHL {{did not want to}} <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their franchises from the expansion of 1967 move so quickly and vetoed the deal. In exchange for avoiding a lawsuit, the NHL promised Vancouver would get a team in the next expansion. Another group, headed by Minnesota entrepreneur Tom Scallen, made a new presentation and was awarded an expansion franchise for the price of $6million (three times the cost in 1967). The new ownership group purchased the WHL Canucks, and brought the team into the league with the Buffalo Sabres as expansion teams for the 1970–71 season.|$|E

25|$|Although largely {{absent from}} his diocese between 1436 and 1445, his {{presence}} is on record for January 1439, February 1441, and February 1445.

The dispute with the archdeacon Gilbert Forrester continued, Forrester's excommunication being renewed on 30 July 1448. Forrester tried to secure exemption from episcopal authority at the Roman court. Although Crannach resisted Forrester, the bishop-archdeacon dispute was to continue after Crannach's death. Crannach also attacked his dean, John de Lichton (Leighton) for inefficiency and immorality.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 Hibbard-Swenson Company {{chartered}} {{the newly}} built motor schooner King & Winge to carry relief {{supplies to the}} Belvedere and complete the normal trading run. King & Winge became stuck in the ice near Point Barrow and bent her propeller. The ship was extricated by the revenue cutter Bear on August 22. They met the Belvedere at Point Barrow, delivered the supplies, took on some crewmen from the Elvira, and subsequently put into at Nome August 30. Bear arrived the same day and reported that its attempt to rescue {{the crew of the}} Karluk from Wrangel Island off the northeast Siberian coast had been thwarted by bad weather, ice and low fuel. Stefansson's former secretary Burt McConnell then requested that King & Winge attempt a rescue; this request was reiterated by Captain Bartlett of the Karluk. Swenson set out for Wrangel Island in the King & Winge with A.P. Jochimsen as Master. They stopped at East Cape, Siberia, and picked up an umiak and a party of natives to man it, in case they had to cross ice interspersed with open water. As they approached the beach in the umiak, the native crew was alarmed to <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Karluk survivors vigorously pumping a rifle, but Swenson reassured them in their language. They removed a total of twelve expedition survivors from two separate camps. The survivors included an Inupiaq couple and their two children. The survivors were later transferred to the Bear.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the backing}} of his home state, Pierce faced {{obstacles}} in gaining the nomination, as he had not held elective office in a decade, and lacked the front-runners' national reputation.

To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached, he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850, including the controversial Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
500|$|In November 1895, Republican John Griggs {{was elected}} {{governor}} of New Jersey; his campaign was managed by Hobart. [...] The election of New Jersey's first Republican governor since the 1860s led to speculation {{in the newspapers}} that Hobart would {{be a candidate for}} vice president. [...] New Jersey Republicans were anxious to nominate Hobart, both to <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their own possibly elevated to national office, and in the hope that having Hobart on the national ticket would boost the Republican vote in New Jersey. [...] Hobart was an attractive candidate as he was from a swing state, and the Griggs victory showed that Republicans could hope to win New Jersey's electoral votes, which they had not done since 1872. [...] Another reason for a Hobart selection was his wealth; he could be expected to spend abundantly on his own campaign.|$|E

When Kelly insists the party needs a theme, Jim and Dwight are unable to think of anything. They finally settle on offering her one hour of napping or one hour of watching television. She loves the idea and chooses the nap. Meanwhile, Angela appears much happier than usual because she bought a new $7,000 cat with the money she received from selling Andy's engagement ring.
