50|$|A flit (flow control units/digits) is a {{unit amount}} of data when the message is {{transmitting}} in link-level. The flit can be accepted or rejected at the receiver <b>side</b> <b>base</b> on the flow control protocol {{and the size of}} the receive buffer. The mechanism of link-level flow control is allowing the receiver to send a continuous signals stream to control if it should keep sending flits or stop sending flits. When a packet is transmitted over a link, the packet will need to be split into multiple flits before the transmitting begin.|$|E

50|$|Suárez {{proposed}} {{making the}} SIDE expense account, long {{a source of}} controversy in Argentina due to its classified nature, a matter of Congressional purview. Though the proposal was not enacted by Congress, Suárez made the agency's budget public, and during his 1986—89 tenure, this amount doubled. His tenure coincided {{with a number of}} scandals, however, including the filming of the UCR's 1989 presidential campaign television ads on a <b>SIDE</b> <b>base,</b> with employees in the background, the involvement of numerous SIDE officials in the far-right Carapintadas, and the surveillance of opposition senators for human weaknesses to be used against them in future political operations.|$|E
50|$|The Asa Locke House {{is set on}} {{the south}} side of High Street, at the {{southeast}} corner with Overlook Way, in what is now a predominantly residential suburban area. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a front-facing gable roof and clapboard siding. A single-story porch extends across the north-facing front and around to the east side, supported by chamfered square posts with segmented-arch bracketing. The front door is set to one side, with full-length windows in the <b>side</b> <b>base.</b> The door is flanked by sidelight windows, and is topped by a transom window. A gabled two-story bay projects from the east side, with a lunette window in the gable, and a two-story ell and garage extend to the rear.|$|E

50|$|No Regret begins 46 {{hours after}} the events in No Remorse. A WEC {{freighter}} headed for the Moon picks up the escape pod, and the Silencer, upon moonfall, makes contact with the local Resistance. The WEC uses the moon as both a mine and prison, {{where most of the}} political dissidents and Resistance members are forced to extract a precious radioactive compound, Di-Corellium, the mineral that is the basis of virtually all energy production on Earth. Approximately half of all known reserves are on the Moon, and a shortage of Di-Corellium would cause serious problems for the WEC. For this reason, Chairman Draygan is on the Moon to oversee the Di-Corellium production, which has been lagging recently—possibly due to incursions from the Resistance cell on Moon, at the hidden Dark <b>Side</b> <b>base.</b> On learning of the Silencer's presence, he sics all his forces against him.|$|E
5000|$|She {{went for}} the Mount Everest {{expedition}} on 5 April 2015 to Kathmandu. From there she started her Trek to the North <b>side</b> <b>Base</b> camp, China. Unlike the last year attempt at climbing Everest, she had some bigger plans to first scale the Everest from North side and then attempt from the South side in Nepal. No Indian Lady has achieved this feat in the same year. The Everest mission had to be called off due to the High intensity Earthquake in Nepal which caused large scale disaster in Nepal and parts of China. The second time unlucky Aparna says that watching Everest everyday (during her climb up to 25,000 feet this year, before the quake hit [...] ) has emboldened her resolve {{to make it to}} the top one day. Everest is like a magnet and the more you see the more you get attracted. It's the ultimate mission and dream of every mountaineer to summit the Everest.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} season, biker Tim Medvetz and Danish {{asthmatic}} Mogens Jensen returned to successfully summit despite Jensen's initial unwillingness to use oxygen and Medvetz's accidental fall and hand injury. Jensen nearly {{died on the}} descent when a piton attached to a rock pass came loose and he fell fifteen feet off the slope. Rod Baber ascended ahead of Medvetz with a cell phone battery taped to his chest, which upon summiting he {{used to make a}} mobile phone call to his family. Mountaineer David Tait attempted the first double-traverse of Everest, planning to ascend the north side, descend the south, and make the return trip. Tait reached the south <b>side</b> <b>base</b> but declined to complete his plan as he had lagged behind Phurba Tashi. He respectfully felt that Tashi would purposefully have to let him reach his objective first to secure the record. Fred Ziel completed his first summit of Everest from the north side (he had previously failed twice after climbing the south), while Katsusuke Yanagisawa—at age 71—became the oldest man to summit Everest as of 2007. Yanagi experienced intermittent throat pain but was otherwise completely healthy upon his return to base camp. The following day, Brice presented him with a gift before packing up camp.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{standard}} {{methods for}} officiating a basketball game, either [...] "two-person" [...] or [...] "three-person" [...] mechanics {{depending on how}} many officials are available to work the game. In [...] "two-person" [...] mechanics, each official works either the lead or the trail position. The lead position is normally along the baseline of the court, with the trail position having its starting point at the free throw line extended {{on the left side}} of the court facing the basket. Officials do change position a lot during the game to cover the area in the best possible way. As the game transitions from one end of the court to the other, the lead becomes the trail and vice versa. Between the two positions, each is responsible for a specific part of the court as well as two each of the <b>side,</b> <b>base</b> or back court lines. Officials change position after certain calls (mostly when the lead official calls a defensive foul). This allows officials to alternate between positions to increase the speed of play; one official will approach the bench whilst another, usually the closest to the bench at that time, will move to occupy his position. This also prevents one official from always working one particular team's basket throughout the course of the game.|$|E
50|$|From {{the west}} <b>side</b> <b>base</b> {{there is a}} scenic walking track which {{traverses}} large granite outcrops and leads to the summit of Pine Mountain. Access to the walking track is achieved along a 5 km dry weather only 4WD track from {{the entrance of the}} park. The walk is very difficult and requires a high level of Australian bush craft skills, mountaineering experience, advanced navigational skills, and a very high level of physical fitness. The walk to the summit is long and extremely strenuous with a number of steep rock climbs and descents, it is advised that only extremely fit persons attempt this walk, and rock climbing skills and experience are advised to complete this walk. The weather is capable of changing very rapidly so it is necessary to be prepared with warm and waterproof clothing, high energy food supplies and sufficient water. The reasonably worn walking track is a 12 km trip, 8 hrs return (or longer, especially if less than perfectly fit or weighed down with equipment). It is marked out with numerous markers on trees and cairns (ducks). The track is sometimes poorly defined so it is necessary that a map and compass is carried, and are used by a properly trained and experienced user. The summit area offers panoramic views of the surrounding Murray River Valleys and the Snowy Mountains, NSW. For the less adventurous there is also a small walk of 2 km, 1hr return, to Rocky Knob.|$|E
5000|$|Paramelania damoni. Shell solid, imperforate, ovate turreted, white, {{covered with}} an olive-brown epidermis, prettily {{sculptured}} with fine yet distinct wavy lines of increment, and {{more or less}} distinct transverse impressed striae. Whorls 10, very concave at the upper part, the concavity occupying about {{one third of the}} whorl; concavity smooth, merely exhibiting the epidermal sculpture; rest of the whorls coarsely plicated and spirally ridged. Plicae rather acute, about 12 in number on the penultimate whorl, a little oblique on the last, and becoming obsolete about the middle. Spiral lirae rather slender, equal, continuous on and between the plicae; 4 upon the upper volutions, and about 14 on the last. The uppermost, which defines {{the upper end of the}} costae, is produced into very short hollow scales or spines upon the ribs; and the second and sometimes the third have the same character in a less marked degree. Aperture obliquely ovate, occupying about half the length of the shell, covered with a slight callus deposit far within, not quite obscuring the external coloration. Outer lip somewhat expanded, much thickened within, white, concave above, arcuate at the <b>side.</b> <b>Base</b> also thickened and, together with the lower extremity of the whorl, forming a broad, retroverted, and very short cauda. Upper end of labrum joined to the base by a rather thick defined callosity, which spreads over the body-whorl within the mouth. Length 35 millim., diam. above the aperture 16; aperture 15 long, 9 broad. Operculum black, closing the aperture, but at some distance from the peristome.|$|E

30|$|Code {{division}} {{multiple access}} (CDMA) has become standard in several wireless communication systems from IS- 95, UMTS wideband CDMA (WCDMA) to HSPA, and so on [1 – 3]. Although being introduced more than 50 years ago, CDMA is still largely employed and developed nowadays due to its various advantages such as enabling universal frequency reuse, improving handover performance by soft-handover, and mitigating the effects of interference and fading. The performance assessment of such networks is of significant importance. In addition, the architecture of WCDMA systems still has room for improvement, especially at the uplink receiver <b>side</b> (<b>base</b> station) [4, 5].|$|E
40|$|SOI {{technology}} provides several unique {{advantages for}} integrating deep-sub-micron CMOS and lateral bipolar technologies, and high performance Complementary BiCMOS {{process has been}} demonstrated. However, even though the inherent bipolar action between the drain and source junctions of a MOSFET in SOI CMOS technology allows the formation of Lateral Bipolar Transistors with minimal effort, base definition and base contact are usually very difficult. In this paper, a new bipolar device structure fabricated using a SOI CMOS process is studied. The new base contact scheme is scalable with channel width, thus giving higher performance compared with the <b>side</b> <b>base</b> contact scheme...|$|E
40|$|Vehicular Communication Networks (VCNs) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are {{emerging}} types of networks, which have individually been extensively explored. However, their cooperation and exploring advantages offered by their integration are unexplored topics. Such integration help better investigate impacts of human mobility and transportation behaviours on safety {{and well-being of}} cities, their residents, their surrounding environments, and ecology. In this chapter we propose a quality-aware data aggregation technique for wireless sensor networks cooperating with vehicular communication networks, which fast, reliably, and energy efficiently aggregates sensor data and sends the aggregated value to road <b>side</b> <b>base</b> stations. Ensuring quality of service parameters has been put forward as an essential consideration for wireless sensor networks, which are often deployed in unattended and open environments and are characterized by their limited resources. To this end, in-network data aggregation is an efficient solution to save energy and bandwidth and to provide meaningful information to end-users...|$|E

30|$|With the {{introduction}} of Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems to high-speed train communications [10], the handover delay could be significantly reduced to less than 1 second [11]. Due to the limited uplink resource and inadequate uplink scheduling, the LTE system may still suffer from frequent handover failures caused by unreliable uplink measurement reports at high mobility. Furthermore, for a train with hundreds of passengers, {{a large amount of}} handover requests in a short time may easily leads to signaling congestions. To address this issue, there are numerous interests in adopting LTE-based mobile relays dedicated for high speed train scenario [12] where user traffics are aggregated by a mobile relay fixed {{on the top of a}} train carriage and then communicated to the track <b>side</b> <b>base</b> stations (BS). The system only needs to maintain one high-mobility link between the mobile relay and the track-side BS, e.g. the mobile backhaul, instead of hundreds of individual access links. Mobile relay can reduce the possibility of signaling congestions, but it still requires a large overlapped cell boundary area for smooth handovers.|$|E
40|$|A good {{understanding}} of the fading characteristics in high speed railway environment {{is essential for the}} design of a high reliable railway wireless network. In this paper, measurements have been taken in both high speed viaduct and terrain cutting scenarios using track <b>side</b> <b>base</b> stations (BSs) of the railway wireless network in China. The measurement sites have been chosen with special care; thus the whole measured route can be characterized either by viaduct or terrain cutting. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test has been first introduced in the statistical analysis to find out which is the most appropriate model for the small scale fading envelope. Though both Rice and Nakagami distributions provide a good fit to the first-order envelope data in both scenarios, only the Rice model generally fits the second-order statistics data accurately. For the viaduct scenario, higher Rice K factor can be observed. The change tendency of the K factor as a function of distance in the two scenarios is completely different. It can be concluded that the over bridges which span the railway tracks in terrain cutting scenario would affect the Rice K value severely...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of cavities present in protein–DNA and protein–RNA complexes is presented. In {{terms of the}} number of cavities and their total volume, the interfaces formed in these complexes are akin to those in transient protein–protein heterocomplexes. With homodimeric proteins protein–DNA interfaces may contain cavities involving both the protein subunits and DNA, and these are more than twice as large as cavities involving a single protein subunit and DNA. A parameter, cavity index, measuring the degree of surface complementarity, indicates that the packing of atoms in protein–protein/DNA/RNA is very similar, but it is about two times less efficient in the permanent interfaces formed between subunits in homodimers. As within the tertiary structure and protein–protein interfaces, protein–DNA interfaces have a higher inclination to be lined by b-sheet residues; from the DNA <b>side,</b> <b>base</b> atoms, in particular those in minor grooves, have a higher tendency to be located in cavities. The larger cavities tend to be less spherical and solvated. A small fraction of water molecules are found to mediate hydrogen-bond interactions with both the components, suggesting their primary role is to fill in the void left due to the local non-complementary nature of the surface patches...|$|E
