5|$|As {{attendance}} at ISMB {{grew in the}} late 1990s, several satellite meetings and <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> (SIG) meetings formed alongside the main conference. SIG meetings are held over {{one or two days}} before the main conference and focus on a specific topic, allowing more detailed discussion than there would be time for in the main conference. Notable SIG meetings include the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC), which has been held annually since 2000 and Bio-Ontologies, which has been held annually since 1998. Satellite meetings are usually two days long and are held in conjunction with ISMB. The 12th CAMDA conference and the 9th 3DSIG meeting were held as satellite meetings of ISMB/ECCB 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{program had}} some loose ends that {{manifested}} themselves later. Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts. Critics {{noted that the}} refugees had become a <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> that fostered resentment. The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village, hoping to maintain social continuity. In some cases, Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas. Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps {{on the outskirts of}} the capital, wanting to live an urban lifestyle, and objecting to Diem's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed. On occasions, the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem's residence. Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory. This was efficient in the short run but meant that they would never assimilate into southern society. They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt, sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag. Peter Hansen, an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion, has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present, due to issues of regionalism and local traditions. Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co-religionists, and were more likely to see non-Catholics as a threat. He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more willing to listen to the advice of priests on a wide range of issues, not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters. These differences and the sense of segregation persist to the current day.|$|E

After Miller was elected Mayor in November 2003, the new council voted to cancel the previous Council's decision, stopping the bridge project.|$|E

25|$|In early 1984, Ben Baker was {{planning}} on starting a BBS for the newly forming computer club at the McDonnell Douglas automotive division in St. Louis. Baker {{was part of the}} CP/M <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> within the club. He intended to use the seminal, CP/M-hosted, CBBS system, and went looking for a machine to run it on. The club's president told Baker that DEC would be giving them a Rainbow 100 computer on indefinite loan, so he made plans to move the CBBS onto this machine. The Rainbow contained two processors, an Intel 8088 and a Zilog Z80, allowing it to run both MS-DOS and CP/M, with the BBS running on the latter. When the machine arrived, they learned that the Z80 side had no access to the I/O ports, so CBBS could not communicate with a modem. While searching for software that would run on the MS-DOS side of the system, Baker learned of Fido through Madil.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} of {{conventional}} PCI found in consumer desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33MHz bus clock and 5V signalling, although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well. These have one locating notch in the card. Version 2.0 of the PCI standard introduced 3.3V slots, physically distinguished by a flipped physical connector to preventing accidental insertion of 5V cards. Universal cards, which can operate on either voltage, have two notches. Version 2.1 of the PCI standard introduced optional 66MHz operation. A server-oriented variant of conventional PCI, called PCI-X (PCI Extended) operated at frequencies up to 133MHz for PCI-X 1.0 and up to 533MHz for PCI-X 2.0. An internal connector for laptop cards, called Mini PCI, was introduced in version 2.2 of the PCI specification. The PCI bus was also adopted for an external laptop connector standard the CardBus. The first PCI specification was developed by Intel, but subsequent development of the standard became {{the responsibility of the}} PCI <b>Special</b> <b>Interest</b> <b>Group</b> (PCI-SIG).|$|E
40|$|I {{examine the}} funding of {{election}} candidates by <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> and parties {{in the context of}} open-seat races for the U. S. House of Representatives. I address two principal questions about contributor behavior. First, why do <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> fund election campaigns? Second, how do contributors, such as parties and <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> learn during an election campaign where to best spend their money? My empirical analysis focuses on open-seat general elections for the U. S. House from 1984 to 2000. I resolve a controversy in the campaign finance literature about the motives of <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> when funding election campaigns. I show that in open-seat races most <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> act like the parties and give money primarily to maximize the expected number of seats won by each group‚Äôs preferred party. In particular, corporate political action committees (PACs) allocate their contributions to candidates {{in the same manner as}} the Republican party, and labor PACs act like the Democratic party. I also show that some PACs fund candidates from their less preferred party and do so in a manner consistent with seeking private benefits. Most money in open-seats is partisan money which is given by <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
