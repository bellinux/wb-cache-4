5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, {{who had worked}} in the Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> he was about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening.|$|E

However, Callum has decided to join the LM, against the wishes of his mother, and he does not read the letter until just before Sephy leaves.

500|$|Chasing Vermeer is Blue Balliett's first {{published}} book. Its original purpose {{was a book}} to read to her class for fun. She realized that a mystery about [...] "real" [...] art issues had not been written since E.L. Konigsburg's From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and desired to write what she wished to read. Chasing Vermeer took about five years to complete, as Balliett was also a teacher and parent. She compared writing the book to weaving, as she first wrote mainly about art, but then incorporated the pentominoes and classroom scenes, creating many different levels to read on. She admits that it ended up more complex than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> it would be.|$|E
500|$|On January 14, 1993, a {{page-one}} {{story in}} The New York Times {{broke the news}} that Baird had hired a married pair of illegal aliens from Peru, Lillian and Victor Cordero, between 1990 and 1992. [...] The Peruvian woman served as the nanny for Baird's son and the Peruvian man as a part-time driver. Furthermore, Baird had not paid Social Security taxes for the couple, until making a lump-sum payment earlier in January 1993. Baird had brought forward this information willingly to transition officials and authorities performing background checks; she said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> {{that the fact that}} they were sponsoring the couple for citizenship made the hiring acceptable, and that they could not pay the taxes for people who were not yet in the country legally. [...] (Baird's immigration lawyer would dispute some aspects of exactly when the sponsorship request took place.) ...|$|E
500|$|On {{her wedding}} day to Riley, Mercedes {{was the one who}} exposes the affair. Metcalfe said this was because when Mercedes looked into Riley's eyes she [...] "couldn't help it" [...] because of her love for him, and because Jacqui's {{entrance}} [...] "just tipped her over the edge". Metcalfe {{went on to say that}} she did not think Mercedes [...] "thought about it" [...] when revealing the affair, but if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> it through she would not have revealed the secret. Metcalfe postulated that there would be [...] "huge repercussions" [...] from the events, explaining that her following storylines [...] "all stem from the wedding". Metcalfe added that she did not [...] "fancy" [...] the chances of a reunion for Mercedes and Riley although the actress would have liked one. Metcalfe commented that she [...] "loved" [...] the storyline and with working with Norbury.|$|E

500|$|However, {{she soon}} {{came to realize}} that writing a book about Madonna would not be as easy as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought.</b> There was already {{abundant}} material available about her life and career and Simone could not find anything else left to be said in her book. The author hoped of [...] "finding some tiny stone left unturned in the giant gravel pit of Madonna studies". She even had to return her book advance given by her publisher for failing to write the biography. Unable to produce a biography, Simone instead decided to pursue a different direction with the material. The author, who had already released the novel called Note to Self (2009) and is also a musician, wanted to focus on her own singing career, self-declared as a [...] "failure". She confessed having a personal affinity for [...] "underdog" [...] musicians, an understanding which was totally opposite to what Madonna stood for with her success.|$|E
500|$|On Good Friday in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and {{six other}} women went to a strip club in Riverside and paid for lap dances. Instead of {{accepting}} the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling {{them that they were}} loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there. One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> that she would be rejected. The woman accepted a prayer from Albee and hugged her. Albee would later say that talking with women at the strip club that first day changed her life. Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls, with [...] "JC" [...] standing for Jesus Christ. They made Matthew's House the parent organization, but decided to operate primarily under the name [...] "JC's Girls" [...] because Veitch believed that strippers would not understand the meaning of the name [...] "Matthew's House".|$|E

[...] Alex Catarinella of The Huffington Post deemed it as her greatest and most mature work, and said the video was ultimately simple in its concept, and added, [...] "The once picture-perfect pop star has returned and is offering fans the new, worn-and-torn and yes, stronger than yesterday Britney." [...] The use of product placement received criticism from the media. Megan Gibson of Time said that the video was [...] "borderline insulting" [...] and commented, [...] "we get that it's hard economic times all around, but couldn't they have been a tad more subtle with ?". Liz Kelly of The Washington Post called the clip [...] "an infomercial" [...] and said, [...] "I would write more, but suddenly {{feel the need to}} put on some Make Up Forever and dash out to buy a Sony flat screen TV."

500|$|Hearsay and {{conjecture}} have clouded {{assessment of}} the Duchess of Windsor's life, not helped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was {{anything other than a}} victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, [...] "she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he threw up his position {{to spend the rest of}} his life with her." [...] Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that [...] "left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated.

Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought, suddenly she warned him, in a letter, 'You and I can only create disaster together'... she predicted to society hostess Sibyl Colefax, 'two people will suffer' because of 'the workings of a system'...

[...] Spears also wanted her real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick to play the criminal. Marrs Piliero was initially hesitant to cast Trawick feeling that a professional actor would do a better job, but did not talk to Spears about it. He told USA Today, [...] "When you're doing nudity, I don't think {{it was at the}} top of Britney's list to bring in some random guy while her boyfriend watches. [...] We definitely wanted to make some passionate, steamy scenes, but we also wanted it to be intensely beautiful. We didn't want to go for raunchy. We wanted it to be sensual and steamy." [...] On September 6, 2011, Spears announced through her Twitter account that she had decided to shoot the video [...] "in the streets of merry old England when I get there." [...] In an interview with AOL, she explained, [...] "I've never shot on location out of the country of America for a video. So, it should be very interesting.

On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to [...] "whip my hair {{back and forth on}} stage," [...] referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice. The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> to herself, [...] "Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be [...] distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the {{performance was}} [...] "surprisingly" [...] sparse compared to Gaga's previous [...] "over-the-top" [...] endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the [...] "highly expected" [...] performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography. Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as [...] "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards. Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was {{one of the highlights of}} the show.

Catherine suggested Henry should use the coat as his battle-banner, and wrote that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> to send him the body too, but 'Englishmen's hearts would not suffer it.' It was suggested that James' body would be her exchange with Henry for his French prisoner, the Duke of Longueville. Longueville had been captured at Thérouanne by John Clarke of North Weston, sent to Catherine, and lodged in the Tower of London.

2500|$|One of Eliade's {{earliest}} fiction writings, {{the controversial}} first-person narrative Isabel şi apele diavolului, {{focused on the}} figure of a young and brilliant academic, whose self-declared fear is that of [...] "being common".

The guest of a pastor, the scholar ponders sexual adventures with his host's wife, servant girl, and finally with his daughter Isabel. Persuading the pastor's adolescent son to run away from home, becoming the sexual initiator of a twelve-year-old girl and the lover of a much older woman, the character also attempts to seduce Isabel. Although she falls in love, the young woman does not give in to his pressures, but eventually allows herself to be abused and impregnated by another character, letting the object of her affection know that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> of him all along.|$|E
