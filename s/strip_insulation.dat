2500|$|Guiyu in the Shantou {{region of}} China {{is a massive}} {{electronic}} waste processing community. It {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "e-waste capital of the world." [...] Traditionally, Guiyu was an agricultural community; however, in the mid-1990s it transformed into an e-waste recycling center involving over 75% of the local households and an additional 100,000 migrant workers. Thousands of individual workshops employ laborers to snip cables, pry chips from circuit boards, grind plastic computer cases into particles, and dip circuit boards in acid baths to dissolve the precious metals. Others work to <b>strip</b> <b>insulation</b> from all wiring in an attempt to salvage tiny amounts of copper wire. Uncontrolled burning, disassembly, and disposal has led to a number of environmental problems such as groundwater contamination, atmospheric pollution, and water pollution either by immediate discharge or from surface runoff (especially near coastal areas), as well as health problems including occupational safety and health effects among those directly and indirectly involved, due to the methods of processing the waste.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{theoretical}} studies of heat-shielding {{properties of the}} angle of external wall a residential building are presented. The brick wall thickness of 510 mm was considered. The studies were performed for the I-st temperature zone of Ukraine. Heat insulation was located on the external side of enclosure. Thermal protection problems of the angle are consideration {{of the impact of}} heat-conductive inclusion on adjusted heat transfer resistance of enclosure. Conductive inclusion on the external angle area is its configuration. An additional layer of insulation in the angle area is necessary to use for bringing the level of thermal protection of angle area to the standards. The results of calculations of two-dimensional temperature fields were used for the analysis of thermal protection. Two options for additional insulation were studied. The first option: continuous <b>strip</b> <b>insulation</b> covering the external wall angle. Another one provides division of additional insulation layer into two parts and displacement them from the angle within the design scheme. Studies were performed for different thickness of additional insulation. There was additionally taking into account the value of insulation displacement from the angle for the second option. The optimal location and size of additional insulation were determined. The minimum amount of additional insulation under which the thermal protection requirements are performed was accepted like optimality criterion...|$|E

50|$|Tinsel wire is {{commonly}} connected to equipment with crimped terminal lugs that pierce the insulation {{to make contact}} with the metal ribbons, rather than <b>stripping</b> <b>insulation.</b> Separated from the core, the individual ribbons are relatively fragile, and the core can be damaged by high temperatures. These factors make it difficult or impractical to terminate tinsel wire by soldering during equipment manufacture, although soldering is possible, with some difficulty, to repair a failed connection. However, the conductors tend to break at their junction with the rigid solder.|$|R

50|$|A laser wire {{stripper}} is a computer-controlled machine, {{much like a}} CNC router, which uses a laser to burn off the insulation of the wire. Laser wire stripping machines are used mostly for very fine gauge wires since they do not damage the conductor. A typical CO2 laser wire stripping machine should be capable of <b>stripping</b> the <b>insulation</b> from any size wire.|$|R

Brooks is the next victim, this time {{the cause of death}} being a fatal dose of morpha.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of AS-Interface installations utilize the AS-Interface flat cable, defined {{as part of the}} AS-Interface specifications. A relatively small number of industries (e.g. valve control in process automation) use a round cable, mostly because it is easier to pull through conduit. While the shape of the cable does not matter (any other cable can be used) the electrical characteristics of the selected cable matters greatly. To prevent problems due to improper cable, most professionals suggest the AS-Interface flat cable. This cable is designed to make use of a cable piercing technology. When an AS-Interface module is installed on the network, piercing needles penetrate the cable jacket and displace the internal copper strands without cutting them. This allows AS-Interface modules to be installed anywhere on the network without cutting and preparing (i.e. removing cable jacket, <b>stripping</b> <b>insulation</b> and possibly applying a ferule) the cable first. The result is a faster installation without the chance of inadvertent shorts between the leads.|$|R
50|$|Punch-down blocks are a {{very quick}} and easy way to connect wiring, {{as there is no}} <b>stripping</b> of <b>insulation</b> and no screws to loosen and tighten. Punch-down blocks are often used as patch panels, or as {{breakout}} boxes for PBX or other similar key phone systems with a 50-pin RJ21 (Amphenol) connector. They are sometimes used in other audio applications, such as in reconfigurable patch panels.|$|R

50|$|The {{terminal}} {{consists of}} a spring-loaded metallic pincher which opens when the level is pressed, and when released will tightly grip the conductor which has been inserted into it. This type of terminal is popular {{because it does not}} require any special connector to be applied {{to the end of the}} wire; instead the wire is simply <b>stripped</b> of <b>insulation</b> on its end and inserted into the terminal. This terminal may be used with a variety of wire gauges as well as with either solid core or stranded wires.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- A {{critique}} of the World Trade Center investigation {{with respect to the}} cause of the collapse of towers 1 and 2 is presented. The official investigation conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) concluded that the collapse was due to the fires heating the core columns that were <b>stripped</b> of <b>insulation</b> by the aircraft impacts. An alternative cause is considered that puts the cause on insufficient insulation of the steel truss floor members. Evidence for the latter is supported by NIST analysis of a truss member, Underwriter Laboratory furnace tests of the floor assembly, and engineering calculations and scale model tests conducted at the University of Maryland.

50|$|Since <b>stripping</b> the <b>insulation</b> from wires is time-consuming, many {{connectors}} {{intended for}} rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors so that insulation {{need not be}} removed from the wire. These generally {{take the form of a}} fork-shaped opening in the terminal, into which the insulated wire is pressed and which cut through the insulation to contact the conductor within. To make these connections reliably on a production line, special tools are used which accurately control the forces applied during assembly. If properly assembled, the resulting terminations are gas-tight and will last the life of the product. A common example is the multi-conductor flat ribbon cable used in computer disk drives; to terminate each of the many (approximately 40) wires individually would be slow and error-prone, but an insulation displacement connector can terminate all the wires in (literally) one stroke. Another very common use is so-called punch-down blocks used for terminating telephone wiring.|$|R

It’s as if places like those I had visited had not just closed but had been abandoned to an encroaching wilderness, with nothing taking their place. We see the remains of resorts like Grossinger’s or the Pines being gradually assailed by entropy or subsumed by natural surroundings. <b>Strips</b> of <b>insulation</b> drop from ceilings; moss and fern sprout from moist carpets; graffiti and plunder deface grand spaces. Some photographs also seem to be commenting on earlier vanity or vulgarity: In one, bar stools with turquoise cushions stand in a row like shunned roués, rusting in the wreckage. These images are affectionate without being nostalgic. The wreckage they show is almost lush with new growth. And while they really can’t compete with history’s vast iconography of ruin, their effect is unusual: The landscape of abandonment still retains signs of vitality — and we’re aware of the remarkable impact that this vitality had on American popular culture." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the Lynch motor {{armature}} is significantly different compared to other types of motor. The armature coils are formed from insulated copper strips each in a 'U' shape (like a tuning fork). One leg is then bent 45 degrees clockwise, while the other leg is bent 45 degrees anticlockwise. Each coil leg contains several bends before reaching {{the outside of the}} armature to be able to pass radially through the ferrite ring before the ends finish 90 degree apart. At the outer edge each copper strip has a crimp forming an electrical connection to its companion 90 degrees rotated. The inner edge of the copper <b>strips</b> have the <b>insulation</b> removed on the front face only, to form the commutator surface where the brushes make contact.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the low △ value of {{dual-band}} terahertz MPA formed by dual-layer stack of Au <b>strips</b> and <b>insulation</b> dielectric layers {{backed by a}} continuous Au plane. Two nearly perfect absorption peaks with discrete distance of only 0.30 THz are obtained. The △ value of device is 13.33 %, which is only 1 / 4 of the previous minimum value of MPAs, and the △ value can be tuned through dimension change of the Au strips. Its △ value {{can be reduced to}} only 6.45 %, which is far less than that of previous MPAs. A narrow discrete distance or low △ value of the dual-band MPA is caused by the ultra-narrow bandwidth of each resonance band. We furthermore present two low △ values of triple-band MPA through stacking one more Au strip. Two narrow discrete distances of only 0.14 THz and 0.17 THz in three nearly perfect absorption peaks can be realized; the △ values of adjacent frequencies of triple-band MPAs are respectively 6.57 % and 7.22 %, which are both smaller than that of previous works. Low △ values of these MPAs can find a number of applications in the study of some implicit information in the areas of off-resonance absorption.|$|R
50|$|The {{scheme was}} {{designed}} to export power from coal-fired power stations on Sardinia to the Italian mainland, and thus was only required to operate in one direction. Although the converter stations are inherently capable of operating in either direction of power transmission, advantage was taken of the unidirectional power-flow requirement to economise {{on the design of}} the sea electrodes. The sea return current enters the sea at the Sardinian end (Anode) and leaves the sea at the mainland end (Cathode). The mainland electrode consists of bare copper (a section of insulated copper cable with the <b>insulation</b> <b>stripped</b> off), which would corrode rapidly if used as an anode but suffers no degradation when used as a cathode. However, the anode electrode on Sardinia required a more sophisticated design using platinum-coated titanium pipe, subdivided into 30 sub-electrodes, in order to prevent corrosion.|$|R
30|$|We next explore {{whether the}} {{combination}} of these narrow bandwidth of MPAs has the ability to realize the low △ value of multiple-band MPAs. A vertically stacked design concept, as a kind of frequently used method, is employed to obtain the multiple-band MPAs. An example of the simplest kind is the case of dual-band absorption. Figure 1 c gives the side-view of the structure model of the dual-band absorption. As shown, two layers of metallic <b>strip</b> resonators and <b>insulation</b> dielectric slabs are alternately stacked on a metallic ground plane. The lengths of two Au strips are respectively l 1 [*]=[*] 36 [*]μm and l 2 [*]=[*] 39 [*]μm; the widths of them are fixed as w[*]=[*] 8 [*]μm. The thicknesses of dielectric slabs are t 1 [*]=[*] 1.4 [*]μm and t 2 [*]=[*] 2 [*]μm. Other parameters of the dual-band MPA, including unit period, dielectric constant of the slab, thickness, and conductivity of Au strips, are the same as those of the single-band MPA.|$|R
50|$|Insulation {{paper or}} {{insulation}} foil is usually {{attached to the}} slots of the stator package before the insulated end plates are installed. The insulation material, e.g. Nomex or Mylar or Kapton, is taken from the endless strip. It is pre-hemmed, separated analogously {{to the length of}} the stator and inserted into the latter. It {{is important to note that}} the <b>insulation</b> <b>strip</b> must always be slightly longer than the stator package in order to guarantee complete insulation of the winding space towards the wire in consideration of the length tolerances of the stator package and the insulation paper. When this construction is applied, it is beneficial, that the insulation does not take up much space in the slot area. At high dielectric strength, an insulation thickness of merely 0.1 mm may be reached. Even at a material strength of only a few hundredths of a millimeter, Kapton foil may be integrated into the package. This in turn has a positive effect on the fill factor since more room is available for winding.|$|R
40|$|When {{homeowners are}} looking at ways to reduce energy costs, a common misperception is that solar {{applications}} are too expensive to be practical. However, {{as the cost of}} energy from fossil fuels increases, Americans can use solar energy to reduce their household energy costs. According to a 1993 government survey of residential energy use, American households spent an average of 4 percent of their yearly income on energy, which can be much higher for some families. For low-income families, this amount can rise to over 10 percent and become the second largest family expense after rent or the mortgage payment. This factsheet looks at solar additions, retrofits and construction techniques that are low-cost. These systems are described and compared to each other in terms of energy benefits, initial costs and ease of maintenance. Before investing in any of these systems, the most cost-effective home improvement is to caulk, weather <b>strip,</b> increase <b>insulation,</b> and install low-flow shower heads to maximize the energy efficiency of your home. All of the solar systems described below will have the greatest benefit if used in an energy efficient home. General Guidelines for Solar Systems All solar systems have three elements: a collector, heat storage and a distribution system. The collector is often a combination of glass or plastic glazing and an absorptive material to capture the sun’s energy. The collection surface must be facing south but can be up to 30 ° from true south and still be effective, {{depending on the type of}} system. The collected heat must then be distributed where it can be used or stored for later use. Distribution systems can be passive, where they depend on the natural movement of heated air and water, or they can be active, relying on a mechanical method to move heat, such as a pump or fan.

40|$|In {{this paper}} some options of how {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) can assist {{to expand the}} capabilities of conventional forming and joining technologies are discussed. Three different areas where EMF {{has the potential for}} a significant expansion of capabilities of traditional technologies are reviewed: 1) restrike operation to fill sharp corners of automotive panels; 2) low energy method of springback calibration; 3) joining of closed frames with an openable coil. Each of these applications was demonstrated in laboratory conditions and the description of the tooling is provided in the paper. Suggested design of a flat concentrator collecting induced electric currents from a flat coil was demonstrated for a corner filling operation and a springback calibration. An efficient technique of fabricating the flat coil from a flat plate by using water jetting technology enables a cost effective coil design, which can be reinforced by a system of non-conductive bars. The insulation of the coil is produced from the flat sheet of insulation material. Suggested design allows the coil to be repaired if a shortcut or fracture of <b>insulation</b> <b>strips</b> happens. A technology of low-energy calibration of stamped parts provides an option of working with a wider variety of materials including aluminum alloys, mild steels, and advanced high-strength steels. This technology is demonstrated for calibration of U-channels...|$|R
