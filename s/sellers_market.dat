50|$|Though the {{performance}} of APGenCo thermal power stations in terms of reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM analysis) {{is one of the}} best in India, its hydro power stations performance is not satisfactory as they break down frequently or not in working condition when required to perform at full capacity during the short period (four months) monsoon season. The thermal efficiency (heat rate) of thermal power stations is not satisfactory to attain close to the rated / design values which is deciding parameter in the competitive electricity market (buyers market) whereas the fuel (coal) is costly in <b>sellers</b> <b>market.</b> Operating the thermal power stations in the range of 75 to 100% capacity in 'frequency follow mode' with good part load efficiency is the needful strategy in surplus electricity grid except during peak demand hours. Also Hydro power stations should perform well meeting all the functions such as power factor correction, peaking power generation, pumping water in pump mode and secondary power generation during monsoon season utilising total available water. This can be achieved by maintaining hydro power stations at availability more than 95%.|$|E
5000|$|Today, futurists {{who speak}} of [...] "post-scarcity" [...] suggest economies based on {{advances}} in automated manufacturing technologies, often including {{the idea of}} self-replicating machines, the adoption of division of labour which in theory could produce nearly all goods in abundance, given adequate raw materials and energy. More speculative forms of nanotechnology (such as molecular assemblers or nanofactories, which do not currently exist) raise the possibility of devices that can automatically manufacture any specified goods given the correct instructions and the necessary raw materials and energy, and so many nanotechnology enthusiasts have suggested it will usher in a post-scarcity world. In the more near-term future, the increasing automation of physical labor using robots is often discussed as means of creating a post-scarcity economy. Increasingly versatile forms of rapid prototyping machines, and a hypothetical self-replicating version of such a machine known as a RepRap, have also been predicted to help create the abundance of goods needed for a post-scarcity economy. Advocates of self-replicating machines such as Adrian Bowyer, {{the creator of the}} RepRap project, argue that once a self-replicating machine is designed, then since anyone who owns one can make more copies to sell (and would also be free to ask for a lower price than other <b>sellers),</b> <b>market</b> competition will naturally drive the cost of such machines down to the bare minimum needed to make a profit, in this case just above the cost of the physical materials and energy that must be fed into the machine as input, and the same should go for any other goods that the machine can build.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a farmer-processor relationship, where market power is bidirectional: {{processors}} have buyer {{as well as}} <b>seller</b> <b>market</b> power. Farmers supply a homogeneous raw input to the processors, which, in turn, process it into a horizontally differentiated product. The analysis shows that the spread between prices that both parties receive can be decomposed into two components: one due to buyer market power in the agricultural input market and one due to <b>seller</b> <b>market</b> power in the differentiated processed market. Farmers receive a decreasing dollar share of the final price as concentration in the processed good market increases. On the other hand, the price spread due to processors' buyer (<b>seller)</b> <b>market</b> power decreases (increases) when farmers' transportation costs shrink and when consumers' strength for brand preference increases. We also examine welfare: while the surplus of farmers serving a specific processor is adversely affected in a more concentrated processed good market, the total surplus of farmers serving all processors is independent of the industry concentration. In addition, consumers are worse off when the processed good market is more concentrated and farmers' transportation costs are larger. While stronger brand preference implies a larger "travel cost" for consumers, it may encourage more processors to join the market and provide more varieties. buyer market power, horizontal differentiation, Agribusiness, Industrial Organization, Marketing, D 43, L 13, M 31, Q 13,...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} reinforcement learning (RL) techniques {{to the problem of}} determining dy-namic prices in an electronic retail market. As representa-tive models, we consider a single <b>seller</b> <b>market</b> and a two <b>seller</b> <b>market,</b> and formulate the dynamic pricing problem in a setting that easily generalizes to markets with more than two sellers. We first formulate the single seller dy-namic pricing problem in the RL framework and solve the problem using the Q-learning algorithm through simula-tion. Next we model the two seller dynamic pricing prob-lem as a Markovian game and formulate the problem in the RL framework. We solve this problem using actor-critic al-gorithms through simulation. We believe our approach to solving these problems is a promising way of setting dy-namic prices in multi-agent environments. We illustrate the methodology with two illustrative examples of typical retail markets. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} “marketing avoidance ” – consumer efforts to conceal themselves and to deflect marketing. The setting is one where <b>sellers</b> <b>market</b> some item through solicitations to potential consumers, who differ in their benefit from the item and suffer harm from receiving solicitations. We find that seller solicitations are a strategic complement with concealment by low-benefit consumers: efforts by low-benefit consumers to conceal themselves will increase the cost-effectiveness of solicitations and lead sellers to market more. However, concealment by high-benefit consumers leads sellers to market less. Concealment causes solicitations to be shifted to other consumers, while deflection does not. We show that concealment by low-benefit consumers increases the overall expected harm. To {{the extent that the}} increase in consumer harm outweighs the gain in seller revenue, concealment is also socially worse than deflection. In general, unless the benefit from the marketed item is large relative to the harm caused by solicitations, deflection is socially preferable to concealment...|$|E

We find that in markets where the marginal cost of solicitation is sufficiently low, efforts by low-benefit consumers to conceal themselves will increase the cost-effectiveness of solicitations and lead sellers to market more. However, concealment by high-benefit consumers leads sellers to market less.

Functions of a Market Markets {{play a central role}} in the economy, facilitating the exchange of information, goods, services and payments. In the process, they create economic value for buyers, <b>sellers,</b> <b>market</b> intermediaries and for society at large. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the role of information technology in markets, both in traditional markets, and in the emergence of electronic marketplaces, such as the multitude of Internet-based online auctions. Markets (electronic or otherwise) have three main functions, summarized in Table 1 : (a) matching buyers and sellers; (b) facilitating the exchange of information, goods, services and payments associated with market transactions; and (c) providing an institutional infrastructure, such as a legal and regulatory framework, that enables the efficient functioning of the market. In a modern economy, the first two functions are provided by intermediaries, while the institutional infrastructure is typically the province of governments. Internet-based electronic marketplaces leverage information technology to perform the above functions with increased effectiveness and reduced transaction costs, resulting in more efficient, “frictionfree” markets...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the emergence of}} African-European business relationships. Its {{focus is on the}} role of bargaining power and information technology {{and its impact on the}} different stakeholders in (electronic) markets (<b>sellers,</b> <b>market</b> maker, buyers). Information technology is seen as an enabling technology that facilitates reaching a wider customer base (called reach) and providing a channel for increased customer services (called richness). The central question is how African suppliers can create bargaining power by means of information technology and therefore enter and improve their position in European markets. Research is carried out in the flower industry. In this industry African flower growers create competitive advantage and develop business relationships with European buyers (wholesalers, retailers). In this article we investigate three flower markets (Tele Flower Auction, FloraHolland Auction, and Aalsmeer Auction), the role of African flower growers, and the use and impact of information technology in these markets. The results of our research show that there are potentials for African flower growers to enter the European flower markets and to increase their position of bargaining power. A first potential is using and implementing information technology for the access to new and large European markets. African flower growers use information technology to streamline transaction processes and lower transaction costs. A second potential is related to the quality and specificity of the produced flower products. Information technology can remove the quality uncertainty of products and can provide rich information services to buyers. The results in the flower industry suggest that information technology provides opportunities for the African producers to expand the reach and richness of their product and service offerings, thus creating economic value.

40|$|Major {{clients of}} the {{construction}} industry {{have been found to}} organise construction work into fewer, but larger, contracts with more transfer of risk and responsibilities in response to a change from a <b>sellers</b> <b>market</b> to a buyers market, and facing a greater choice of procurement methods than ever before. Main contractors and consultants alike are moving towards multidisciplinary teams offering design and management services, challenging single service consultants or contractors and are in competition with each other over who is leading the process. A consolidation of firms at {{the upper end of the}} industry can be witnessed in order to access a wider market and new clients, and at the lower end a specialisation into specific skills or locations takes place, while medium sized firms are increasingly struggling to survive. A general procurement model serves to identify the appropriate procurement approach for construction needs, as neither clients or construction service suppliers represent a homogenous market. Clients demands for a ready purchase of design, procurement and management of construction from a single source have been found to be met most appropriately by contractor-led procurement under most, but not all, circumstances, particularly in respect of higher levels of efficiency, cost certainty and punctuality among other benefits. The consequences faced by a contractor in the leading role of the procurement process are significant, especially in terms of integrating and co-ordinating the entire supply chain to the satisfaction of the client and for anticipated repeat business. This is the chief factor of competitive strength for the struggle of long term survival. A classification model of procurement strategies in respect to parameters of supply risk, strategic importance and frequency of spend offers a tool for the appropriate choice of business relationship with different suppliers. It is to be anticipated that the future will see an intensification of the changes in the processes of construction procurement described and analysed, which may vary in extent from one market to another, but not in direction...|$|E
