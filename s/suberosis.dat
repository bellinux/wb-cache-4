40|$|ABSTRACTExtrinsic Allergic Alveolitis (EAA) is an immunologically {{mediated}} interstitial {{lung disease}} that may result from repeated inhalation of many different environmental agents. Heterogeneity of the clinical presentation and bronchoalveolar lavage profiles has been described, possibly related to different occupational exposures. The aim of our study was to compare bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), clinical, functional and radiological characteristics {{of the two most}} frequent forms of EAA seen in our practice: <b>Suberosis</b> and Bird Fancier’s Disease (BFD). We included 81 patients with <b>Suberosis,</b> {{with a mean age of}} 38. 8 ± 11. 3 years and a mean exposure of 20. 0 ± 10. 5 years and 32 patients with BFD, with a mean age of 46. 3 ± 11. 8 years and mean exposure of 10. 5 ± 1. 0 years. Patients with BFD had more acute forms, while subacute and chronic presentations predominated in <b>Suberosis.</b> Restrictive defect was the most frequent pattern of lung function impairment, and more severe in BFD. Ground glass opacities were the most frequent pattern in high-resolution computed tomography. A normal chest x-ray was more frequently seen in <b>Suberosis.</b> Both types of EAA had lymphocytic alveolitis in BALF: <b>Suberosis</b> 6. 6 ± 5. 7 x 105 ml- 1 cells, 58. 8 ± 18. 9 % lymphocytes; bird fancier’s disease - 9. 0 ± 6. 5 x 105 ml- 1 cells, 61. 7 ± 22. 2 % lymphocytes. Although BALF CD 8 + lymphocytes predominated in both diseases, the proportion of CD 4 + and CD 4 /CD 8 ratios were significantly higher in Bird Fancier’s Disease (Suberosis: 0. 47 ± 0. 33 versus BFD: 1. 1 ± 1. 5; p < 0. 005). Moreover, BALF cellularity and mast cell counts were also significantly higher in BFD. In conclusion, <b>Suberosis</b> and bird fancier’s disease are EAA with different clinical and laboratory profiles, suggesting that despite their pathophysiological similarities, different antigenic exposures may cause different immune and inflammatory response dynamics in the lung.

40|$|AbstractSuberosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP) in Portugal. Compared with Bird Fancier’s Disease (BFD), {{patients}} with <b>Suberosis</b> have predominately subacute and chronic presentations of HP. Although BAL CD 8 + lymphocytes predominate in both diseases, CD 4 /CD 8 ratio is significantly higher in BFD. Apart from these interstitial forms, in the initial descriptions of <b>Suberosis</b> asthma-like syndromes were also reported. We have recently described cases of Cork worker’s Occupational Asthma, associated with bronchoalveolar eosinophilic inflammation. While patients with HP had high IgG reactivity tomoulds and especially recognized Penicillium glabrum antigens of molecular weight of 12 - 13. 5 kDa and 33 kDa, we could not find evidence of IgE sensitisation to these fungi in asthmatics. Cork worker’s Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis has a different clinical profile compared with Bird Fancier’s Disease, suggesting that different antigenic ex-posures may result in a different dynamic of the lung immune/inflammatory response. The identification of major antigens in cork worker’s HP (like those identified by immunoblotting in Penicillium glabrum) may be helpful to develop new diagnostic tests...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cork {{particles}} and fungus spores were commonly airborne in a cork factory in Portugal where some workers suffered from <b>suberosis.</b> Where cork was being handled and shaped, fungus spores were usually {{more common than}} cork particles. In a warehouse (Junddo) where cork had moulded, up to 54 x 106 spores/m 3 were general in the air, but workers handling the mouldy cork were exposed {{to as many as}} 128 x 10 * spores/m*. Cork particles were most common close to cutting and sanding machines, but seldom exceeded 2 x 10 * particles/m 3 air. The most abundant species were Penicillium frequentans Westling, P. granulatum Bain., Aphanocladium album (Preuss) W. Gams, Monilia sitophila (Mont.) Sacc. and Mucor plumbeus Bon. P. frequentans was common everywhere in the factory and mostly in units small enough to penetrate into alveoli...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTHyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) is a glycosamino-glycan {{present in}} the {{interstitial}} lung matrix, and produced by activated fibroblasts stimulated by several inflammatory mediators. The increase of hyaluronan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has been described in several experimental and human fibrotic lung diseases and associated with fibroblast activation. AimsTo Investigate the hypothesis that pulmonary fibroblast activation follows lung recruitment of T lymphocytes and mast cells in <b>Suberosis,</b> we measured BALF hyaluronan in 31 symptomatic cork workers with distinct clinicopathologic patterns. Patients and MethodsWe studied 31 patients with a clinical and occupational history, physical examination, chest X-ray, spirometry, body plethismography and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, resting blood gases and BAL. Patients were classified in two different syndromes according to clinical, functional criteria and BALF analysis: 20 with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and l I with obstructive lung disease (8 with bronchial asthma and 3 with chronic bronchitis). BALF hyaluronan Levels were measured by a radiometric assay, BALF Albumin and IgG by rate nephelometry and differential and mast cell counts performed in BALF cytospins. ResultsBALF hyaluronan levels were significantly higher in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, with a median (and interquartile range) of 67. 1 μg/L (33. 7 - 111. 5) versus 22. 7 μg/L (12. 8 - 40. 7) in patients with obstructive lung disease (p< 0. 01, Mann-Whitney). We found a significant correlation between BALF hyaJuronan, total cell numbers, albumin and IgG levels (p< 0. 02, Spearman correlation) and also with the total lymphocyte and mast cell counts (p< 0. 01). Moreover, we also found a significant inverse correlation between BALF hyaluronan, lung diffusion and Vital Capacity (DLCO rs = - 0, 58, VC rs = - 0, 61, p< 0. 002), and also with the ye. ars of exposure (rs = - 0. 45, p< 0, 05).

40|$|Cork oak is {{the second}} most {{dominant}} forest species in Portugal and makes this country the world leader in cork export. Occupational exposure to Chrysonilia sitophila and the Penicillium glabrum complex in cork industry is common, and the latter fungus is associated with <b>suberosis.</b> However, as conventional methods seem to underestimate its presence in occupational environments, the aim of our study was to see whether information obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a molecular-based method, can complement conventional findings and give a better insight into occupational exposure of cork industry workers. We assessed fungal contamination with the P. glabrum complex in three cork manufacturing plants in the outskirts of Lisbon using both conventional and molecular methods. Conventional culturing failed to detect the fungus at six sampling sites in which PCR did detect it. This confirms our assumption that the use of complementing methods can provide information for a more accurate assessment of occupational exposure to the P. glabrum complex in cork industry...|$|E

O seu aumento no lavado broncoalveolar (LBA) tem sido descrito em diversas patologias pulmonares humanas e experimentais que evoluem para a fibrose e relacionado com a activaÃ§Ã£o de fibroblastos. Objectivos: Partindo da hipÃ³tese de que a activaÃ§Ã£o de fibroblastos acompanha o recrutamento intersticial de linfÃ³citos T citotÃ³xicos e de mastÃ³citos na Suberose, caracteristicamente observados nas formas de Pneumonite de Hipersensibilidade (P. H.), medimos os niveis de hialuronano (RA) no LBA de 31 doentes com queixas respiratÃ³rias associadas Ã  exposiÃ§Ã£o ocupacional na indÃºstria da cortiÃ§a. TentÃ¡mos, tambÃ©m, relacionar os niveis de HA no LBA com a intensidade do envolvimento intersticial, avaliado pelas caracterÃ­sticas da alveolite e a detioraÃ§Ã£o funcional respiratÃ³ria. Doentes e MÃ©todos: 31 doentes estudados por histÃ³ria clÃ­nica e ocupacionaJ, exame fisico, telerradiografia de tÃ³rax, pletismografia {{corporal}} espirometria, difusÃ£o de CO, gasometria arterial em repouso e broncofibroscopia com lavagem broncoalveolar. A classificaÃ§Ã£o dos doentes- 20 Â com P. H., 8 Â com asma brÃ´nquica e 3 Â com bronquite crÃ³nica - foi feita de acordo com criterios clinicos, funcionais e da anÃ¡lise do lÃ­quido de lavagem broncoalveolar. O hialuronano no LBA foi quantificado por mÃ©todo radiomÃ©trico e a contagem celular diferencial e de mastÃ³citos foi realizada em esfregaÃ§os de citocentrifuga. A Albumina e lgG no LBA foram medidas por nefelometria cinÃ©tica. Principals Resultados: Os niveis de HA no LBA estavam significativamente mais elevados no grupo com P. H., com uma mediana (e Ã¢mbito interquartis) de 67, 1 Î¼g/L (33, 7 - 111, 5) versus 22, 7 Î¼g/L (12, 8 - 40, 7) nos casos com doenÃ§a obstrutiva das vias aÃ©reas (p< 0, 0 l, teste de Mann-Whitney). EncontrÃ¡mos no LBA uma correlaÃ§Ã£o directa do HA com a celularidade total e com os niveis de lgG e Albumina (p< 0, 02, correlaÃ§Ã£o de Spearman), bern como com o numero absoluto de linfÃ³citos e mastÃ³citos (p< 0, 01). Por outro lado, os nÃ­veis de HA correlacionaram-se inversamente com a difusÃ£o pulmonar e Capacidade Vital (DLCO rs = - 0, 58, CV rs = - 0, 61, p< 0, 002) e com o tempo de exposiÃ§Ã£o (rs. = - 0, 45, p< 0, 05). ConclusÃµes: Os resultados obtidos sugerem que a activaÃ§Ã£o de fibroblastos acompanha a resposta celular do interstÃ­cio pulmonar Ã  inalaÃ§Ã£o de poeiras orgÃ¢nicas na indÃºstria da cortiÃ§a e apontam para a sua relaÃ§Ã£o com a intensidade da inflamaÃ§Ã£o e com a presenÃ§a de linfÃ³citos e mastÃ³citos na superficie alveolar.

40|$|Cork is a light, porous and {{impermeable}} material {{extracted from}} the bark of some trees. It is in manufacture of stoppers for wine bottles the main application of cork. It is estimated that the area occupied by cork oaks in the Iberian Peninsula is around 33 % in Portugal and 23 % in Spain. The world production of cork is focused in the south Europe, with Portugal being the most important producer followed by Spain. According to Companies Directory more than 100 manufactories from Portugal has their branch associated with the preparation and fabrication of cork. Cork workers {{are at risk for}} developing diseases of the respiratory tract such as occupational asthma and <b>Suberosis,</b> a form of pulmonary hypersensitivity due to repeated exposure to mouldy cork dust. In this review study papers from 2000 were analyzed to better understand which fungi species are associated with occupational disease in cork workers. The most prevalent fungi species in these workers that are associated with those occupational diseases are Penicilliumglabrum, Chrysoniliasitophila and Trichodermalongibrachiatum. Therefore, a specific knowledge about occupational exposure to fungi in the cork industry is the key to better understand the related diseases and to define preventive measures. Given the importance of this occupational setting in Portugal is essential to evaluate the combined exposure of fungi and particles and their metabolites. Further studies concerning exposure assessment to fungi and particles in the cork industry must be developed...|$|E
