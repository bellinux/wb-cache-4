30|$|From {{the fifteenth}} century on, small glass {{particles}} were used as additives to paint layers [2 – 5] and as decorative materials in wall paintings and plaster [6 – 8]. Powdered glass particles were found in priming and paint layers of several European paintings from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century [3, 9]. A lead glass sample from a late fifteenth century German altarpiece also contained copper as colouring agent [3]. In the sixteenth century glass was added mainly for technical purposes such as <b>siccatives</b> and grounding. Laboratory testing carried out with modern ingredients indicated that the glass content was due to a better texture and colour depth of the tested red lakes [3]. A similar approach can be assumed for glass flakes used in plaster decorations. Glass flakes from 1722 in the Sala Terrena of Weissenstein Castle at Pommersfelden, Bavaria, {{were found to be}} lead glass with copper and iron as colouring elements [10]. Glass flakes on stucco work from 1714 in the former Grotto Hall in the Zwinger of Dresden (now Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon), Germany, were mainly made of lead glass as well besides some examples being soda-lime glass [11].|$|R
5000|$|By definition, drying oils, such as linseed and tung oil, are {{not true}} {{varnishes}} though often in modern terms they accomplish the same thing. Drying oils cure through an exothermic reaction between the polyunsaturated portion of the oil and oxygen from the air. Originally, the term [...] "varnish" [...] referred to finishes that were made entirely of resin dissolved in suitable solvents, either ethanol (alcohol) or turpentine. The advantage to finishes in previous centuries was that resin varnishes had a very rapid cure rate compared to oils; in most cases they are cured practically {{as soon as the}} solvent has fully evaporated. By contrast, untreated or [...] "raw" [...] oils may take weeks or months to cure, depending on ambient temperature and other environmental factors. In modern terms, [...] "boiled" [...] or partially polymerized drying oils with added <b>siccatives</b> or dryers (chemical catalysts) have cure times of less than 24 hours. However, certain non-toxic by-products of the curing process are emitted from the oil film even after it is dry to the touch and over a considerable period of time. It has long been a tradition to combine drying oils with resins to obtain favourable features of both substances.|$|R

The {{modes of}} {{bleaching}} and thickening {{oil in the}} sun, {{as well as the}} <b>siccative</b> power of metallic oxides, were known to the classical writers, and evidence exists of the careful study of Galen, Dioscorides, and others by the painters of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries: the loss (recorded by Vasari) of Antonio Veneziano to the arts, [...] "per che studio in Dioscoride le cose dell'erbe," [...] is a remarkable instance of its less fortunate results. Still, the immixture of solid color with the oil, which had been commonly used as a varnish for tempera paintings and gilt surfaces, was hitherto unsuggested; and no distinct notice seems to occur of the first occasion of this important step, though in the twelfth century, as above stated, the process is described as frequent both in Italy and England. Mr. Eastlake's instances have been selected, for the most part, from four treatises, two of which, though in an imperfect form, have long been known to the public; the third, translated by Mrs. Merrifield, is in course of publication; the fourth, [...] "Tractatus de Coloribus illuminatorum," [...] is of less importance.|$|E

A gray wall quadrangularly vaulted to a large north light; casts of feet, hands, faces hung to nails about; prints, {{sketches}} in oil and water-color stuck here and there lower down; a rickety table, with paint and palettes and bottles of varnish and <b>siccative</b> tossed comfortlessly on it; an easel, with a strip of some faded mediaeval silk trailing from it; a lay figure simpering in incomplete nakedness, with its head on one side, and a stocking on one leg, and a Japanese dress dropped before it; dusty rugs and skins kicking over the varnished floor; canvases faced to the mop-board; an open trunk overflowing with costumes: these features one might notice anywhere. But, besides, there was a bookcase with an unusual number of books in it, {{and there was an}} open colonial writing-desk, claw-footed, brass-handled, and scutcheoned, with foreign periodicals--French and English--littering its leaf, and some pages of manuscript scattered among them. Above all, there was a sculptor's revolving stand, supporting a bust which Beaton was modelling, with an eye fixed as simultaneously as possible on the clay and on the head of the old man who sat on the platform beside it.|$|E
30|$|Lead {{pigments}} are {{not suitable}} for use in fresco, {{but they were still}} used due to their good hiding properties and to the low prices compared to other pigments [5, 123, 200, 211 – 213]. The degradation processes of the various Pb pigments yield a range of compounds which cause discolouration, strongly affecting the readability of the polychromy [200]. Lead pigments on ceramic artefacts are sensitive to sulphur containing pollutants, to acidic solutions (rain; CO 2; microbial activity), to light and air: anglesite PbSO 4, cerussite PbCO 3, hydrocerussite 2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2 and lead sulphide PbS are formed [166]. Anglesite, attributed to lead pigment degradation was identified on wall paintings as well [214]. To laser irradiation, reduction of the lead compounds (leadwhite, massicot, red lead) occurs on the surface, so that the dark colour is attributed to formation of metallic lead, or Pb 2 O [150]. The subsequent oxidation of lead explains the reversibility of such a colour change [150]. The temperature increase related to the laser irradiation causes the formation of massicot on both minium and leadwhite [150]. Care needs to be taken when a laser source is used for analytical purposes, such as during Raman spectroscopic investigations, as the lead pigments and their degradation products, such as PbO 2 and PbS, might be altered, affecting the interpretation of the degraded areas [215, 216]. All lead pigments turned black after exposure to H 2 S vapours (formation of galena, PbS), with increasing reactivity for basic moieties, such as Pb(OH) 2 units in leadwhite [124]. It is reported that biological colonization on wall paintings can selectively affect lead (II) compounds, causing brown discolourations identified as PbO 2 or PbS [211, 217], while copper pigments act as biocides [124, 212]. Lead dioxide formation is favoured in humid alkaline conditions, such as in frescoes, when peroxides are produces, either by microorganisms or by photo-oxidation of organic materials [213]. When exposed to salt solutions, and light, the most stable phase for all the lead pigments is cerussite [123, 200, 218]. In oil, lead compounds were not only used as pigments, but as <b>siccatives</b> as well [219, 220]. Moreover, lead soaps are formed in, or on the surface of, oil paint layers containing lead based pigments (leadwhite, lead tin yellow type I, litharge, red lead) and are investigated as they affect the appearance of paintings [54, 55, 107, 145, 219 – 228]. Lead oxalates were observed on leadwhite treated with oxalic acid [32], and on real samples containing red lead and lead tin yellow [56]. Plumbonacrite 3 [2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2]·PbO was detected as well [56].|$|R

What was once supposed to be the spring grass {{has been found to be}} nothing but the fall grass, with the green stealing back into the withered blades. As for the spring lamb which used to crop the spring grass, it is now out of the cold-storage where the spring chicken and the new-laid eggs of yesteryear come from. It is said that there are no birds in last year's nests, but probably a careful examination would discover a plentiful hatch of nestlings which have hibernated in the habitations popularly supposed to be deserted the June before this. Early spring vegetables are in market throughout the twelvemonth, and spring flowers abound at the florists' in December and January. There is no reason why spring should not be absorbed into winter and summer by some such partition as took place politically in the case of Poland. Like that unhappy kingdom, she has abused her independence and become a molestation and discomfort to the annual meteorology. As a season she is distinctly a failure, being neither one thing nor the other, neither hot nor cold, a very Laodicean. Her winds were once supposed to be very <b>siccative,</b> and peculiarly useful in drying the plaster in new houses; but now the contractors put in radiators as soon as the walls are up, and the work is done much better. As for the germinative force of her suns, in these days of intensive farming, when electricity is applied to the work once done by them, they can claim to have no virtue beyond the suns of July or August, which most seeds find effective enough. If spring were absorbed into summer, the heat of that season would be qualified, and its gentler warmth would be extended to autumn, which would be prolonged into the winter. The rigors of winter would be much abated, and the partition of spring among the other seasons would perform the mystic office of the Gulf Stream in ameliorating our climate, besides ridding us of a time of most tedious and annoying suspense.

50|$|Traditional {{oil paints}} require an oil that always hardens, forming a stable, {{impermeable}} film. Such oils are called <b>siccative,</b> or drying, oils, and {{are characterized by}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. One common measure of the <b>siccative</b> property of oils is iodine number, the number of grams of iodine one hundred grams of oil can absorb. Oils with an iodine number greater than 130 are considered drying, those with an iodine number of 115-130 are semi-drying, and those with an iodine number of less than 115 are non-drying. Linseed oil, the most prevalent vehicle for artists' oil paints, is a drying oil.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the time}} of the Renaissance, <b>siccative</b> (drying) oil paints, {{primarily}} linseed oil, have been the most commonly used kind of paints in fine art applications; oil paint is still common today. However, in the 20th century, water-based paints, including watercolors and acrylic paints, became very popular with the development of acrylic and other latex paints. Milk paints (also called casein), where the medium is derived from the natural emulsion that is milk, were popular in the 19th century and are still available today. Egg tempera (where the medium is an emulsion of raw egg yolk mixed with oil) is still in use as well, as are encaustic wax-based paints. Gouache is a variety of opaque watercolor that was also used in the Middle Ages and Renaissance for manuscript illuminations. The pigment was often made from ground semiprecious stones such as lapis lazuli and the binder made from either gum arabic or egg white. Gouache, also known as 'designer color' or 'body color' is commercially available today.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of making bioplastics out of oil cake from Crambe Abyssinica, Brassica Carinata and Brassica Napus (Rapeseed) was studied {{in order to}} produce added value for these by-products. The materials were hot pressed and extruded at 100 ˚C using glycerol as a plasticizer. Pressing without plasticizer produced brittle materials. Tensile properties, moisture content, water and oil absorption were determined for the hot pressed sheets. Ball milling of the oil cake did not result in improved properties of the pressed sheets. As the three plants all have semi-drying oils, a <b>siccative</b> was added in different concentrations to crosslink the oil and add to the matrix of the bioplastic. Sheets were pressed after preheating the materials 0 h, 2 h or 6 h. Sheets were also pressed from granulated extrudate with different concentrations of <b>siccative</b> after pre-heating for 0 h or 2 h. Tensile properties, moisture content, water and oil absorption were determined for the pressed sheets. Pre-heating before pressing had a larger impact than <b>siccative</b> concentration on the properties of crambe and carinata sheets. <b>Siccative</b> concentration had larger influences on the properties of rapeseed cake sheets. Carinata and rapeseed cake were easier to process than crambe as they flowed better. Carinata sheets and extrudates were more flexible than crambe and rapeseed cake sheets and extrudates. A tray could be pressed from a mixture of crambe and rapeseed cake. All three materials show potential to be used as bioplastics for rigid items, perhaps in packaging applications...|$|E

The chromatogram also showed the presence of characteristic markers of a drying oil, with large amount of palmitic, oleic and stearic acids (Figure  2). In order to confirm {{the presence of a}} <b>siccative</b> oil, GC/MS analyses after saponification, extraction and derivatisation with a silanising agent, were performed. The results can be seen in Table  1, and the chromatogram of sample L 12 is shown in Figure  3.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{chemical}} characterisation of samples of black decorations and inscriptions, and of yellow-brown patinas collected from various panels of the chapel of Saint Anthony (Padua, Italy) ark, by using three analytical procedures based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). In particular, analytical pyrolysis {{in the presence of}} hexamethyldisilazane followed by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis (Py-GC/MS) and two procedures based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after wet-chemical treatment of the samples (GC/MS) have been chosen for the recognition of the organic substances (used originally or in the course of restoration) and of their degradation products. As far as the two GC/MS procedures are concerned, one is suitable for the characterisation of proteins, lipids, resins, waxes, bituminous materials and their degradation products, and the other was used to characterise the saccharide materials. The three analytical procedures used allow us to obtain information on the presence of egg proteins, lipid materials (beeswax, <b>siccative</b> oil and animal fatty material), saccharide materials and Pinaceae resin. Beeswax, animal fat, egg and saccharide materials have been used as past restoration materials, and pine resin and <b>siccative</b> oil are the main ingredients of the black decorations and inscriptions...|$|E

Pigments were applied by the artist using a PVAc binder on the canvases of the ceiling, while <b>siccative</b> oils and PVAc {{were found on the}} canvas of the wall.

In the canvas of the wall, instead, the paint is applied more uniformly and gives a dark colour cast. The analytical results led to the identification of many of the materials used by Gallizio. The pictorial palette consists of both inorganic and organic pigments, while polyvinylacetate, pure or mixed with a <b>siccative</b> oil, was identified as a binder thus confirming what was reported by the artist in his notes.|$|E
30|$|Carbon blacks (disordered C) are {{worldwide}} {{commonly used}} in arts and crafts throughout the centuries [1, 12]. They are of natural of artificial origin, and the microscopical structure of the pigment is related to its origin and manufacture process [13, 14]. They are stable to light and humidity, but burn at high temperatures. Their curing properties in oil are poor, often requiring the addition of siccatives [12, 15]. Evidence of degradation is observed upon exposure to oxidizing agents, and especially when impurities are present (e.g. presence of residual salts/uncarbonized moieties in carbonaceous pigments applied by using the fresco technique) [12, 15, 16]. Whitening is also reported for bone black [amorphous carbon with apatite Ca 3 (PO 4) 2] in oil binding medium, possibly related to the photodegradation of the aromatic structure, probably catalysed by lead (present as a <b>siccative,</b> or pigment) [17]. In another study, by the same authors, {{a variety of issues}} was identified related to the causes of discolouration of carbon blacks, such as the formation of lead carboxylates from the reaction of the <b>siccative</b> with the binder, or the alteration of lakes present in the mixture, or the degradation of the aromatic carbon compounds. The latter process is related to both the manufacturing process of the carbon based pigment, and the presence of siccatives [15]. Upon infrared laser irradiation, the colour of mock-ups prepared with organic and inorganic binders changed, showing evidence of darkening [18], while a 248  nm (UV) laser induced no changes [19].|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{observation}} of Raman bands attributed to degraded organic binders in various of the micro samples (Fig.  3) and considering the hypothesis of a secco painting technique, we selected four samples (PCH 02, PCH 04, PCH 05, and PCH 08) of the mural painting and submitted them to extraction with ammonia, using a modification of the procedure reported in [8] and described in the Experimental section. After separation of the lipid fraction from the proteins, both fractions were derivatised and analyzed by GC–MS. Fatty acids obtained by saponification and further acidification were analyzed as their methyl esters (FAME) while sterols were derivatised as their trimethylsilyl derivatives (TMS). The chromatograms of the four samples showed a major presence of palmitic (C 16 : 0) and stearic (C 18 : 0) acids, together with minor amounts of myristic acid (C 14 : 0) in samples PCH 02 and PCH 05, and oleic acid (C 18 : 1) in samples PCH 04 and PCH 05. Samples PCH 05 and PCH 08 also showed azelaic (nonanedioic) acid, a degradation product of C- 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids in <b>siccative</b> oils such as linseed oil. The ratio between {{the areas of the}} FAME of palmitic and stearic acids (P/S) is a parameter that gives information on the lipid source based on the stability of both saturated fatty acids [59]. Samples PCH 02 and PCH 05 showed P/S ratios of 1.2 while PCH 04 and PCH 08 gave ratios of 0.9 and 1.4, respectively. These values are close to those reported previously for a naturally aged model sample of linseed oil applied on gypsum (1.6) compared to a model sample of whole egg on gypsum (2.8) [4]. Moreover, the ratio of the areas of azelaic and palmitic acids (A/P) is a parameter that helps in the determination of a <b>siccative</b> oil due to the presence of reactive linoleic and linolenic acids in comparison to egg, which is rich in oleic acid [59]. Samples PCH 05 and PCH 08 showed A/P values of 0.1 and 0.2 close to that of a model sample of linseed oil on gypsum (0.1) [4] while azelaic acid was absent in samples PCH 02 and PCH 04. Three of the samples (PCH 02, PCH 05, and PCH 08) showed the presence of cholesterol, which indicates the use of egg as a binder. The identification of a mixture of egg and a <b>siccative</b> oil in samples PCH 05 and PCH 08 points to a tempera grassa [16].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first systematic {{analysis of the}} palette of Francesco Hayez, {{one of the most}} outstanding artists of European Romanticism, whose painting technique has never been extensively investigated despite the plethora of artistic studies. He lived in a particular moment in the history of painting, as {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century many synthetic pigments were available, also in tin tubes, but traditional materials were still used. Sixteen paintings on canvas and on panels, created between 1823 and 1868, were analyzed in situ through non-invasive techniques (infrared reflectography and infrared reflection spectroscopy). Imaging investigation provided clues on painting technique, revealing some cases of pentimenti and underdrawings. A preliminary survey was carried out on a hundred pure pigments used up to the 19 th century and on new synthetic colours, in order to attain reference spectra for the interpretation of painting spectra. The portable infrared instrument provided insight into Hayez's painting materials, identifying barite, ivory black, lead-tin yellow, Naples yellow, ochres, Prussian blue, and white lead. The pigments were often blended, to obtain a unique fabric appearance or to attain cold shades. The results pointed to a <b>siccative</b> oil as a binder, mixed with white lead so that it could act as a catalyzer in polymerization reactions, and in some cases with a proteinaceous binder and resins. The preparation was made with gypsum and white lead mixed with a <b>siccative</b> oil. The results showed that the artist used a typical traditional palette, throughout his career, in order to lead to brilliant colours and with long-term stability. Anyway, the possible presence of cobalt blue in a few paintings suggests that Hayez had probably started testing the new colours, since the second decade of 19 th century...|$|E

30|$|The monocarboxylic acids {{are related}} to the oil {{modification}} and suberic and azealic acid are common oxidation products of a <b>siccative</b> oil [11, 15].

The rosin compounds identified were dehydroabietic acid (DHA), 7 -oxo DHA, and 7 -methoxy-tetradehydroabietic acid which are oxidation products of abietic acid and markers for resin of the Pine tree family (Pinaceae) [17 – 20]. The presence rosin may indicate that oil modification was performed with tall oil fatty acids (TOFA), a by-product from the paper industry which finds major use in alkyds [2, 15]. However, a direct addition of rosin to the oil modified alkyd or pigment modification can not be excluded.|$|E

30|$|On the verso of page 56 {{it states}} that ‘Lake {{takes a long}} time to dry in oil, and for that reason you have to grind some glass with it.

This seems invariably to have been the type of glass used as an additive in paintings, since the quantitative analyses show that in every case some manganese is present [8]. It is well known that manganese can act as a <b>siccative</b> for oil, although it is not yet clear whether this element is sufficiently mobile in the glass to perform this function, and it may be that the alkali content proves to be more important in this respect [8]. In northern European glass manganese is likely to have been introduced as part of the wood ash used as the flux, rather than as a separate component [17].|$|E
40|$|Bieb.) {{also named}} Dragon's head ” is an annual plant {{cultivated}} for its seeds that contain about 30 %- 38 % drying oil (<b>siccative</b> oil). Its seed oil {{is used in}} foods, dye and varnish industry. L. iberica seeds have traditional uses as reconstitute, stimulant, diuretic and expectorant. L. iberica in an important medicinal plant in our country and grows in various regions with different environmental conditions. At present no investigation has been reported about population genetic structure of this valuable plant species in Iran. Therefore, we carried out population genetic analysis of 11 populations of L. iberica by using ISSR molecular markers for the first time. Genetic diversity analysis revealed high within population genetic variability. AMOVA test produced significant genetic difference among the studied populations. Mantel test revealed significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance of the populations. STRUCTURE analysis and K-Means clustering revealed population genetic fragmentation {{and the presence of}} three gene pools for this species. The assignment test revealed the occurrence of limited gene flow among the populations. The results suggeste...|$|E
