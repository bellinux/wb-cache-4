40|$|Acoustic echo cancellers in today's <b>speakerphones</b> {{or video}} {{conferencing}} systems {{rely on the}} assumption of a linear echo path. Low-cost audio equipment or constraints of portable communication systems cause nonlinear distortions, which limit the echo return loss enhancement achievable by linear adaptation schemes. These distortions are a superposition of different effects, which can be modelled either as memoryless nonlinearities or as nonlinear systems with memory. Proper adaptation schemes for both cases of nonlinearities are discussed. An echo canceller for nonlinear systems with memory based on an adaptive second order Volterra filter is presented. Its performance is demonstrated by measurements with small loudspeakers. The results show an improvement in the echo return loss enhancement of 7 dB over a conventional linear adaptive filter. The additional computational requirement for the presented Volterra filter is {{comparable to that of}} existing acoustic echo cancellers. 1. INTRODUCT [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm using parallel {{filters and}} evolutionary programming techniques is introduced. IIR filters have the attractive property that they require fewer computations than a corresponding FIR filter, {{but they are}} prone to instability and local minimum problems. Evolutionary algorithms are good in global optimization scenarios, but are computationally very expensive. Adaptive filter weights for a given step size and initial weight vectors may not lead to optimal solutions. In this paper we extend the IIR LMS algorithm by embedding an evolutionary computation, and also simultaneously implement multiple filters (different initial weight vectors) to achieve optimal solutions.

40|$|Low-cost audio {{components}} in hands-free telephone applications call for nonlinear adaptive echo cancellation (AEC). It {{has been demonstrated}} that a cascade of a polynomial and an FIR lter can cancel such nonlinear echoes [1]. Another technique employs a hardclipping curve with LMS adapted saturation parameter [2]. For both cascaded systems we derive an LMStype adaptation using a common framework, and propose stepsize normalizations for both approaches. To achieve suciently fast convergence for practical use, an RLS-type adaptation for the polynomial is derived and experimentally veried. Both techniques are compared using real hardware and speech signals, and show robust convergence behaviour and an echo reduction gain of up to 10 dB compared to a linear AEC. 1.

30|$|When {{communicating}} using {{hands free}} {{devices such as}} <b>speakerphones,</b> the speech signal is typically corrupted by background noise such as ventilation noise or computer fan noise. One commonly used method for reducing this type of noise is spectral subtraction [1, 2]. Although typically achieving well in terms of noise reduction, the basic spectral subtraction algorithm has often the effect that musical noise appears due to spectral flooring [3]. Ways of reducing the musical noise has been proposed by e.g. Ephraim and Malah [4], although this method still tends to give audible artifacts which could in some cases even result in reduced listening comfort compared to the original unprocessed signal [5]. Further improvements {{have been made by}} Plapous et al. [6] in which they introduce a two-step noise reduction technique that reduces the noise without adding artifacts to the speech signal. However, this algorithm aims at reducing speech harmonics distortion and does nothing for the unvoiced speech.|$|R

2500|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of her poster, Fawcett earned a supporting role in Michael Anderson's science-fiction film Logan's Run (1976) with Michael York. She and her husband, television star Lee Majors, were frequent tennis partners with producer Aaron Spelling. Spelling and his business partner eventually chose Fawcett to play Jill Munroe in their upcoming made-for-TV movie, Charlie's Angels, a movie of the week which aired on March 21, 1976, on ABC. The movie starred Fawcett (then billed as Farrah Fawcett-Majors), Kate Jackson, and Jaclyn Smith as private investigators for Townsend Associates, a detective agency run by a reclusive multimillionaire whom the women had never met. Voiced by John Forsythe, the Charles Townsend character presented cases and dispensed advice via a <b>speakerphone</b> to his core team of three female employees, whom he referred to as [...] "Angels". They were aided {{in the office and}} occasionally in the field by two male associates, played by character actors David Doyle and David Ogden Stiers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an updated, simple, easy-to-use {{version of a}} predictive methodology, the Speech Privacy Predictor (SPP). SPP is intended to help those designing, furnishing or retrofitting open plan and private offices. To illustrate {{the application of the}} SPP method, nine case studies are described below. These case studies document acoustical conditions in an office building where the Center for the Built Environment had previously conducted an occupant survey. In layout and utilization, this building is representative of a typical modern office [...] -large open plan areas, ubiquitous telephones with built-in <b>speakerphones,</b> distributed common areas, and widespread use of computers. It is also typical of the acoustical shortcomings of modern offices: CBE's occupant satisfaction survey had detected significant occupant dissatisfaction with speech privacy. Each case study is designed to demonstrate how the SPP calculation is performed. The case studies evaluate the reliability of the SPP method, by comparing predicted results with measurements of actual acoustic conditions as well as the subjective level of acoustic dissatisfaction reported by those who had taken the CBE Survey. Results of these comparisons show broad agreement between the predictive tool, measured acoustic conditions, and surveyed employee dissatisfaction. The SPP method therefore appears to be a viable tool for designing to achieve good acoustical environments. This finding is especially noteworthy because while poor speech privacy has been shown to reduce worker motivation, interfere with concentration and compromise the security of meetings and confidential discussions, retrofitting office spaces with poor acoustic performance is often an expensive and disruptive solutio...|$|R
