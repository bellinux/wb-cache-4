5|$|Cynthia {{knew her}} husband took drugs like Preludin, and {{regularly}} smoked cannabis but {{thought of them}} as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E

The Women's Political Council was the first group to officially endorse the boycott.|$|E

[...] Perry and McKee had been casual friends prior to Perry's request for her help with a song that Perry had been writing called [...] "Part of Me".

500|$|Because Sherwood Anderson was so {{ambiguous}} {{about what}} directly influenced him, {{it is difficult}} to say that any specific writer or work inspired him to write Winesburg, Ohio as a whole. Still, most scholars affirm the obvious connection between Anderson's cycle and the Spoon River Anthology of Edgar Lee Masters (published in [...] ), which Anderson reportedly <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> to read. Though B.W. Huebsch, Anderson's publisher, sent out a statement, upon the release of Winesburg, Ohio, heading off comparisons between the two works by stating (erroneously, as it turns out) that the Winesburg stories were printed in magazines before the Spoon River Anthology was published, the similarities in small-town setting, structure, and mood of the works have been noted by several reviewers, with one {{going so far as to}} call Winesburg, Ohio, the Spoon River Anthology [...] "...put into prose." ...|$|E
500|$|While most of {{the other}} songs on the Spice album {{required}} two or three days of studio time, [...] "Wannabe" [...] was recorded in less than an hour. The solo parts were divided between Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, and Halliwell. Victoria Adams missed {{most of the}} writing session and communicated {{with the rest of the}} group on a mobile phone. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter. Saying 'Yes, I like that' or 'Not sure about that' down the phone is not the same." [...] She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition was the sound of Brown's footsteps as she ran to the microphone.|$|E
500|$|McGraw brought several outfielders into spring {{training}} with the Giants. When Stengel {{was not included}} with the starters when the manager split the squad, some sportswriters assumed {{he would not be}} with the team when the regular season began. Stengel, at McGraw's request, acted as a coach to the young players on the [...] "B" [...] squad, [...] and worked hard, getting key hits in {{spring training}} games, and making the Giants as a reserve outfielder. McGraw and Stengel sometimes <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night,</b> discussing baseball strategy. [...] With two Giant outfielders injured by June, Stengel was put in center field, and hit [...]368 in 84 games, as McGraw platooned him against right handers. If Stengel had enough plate appearances to qualify for the league batting championship, he would have finished second to Rogers Hornsby of the St. Louis Cardinals, who hit [...]401. The Giants played the Yankees again in the 1922 World Series; Stengel went 1–4 in Game 1, nursing an injured right leg muscle, which he aggravated running out an infield single in his first at bat in Game 2. Stengel was obviously limping when he was advanced to second base on another single, and McGraw sent in a pinch runner. He did not use Stengel again in the Series, which the Giants won, four games to zero, with one tie. After the Series, Stengel and other major leaguers went on a barnstorming tour of Japan and the Far East.|$|E

500|$|... "She's Out of My Life" [...] {{had been}} written for Jones by Tom Bahler three years earlier. Jackson heard and enjoyed it, and Jones allowed him to use it on the record. Jones called in Heatwave's keyboardist Rod Temperton to write three songs. The {{intention}} was for Jackson and Jones to select one of his songs, but Jackson, liking them all, included {{all of them in}} the final cut. Jackson <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> to learn the lyrics to these songs instead of singing from a sheet. He finished the vocals to these three Temperton songs in two recording sessions. Temperton took a different approach to his song writing after spending some time researching the background to Jackson's music style. Temperton mixed his traditional harmony segments with the idea of adding shorter note melodies to suit Jackson's aggressive style. Jackson wrote [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" [...] after humming a melody in his kitchen. After listening to hundreds of songs, Jackson and Jones decided upon a batch to record. In hindsight, Jones believed they took a lot of risks in the production of Off the Wall and the final choice of album tracks. Attention was also paid to the album cover, which shows Jackson smiling, wearing a tuxedo and trademark socks. His manager stated, [...] "The tuxedo was the overall plan for the Off the Wall project and package. The tuxedo was our idea, the socks were Michael'".|$|E

They played covers of songs by the Rolling Stones ("Dandelion"), Moby Grape ("Hey Grandma"), and Willie Dixon ("Spoonful"), {{as well as some}} original compositions. Terence Boylan, another Bard musician, remembered that Fagen took readily to the beatnik life while attending college: [...] "They never came out of their room, they <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night.</b> They looked like ghosts— black turtlenecks and skin so white that it looked like yogurt. Absolutely no activity, chain-smoking Lucky Strikes and dope." [...] Fagen himself would later remember it as [...] "probably the only time in my life that I actually had friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whatever {{the reasons}} behind the duel, Galois was so {{convinced}} of his impending death that he <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts. Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament, [...] "This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, {{is perhaps the most}} substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind." [...] However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated. In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers.|$|E
2500|$|Although Page {{recorded}} with many notable musicians, {{many of these}} early tracks are only available as bootleg recordings, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest {{of these is the}} early jam session featuring Jimmy Page and Stones guitarist Keith Richards covering Robert Johnson's [...] "Little Queen of Spades". Several early tracks with Page were compiled on the twin album release, [...] Page also {{recorded with}} Richards on guitar and vocals in Olympic Sound Studios on 15 October 1974. Along with Ric Grech on bass and Bruce Rowland on drums, a track called [...] "Scarlet" [...] was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with Rolling Stones Cameron Crowe: [...] "I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called [...] "Scarlet." [...] I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those Blonde on Blonde tracks. It was great, really good. We <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album".|$|E

They overslept and Moses had to wake them up because God was already waiting on the mountaintop.

The German left flank (British right flank) advanced on Royal Ave, short of which was Broadmarsh Crater, to the north-west of a new crater which had been captured by the British on the night of 18/19 May and the German right flank (British left) attacked towards Momber Crater. In the smoke and dust the German infantry got half-way across no man's land before the British could see them, moving in skirmish lines, the men [...] apart. Behind the foremost line, the British could see men carrying barbed wire, wood and machine-guns. The Germans were able to walk into the sector of the 140th Brigade, where the survivors of the bombardment were stunned and their weapons smashed or buried. The 47th Divisional artillery was unable to help as communications had been cut and was short of ammunition. Many men of the 1/7th and 1/8th London were caught in their shelters and captured, except for a few who fought hand to hand.|$|E

Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are there and what they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone in the room is drinking. Edna announces that Harry wants to talk to Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t think they would allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house, {{in spite of the fact}} that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” [...] Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that because they are friends, Harry and Edna have the right to be there. [...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E

Time Magazine said, [...] "The movie spans about 20 years, and seems that long in running time [...] [...] [...] Miss Ball has been molded over the years {{into some sort of}} national monument, and she performs like one too. Her grace, her timing, her vigor have all vanished." [...] Time Out London declared she [...] "simply hasn't the drive and steel of a Rosalind Russell, an Angela Lansbury or a Ginger Rogers, all of whom played the part before her," [...] and said of Saks, [...] "When he's not ogling his star in perpetual soft focus and a $300,000 fashion parade, [...] fails to get enough retakes, match his shots, or inject the essential vim." [...] Pauline Kael in The New Yorker wondered, [...] "After forty years in movies and TV, did she discover in herself an unfulfilled ambition to be a flaming drag queen?" [...] The New Republics Stanley Kauffman, though he pointed out that Ball would have made a perfect Mame had she played the role [...] "fifteen years earlier," [...] described her as [...] "too old, too stringy in the legs, too basso in the voice, and too creaky in the joints." [...] Virtually every critic took notice of the heavy-handedness in photographing Ball out of focus, Rex Reed {{going so far as to}} suggest, albeit jokingly, that chicken fat was put over the lens. Some regarded this as evidence that those executives responsible for signing Ball, and Ball herself, knew from the outset that she was too old for her role. In her defense in regards to her lack of singing ability, Ball told one interviewer [...] "Mame <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> <b>night</b> and drank champagne!
