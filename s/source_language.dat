5|$|Twenty-two {{other state}} names derive from European languages: seven come from Latin (mostly from Latinate forms of English {{personal}} names, one coming from Welsh), five come from English, five come from Spanish (and one more from an Indigenous language {{by way of}} Spanish), and four come from French (one of these by way of English). The etymologies of six states are disputed or unclear: Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Oregon, and Rhode Island (in the table below, those states have one row for each potential <b>source</b> <b>language</b> or meaning).|$|E

25|$|Spontaneous second {{language}} acquisition (and {{the genesis of}} pidgins) involves the gradual relexification of the native or <b>source</b> <b>language</b> with target-language vocabulary. After relexification is completed, native language structures alternate with structures acquired from the target language.|$|E
50|$|Finally, a mixed {{language}} {{differs from}} code-switching, such as Spanglish or Portuñol, in that, {{once it has}} developed, the fusion of the <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> is fixed in the grammar and vocabulary, and speakers {{do not need to}} know the <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> in order to speak it. But, linguists believe that mixed languages evolve from persistent code-switching, with younger generations picking up the code-switching, but not necessarily the <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> that generated it.|$|R
25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} Interlingua's <b>source</b> <b>{{languages}}</b> {{include not only}} Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and loan translations are included. Tests had shown that if {{a larger number of}} <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> were used, the results would be about the same. So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.|$|R

25|$|When a name {{is fully}} assimilated, the final vowel is often changed to inflectional o, {{rather than the}} o being added to the full root. As with {{borrowed}} common nouns, this may be criticized if the vowel {{is part of the}} root rather than inflectional in the <b>source</b> <b>language,</b> because the resulting form may not be readily recognized by native speakers of the <b>source</b> <b>language.</b> However, it is a common phenomenon in inflectional languages such as Russian or Latin. If a name is not fully assimilated, the accusative case may be tacked on with a hyphen, as -n if the name ends in a vowel, or as -on if it does not (Zamenhof-on).|$|E
25|$|The {{languages}} of the Algonquian family constitute {{a group of}} historically related languages descended from a common <b>source</b> <b>language,</b> Proto-Algonquian. The Algonquian languages are spoken across Canada from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast; on the American Plains; south of the Great Lakes; and on the Atlantic coast. Many of the Algonquian languages are now extinct.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>source</b> <b>language</b> uses a non-Latin script (Greek, Russian, Chinese etc.) {{words are}} respelled phonetically. This {{does not always}} mean exact transliteration, {{sometimes}} the foreign pronunciation is bent to conform to Hungarian phonology better (e.g. szamovár, tájfun ‘samovar, typhoon’). In practice, English transliterations are also often used, such as gyros instead of gírosz).|$|E
50|$|This {{simply means}} that the <b>source</b> <b>language(s)</b> to be {{compiled}} must not be closed, fixed, or static. It must be possible to add new keywords, concepts, and structures to the <b>source</b> <b>language(s).</b> Languages which allow the addition of constructs with user defined syntax include Camlp4, OpenC++, Seed7, Red, Rebol, and Felix. While it is acceptable for some fundamental and intrinsic language features to be immutable, the system must not rely solely on those language features. It must be possible to add new ones.|$|R

5000|$|The project's {{development}} {{takes place}} mostly online in a Yahoo group, though disagreements about grammar and orthography {{means that there}} are several different versions or [...] "dialects". [...] Disagreement occurs even over which <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> to use, so that only some developers draw from Frisian, Low German and Norwegian Nynorsk, next to the usual <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> of English, Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian Bokmål, and Swedish.|$|R
25|$|Most romanizations are {{intended}} to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the <b>source</b> <b>language</b> reasonably accurately. Such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic transcription and attempt to render the significant sounds (phonemes) of the original as faithfully {{as possible in the}} target language. The popular Hepburn romanization of Japanese {{is an example of a}} transcriptive romanization designed for English speakers.|$|E
25|$|If the romanization {{attempts}} to transliterate the original script, the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of {{characters in the}} <b>source</b> <b>language</b> into the target script, with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader's language. For example, the Nihon-shiki romanization of Japanese allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original Japanese kana syllables with 100% accuracy, but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|A phonetic {{conversion}} goes {{one step}} further and attempts to depict all phones in the <b>source</b> <b>language,</b> sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions {{not found in the}} target script. In practice such a representation almost never tries to represent every possible allophone—especially those that occur naturally due to coarticulation effects—and instead limits itself to the most significant allophonic distinctions. The International Phonetic Alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} to train acoustic models for a target language using speech data from distinct <b>source</b> <b>languages.</b> In this approach, no native training data from the target language is required. The acoustic model candidates for each targetlanguage phoneme are automatically selected {{from a group of}} existing <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> by means of a combined phoneticphonological (CPP) metric, developed by incorporating statistically-derived phonetic and phonological distance information (Liu and Melnar, Interspeech 2005). The method assumes availability of sufficient native training data for the <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> and pronunciation lexica for both the target and <b>source</b> <b>languages.</b> Once the model candidates are determined for each target-language phoneme, the target HMMs are trained with the speech data from the <b>source</b> <b>languages</b> by means of a “silkie-hen-on-duck-eggs ” strategy – namely the target phoneme model training is embedded in the source phoneme model training. The recognition performance of the resultant models is comparable to that of our previously-reported CPP-derived models built through multimixture construction while the size of the current models is {{only a fraction of the}} previous models, depending on the number of HMM candidates used for each target phoneme. Utilizing the CPP metric, both versions of the models reach the performance of models generated by a data-driven acoustic-distance mapping approach, far above the general phoneme symbol-based cross-language transfer strategies. 1...|$|R

25|$|Around {{the same}} time, the book An APL Compiler by Timothy Budd {{appeared}} in print. This book detailed {{the construction of}} an APL translator (aplc), written in C, which performed certain optimizations such as loop fusion specific to the needs of an array language. The <b>source</b> <b>language</b> was APL-like in that a few rules of the APL language were changed or relaxed to permit more efficient compilation. The translator would emit C code which could then be compiled and run outside of the APL workspace. Another compiler, also named aplc, was later created by Samuel W. Sirlin, based on Budd's work.|$|E
25|$|The attested Hurrian lexicon {{is quite}} homogenous, {{containing}} {{only a small}} number of loanwords (e.g. tuppi (clay tablet), Mizri (Egypt) both from Akkadian). The relative pronouns iya and iye may be a loan from the Indo-Aryan language of the Mitanni people who had lived in the region before the Hurrians; cf. Sanskrit ya. Conversely, Hurrian gave many loan words to the nearby Akkadian dialects, for example hāpiru (nomad) from the Hurrian hāpiri (nomad). There may also be Hurrian loanwords among the languages of the Caucasus, but this cannot be verified, as there are no written records of Caucasian languages from the time of the Hurrians. The <b>source</b> <b>language</b> of similar sounding words is thus unconfirmable.|$|E
25|$|Though both Esperanto and Interlingua borrow {{primarily}} from European languages, they also borrow words from other languages {{which have become}} widespread. Two different philosophies have led to two different approaches. Interlingua highly regards etymological fidelity, thus it usually adopts the word that is the nearest common ancestor of the respective words {{in at least three}} <b>source</b> <b>language</b> units (considering Spanish and Portuguese together as one unit). Esperanto highly regards regularity, thus it disregards the form of the word in European languages to make it match Esperanto's morphology and phonemic orthography. For example, Interlingua has geisha (from Japanese 芸者), sheik (from Arabic شيخ), and kayak (from Inuit ᖃᔭᖅ); in Esperanto, these words are written gejŝo, ŝejko, and kajako.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Dutch {{presence}} in Indonesia for almost 350years, as the Asian {{bulk of the}} Dutch East Indies, the Dutch language has no official status there and the small minority that can speak the language fluently are either educated members of the oldest generation, or employed in the legal profession, as certain law codes are still only available in Dutch. Dutch is taught in various educational centres in Indonesia, {{the most important of}} which is the Erasmus Language Centre (ETC) in Jakarta. Each year, some 1,500 to 2,000 students take Dutch courses there. In total, several thousand Indonesians study Dutch as a foreign language. Owing to centuries of Dutch rule in Indonesia, many old documents are written in Dutch. Many universities therefore include Dutch as a <b>source</b> <b>language,</b> mainly for law and history students. In Indonesia this involves about 35,000 students.|$|E
25|$|The terms {{substrate}} and superstrate {{are often}} used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in second language acquisition or language replacement events, when the native speakers of a certain <b>source</b> <b>language</b> (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate). The outcome of such an event is that erstwhile speakers of the substrate will use some version of the superstrate, at least in more formal contexts. The substrate may survive {{as a second language}} for informal conversation. As demonstrated by the fate of many replaced European languages (such as Etruscan, Breton, and Venetian), the influence of the substrate on the official speech is often limited to pronunciation and a modest number of loanwords. The substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving any trace.|$|E
500|$|Pound {{could not}} {{understand}} Chinese himself, yet some critics see his translations of Chinese poetry as among the best (others complain of their mistakes). Cathay {{was the first of}} many translations Pound would make from the Chinese. Pound often followed the translations made by Herbert Giles in his History of Chinese Literature [...] and used Fenollosa's work {{as a starting point for}} what he called the ideogrammic method, which proceeded on Fenellosa's entirely mistaken but fruitful idea that each character represented an image or pictograph, based on sight rather than sound. Robert Graves recalled [...] "I once asked Arthur Waley how much Chinese Pound knew; Waley shook his head despondently." [...] Steven Yao, scholar of American and Asian literature, sees Cathay as a [...] "major feat"; a work where Pound shows that translation is possible without a thorough knowledge of the <b>source</b> <b>language.</b> Yao does not view Pound's lack of Chinese as an obstacle, and states that the poet's trawl through centuries of scholarly interpretations resulted in a genuine understanding of the original poem.|$|E
