Though the natural hazards like earthquake in Indian sub-continent cannot be prevented, because of the active tectonic disturbances and resulting incidence of earthquake of different intensities in <b>sensitive</b> <b>zones,</b> with a better preparedness and mitigation plan, {{the loss of life}} and property can be minimised to a greater extent. Though the scientific and technological knowledge is available for disaster preparedness and mitigation in different disaster prone regions of the world, the lack of disaster management system in disaster prone regions is causing collateral damages causing enormous environmental costs in form of loss of life and property and the cost of rehabilitation. The neglect of the development of disaster management system for minimisation of the impact of such disasters have caused a huge cost, even a fraction of which could help in disaster management capacity building in disaster prone regions.

5000|$|According to the Ministry of Environment, in 1992 tariffs {{by private}} {{providers}} were 22% {{higher than for}} public providers. [...] After competition in the sector has been strengthened through the Loi Sapin in 1993, the difference declined to 13% in 1998, according to the Ministry of Environment. No matter how high the difference is, these assessments do not compare apples with apples. For example, public companies {{do not have to}} pay for the acquisition of public land. Also, they are not subject to corporate income tax (taxe professionnelle) or property tax (redevance pour occupation du domaine public). Both factors reduce the costs of public companies compared to private companies without providing an economic benefit, since the higher costs of private companies are channeled back to the public treasury. In addition, a study by the research institute INRA showed that the municipalities with the most difficult conditions tend to delegate service provision to the private sector, thus biasing the comparison of tariff levels. Among the conditions driving municipalities to seek private sector participation are the classification in an ecologically <b>sensitive</b> <b>zone</b> implying stricter wastewater treatment standards and a lower population density implying a longer network per customer.|$|E

40|$|Many {{scholars}} have used microtremor applications {{to evaluate the}} vulnerability index. In order to reach fast and reliable results, microtremor measurement is preferred {{as it is a}} cost-effective method. In this paper, the vulnerability index will be reviewed by utilization of microtremor measurement results in Nicosia city. 100 measurement stations have been used to collect microtremor data and the data were analysed by using Nakamura’s method. The value of vulnerability index (Kg) has been evaluated by using the fundamental frequency and amplification factor. The results obtained by the artificial neural network (ANN) will be compared with microtremor measurements. Vulnerability Index Assessment using Neural Networks (VIANN) is a backpropagation neural network, which uses the original input microtremor Horizontal Vertical Spectrum Ratio (HVSR) spectrum set. A 3 -layer back propagation neural network which contains 4096 input, 28 hidden and 3 output neurons are used in this suggested system. The output neurons are classified according to acceleration sensitivity zone, velocity zones, or displacement zones. The sites are classified by their vulnerability index values using binary coding: [1 0 0] for the acceleration <b>sensitive</b> <b>zone,</b> [0 1 0] for the velocity <b>sensitive</b> <b>zone,</b> and [0 0 1] for the displacement <b>sensitive</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|E

40|$|Recent {{researches}} {{concerned with}} the effects of x-rays on bac-teria have for the most part considered rates of killing and the theory of action on a <b>sensitive</b> <b>zone.</b> The mechanism of action is not clear, however; certain studies seem to indicate that factors other than direct action on a <b>sensitive</b> <b>zone</b> are involved. In the elucidation of this problem, changes at the surfaces of the bacteria need to be considered. It is evident that x-rays may affect the distribution of ions at the surface, with a probable resultant change in surface charge and electrokinetic potential. A means of approach to the problem is through the study of electrophoretic mobilities of the particles. Reports of such studies in the literature have been few in number. Lisse and Tittsler (1931) found that irradiation of Escherichia coli with ultraviolet light resulted in death with an accompanying decrease in electrophoretic velocity. Dozois et al.

40|$|On {{the island}} Bonaire, {{eutrophication}} {{is a point}} of serious concern, affecting the coral reefs in the marine park. Eutrophication can cause altered balance of the reef ecosystem because algae can outcompete corals, leading to a disturbed composition and deterioration of the biodiversity of the reef. The reef of Bonaire faces nutrient input by various sources, of which enriched groundwater outflow from land to the reef {{is considered to be a}} substantial one. Groundwater is enriched with nutrients e. g. due to leaking septic tanks. In order to reduce the input of nutrients on the reef via sewage water, a water treatment plant is being built on Bonaire.
