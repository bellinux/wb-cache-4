The first Cognifit programs the company developed were largely driving programs, such as the online application Drivefit (stylized as [...] "DriveFit"), which was used by organizations including the British <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motoring</b> and the Young Drivers of Canada, using [...] "visual and memory tests to measure 12 driving-related cognitive abilities" [...] according to the New York Times. The Times wrote further that the DriveFit 30-minute evaluation, [...] "assesses reaction times, {{as well as a}} person’s propensity to take risks, ability to judge relative speed and process information when attention is divided (for example, driving while talking on a cellphone)." [...] In addition to these programs, the company decided to expand into additional cognitive testing areas, to create what they termed a [...] "brain gym".|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{joining the}} as yet unnamed Pretenders, Chambers played with James Honeyman-Scott in Cheeks, a band {{led by former}} Mott the Hoople keyboardist Verden Allen. At the time Chambers joined the yet unnamed band in 1978, he {{was working as a}} driving {{instructor}} in Tufnell Park, London where he had got a job with the British <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motoring</b> [...] "because it came with a car so I could get about" [...] and because of that he found where Jim and Pete were living and then replaced Jerry Mackleduff on drums (Uncut, 1999). At Chambers's first rehearsal with the group, Hynde recalled: [...] "We plugged in and started playing [...] "Precious", and I remember clearly, I had to turn around and face the wall, I was laughing so hard, because as soon as Martin started playing with us, I knew this was it. We had the band." [...] (Uncut, 1999). Martin also recalled the rehearsal [...] "We knew it straight away. We just locked in." [...] (Rhino Entertainment Company, 2006).|$|E
40|$|My project idea is {{to easily}} connect learner drivers with driving {{instructors}} via a web application. Currently if a learner is looking to book a driving instructor they must monotonously search through directories in their area. Alternatively a lot of bookings come through word of mouth which is not really sustainable. There are some companies such as Irish <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motoring</b> (ISM) who can schedule appointments via a website. This does not however facilitate private instructors {{who may not have}} the expertise or funding to develop a site themselves. The application will have instructor profiles, contact details, locations, merits and qualifications of the driving instructors which the user can browse when looking for a lesson. The user can also book a test with an instructor, leave a review, comment and star-rate and take driving theory quizzes among other activities. The main goal of this app is to enable learner drivers to have a wider choice of driving instructors whose experience and ability are transparent. My aim is to create a web app which is user friendly and provides all the necessary information required for both the driver and instructor. I will implement a payment method using a payment gateway so customers can actually pay for their lessons through the site. This will turn the web app into a more holistic product with end to end functionality. Providing a review process is what I feel will attract the most attention. Currently learner drivers have to take a risk of perhaps paying an instructor who is not at the level they require. The review features will hopefully eliminate this issue. The entire project is going to be written in PHP and will communicate with a database using SQL commands. The web app will be hosted on an apache web server. JavaScript and html/CSS will be used to provide a user friendly experience...|$|E
