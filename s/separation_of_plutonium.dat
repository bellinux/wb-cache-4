40|$|Isotopic {{reference}} materials certified for {{the age of}} nuclear material (uranium, plutonium) are needed {{in the fields of}} nuclear forensics and environmental measurements. Therefore a feasibility study for the development <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> {{reference materials}} for age dating has been started recently at the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (EC-JRC-IRMM). The "age" of the material is defined as the time that has passed since the last chemical <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the mother and daughter isotopes (e. g. 241 Pu and 241 Am). Assuming that the separation has been complete and all the daughter isotopes have been removed from the original material during this last <b>separation,</b> the age <b>of</b> the material can be determined by measuring the ratio of daughter and mother radio-nuclides, e. g. 241 Am/ 241 Pu. At a given time after the last separation and depending on the half lives of the radio-nuclides involved, a certain amount of the daughter radionuclide(s) will be present. For the determination of the unknown age of a material different "clocks" can be used; "clocks" are pairs of mother and daughter radio-nuclides, such as 241 Am/ 241 Pu, 238 Pu/ 234 U, 239 Pu/ 235 U, 240 Pu/ 236 U, and possibly 242 Pu/ 238 U. For the age estimation of a real sample, such as material seized in nuclear forensics investigations or dust samples in environmental measurements, it is advisable to use more than one clock in order to ensure the reliability of the results and to exclude the possibility that the sample under question is a mixture of two or more materials. Consequently, a future reference material certified for separation date should ideally be certified for more than one "clock" or several reference materials for different "clocks" should be developed. The first step {{of this study is to}} verify the known <b>separation</b> dates <b>of</b> different <b>plutonium</b> materials <b>of</b> different ages and isotopic compositions by measuring the mother (238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu, 241 Pu, 242 Pu) and daughter (234 U, 235 U, 236 U, 238 U and 241 Am) isotope abundances and to estimate the achievable uncertainties of the calculated ages. Thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) is applied for the measurement <b>of</b> the <b>plutonium</b> and uranium isotope ratios after chemical <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plutonium</b> and uranium fractions from the sample matrix, while 241 Am is measured by gamma-ray spectrometry.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The Hanford nuclear {{reservation}} in Washington state was initially created during World War II {{for the production}} <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> {{to be used in}} atomic bombs. A perceived need for a large {{increase in the number of}} nuclear weapons spurred expansions in production facilities at Hanford through the 1960 's, and production was continued through the mid 1980 's. The production process included irradiation of uranium fuel in reactors followed by chemical <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plutonium</b> from the other fuel constituents, and finally transformation <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> nitrate to plutonium metal. The various steps in the process produced large amounts of radioactive as well as chemical hazardous waste. Some of this waste was released to the environment either through deliberate disposal methods or by leaks in transfer and storage systems. As a result, the soil at many areas of Hanford is contaminated to a point at which it would be unsafe for human contact for more than a short period of time. The current focus of efforts at Hanford is cleanup of the environment as well as decommissioning of the facilities. As part of the cleanup process, future land use must be determined which will then affect the scale of the remediation effort. The proposed land use will determine the residual contamination which will be left after all remediation is complete and access is allowed to the site. This document details the process for determining the residual contamination levels associated with various land use options. Some possible land use options are explained in the form of exposure scenarios. These scenarios give data in the form of exposure factors which describe the possible exposure level of an individual to contaminated media. Once the exposure factors are determined, they can be used in the equations outlined in the Hanford Site Risk Assessment Methodology to calculate preliminary remediation goals. These goals are presented as contaminant concentrations in environmental media which are the maximum allowable in order to meet regulatory limits. The limits are expressed either as a risk for carcinogens, or as a hazard quotient for non-carcinogens...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{safeguards}} {{conclusions are}} based {{to a large}} extent on comparison of measurement results between operator and safeguards laboratories. Nuclear forensics deals with consistency of information, coherence between materials or samples, conformity of findings with declared processes and comparison of external and internal data.

For nuclear forensics, the laboratories are mainly members of the Nuclear Forensics International Technical Working Group (ITWG). Metrological quality control tools are a means to establish accurate, traceable and comparable measurement results. The European Commission-Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) has therefore put effort into the development of certified reference materials and the provision of conformity assessment tools, particularly for "age-dating" <b>of</b> uranium and <b>plutonium</b> samples, which is of importance to both communities.

50|$|Conversely, plutonyl is {{more easily}} reduced than uranyl. This {{difference}} is utilized in the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> from uranium in the PUREX process, as described below. The plutonyl ion is always associated with other ligands. The most common arrangement {{is for the}} so-called equatorial ligands to lie in a plane perpendicular to the O-Pu-O line and passing through the plutonium atom. With four ligands, as in PuO2Cl42− the plutonium has a distorted octahedral environment, with a square of ligand atoms in the equatorial plane. In plutonyl nitrate, PuO2(NO3)22H2O, as in uranyl nitrate there is a hexagon of six ligand atoms in the equatorial plane, four oxygen atoms from bidentate nitrate ions and two oxygens from the water molecules. Plutonyl nitrate, like uranyl nitrate, is soluble in diethyl ether. The complex that is extracted has no electrical charge. This {{is the most important}} factor in making the complex soluble in organic solvents. Also the water molecules are replaced by ether molecules.
