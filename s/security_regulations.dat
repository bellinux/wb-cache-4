5|$|Due to <b>security</b> <b>regulations</b> put {{in place}} by the Olympic organisers, spectators were not {{permitted}} to stand roadside along the course. Several prominent figures in cycling protested against this decision, including UCI president Pat McQuaid and two Australian riders, Stuart O'Grady and Cadel Evans, who competed in the men's race. McQuaid and O'Grady felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. Cycling Australia's reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the time trial to follow, but this plea was ignored.|$|E

5|$|For {{security}} reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson {{to operate}} the new plant, {{but it was a}} closed shop, and <b>security</b> <b>regulations</b> at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it {{to operate the}} plant for $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the job would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E
40|$|We {{document}} {{in this study}} that the institutional factor of <b>securities</b> <b>regulations</b> is positively associated with audit fees in low investor-protection countries. Strict <b>securities</b> <b>regulations</b> in these countries are likely to be associated with higher audit effort and risk, which result in higher audit fees. On the other hand, we do not find any significant association between audit fees and <b>securities</b> <b>regulations</b> in high investor-protection countries. Auditors in these countries generally expend higher audit effort to reduce risk irrespective of the strictness of <b>securities</b> <b>regulations.</b> Consequently, strict <b>securities</b> <b>regulations</b> do not {{have a significant impact on}} audit fees in these countries. Our findings suggest that strict <b>securities</b> <b>regulations</b> in weak investor-protection countries play an important role in audit pricing.

40|$|By {{combining}} {{new data}} on bilateral asset holdings with data on <b>securities</b> <b>regulation</b> in an empirical gravity model, {{it is found}} that bilateral differences in <b>securities</b> <b>regulation</b> lead to decreased portfolio holdings. Hence, regulatory harmonization can foster financial integration. The results are especially strong for equity holdings. It is verified that the results do not just reflect general economic, institutional, and cultural differences. Additional analysis of causality shows the exogenous component of asset holdings to be associated with larger differences in <b>securities</b> <b>regulation.</b> This might suggest that regulatory differences are used to protect domestic capital markets from outside competition.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if the <b>securities</b> <b>regulation</b> in a foreign country is related to the earnings quality of European firms cross-listed in Europe. The study compared the post-listing earnings quality of 112 European firms cross-listed in 13 European stock exchanges during 1989 - 2001 to those of a controlled sample of non-cross-listed firms. Earnings quality was assessed by the use of reporting discretion to manage earnings. The regulatory strictness was represented by three indices of <b>securities</b> <b>regulation.</b> Empirical results provide some support to a positive association between earnings quality and the foreign <b>securities</b> <b>regulation,</b> suggesting that the foreign regulatory requirements have little or no effect on the reported earnings of European firms cross-listed in European exchanges.

During this period, Barnard, Eldershaw and Frank Dalby Davison worked together to ensure the Fellowship of Australian Writers (FAW) functioned as a trade union of professional writers and that it adopted progressive positions on political questions.

It was officially opened on Day of Yugoslav People's Army on 22 December 1951. The first match ever played was between Yugoslavia and France on 9 October 1949. The stadium had a capacity of 55,000 until it was renovated in 1998 following UEFA <b>security</b> <b>regulations.</b> This led to the conversion of the stadium into an all-seater reducing the capacity to 32,710, currently the second largest stadium in Serbia, behind the Red Star Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Although Inayat Khan did {{not talk}} about her {{activities}} under interrogation, the SD found her notebooks. Contrary to <b>security</b> <b>regulations,</b> she had copied out all the messages she had sent as an SOE operative (this {{may have been due}} to her misunderstanding what a reference to filing meant in her orders, and also the truncated nature of her security course due to the need to insert her into France as soon as possible). Although she refused to reveal any secret codes, the Germans gained enough information from them to continue sending false messages imitating her. As a WAAF signaller, Inayat Khan had been nicknamed 'Bang Away Lulu' because of her distinctively heavy-handed style, which was said to be a result of chilblains.|$|E

25|$|In August, {{during the}} annual audit of Beznau 2, the 50 kV {{emergency}} power line was inactivated. Consequently, the diesel generator of Beznau 1 was switched on at low regime as prescribed by the <b>security</b> <b>regulations.</b> After the reconnection of the 50 kV line, the generator ran at higher load because of technical reasons, but it eventually failed {{due to a}} defective relay. It was therefore assumed that while the 50 kV line was not active the generator {{would not have been}} able to run at full loading. Since the unit 2 generator was also unavailable due to the planned audit, the emergency power could be provided only by the hydroelectric plant or backup generators activated in case of flood. The decrease in redundancy caused a deviation from the normal operation parameters and was therefore classified as a level 1 event (Swiss scale level B).|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{method of}} {{management}} at the OSRD was to direct overall policy, while delegating supervision of divisions to qualified colleagues and letting them do their jobs without interference. He attempted to interpret {{the mandate of the}} OSRD as narrowly as possible to avoid overtaxing his office and to prevent duplicating the efforts of other agencies. Bush would often ask: [...] "Will it help to win a war; this war?" [...] Other challenges involved obtaining adequate funds from the president and Congress and determining apportionment of research among government, academic, and industrial facilities. His most difficult problems, and also greatest successes, were keeping the confidence of the military, which distrusted the ability of civilians to observe <b>security</b> <b>regulations</b> and devise practical solutions, and opposing conscription of young scientists into the armed forces. This became especially difficult as the army's manpower crisis really began to bite in 1944. In all, the OSRD requested deferments for some 9,725 employees of OSRD contractors, of which all but 63 were granted. In his obituary, The New York Times described Bush as [...] "a master craftsman at steering around obstacles, whether they were technical or political or bull-headed generals and admirals." ...|$|E

40|$|In this Article, I {{propose a}} novel approach, which I call the “glass-half-empty” approach, {{to analyze the}} {{appropriate}} boundaries of <b>securities</b> <b>regulation.</b> This approach assumes a baseline of “full” regulation and then analyzes which regulations should be stripped away because the costs exceed the benefits. This {{is the opposite of}} the traditional approach, which assumes a baseline of zero regulation, identifies a market failure, and then weighs {{the costs and benefits of}} regulatory intervention. Although, in theory, the two approaches should reach the same conclusions about the appropriate bounds of <b>securities</b> <b>regulation,</b> the glass-half-empty approach yields new insights because it is a clearer way to identify boundary lines in a heavily-regulated field, reveals areas that have been overlooked under the traditional approach, is more likely to result in a coherent regulatory scheme than the current piecemeal approach, and defrays any bias against adding regulatory burdens that may infect the glass-half-full approach. The glass-half-empty approach, when applied to the fundamental components of <b>securities</b> <b>regulation,</b> supports several dramatic reforms to the current boundaries of <b>securities</b> <b>regulation.</b> I hope that the glass-half-empty approach, alongside the traditional approach, will become an integral part of future scholarly analysis about the appropriate bounds of <b>securities</b> <b>regulation</b> and that the insights that this approach reveals will be incorporated into future reforms of <b>securities</b> <b>regulation,</b> leading to a more comprehensive, coherent, and unbiased regulatory scheme that furthers accuracy in securities pricing...|$|R
