25|$|Vacuum {{deposition}} is not {{a suitable}} method for forming thin films of polymers. However, polymers can be processed in solution, and <b>spin</b> <b>coating</b> is a common method of depositing thin polymer films. This method is more suited to forming large-area films than thermal evaporation. No vacuum is required, and the emissive materials can also be applied on the substrate by a technique derived from commercial inkjet printing. However, as the application of subsequent layers tends to dissolve those already present, formation of multilayer structures is difficult with these methods. The metal cathode may {{still need to be}} deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum. An alternative method to vacuum deposition is to deposit a Langmuir-Blodgett film.|$|E

One of the largest application areas is thin films, which can be produced {{on a piece of}} substrate by <b>spin</b> <b>coating</b> or dip coating. Protective and decorative coatings, and electro-optic components can be applied to glass, metal and other types of substrates with these methods. Cast into a mold, and with further drying and heat-treatment, dense ceramic or glass articles with novel properties can be formed that cannot be created by any other method.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} the microstructure of all-polymer solar cell active films, where the active film of an all-polymer solar cell is the photoactive polymer layer used to harvest light. The morphology {{of the active}} film {{is important for the}} efficiency of the solar cells. Both charge separation, facilitated by smaller domains with more interfaces, and charge carrier mobility, improved by crystalline domains in the material, are of importance. The films in this work consist of the two polymers TQ 1 and N 2200. Active films <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> from different solvents are compared as well as films with or without thermal annealing. The active films containing both polymers in a bulk heterojunction are also compared to films of a single polymer <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> from the same solvents. The films were studied by transmission electron microscopy using bright field imaging and electron diffraction. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were also used to image the surface structure of the films. It was found that films of pure N 2200 <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> using ortho-dichlorobenzene or chloroform were crystalline as evidenced by electron diffraction. The films <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> with ortho-dichlorobenzene showed a fibrillar structure on the surface. This was in agreement with what was previously known about solution processed films of N 2200. For the bulk heterojunctions it was found that films <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> with chloroform crystallised during thermal annealing whereas thermal annealing did not seem to affect the films <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> with ortho-dichlorobenzene which showed crystalline order in both as-spun and annealed films. The data from the bulk heterojunctions showed that the morphology of the films <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> with chloroform had features on a smaller length scale when compared to films <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> with ortho-dichlorobenzene. This will affect the power conversion efficiency of devices made of these films, as both features on a smaller length scale and crystalline domains are favourable...|$|R
40|$|The {{promise of}} {{solution}} processed organic solar cells lies in their low-cost high-throughput manufacturability. However, this low cost aspect {{can only be}} fully realized {{if all of the}} layers are deposited by solution based, in-line compatible methods. Spray coating is a high-rate deposition technique characterized by the ability to deposit thin films over large areas by the superposition of femtoliter-size droplets. Here, with an automated ultrasonic spray coater we replaced each of the <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> layers of a polymeric solar cell. We alternatively replaced the active layer, based on a poly(3 -hexyl thiophene) (P 3 HT) :(6, 6) -phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixture, and the hole transport layer, a thin film of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), in a standard <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> device with evaporated top contact yielding efficiencies above 3 %, a performance which is comparable to that of the <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> corresponding device. The film quality, deduced from atomic force microscopy and absorption measurements, confirms that polymers can be deposited in smooth and uniform layers with characteristics comparable to <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> films. Furthermore, a Ag nanoparticle (NP) based solution can be applied as the patterned metal top contact, replacing vacuum evaporation, on top of <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> layers. After sintering the Ag nanoparticle film at 150 °C, a temperature which is compatible with processes on flexible substrates, the metal contacts and the resulting solar cells show conductivities and performances of 2. 5 %, comparable to those of reference devices with evaporated top-contacts. Spray coating of both polymers and Ag NP solutions can then be combined for the production of a fully spray coated organic solar cell with an overall efficiency of ~ 2 %. We will overview the strategies for achieving these cells as well as the challenges for making further improvements. status: submitte...|$|R

40|$|Thin organic {{films are}} used {{in a wide variety}} of applications, from {{membranes}} to microelectronics. While coating processes have been studied extensively, little work has been done in the quantitative characterization of the produced films. In this Thesis, <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> polymer films are characterized using ellipsometry and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy-Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR) for film quality. A new two-angle ellipsometric method for determining the thickness, refractive index, and film quality of a transparent film was developed, and was found to be better than conventional methods. Atactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> from toluene solutions at 23 °C, and subsequently annealed at 140 °C, were found with ellipsometry to be thinner, more uniform, and of higher quality than films <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> from chloroform solutions. This represents the first quantitative study of the quality of <b>spin</b> <b>coated</b> polymer films using two-angle ellipsometry. ‘Quality’ films imply close to normal bulk density, few defects or pores, and little surface roughness. FTIR-ATR spectroscopy was used as an additional method for assessing film quality by placing films in direct contact with liquid water and aqueous solutions of electrolytes and surfactants, and measuring the uptake of water in situ. <b>Spin</b> <b>coated</b> films absorbed non-bulklike water only. Poor quality films, produced by casting, absorbed bulklike water also. The highest quality films absorbed the least water overall at equilibrium. Results from dynamic mass transport experiments suggested that after water initially penetrated the films, pores and defects were filled on a longer timescale, from several minutes to hours. PMMA films, such as the ones produced here, have potential uses as semi-permeable membranes for the separation of electrolytes or surfactants from water. The selectivity may be controlled with the control of the film quality. The use of ellipsometry was expanded to the direct probing of the surface density of cationic surfactant monolayers at the air/water interface. The surface density results were robust and fairly reliable for the three algorithms tested. Ellipsometry results compared favorably to results from reflection absorption infrared Spectroscopy. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Spin</b> <b>coating</b> has its limitations, though.

50|$|The wafer {{is covered}} with {{photoresist}} by <b>spin</b> <b>coating.</b> A viscous, liquid solution of photoresist is dispensed onto the wafer, and the wafer is spun rapidly to produce a uniformly thick layer. The <b>spin</b> <b>coating</b> typically runs at 1200 to 4800 rpm for 30 to 60 seconds, and produces a layer between 0.5 and 2.5 micrometres thick. The <b>spin</b> <b>coating</b> process results in a uniform thin layer, usually with uniformity of within 5 to 10 nanometres. This uniformity {{can be explained by}} detailed fluid-mechanical modelling, which shows that the resist moves much faster {{at the top of the}} layer than at the bottom, where viscous forces bind the resist to the wafer surface. Thus, the top layer of resist is quickly ejected from the wafer's edge while the bottom layer still creeps slowly radially along the wafer. In this way, any 'bump' or 'ridge' of resist is removed, leaving a very flat layer. Final thickness is also determined by the evaporation of liquid solvents from the resist. For very small, dense features (< 125 or so nm), lower resist thicknesses (< 0.5 micrometres) are needed to overcome collapse effects at high aspect ratios; typical aspect ratios are < 4:1.|$|E
