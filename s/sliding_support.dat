40|$|The {{response}} of structures with <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> to bi-directional (i. e. two horizontal components) harmonic ground motion is investigated. The frictional forces mobilized at the <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> {{are assumed to}} have the ideal coulomb-friction characteristics. The coupled differential equations of motion of the sliding structure in two orthogonal directions are solved in the incremental form using Newmark's method with iterations. The iterations are required due to dependence of the frictional forces on the {{response of}} the system. The responses of the system with bi-directional interaction are compared with those without interaction (2 D idealization in two orthogonal directions) in order to investigate the effects of bi-directional interaction of frictional forces at the sliding supports. It has been shown that effects of bi-directional interaction are significant and should be included for the effective design of sliding structures. Further, if the effects of bi-directional interaction of frictional forces are neglected then the sliding base displacement will be underestimated which is crucial from the design point of view. In addition to harmonic ground motion the significant effects of bi-directional interaction are also observed for selected real earthquake ground excitations. Copyright (C) 1996...|$|E

The NS component of the El- Centro earthquake and harmonic ground acceleration is considered for earthquake excitation. The structure is modeled by considering six-degrees of freedom (three translations and three rotations) at each node. The <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> is modeled as a fictitious spring with two horizontal degrees of freedom. The response quantities considered for the study are the top floor acceleration, base shear, bending moment and base displacement. It is concluded from the study that the displacement of the structure reduces by the use of the restoring force device. Also, the peak values of acceleration, bending moment and base shear also decreases. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the developed and proposed method...|$|E
40|$|Molybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS 2) is {{a well-known}} solid lubricant for tribosystems running in vacuum or dry gases. Problems arise due to its sensitivity to humidity, which is a drawback for its application under ambient conditions. However, by using a physical vapor deposition (PVD) process, deposition parameters can be optimized not only to gain a coatings structure with favorable frictional properties but also to minimize the sensitivity to attack by water molecules. Therefore, an improved tribological behavior even under moist conditions can be achieved. MoS 2 coatings are also candidates for being applied at cryogenic temperatures. They already have proven their suitability, e. g., for <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> elements between superconducting magnets of the nuclear fusion-experiment Wendelstein 7 -X. However, these coatings were exclusively produced for this particular application and the utilization for more common tribosystems may be precluded due to cost considerations. In view of {{a wider range of}} applications, pure and Cr containing PVD-MoS 2 coatings with an optimized structure were tested under varying environments including hydrogen gas and cryogenic temperatures. Results of the most promising variant are presented in this paper...|$|E

On the basis of the relative research on the elastic beam equations with one end fixed and one end <b>sliding</b> <b>support,</b> and the multiple solutions of the elastic beam equation are researched. In this paper, through putting this problem into an integral equation, which is equivalent to an operator fixed-point problem, and combining with the properties of Green function and Guo- Krasnoselskii fixed point theorem of cone expansion and compression, the existence of positive solutions of this kind of elastic beam equations is discussed. Under various assumptions on nonlinear terms, the intervals of the parameters are established, and the existence of one positive solution, two positive solutions or nonexistence of positive solutions for this elastic beam equations are obtained. In conclusion, the intervals of eigenvalue about this problem for at least one positive solution, two positive solutions and nonexistence of positive solutions are obtained. The study of the existence of such solution can not only contribute to the stability analysis of elastic beams, but also enrich the theory of material mechanics...|$|E
40|$|Sliding {{supports}} {{are widely}} used in bridges, space structures, and power plants to avoid potential damages to the structure due to expansion and contraction effects caused by temperature changes. To {{ensure the safety of}} an important structure with sliding supports, it is desirable to know both the magnitudes and positions of sliding forces through strain measurements. Effective and practical identification of sliding forces based on strain measurements on site is therefore explored in this paper. The problems involved in the force identification of <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> systems are described. The finite element-based force identification technique and the strain measurement point selection procedure are then presented for the identification of sliding forces with no information required on their initial positions and magnitudes. The minimum strain measurement points with fairly good orthogonal property are targeted in the selection procedure. The quadratic programming problem with linear constraints and in some case the nonlinear least-squares method are involved in the identification of either concentrated sliding forces or uniformly distributed sliding loads. The feasibility and accuracy of the force identification technique and the strain measurement point selection procedure proposed in Part I of this paper will be demonstrated in Part II of this paper through numerical examples.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present some {{applications}} of Ground-Based Synthetic Aperture Radar (GBSAR) interferometry to the monitoring of dams, bridges and landslides. A SAR {{system is a}} coherent active microwave device able to provide 2 D refractivity images of a given area with high spatial resolution, independently of weather conditions and day-night cycle. SAR interferometry is the most notable application of SAR technology. This technique relies on the processing of a time series of coherent SAR images. It gives a powerful tool to produce maps of deformations occur-ring in infrastructures (dams, buildings, bridges) or terrain. In {{the last few years}} the research ac-tivity of several remote sensing groups has dealt with the development of GBSAR systems. GBSAR sensors represent a cost-effective solution for the continuous monitoring of small scale deformation phenomena if compared to space and air-borne systems. These systems basically con-sist of a CW radar mounted on a <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> and synthesizing in time an aperture longer than the physical dimension of their real antennas.

Some examples of application of GBSAR technology are de-scribed The GBSAR results are compared to measurements obtained by traditional instruments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Seismic {{performance}} of a symmetrical space frame structure resting on sliding bearing with restoring force device is studied considering all the six degrees of freedom. The <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> is modeled as a fictitious spring with two horizontal degrees of freedom. In non-sliding phase the horizontal stiffness of sliding bearing is considered as very large whereas it is equal to zero during sliding phase. The El Centro, Turkey and Mexico earthquakes are adopted as the input motion. The response quantities obtained from the analysis are the acceleration, base shear, bending moment and displacement. In this study, {{the response of the}} isolated structure is compared with the response of the structure fixed at the base. Response of the isolation system with restoring force device is also compared with the response of the isolation system without restoring force device. In addition, the effects of coefficient of friction of sliding material, time period of the superstructure and the number of storeys on response of structure are also investigated. It is concluded from the study that the sliding bearing with restoring force device reduces the earthquake response of the structure. The restoring force device reduces the sliding and residual displacements without transmitting additional forces into the structure. Response of the isolated structure varies with the coefficient of friction of sliding material, time period of superstructure and number of storeys. Also, there exists an optimum coefficient of friction of sliding material for acceleration, base shear and bending moment at which accelera-tion, base shear and bending moment attains a minimum value...|$|E
40|$|A rugged iris {{mechanism}} {{has been}} designed to satisfy several special requirements, including a wide aperture in the "open" position, full obscuration in the "closed" position, ability to function in a cryogenic or other harsh environment, and minimization of friction through minimization of the number of components. An important element of the low-friction aspect of the design is maximization of the flatness of, and provision of small gaps between, adjacent iris blades. The tolerances of the design can be very loose, accommodating thermal expansions and contractions associated with large temperature excursions. The design is generic in that it is adaptable {{to a wide range of}} aperture sizes and can be implemented in a variety of materials to suit the thermal, optical, and mechanical requirements of various applications. The mechanism (see figure) includes an inner flat ring, an outer flat ring, and an even number of iris blades. The iris blades shown in front in the figure are denoted as "upper," and the iris blades shown partly hidden behind the front ones are denoted as "lower. " Each iris blade is attached to the inner ring by a pivot assembly and to the outer ring by a roller/slider assembly. The upper and lower rings are co-centered and are kept in sliding contact. The iris is opened or closed by turning the outer ring around the center while holding the inner ring stationary. The mechanism is enclosed in a housing (not shown in the figure) that comprises an upper and a lower housing shell. The housing provides part of the <b>sliding</b> <b>support</b> for the outer ring and keeps the two rings aligned as described above. The aforementioned pivot assemblies at the inner ring also serve as spacers for the housing.
