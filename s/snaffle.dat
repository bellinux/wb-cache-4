5|$|Domesticated {{horses were}} present in Bronze Age Britain from around 2000BC. Bronze Age horse trappings {{including}} <b>snaffle</b> bits have been found which were used in harnessing horses to vehicles; Bronze Age cart wheels have been found at Flag Fen and Blair Drummond, the latter dating from around 1255â€“815BC, though these may have belonged to vehicles pulled by oxen. Early Bronze Age evidence for horses being ridden is lacking, though bareback riding may have involved materials which have not survived or have not been found; but horses were ridden in battle in Britain by the late Bronze Age. Domesticated ponies were on Dartmoor by around 1500BC.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Carpathian Basin provide {{evidence}} of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and <b>snaffle</b> bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver pectoral disks evidence {{the high levels of}} skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, decorated pectoral disks, and rings with gemstones.|$|E
25|$|The {{dressage}} horse {{at lower}} levels is only permitted to be shown at recognized competitions in a <b>snaffle</b> bit, though the detail regarding bitting varies slightly from organization to organization. The loose-ring <b>snaffle</b> with a single- or double-joint is most commonly seen. Harsher <b>snaffle</b> bits, such as twisted wire, corkscrews, slow-twists, and waterfords are not permitted, nor are pelhams, kimberwickes, or gag bits. Upper level and FEI dressage horses are shown in a double bridle, using both a bradoon and a curb bit with a smooth curb chain.|$|E

25|$|A bit {{consists}} of two basic components, the bit mouthpiece that goes inside the horse's mouth, and the bit rings of a <b>snaffle</b> bit or shanks of a curb bit, to which the bridle and reins attach.|$|E
25|$|Gag bit:A bit that, {{depending}} on design, may outwardly resemble a <b>snaffle</b> or a curb, but with added slots or rings that provide leverage by sliding the bit {{up in the}} horse's mouth, a very severe design.|$|E
25|$|A longeing cavesson may be {{used with}} or without a bridle. When used with a bridle {{containing}} a <b>snaffle</b> bit, the noseband of the bridle is removed, and the bridle goes over the longeing cavesson, to prevent pinching. The bridle cheekpieces sometimes need to be lengthened so that the bit still rests correctly in the mouth.|$|E
50|$|None of {{her books}} are {{currently}} in print, but Fidra Books republished Silver <b>Snaffles,</b> which appeared in late 2007.|$|R
50|$|<b>Snaffles</b> had {{a studio}} {{behind the house}} and {{although}} his most prolific painting days had passed, he still continued to sketch and turned his hand to producing a series of well-received books and also Christmas Cards for his friends. He and Lucy were often to {{be seen on the}} footpaths around Fonthill with their dogs and down by the lake. <b>Snaffles</b> died in 1967, Lucy in 1980. They are both buried in Fonthill Gifford churchyard.|$|R
50|$|Uses: Most {{commonly}} found on <b>snaffles,</b> quite rare on pelhams and gags. Usually seen in English disciplines. Not permitted in dressage competition.|$|R
25|$|Polo is ridden {{with double}} reins for greater {{accuracy}} of signals. The bit is frequently a gag bit or Pelham bit. In both cases, the gag or shank rein {{will be the}} bottom rein in the rider's hands, while the <b>snaffle</b> rein will be the top rein. If a gag bit is used, {{there will be a}} drop noseband in addition to the cavesson, supporting the tie-down. One of the rein sets may alternately be draw reins.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a variety}} of {{headgear}} used to control horses, predominantly bridles with assorted designs of bits. [...] Many of the bits used during the Middle Ages resemble the bradoon, <b>snaffle</b> bit and curb bit that are still in common use today. [...] However, they often were decorated to a greater degree: [...] the bit rings or shanks were frequently covered with large, ornamental [...] "bosses." [...] Some designs were also more extreme and severe than those used today.The curb bit was known during the classical period, but was not generally used during the Middle Ages until the mid-14th century. [...] Some styles of <b>snaffle</b> bit used during the Middle Ages had the lower cheek extended, {{in the manner of}} the modern half-cheek or full cheek <b>snaffle.</b> Until the late 13th century, bridles generally had a single pair of reins; after this period it became more common for knights to use two sets of reins, {{similar to that of the}} modern double bridle, and often at least one set was decorated.|$|E
500|$|Varian {{departed}} {{slightly from}} tradition. She started young horses under saddle {{at the age}} of three, beginning with a bridle and a <b>snaffle</b> bit because it sends clearer signals to a young horse, particularly one of sensitive disposition. [...] She then introduced the traditional hackamore, and, after a couple of months to transition between the hackamore and the <b>snaffle,</b> began teaching neck reining, which allows a horse to be ridden one-handed. After a year or two, when the horse became light in the hackamore, she introduced the young horse to the two-rein, using a light bosal with either a [...] "half-breed" [...] or a low-port curb bit. Once the horse understood the bit, the bosal was removed and the horse was ridden in just the curb bit for a while until ready to go into the full spade bit, at which point the horse went back into the two-rein when the spade is first introduced. She introduced horses to the spade bit {{at the age of}} seven or eight, if they had suitable conformation and temperament to carry it. When she selected and fully trained a spade bit horse for her own personal use, that particular horse stayed with her for life and was never sold.|$|E

500|$|The Turkic-speaking Pechenegs {{took the}} control of the territories east of the Carpathians from the Hungarians around 895. Emperor Constantine VII wrote that two Pecheneg [...] "provinces" [...] or [...] "clans" [...] ("Kato Gyla" [...] and [...] "Giazichopon") were located in Moldavia and Wallachia around 950. The change of {{dominion}} had no major effect on the sedentary [...] "Dridu" [...] villages in the region. The settlements in Moldavia and Wallachia, most of them built on river banks or lake shores, remained unfortified. Sporadic finds of horse brasses and other [...] "nomadic" [...] objects evidence the presence of Pechenegs in [...] "Dridu" [...] communities. <b>Snaffle</b> bits with rigid mouthpieces and round stirrupsnovelties of the early 10thcenturywere also unearthed in Moldavia and Wallachia. Cemeteries of the locals show that inhumation replaced cremation {{by the end of the}} 10thcentury.|$|E
2500|$|All bits {{work with}} either direct {{pressure}} or leverage. [...] Bits that act with direct {{pressure on the}} tongue and lips are in the general category of <b>snaffle</b> bits. <b>Snaffle</b> bits most commonly have a single jointed mouthpiece and act with a nutcracker effect on the bars, tongue and occasionally roof of the mouth. [...] However, any bit that operates only on direct pressure is a [...] "snaffle" [...] bit, regardless of mouthpiece.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Snaffle</b> bit: [...] Uses a bit ring {{at the bit}} {{mouthpiece}} {{to apply}} direct pressure on the bars, tongue and corner of the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Often, bits with shanks {{that also}} have single- or double-jointed {{mouthpieces}} are incorrectly {{referred to as}} <b>snaffles.</b> Because {{of the presence of}} a shank, they are actually in the curb bit family.|$|R

50|$|Use: Commonly seen on <b>snaffles,</b> rare in gags, pelhams, or curbs. This {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{mouthpieces}} for dressage work. However, it is used in many English-styled disciplines. It is rarely used in the Western-styled disciplines.|$|R
2500|$|Pelham bit: A single curb {{bit with}} {{two sets of}} reins {{attached}} to rings at the mouthpiece {{and end of the}} shank. [...] Partly combines <b>snaffle</b> and curb pressure.|$|E
2500|$|The bit used is a <b>snaffle</b> bit. Curb bits, having bit shanks of {{any kind}} are dangerous; the line can tangle in them, causing injury to the horse's mouth. [...] When longed off a bridle, the reins are {{kept out of the}} way, either by {{removing}} them, or by twisting them once or twice over the neck and then running the throatlatch of the bridle under the reins before buckling it.|$|E
2500|$|Some bits combine both direct {{pressure}} and leverage, {{the most common}} examples being the Pelham bit, which has shanks and rings allowing both direct and leverage pressure on a single bit and is ridden with four reins; the Kimblewick or Kimberwicke, a hybrid bit that uses minimal leverage on a modified snaffle-type ring combined with a mouthpiece that is usually seen more often on curb bits, ridden with two reins; and the double bridle, which places a curb and a <b>snaffle</b> bit simultaneously in the horse's mouth so that each may act independently of the other, ridden with four reins. [...] Another bit that combines direct {{pressure and}} leverage in a unique manner is the Gag bit, a bit derived from the <b>snaffle</b> that, instead of having a rein attached to the mouthpiece, runs the rein {{through a set of}} rings that attach directly to the headstall, creating extra pressure on the lips and poll when applied. [...] Usually used for correction of specific problems, the gag bit is generally illegal in the show ring and racecourse.|$|E
50|$|Uses: Seen in all equestrian activities, {{although}} less commonly in dressage. Usually not {{as popular}} for <b>snaffles</b> or gags as for bits that use leverage (pelham, Kimblewick, and curb). The straight bar {{is common in}} stallion in-hand bits.|$|R
50|$|The {{published}} {{dates of}} Primrose Cummingsâ€™ books make {{it likely that}} these were Spider Dog (1935), and perhaps Silver <b>Snaffles,</b> which presumably was accepted for publication {{by the time she}} was 21: it was published in 1936, when she was 22.|$|R

2500|$|Bridle; a Western bridle {{usually has}} a curb bit and long split reins {{to control the}} horse in many {{different}} situations. Generally the bridle is open-faced, without a noseband, unless the horse is ridden with a tiedown. Young ranch horses learning basic tasks usually are ridden in a jointed, loose-ring <b>snaffle</b> bit, often with a running martingale. In some areas, especially where the [...] "California" [...] style of the vaquero or buckaroo tradition is still strong, young horses are often seen in a bosal style hackamore.|$|E
2500|$|Riders {{must use}} a western saddle and a curb bit, and may only use {{one hand to}} hold the reins while riding. Two hands are allowed if the horse is ridden in a <b>snaffle</b> bit or hackamore, which are only {{permitted}} for use on [...] "junior" [...] horses, defined differently by various breed associations, but usually referring to horses {{four or five years}} of age and younger. Horses are not allowed to wear a noseband or cavesson, nor any type of protective boot or bandage, except during some tests that require a reining pattern.|$|E
2500|$|All bits {{act with}} some {{combination}} of pressure and leverage, often in conjunction with pressure applied by {{other parts of the}} bridle such as the curb chain on the chin, noseband on the jaw and face, or pressure on the poll from the headstall. [...] Particular mouthpieces do not define the type of bit. [...] It is the sidepieces and the leverage these rings or shanks use to act on a horse's mouth that determines whether a bit is in the curb or <b>snaffle</b> family, and has a great impact on the severity of the mouthpiece.|$|E
