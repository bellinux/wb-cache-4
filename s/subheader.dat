5000|$|The Dice Man {{is a novel}} {{published}} in 1971 by George Cockcroft under the pen name Luke Rhinehart and {{tells the story of}} a psychiatrist who begins making life decisions based on the casting of dice. Cockcroft wrote the book based on his own experiences of using dice to make decisions while studying psychology. The novel is noted for its subversion, anti-psychiatry sentiments and for reflecting moods of the early 1970s. Due to its subversive nature and chapters concerned with controversial issues such as rape, murder and sexual experimentation, it was banned in several countries. Upon its initial publication, the cover bore the confident <b>subheader,</b> [...] "Few novels can change your life. This one will" [...] and quickly became a modern cult classic.The book went through a number of republishings - in the United States it acquired the even more confident <b>subheader</b> [...] "This book will change your life", in spite of its being a highly edited version of the original. It was initially less successful than in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia.|$|E
40|$|PATCH {{provides}} information describing {{a portion of}} an image, a patch, to support exploitation. In order to achieve the specified resolution in a SAR image, the phase history data must be continuously collected over a calculated flight path distance; this batch of phase history is then processed into one SAR image patch. A search scene typically consists of many abutting or overlapping patches; each patch of the scene may be treated as an independent image and placed into a separate file, or placed into separate NSIF image segments within a single file; where multiple patches of a scene exactly abut to form a mosaic image, they may all (up to 999) be placed into a single NSIF image segment. PATCH contains support data pertaining to a single image patch, and one PATCH extension is created for each image patch. The PATCH_TOT field of the ACFT extension contains {{the total number of}} patches contained in the NSIF image segment (and corresponding PATCH extensions contained in the image <b>subheader).</b> For spot modes, there will normally be only one patch, and the corresponding PATCH may be omitted if all necessary information appears elsewhere in the file. PATCH extensions are placed in the <b>subheader</b> of the image containing the described patch...|$|E

The TRA- 604 laboratory components addressed in this closure plan were deferred from the TRA- 630 Catch Tank System closure plan due to ongoing laboratory operations in the areas requiring closure actions. The TRA- 604 laboratory components include the TRA- 604 laboratory warm wastewater drain piping, undersink drains, <b>subheaders,</b> and the east TRA- 604 laboratory drain header. Potentially contaminated surfaces located beneath the TRA- 604 laboratory warm wastewater drain piping and beneath the island sinks located in Laboratories 126 and 128 (located in TRA- 661) are also addressed in this closure plan. The TRA- 604 laboratory components will be closed in accordance with the interim status requirements of the Hazardous Waste Management Act/Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as implemented by the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act 58. 01. 05. 009 and 40 Code of Federal Regulations 265, Subparts G and J. This closure plan presents the closure performance standards and the methods for achieving those standards...|$|R

40|$|Re: This {{contribution}} propose additional capabilities for 802. 16 eD 6 802. 16 - 2004 {{allows for}} 5 <b>subheader</b> types and special payloads {{to be included}} with the payload message as described in section 6. 3. 2. 2. The present of these subheaders is indicated by a 6 -bit type field in the MAC header. The 6 -bit type field is used in a bit map fashion and thus the code space is limited to six values. All of the available code space has been allocated in 802. 16 - 2004. New requirements to support mobility and general enhancements prompted TGe to accept extension mechanism to allow extension of up to 11 more subheaders. This contribution proposes an extension mechanism that replaces the current extension mechanism, but which allows extension to a larger code space.
