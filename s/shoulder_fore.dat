40|$|A {{field study}} {{was carried out}} {{consisting}} of three parts: 1) Posture recording (by goniometrics) of <b>shoulder,</b> <b>fore</b> arm and wrist during the tasks that the bricklayers perform using their trowel; 2) Calculation of the wrist load moment value and 3) Questioning the bricklayers about their experience after using the prototypes. From the posture recording, it was seen {{that the use of}} prototype 2 resulted in a significantly shorter exposure to an extreme wrist posture (i. e., ulnar deviation) than prototype 1 and the traditional trowel. The wrist load value was significantly lower for prototype 2 compared to prototype 1 and the traditional trowel and lower for prototype 1 compared to the traditional trowel. The bricklayers mentioned that the functionality, user friendless and work performance are better for the traditional trowel compared to both prototypes. Spreading mortar in corners and stirring mortar can be better done using the traditional trowel in stead of using the prototypes, according to the bricklayers. Further, they say that the prototypes have a good fit in the hand and that shovelling and spreading mortar using the prototypes cause less physical load on the upper extremities compared to the traditional trowel...|$|E
40|$|This work aims {{to study}} sex and carcass weight effect on carcass and meat quality {{characteristics}} of a {{protected designation of origin}} (PDO) product, cabrito Transmontano. A total of 60 animals with carcass weight ranging between 4 and 8 kg were used. Carcass conformation, commercial joints, tissues measurements and proportions, carcass pH, meat colour and meat texture were evaluated. Sex had a significant effect on carcass composition and males had higher bone and less intermuscular fat and kidney knob and channel fat proportion than females. Males showed better carcass compactness {{as a result of a}} higher hot carcass weight (HCW) /carcass length (K) ratio. Carcass weight significantly affected carcass joint proportion. As the carcass weight increased there was an increase in carcass linear measurements, carcass compactness, chump and breast proportions, fat depots and tissues measurements and a decrease in leg, <b>shoulder,</b> <b>fore</b> ribs and bone proportion. Increasing carcass weight meat became less luminous with more vivid red colour as a result of a progressive brightness reduction and a redness increment. Consequently hue and chroma parameters went through a significant increase and decrease, respectively. A significant effect of carcass weight was found in longissimus dorsi muscle measurements, and muscle area increased as well the subcutaneous fat thickness. Carcass weight also had a significant effect on meat texture measured by Warner-Bratzler shear force, which reduced its value as carcass weight increased. The meat quality parameters studied could be a tool to identify and characterize a product with PDO as cabrito Transmonstano. Additional key words: carcass pH; goat meat; meat colour; tissue proportion...|$|E
40|$|Linear type traits {{describe}} biological extremes for a {{range of}} visual characteristics of an animal and one of the primary reason for collecting them is to allow breeders to select the most functional and profitable cows. Following this main objective, every year the National Breeders Associations train specific classifiers with the purpose to evaluate linear type traits in cows. Using data from the morphological evaluations on two Italian dual-purpose autochthonous breeds, the scores for each type trait has been investigated aiming to assess their genetic aspects and their correlations with the productive traits. Selection goals among the dual-purpose and indigenous breeds used in the study are very similar and lead to maintain both milk and meat production aptitudes. For this reason, the Associations give great emphasis to detect the correct weights to attribute to traits included in the indexes. The understanding of the genetics of both morphological and productive traits is therefore fundamental. The first two steps of the study have been conducted for two different dual-purpose breeds, but following almost the same analysis and taking into account in the model the same effects: the fixed effect of herd-year-classifier contemporary group, the days in milk and age at calving accounted into different classes and the genetic effect of the animal. For the first study, data regarding 20 different type traits from 10, 735 first parity cows of the Italian Rendena breed (mainly raised in Trentino Alto Adige region, Italy) were analysed through single trait animal model for the heritability estimates evaluation and using a multi-trait animal model to assess the genetic and phenotypic correlations between type traits. The most heritable type trait was stature (0. 52), whereas the lowest was feet (0. 12). The same group of type traits showed strong genetic correlations: ≥ 0. 69 among the individual body size traits, ≥ 0. 87 among the individual muscularity traits, from - 0. 39 to 0. 22 among the individual body shape traits, whereas a wider range were found among the individual udder traits (from – 0. 39 to 0. 91). Furthermore, almost all the genetic correlations between the individual muscularity and individual udder traits resulted negative (from - 0. 53 between <b>shoulder</b> <b>fore</b> view and rear udder attachment, to - 0. 15 between back, loins and rump and teat placement side view), with only few exception represented by genetic correlations of udder depth and teat length with all the four individual muscularity traits that showed slightly positive correlations (from 0. 07 to 0. 31). In this first step, also the genetic trends from 2000 to 2009 of type traits have been analysed. The most important result was that the genetic merit for muscularity traits decreased, whereas the genetic merit of the individual udder traits slowly increased over time, meaning that the dual-purpose characteristics of the Rendena cows are becoming more like specialized in milk production. The second step of the study was carried out with the aim to evaluate the genetic parameters of linear type traits in another dual-purpose indigenous breed: the Valdostana breed (mainly raised in Valle d’Aosta region, Italy). Morphological evaluations on 25, 183 cows of the Aosta Red Pied (ARP) strain and 14, 701 cows of the Aosta Black Pied and Chestnut (ABP-CHES) strain were used to analyse heritability and genetic correlations of 26 different type traits within strain. Heritability estimates obtained from the single-trait animal model analysis ranged from 0. 03 (thinness for both strains) to 0. 32 (ARP) and 0. 29 (ABP-CHES) of stature. Regarding the genetic correlations between the individual type traits, for ARP strain the strongest correlation was between thigh, buttocks side and rear view (0. 97), whereas for the ABP-CHES strain the highest correlations were observed between stature and body length (0. 98), meaning that selecting for one trait lead to the simultaneous improvement of the other. Also for the Valdostana breed, most of the genetic correlations between muscularity and udder traits resulted negative, especially those involving udder volume. These results indicate a substantial antagonistic behaviour of type traits related to dairy and beef characteristics of animals. The following step has been addressed to the analysis of a simpler way to manage the large number of information given by the type traits scored on animals and managed by the Breeders Associations. To avoid redundant information in selection indexes, {{only a limited number of}} type traits with a known biological relationship with production should be used in the morphological evaluation. Factor analysis resulted to be a useful procedure to group type traits, so that correlated traits could be isolated in the same factor, and therefore each factor could include traits with common biological characteristics. In this study, a factor analysis was applied to 20 individual linear type traits evaluated on 11, 399 Rendena cows, and to 22 individual linear type traits evaluated on 36, 168 ARP cows. From this procedure, six latent common factors, for each breed, with eigenvalues ≥ 1 were obtained, explaining 63...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2009 Infrared {{thermography}} (IRT) {{was used}} to collect baseline information on skin surface temperatures of two species of pinnipeds, the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina; n = 6) and the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus; n = 2). The IRT technique was validated against objects of known temperature and through post-collection software manipulation of environmental parameters that influence IRT output (emissivity, distance, relative humidity, ambient temperature and reflected temperature). From February 2007 to February 2008, biweekly measurements were taken of skin surface temperature (FLIR P 25 infrared camera) with subsequent measurements of blubber depth (SonoSite Vet 180 portable imaging ultrasound system) on captive individuals at the Alaska SeaLife Center, Seward, Alaska. Once validated, skin surface temperatures in 10 defined regions (whole body, torso, head, eye, muzzle, <b>shoulder,</b> axillae, hip, <b>fore</b> and hind flipper) {{were used to determine}} seasonal variability as well as consistent hot or cold spots, and of those spots, which may act as thermal windows (defined areas of active heat loss and/or retention). Concurrent measurements of blubber depth were compared to skin surface temperatures at eight body sites to assess: a) the impact of insulation level on skin surface temperature on a site-specific scale, and b) the potential use of IRT as an alternative method for the non-invasive measurement of body condition. Both species varied seasonally in skin surface temperature from winter to reproductive and molt to winter, however, harbor seals had greater regional variation. Similar hot and cold spots were consistently recognized in both species with <b>shoulder,</b> axillae, <b>fore</b> and hind flipper identified as likely thermal windows. While some site-specific significant relationships were found between skin surface temperature and blubber thickness, insulation level alone explained a very small portion of the variance. Future studies to determine the factors influencing the variance on skin surface temperature (i. e., blood flow to the skin) warrant further exploration...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of the meat yield {{breeding}} values of sires on highly valued parts of carcasses in their progeny. The study was carried out on Czech Fleckviehs, a breed dual purpose milk-beef production. Cutting parts evaluated were: round, strip loin and tender loin (first-class meat); rib, <b>shoulder</b> blade (boneless), <b>fore</b> shank, flank, chuck roll + neck (second-class meat) and separable fat. The correlation analysis showed significant negative relationships only for the relative breeding values of trading classes and the rib (r=− 0. 2079); relative breeding values of net daily gain with strip loin (r=− 0. 2433). Although strip loin is an important first-class meat cut, the correlation is rather low. Correlations between other meat cuts with breeding values were non-significant. The correlation between meat cuts and age showed the same pattern as correlations between meat cuts and weight at slaughter. Significant negative correlations were found between first-class meat and increasing age (r=− 0. 1979) and weight (r=− 0. 2884). In contrast, for second-class meat there were positive correlation with increasing age and weight (r= 0. 3489 for age, r= 0. 4495 for weight). This also corresponds with the correlation between age or weight and specific first-class meat cuts (tender loin r=− 0. 2804, r=− 0. 3413, strip loin r=− 0. 3710, r=− 0. 2012) and second-class meat (sep. fat r=+ 0. 2360, r=+ 0. 2951, r for correlation with age and weight respectively). Based on the calculations of canonical analysis 27. 75 % explained variability was found for variables relative breeding value of net daily gain (RBVndg), relative breeding value of trading class (RBVtc), age and weight using a linear combination of variables for individual cuts. At the same time, 14. 25 % explained variability was found for cut variables which can be expressed using linear combinations of RBVndg, RBVtc, age and weight...|$|R

The tiger was a [...] "rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life," [...] and had muscular limbs. The male lion was [...] "medium-sized." [...] Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first as they were separated by a wall that was about 4.0 ft tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry cat, which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. As they fought, which involved making bites or scratches, they growled in a way that turned the hunter's hair gray, in his own words. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary, {{but that was not the}} case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its <b>fore</b> <b>shoulder,</b> before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now, the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like that of dogs unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about 2.0 ft deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, limping into the forest.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the effect of diets containing levels of linseed oil in the performance, carcass characteristics, weight, yield of cuts of meat, and meat quality of heifers and steers Nellore x Canchim. Fifteen 24 -monthold steers (427. 80 ± 40. 59 kg) and fourteen 24 -month-old heifers (400. 57 ± 32. 57 kg, average body weight) were confined in individual pens, receiving diets with 80 % of concentrated, sugar cane as exclusive roughage and increasing levels of linseed oil (1. 0, 3. 8 and 5. 2 % on a DM basis). The experiment was designed in an incomplete random blocks one, in a factorial scheme of 3 x 2 (type of diet and sexual condition). The initial weight of animals was used as co-variable and the blocks were considered as the randomizing effect. All of the animals of every block were slaughtered once they reached an average body weight of 500 kg; this resulted in 96 days of feedlot for two blocks, 110 days for other two blocks and 138 days for one block, after 28 days of adaptation. Dry matter consumption by animals, in kg and body weight percentage, was reduced (P< 0. 05), accompanied with higher daily weight gains, an improvement in feed efficiency {{and an increase in}} the Longissimus eye area in the carcass with an elevation of oil levels in diets, without differences between sex conditions. The backfat thickness increased with higher linseed oil levels on the diet and results differed between sex conditions, with higher values for heifers (12. 17 mm) in relation to steers (8. 58 mm). The weight of meat cuts such as the shoulder clod, complete top sirloin butt (top sirloin butt + top sirloin cap + bottom sirloin butt), strip loin and top round, as well as the sum of the noble meat cuts (top sirloin butt + strip loin + full tenderloin), less noble meat cuts (chuck roll + chuck mock tender + <b>shoulder</b> clod + <b>fore</b> shank and shank + hump + point half brisket + neck + outside round), barbecue [...] . Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar dietas contendo teores de óleo de linhaça sobre o desempenho, as características da carcaça, o peso, o rendimento de cortes cárneos, e a qualidade da carne de fêmeas e machos castrados Nelore x Canchim. Quinze machos castrados (427, 80 ± 40, 59 kg) e 14 fêmeas (400, 57 ± 32, 57 kg, em média de peso corporal), com 24 meses de idade foram confinados, recebendo dietas com 80 % de concentrado, cana-de-açúcar como volumoso exclusivo e teores crescentes de óleo de linhaça (1, 0; 3, 8 e 5, 2 % da MS). O delineamento experimental foi em blocos incompletos ao acaso, em esquema fatorial 3 x 2 (dietas e condição sexual), sendo o peso inicial dos animais utilizado como covariável e os blocos como efeito aleatório. Todos os animais de cada bloco foram abatidos quando o peso corporal médio atingiu 500 kg; assim, o tempo de confinamento foi de 96 dias para dois blocos, 110 dias para dois blocos e 138 dias para um bloco, após 28 dias de adaptação. O consumo de matéria seca pelos animais, em kg/dia e % do peso corporal, foi reduzido (P< 0, 05), acompanhado de maiores ganhos de peso, melhora da eficiência alimentar e aumento da área de olho de lombo na carcaça com a elevação dos teores de óleo nas dietas, sem diferenças entre as condições sexuais; a espessura de gordura de cobertura na carcaça foi crescente com o aumento dos teores de óleo de linhaça na dieta e diferiu entre as condições sexuais, com maiores valores para as fêmeas (12, 17 mm) em relação aos macho castrados (8, 58 mm).
