50|$|Power systems contain {{protective}} devices to prevent {{injury or damage}} during failures. The quintessential protective device is the fuse. When the current through a fuse exceeds a certain threshold, the fuse element melts, producing an arc across the resulting gap that is then extinguished, interrupting the circuit. Given that fuses can be built as the weak point of a system, fuses are ideal for protecting circuitry from damage. Fuses however have two problems: First, after they have functioned, fuses must be replaced as they cannot be reset. This can prove inconvenient if the fuse is at a remote site or a <b>spare</b> <b>fuse</b> is not on hand. And second, fuses are typically inadequate as the sole safety device in most power systems as they allow current flows well in excess of that that would prove lethal to a human or animal.|$|E
50|$|The A350 {{comes with}} leather saddle bags {{and a few}} odd {{military}} accessories. One is the blackout light for night riding, {{and the other is}} mounts for two SIG 57 assault rifles. The side covers house a large air filter and <b>spare</b> bulbs and <b>fuses</b> in a foam block, and the other side contains a tool set, a lock, a cleaning brush, and goggles.|$|R
50|$|Consumer {{fireworks}} can be {{used with}} a variety of tools. One set of tools has to do with basic ignition, such as lighters, matches, and punks also known as a 'port fire'. By using a rack, one can ignite a series of different fireworks to create a scene. These sometimes allow for the finales seen at professional fireworks displays to be created using consumer fireworks. Racks {{can be used}} with multiple types of fireworks, such as aerial shells, fountains, Roman candles, and the newest class of fireworks, 500 gram repeaters. Other tools are involved with the setup of fireworks for later display, such as shovels, various hand tools, and <b>spare</b> visco <b>fuses.</b> The true scope of tools used with consumer fireworks is limited only by the displayer's imagination.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis describes {{design and}} manufacture of airsoft spare parts. Selected spare parts were hammer and spring holder, which were designed in 3 D parametric software Autodesk Inventor 2016. Chosen method to manufacture <b>spare</b> parts, was <b>Fused</b> Modeling Deposition, {{which is part}} of Rapid Prototyping technology. The device for producing parts was 3 D printer uPrint. The manufacture of silicon mould was based on printed spring holder, which was used for parts manufacture, by casting plastic materi√°l. Thesis is completed with a technical-economical evaluation, in which {{it was found that the}} silicon mould casting is more profitable in the production of more parts...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the Metrology Data Processor (METDAT), the Optical Surface Analysis Code (OSAC), and their {{application to the}} image evaluation of the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) mirrors. The FUSE instrument - designed and developed by the Johns Hopkins University and launched in June 1999 is an astrophysics satellite which provides high resolution spectra (lambda/Delta(lambda) = 20, 000 - 25, 000) in the wavelength region from 90. 5 to 118. 7 nm The FUSE instrument is comprised of four co-aligned, normal incidence, off-axis parabolic mirrors, four Rowland circle spectrograph channels with holographic gratings, and delay line microchannel plate detectors. The OSAC code provides a comprehensive analysis of optical system performance, including the effects of optical surface misalignments, low spatial frequency deformations described by discrete polynomial terms, mid- and high-spatial frequency deformations (surface roughness), and diffraction due to the finite size of the aperture. Both normal incidence (traditionally infrared, visible, and near ultraviolet mirror systems) and grazing incidence (x-ray mirror systems) systems can be analyzed. The code also properly accounts for reflectance losses on the mirror surfaces. Low frequency surface errors are described in OSAC by using Zernike polynomials for normal incidence mirrors and Legendre-Fourier polynomials for grazing incidence mirrors. The scatter analysis of the mirror is based on scalar scatter theory. The program accepts simple autocovariance (ACV) function models or power spectral density (PSD) models derived from mirror surface metrology data as input to the scatter calculation. The end product {{of the program is}} a user-defined pixel array containing the system Point Spread Function (PSF). The METDAT routine is used in conjunction with the OSAC program. This code reads in laboratory metrology data in a normalized format. The code then fits the data using Zernike polynomials for normal incidence systems or Legendre-Fourier polynomials for grazing incidence systems. It removes low order terms from the metrology data, calculates statistical ACV or PSD functions, and fits these data to OSAC models for the scatter analysis. In this paper we briefly {{describe the}} laboratory image testing of <b>FUSE</b> <b>spare</b> mirror performed in the near and vacuum ultraviolet at John Hopkins University and OSAC modeling of the test setup performed at NASA/GSFC. The test setup is a double-pass configuration consisting of a Hg discharge source, the FUSE off-axis parabolic mirror under test, an autocollimating flat mirror, and a tomographic imaging detector. Two additional, small fold flats are used in the optical train to accommodate the light source and the detector. The modeling is based on Zernike fitting and PSD analysis of surface metrology data measured by both the mirror vendor (Tinsley) and JHU. The results of our models agree well with the laboratory imaging data, thus validating our theoretical model. Finally, we predict the imaging performance of FUSE mirrors in their flight configuration at far-ultraviolet wavelengths...|$|R
