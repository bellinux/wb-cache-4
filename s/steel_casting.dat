5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony). Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in <b>steel</b> <b>casting.</b> Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium—in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium)—is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) driving wheels which were lighter, yet stronger than the spoked equivalent. These proved to be successful and were later used on other Bulleid classes. The leading bogie was based upon that of the SR Lord Nelson class, although it had a 6ft 3 in (1.90 m) wheelbase as opposed to Maunsell's 7ft 6 in (2.28 m) design, and featured 3ft 1 in (0.94 m) BFB wheels. A long coupled driving wheelbase was incorporated into the design, to keep the locomotives within the lineal loading of the Southern Railway's narrower bridges. The supporting rear trailing truck was a one-piece <b>steel</b> <b>casting</b> that gave the smoothest of rides; the design was utilised in the future BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The inverse problem {{consisting}} in {{the identification}} of volumetric latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> is presented. Additionally it is assumed that the courses of temperature at the points from the casting or mould are known. The substitute thermal capacity of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> (this parameter is directly connected with the latent heat) is approximated by the fourth-degree polynomial. In order to solve the inverse problem the least squares criterion containing the sensitivity coefficients is applied. In the final part of the paper the results of computations are shown. Design/methodology/approach: In this work numerical modelling of solidification process is applied. A <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> solidifying in a sand mould is analyzed. The information concerning the course of cooling curve at the selected point from the casting domain is used in order to identify the latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast.</b> Findings: It is shown that only one sensor located at the optional point from casting or mould domain gives the information sufficient for successful identification of unknown parameter. Research limitations/implications: Further work requires an introducing of real temperature measurements to the model presented. Practical implications: The paper shows the possibilities of thermophysical parameters identification on the basis of temperature measurements. In the case considered the latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> has been identified. Originality/value: The algorithm presented allows to identify the latent heat {{in the case of the}} complex, temperature dependent function determining the substitute thermal capacity of metallic alloy...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{abrasive}} wear tests {{carried out in}} an environment of SiC-water slurry on four grades of <b>cast</b> <b>steel,</b> i. e. carbon <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> with microadditions of vanadium, low-alloy L 70 H 2 GNM <b>cast</b> <b>steel,</b> and high-alloy L 120 G 13 <b>cast</b> <b>steels,</b> without and with microadditions of vanadium, were discussed. Tests were carried out on a Miller machine. A measure of the abrasive wear resistance was the loss of mass in specimens during 16 hour test cycle. It has been proved that the L 120 G 13 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> is definitely less resistant to abrasive wear than its L 70 H 2 GNM counterpart. On the other hand, no distinct differences in the abrasive wear resistance were noticed between the L 120 G 13 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> without vanadium, and the L 120 G 13 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> and carbon <b>cast</b> <b>steel,</b> both with microadditions of vanadium...|$|R

2500|$|Although it was {{somewhat}} controversial, authorities decided to allow bids to include major components and materials not {{made in the}} United States.

40|$|Abstract. With the {{improvement}} of casting and material technology, <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> is continuously used in practical engineering projects. Domestic and foreign scholars studied the performance of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> joints by experiment or the other methods and extended them to beam-column connections in steel frames. This paper mainly introduced the development of beam-column connection forms, the main problems in joint design, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the joints with various forms, material properties and manufacturing process characteristics of <b>cast</b> <b>steel,</b> advantages of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> joints and fasteners, research status and achievements at home and abroad. The results show that compared with traditional connection forms, designers have full freedom to choose the shapes and the sizes, and joints made of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> have the best adaptability and changeability in different engineering practice, what’s more, they have no problems with welding residual stress and stress concentration. Compared with other materials, <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> has more advantages such as flexible application, convenience of connections, small volume, low cost.

40|$|The {{so-called}} adamitic <b>cast</b> <b>steels</b> are characterised {{by a high}} abrasion resistance. These <b>cast</b> <b>steels</b> are of a pearlitic matrix with uniformly distributed hypereutectoid cementite precipitates. Apart from hypereutectoid cementite {{very often}} transformed ledeburite also occurs in the microstructure of these <b>cast</b> <b>steels.</b> Such <b>cast</b> <b>steels</b> contain chromium (app. 1 %) and nickel (app. 0. 5 %) as alloy additions and sometimes their silicon content is increased. The presence of molybdenum is also permissible (app. 0. 4 %). The basic problem in application of these steels for structural elements constitutes their insufficient crack resistance. An improvement of mechanical properties by changes of morphology of hypereutectoid cementite and transformed ledeburite precipitates {{by means of the}} heat treatment application was the aim of this study.
