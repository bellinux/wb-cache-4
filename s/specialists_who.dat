5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} molluscs appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because many regions have not been thoroughly surveyed. There is also a shortage of <b>specialists</b> <b>who</b> can identify all the animals in any one area to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, {{the great majority of}} mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List. About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of molluscs, consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. <b>Specialists</b> <b>who</b> focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
5|$|The Tour of Qatar {{is one of}} {{the early}} races in the season, coming in the middle of three races in the Middle East (alongside the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Oman) that see high levels of {{participation}} from the top European teams. The race is particularly popular as a preparation race for riders aiming for the spring classics. The significant challenge in the Tour of Qatar is the strong winds across the desert, which frequently cause the peloton to split into echelons. As well as attracting the top classics riders, the flat nature of the course means many stages can be won by sprinters; the individual time trial also attracts many of the time trial <b>specialists,</b> <b>who</b> have a chance of overall victory.|$|E

25|$|Economic demand {{influences}} {{the location of}} particular specialties. For example, more orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry {{are more likely to}} practice in high income areas.

25|$|After the 1949 revolution, the Institute of Geography {{under the}} aegis of the Chinese Academy of Sciences became {{responsible}} for official cartography and emulated the Soviet model of geography throughout the 1950s. With its emphasis on fieldwork, sound knowledge of the physical environment and the interrelation between physical and economic geography, the Russian influence counterbalanced the many pre-liberation Western-trained Chinese geography <b>specialists</b> <b>who</b> were more interested in the historical and culture aspects of cartography. As a consequence, China's main geographical journal, the Dili Xuebao (地理学报） featured many articles by Soviet geographers. As Soviet influence waned in the 1960s, geographic activity continued as part of the process of modernisation until it came to a stop with the 1967 Cultural Revolution.|$|E
