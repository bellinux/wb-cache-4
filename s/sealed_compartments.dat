5000|$|Hermetic {{storage is}} the process of storing grain or seeds inside <b>sealed</b> <b>compartments</b> to avoid gas changes with the {{environment}} in order to deplete the oxygen and accumulation of dioxide carbon gas. This combination is lethal to insects and molds, creating an alternative control instead of using any other substance nocive to these pests and maintaining the product quality.This storage method is an important aspect for enhancing and elongating grain life at the same time maintaining the grain integrity. Hermetic storage {{has been around for a}} long times and it has been received well and largely in developing countries since the inception of the method. The method can exercised using different materials such as sealed clay pots, sealed plastic bags, sealed metals etc. These materials are effective in their own right and cost are variable therefore caution need to be practiced to preclude insects infestation during storage time. The process is of utmost importance. Ideally a successful hermetic storage would mean grains are able to retain all their nutrient quality and crushable commodities are well kept for the entire process of storage. Hypothetically, if ninety five percent (95%) of the grain retains their natural characteristic and quality, therefore, statistically hermetic grain storage would mean its efficient and effective method. Nonetheless, the method is used worldwide in Africa, Asia and majority parts of America. The scale of acceptance of this method assure its quality in preserving small and large scale farmer’s crops. Developing countries are relentless and do not want to be left behind, there are enthusiastically adopting the method in large scales as they have seen the benefits of using this storage process.Benefits of using the hermetic storage method include (i) enhances grain life in a much safer and it is rodent-free, weevils-free, pesticides-free and prevents infestation of insects, (ii) the storage process is defiant and resistant to harsh conditions (with the exception of extremely harsh conditions i.e. temperature 0 to -20 degrees Celsius, being unfavorable for oil palm seeds storage [...] such as hot and humid climates, (iii) the mortality of living organisms is kept at 100 percent rate, (iv) precludes mold from developing and (v) mycotoxins which have a high likelihood to cause cancer are totally annihilated. Prior to hermetic storage, grain need to be properly dried to moisture content range of approximately 12 - 14 percent to avoid germination and viability losses. Germination and viability are crucial for crop productions and if losses are encountered then it would mean a loss in profits.|$|E

40|$|SummarySome {{bacteria}} invade host cells by {{triggering a}} process akin to phagocytosis. We analyzed the mechanisms underlying invasion vacuole formation by the bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. After engaging integrins on host cells, Yersinia resided in PI(4, 5) P 2 -rich, membrane-bound compartments called “prevacuoles” that were inaccessible to extracellular antibodies but remained {{connected to the}} plasma membrane. The scission of prevacuoles to form separate, <b>sealed</b> <b>compartments</b> coincided with and required PI(4, 5) P 2 hydrolysis. At the time of scission, the inositol 5 -phosphatases OCRL and Inpp 5 b were recruited to prevacuoles. This recruitment and subsequent PI(4, 5) P 2 hydrolysis required the association of the GTPase Rab 5 with prevacuoles. Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase activity was required for fusion of Rab 5 -positive vesicles with prevacuoles and scission of nascent vacuoles from the plasma membrane. Thus, Yersinia invasion involves a multistep {{process in which the}} bacteria form a protective prevacuole and then recruit host factors to induce membrane fission, allowing the bacteria to invade the cell...|$|E

In particular, hydrophilicity has a strong influence on retention, with highly hydrophilic dyes (LogD < - 7) showing stable, buffer/medium independent retention. In the case of less hydrophilic dyes, we showed that retention can be improved by adjusting the surfactants physical properties, such as geometry, length, and concentration.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that intercellular adhesion can be subdivided into two separable phenomena [...] an initial recognition event and a subsequent stabilization [...] {{is supported by}} the use of a cell binding assay that provides a quantitative measure of intercellular binding strengths. Radioactive single cells are brought into contact with cell monolayers at 4 degrees C in <b>sealed</b> <b>compartments.</b> The compartments are inverted and a centrifugal force is then applied to dislodge the probe cells from the monolayers. By varying the speed of centrifugation, the force maintaining associations between embryonic chicken neural retina cells was determined to be on the order of 10 (- 5) dyne. Topographic specificities of single neural retina cells for retinal monolayers from various regions of the retina were detected with this assay and corresponded to those observed in more traditional assays at 37 degrees C. Also observed were two time- and temperature-dependent stabilization processes in which the force required for dislodgment increased. One of the stabilization processes was sensitive to dinitrophenol and was inactive at 4 degrees C; the second was still active in metabolically blocked cells.

40|$|Abstract. The {{approaches}} and background Earth model applicable for overpressure phenomenon investigation have been reviewed and systemised {{in the context}} of their applicability for pre-drill and while-drill prediction. An Effective Basin Model (EBM) concept has been introduced basing on the successive assumption simplifying full-scale basin modelling solutions. The EBM concept allows to incorporate 1 -D and 2 -D approaches to overpressure modelling in basin time scale. The relevant combine 3 -D overpressure modelling operator has been designed. The operator has been capable to account for the main overpressuring mechanisms including 3 -D pressure communication phenomena (centroid effect, dipping aquifer beds, pressure drop across the sealing faults, etc.). A stable implicit scheme has been developed for numerical pressure solutions. The scheme reveals absolute numerical stability within the practically important range of model parameters and combined grid properties. The benefits of the developed combined 3 -D HD approach versus full scale 3 -D regular grid solution in computing speed is estimated to be about N⋅(105 - 106) times for the Earth model cube based on about 109 cells. The applicability of the new fast 3 -D modelling scheme has been tested on real geology settings and has been checked against real data.
