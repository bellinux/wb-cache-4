25|$|The {{molecular}} composition between conventional neuronal synapse and ribbon synapse {{is surprisingly}} dissimilar. At {{the core of}} synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery in vertebrate neuronal synapses is the SNARE complex. The minimally functional SNARE complex includes <b>syntaxin</b> 1, VAMP 1 and 2, and SNAP-25. In contrast, genetic ablation or application of botulinum, targeting SNAP-25, <b>syntaxin</b> 1-3, and VAMP 1-3, did not affect inner hair cell ribbon synapse exocytosis in mice. Additionally, no neuronal SNAREs were observed in hair cells using immunostaining, pointing {{to the possibility of}} a different exocytosis mechanism. However, several studies found SNARE mRNA and protein expressed in hair cell, perhaps indicating presence of a neuronal SNARE complex in ribbon synapse that is present in low levels and with very redundant components.|$|E
25|$|After the {{synaptic}} vesicles initially dock, {{they must}} be primed before they can begin fusion. Priming prepares the synaptic vesicle {{so that they are}} able to fuse rapidly in response to a calcium influx. This priming step is thought to involve the formation of partially assembled SNARE complexes. The proteins Munc13, RIM, and RIM-BP participate in this event. Munc13 is thought to stimulate the change of the t-SNARE <b>syntaxin</b> from a closed conformation to an open conformation, which stimulates the assembly of v-SNARE /t-SNARE complexes. RIM also appears to regulate priming, but is not essential for the step.|$|E
25|$|In full {{collapse}} fusion, the synaptic vesicle merges {{and becomes}} {{incorporated into the}} cell membrane. The formation of the new membrane is a protein mediated process and can only occur under certain conditions. After an action potential, Ca2+ floods to the presynaptic membrane. Ca2+ binds to specific proteins in the cytoplasm, {{one of which is}} synaptotagmin, which in turn trigger the complete fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the cellular membrane. This complete fusion of the pore is assisted by SNARE proteins. This large family of proteins mediate docking of synaptic vesicles in an ATP-dependent manner. With the help of synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle, the t-SNARE complex on the membrane, made up of <b>syntaxin</b> and SNAP-25, can dock, prime, and fuse the synaptic vesicle into the membrane.|$|E

40|$|Specific <b>syntaxins,</b> such as Arabidopsis AtPEN 1 and its barley {{ortholog}} ROR 2, play a {{major role}} in plant defense against powdery mildews. Indeed, the impairment of these genes results in increased fungal penetration in both host and non-host interactions. In this study, a genome-wide survey allowed the identification of 21 tomato <b>syntaxins.</b> Two of them, named SlPEN 1 a and SlPEN 1 b, are closely related to AtPEN 1. RNAi-based silencing of SlPEN 1 a in a tomato line carrying a loss-of-function mutation of the susceptibility gene SlMLO 1 led to compromised resistance toward the tomato powdery mildew fungus Oidium neolycopersici. Moreover, it resulted in a significant increase in the penetration rate of the non-adapted powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei.

50|$|Indeed, in C.elegans DAG regulates UNC-13, a plasma-membrane {{associated}} protein {{critical for}} vesicle-mediated neurotransmitter release and mutational {{studies have shown}} that two UNC-13 reduction of function mutants show resistance to emodepside, observations supporting this hypothesized mechanism of action.The mechanism by which activation of UNC-13 results in neurotransmitter release (the ultimate result of latrophilin activation) is through interaction with the synaptosomal membrane protein <b>syntaxin,</b> with UNC-13 binding to the N-terminus of <b>syntaxin</b> and promoting the switch from the closed form of <b>syntaxin</b> (which is incompatible with SNARE complex synaptobrevin, SNAP-25 and <b>syntaxin</b> formation) to its open formation so that SNARE complex formation can be achieved, thereby allowing vesicle fusion and release to take place.|$|E
5000|$|SNARE {{proteins}} must assemble into trans-SNARE complexes so {{that they}} can provide the force that is necessary for vesicle fusion. The four α-helix domains (1 each from synaptobrevin and <b>syntaxin,</b> and 2 from SNAP-25) come together to form a coiled-coil motif. The rate-limiting step in the assembly process is the association of the <b>syntaxin</b> SNARE domain, since it is usually found in a [...] "closed" [...] state where it is incapable of interacting with other SNARE proteins. [...] When <b>syntaxin</b> is in an open state, trans-SNARE complex formation begins with the association of the four SNARE domains at their N-termini. The SNARE domains proceed in forming a coiled-coil motif {{in the direction of the}} C-termini of their respective domains. The SM protein Munc18 is thought to play a role in assembly of the SNARE complex, although the exact mechanism by which it acts is still under debate. It is known that the clasp of Munc18 locks <b>syntaxin</b> in a closed conformation by binding to its α-helical SNARE domains, which inhibits <b>syntaxin</b> from entering SNARE complexes (thereby inhibiting fusion). [...] The clasp is also capable, however, of binding the entire four-helix bundle of the trans-SNARE complex. One hypothesis suggests that, during SNARE-complex assembly, the Munc18 clasp releases closed <b>syntaxin,</b> remains associated with the N-terminal peptide of <b>syntaxin</b> (allowing association of the <b>syntaxin</b> SNARE domain with other SNARE proteins), and then reattaches to the newly formed four-helix SNARE complex. [...] This possible mechanism of dissociation and subsequent re-association with the SNARE domains could be calcium-dependent. This supports the idea that Munc18 plays a key regulatory role in vesicle fusion; under normal conditions the SNARE complex will be prevented from forming by Munc18, but when triggered the Munc18 will actually assist in SNARE-complex assembly and thereby act as a fusion catalyst.|$|E
50|$|<b>Syntaxin</b> 1 is a {{component}} of the 7S and 20S SNARE complexes which are involved in docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. This gene encodes a <b>syntaxin</b> 1 binding protein. In rat, a similar protein dissociates <b>syntaxin</b> 1 from the Munc18/n-Sec1/rbSec1 complex to form a 10S complex, an intermediate which can be converted to the 7S SNARE complex. Thus this protein is thought to be involved in neurotransmitter release by stimulating SNARE complex formation. Alternatively spliced variants have been identified, but their biological validity has not been determined.|$|E

40|$|Insulin stimulates glucose {{transport}} in fat {{and muscle}} cells by triggering exocytosis of the glucose transporter GLUT 4. To define the intracellular trafficking of GLUT 4, we have studied the internalization of an epitope-tagged version of GLUT 4 from the cell surface. GLUT 4 rapidly traversed the endosomal system {{en route to a}} perinuclear location. This perinuclear GLUT 4 compartment did not colocalize with endosomal markers (endosomal antigen 1 protein, transferrin) or TGN 38, but showed significant overlap with the TGN target (t) -soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) <b>Syntaxins</b> 6 and 16. These results were confirmed by vesicle immunoisolation. Consistent with a role for <b>Syntaxins</b> 6 and 16 in GLUT 4 trafficking we found that their expression was up-regulated significantly during adipocyte differentiation and insulin stimulated their movement to the cell surface. GLUT 4 trafficking between endosomes and trans-Golgi network was regulated via an acidic targeting motif in the carboxy terminus of GLUT 4, because a mutant lacking this motif was retained in endosomes. We conclude that GLUT 4 is rapidly transported from the cell surface to a subdomain of the trans-Golgi network that is enriched in the t-SNAREs <b>Syntaxins</b> 6 and 16 and that an acidic targeting motif in the C-terminal tail of GLUT 4 {{plays an important role in}} this process...|$|R

The plasma membrane <b>syntaxins</b> {{are required}} for viability in yeast, but in the vegetatively growing cell, the Sso proteins have seemingly reduntant functions.

The corresponding mutant allele of SSO 1, sso 1 - 1, is also temperature-sensitive and interacts synthetically with a disruption of MSO 1, which codes for a Sec 1 p interacting protein. Most notably, both SSO 1 and MSO 1, but not SSO 2, were shown to be necessary for spore formation during meiosis. Mapping of functions within the Sso 1 p protein showed that a region in the N-terminus of Sso 1 p is needed for efficient sporulation. Unexpectedly, the 3 ’-untranslated region of SSO 1 is absolutely required for sporulation and also sufficient to enable some spore formation when fused to the SSO 2 open reading frame. Inspection of the sso 1 /sso 1 phenotype during sporulation using transmission electron microscopy showed that prospore membrane assembly at the meiotic plaque of the spindle pole body is completely blocked in the mutant.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{continuous}} polarized vesicle secretion in pollen tubes {{is essential}} for tip growth but the location of endo- and exocytic sub-domains remains however controversial. In this report we aimed to show that Arabidopsis thaliana <b>syntaxins</b> {{are involved in this}} process and contribute to spatially define exocytosis and membrane recycling. Results Using GFP-fusion constructs, we imaged the distribution of pollen-specific (AtSYP 124) and non-pollen <b>syntaxins</b> (AtSYP 121 and AtSYP 122) in transiently transformed Nicotiana tabacum pollen tubes. All three proteins associate with the plasma membrane and with apical vesicles indicating a conserved action mechanism for all SYPs. However, the GFP tagged SYP 124 showed a specific distribution with a higher labelling at the plasma membrane flanks, 10 - 25 μm behind the apex. This distribution is affected by Ca 2 + fluxes as revealed by treatment with Gd 3 + (an inhibitor of extracellular Ca 2 + influx) and TMB- 8 (an inhibitor of intracellular Ca 2 + release). Both inhibitors decreased growth rate but the distribution of SYP 124 at the plasma membrane was more strongly affected by Gd 3 +. Competition with a related dominant negative mutant affected the specific distribution of SYP 124 but not tip growth. In contrast, co-expression of the phosphatidylinositol- 4 -monophosphate 5 -kinase 4 (PIP 5 K 4) or of the small GTPase Rab 11 perturbed polarity and the normal distribution of GFP-SYP but did not inhibit the accumulation in vesicles or at the plasma membrane. Conclusions The results presented suggest that in normal growing pollen tubes, a net exocytic flow occurs in the flanks of the tube apex mediated by SYP 124. The specific distribution of SYP 124 at the plasma membrane is affected by changes in Ca 2 + levels in agreement with the importance of this ion for exocytosis. Apical growth and the specific localization of SYP 124 were affected by regulators of membrane secretion (Ca 2 +, PIP 5 K 4 and Rab 11) but competition with a dominant negative mutant affected only SYP distribution. These data thus suggest that <b>syntaxins</b> alone do not provide the level of specificity that is required for apical growth and that additional signalling and functional mechanisms are required. </p...|$|R
