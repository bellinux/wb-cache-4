To deal with production cost optimization problem of postponement system based on various situation of CODP, a basic model of production cost and its M/M/ 1 extended model are proposed and compared so as to optimize the overall production cost of the postponement system. The production modes can be classified as MTS (make to stock), ATO (assemble to order), MTO (make to order) and ETO (engineering to order) according to the inventory location, and the postponed production system considered here includes manufacturing cost, semi-finished inventory cost and customer waiting cost caused by delaying delivery. By Matlab simulation, we can compute the optimal location of CODP in each production mode, which can provide some management insight for the manufacturer to decide the right production mode and utilize the resources efficiently...|$|E

40|$|The Ganges River dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica) (GRD) is {{classified}} {{as one of the}} most endangered of all cetaceans in the world and the second scarcest freshwater cetacean. The population is estimated to be less than 2, 000 individuals. In Nepal’s Narayani, Sapta Koshi, and Karnali river systems, survival of GRD continues to be threatened by various anthropogenic activities, such as dam construction and interactions with artisanal fisheries. A basic description of the geographic <b>scope,</b> <b>economics,</b> and types of gear used in these fisheries would help managers understand the fishery-dolphin interaction conflict and assist with developing potential solutions. The main goal was to provide new information on the artisanal fishing communities in Nepal. The specific objectives were to identify, compile, and investigate the demographics, economics, fishing characteristics, and perception of fishermen about GRD conservation in the Narayani, Sapta Koshi, and Karnali rivers so conservation managers can develop and implement a potential solution to the GRD-fishery interaction problem in Nepal. Based on 169 interviews, 79 % of Nepalese fishermen indicated fishing was their primary form of income. Fishermen reported fishing effort was greater in summer than winter; greatest in the afternoon (14 : 30 hrs ± 0 : 27) and during low water level conditions; and gear was set 4. 8 ± 0. 2 days/week. Fishermen reported using eight different types of monofilament nets (gillnets and cast nets). Sixty percent used gillnets less than 10 m long, and nearly 30 % preferred gillnets between 10 and 100 m long; a few used gillnets longer than 100 m. Most fishermen reported they believed education, awareness, and changing occupations were important for GRD conservation, but they indicated that alternative occupational options were currently limited in Nepal. Nepalese fishermen acknowledged that fisheries posed a risk to GRD, but they believed water pollution, and dam/irrigation developments were the greatest threats. Versión del edito...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} bone of contention concerning {{the extension of the}} neoclassical economic approach to traditional domains of other social sciences. The extension of the optimization hypothesis to the study of crime, status, and ideology - known as »economics imperialism> - definitely advances a universal social science. The paper tries to expose the crux of the debate surrounding such a broad <b>scope</b> of <b>economics.</b> The paper maintains that the central bone of contention concerns whether interest and moral commitment, understood as preferred interest, are commensurable as claimed by the optimization hypothesis of orthodox neoclassical economics. The paper argues, the commitment/interest commensurability issue {{is at the heart of}} the <b>scope</b> of <b>economics</b> debate. The paper tries to show that the universality of economics thesis is not about, first, whether moral utility is independent of pecuniary utility. Second, it is not about whether the taste for fine arts and the taste for American-style wrestling are commensurable. Third, the thesis is not about whether tastes are given or whether they are endogenously determined by sociocultural values. Fourth, the universality thesis is not about the tradeoff between self-interest and other-interest (i. e., altruism). For that matter, fifth, it is not about the determination of preferences per se. Rather, the paper maintains, the universality of economics thesis stands or falls depending on whether the taste for commitment (i. e., preferred moral principles and rules of justice) is smoothly substitutable with interest. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Frank Knight’s {{views on}} socialism and on {{capital and interest}} in light of some recent claims by Peter Boettke and Karen Vaughn. It makes several points that raise {{serious questions about the}} correctness of those claims. First, it argues that on the issue of socialism, the views of Knight and the Austrians were quite similar. Second, by more carefully examining Knight’s final contribution to the capital and interest controversy, it shows that the constructs he used – in particular the stationary economy and the Crusonia plant – were quite appropriate for the goal he aimed to achieve. The Austrians did not understand this goal and {{there is no indication that}} they examined Knight’s final statement. Although Boettke and Vaughn refer to the paper that contains his final statement, it is obvious that they also did not examine it carefully. Finally, this paper finds no justification for the claim that Knight differed from the Austrians on the definition or <b>scope</b> of <b>economics.</b> In the writings that Boettke and Vaughn chose to review, Knight was not interested in problems related to time preference, the period of production, or the time structure of production. But aside from that lack of interest in the same problems with respect to these particular writings, Knight’s ideas of the definition and <b>scope</b> of <b>economics</b> appear pretty much the same as those of the Austrians. In any case, Boettke and Vaughn do not provide sufficient evidence to support their claim that Knight’s economics was more narrow in scope...|$|R

40|$|This paper makes {{a number}} of {{fundamental}} proposals to reconsider economics by putting human wellbeing at the centre. It emerges from a pluralist perspective in economics and the ontological, conceptual, axiomatic and methodological propositions that are made lead {{to the construction of}} what we call an inclusive economy matrix (IEM). In particular, the paper draws on heterodox economics to redefine the <b>scope</b> of <b>economics,</b> economic agency, rational behaviour and put emphasis on wellbeing rather than welfare. Furthermore, from the acknowledgement of human wellbeing as a three-dimensional concept, the economic aggregation problem is reconsidered and the methodological implications discussed. The IEM is proposed as a comprehensive and robust analytical framework that gives space to bring social equity and sustainable development considerations forward as a priori concerns for economic development. As such, the IEM can serve as a point of departure for formulating new research questions, exploring new relationships between human wellbeing and economic development, and building economic models that bring us closer to people’s realities on the ground...|$|R

Furthermore, the coherent methodological framework for such structuring and further theoretical analysis is offered and described. Consequently, the principles under consideration are arranged in two groups. The first group includes the principles of realization of socially responsible economic behavior.

Additionally, the set of ‘stern punishment’ campaigns during the 2008 Beijing Olympic games, causing a huge increase in arrest rate and police expenditure, could distort the overall trend of crime and unemployment. Moreover, we find a significant positive correlation between GDP per capita level, rural-urban income inequality and floating population to crime. Therefore, we recommend that the Chinese government should create social safety net that targets specifically at rural migrant workers.
