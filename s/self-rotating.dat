40|$|In this paper, the {{translational}} {{motion and}} self-rotational {{behaviors of the}} Raji cells, a type of B-cell lymphoma cell, in an optically induced, non-rotational, electric field have been characterized by utilizing a digitally programmable and optically activated microfluidics chip {{with the assistance of}} an externally applied AC bias potential. The crossover frequency spectrum of the Raji cells was studied by observing the different linear translation responses of these cells to the positive and negative optically induced dielectrophoresis force generated by a projected light pattern. This digitally projected spot served as the virtual electrode to generate an axisymmetric and non-uniform electric field. Then, the membrane capacitance of the Raji cells could be directly measured. Furthermore, Raji cells under this condition also exhibited a self-rotation behavior. The repeatable and controlled self-rotation speeds of the Raji cells to the externally applied frequency and voltage were systematically investigated and characterized via computer-vision algorithms. The self-rotational speed of the Raji cells reached a maximum value at 60 ?kHz and demonstrated a quadratic relationship with respect to the applied voltage. Furthermore, optically projected patterns of four orthogonal electrodes were also employed as the virtual electrodes to manipulate the Raji cells. These results demonstrated that Raji cells located {{at the center of the}} four electrode pattern could not be <b>self-rotated.</b> Instead any Raji cells that deviated from this center area would also <b>self-rotate.</b> Most importantly, the Raji cells did not exhibit the self-rotational behavior after translating and rotating with respect to the center of any two adjacent electrodes. The spatial distributions of the electric field generated by the optically projected spot and the pattern of four electrodes were also modeled using a finite element numerical simulation. These simulations validated that the electric field distributions were non-uniform and non-rotational. Hence, the non-uniform electric field must play a key role in the self-rotation of the Raji cells. As a whole, this study elucidates an optoelectric-coupled microfluidics-based mechanism for cellular translation and self-rotation that can be used to extract the dielectric properties of the cells without using conventional metal-based microelectrodes.

To identify {{the nature of the}} external resources, Haier classified them respectively into industrial (suppliers, partner enterprises, testing labs, etc.) and non-industrial (individuals, universities, research institutes, etc.) entities; hence the corresponding external resources with appropriate expertise could be integrated in order to match Haier’s requirements for technological innovation. Moreover, Haier adopted the “global talents” mechanism to ensure that qualified resources, without boundary limits, could be absorbed into the innovation process under a controllable system, namely the “participation constraint”, while unqualified resources were excluded from the innovation activities by means of “dynamic optimization”. According to the concrete requirements of technology innovation, some of the selected external resources (such as the strategic suppliers) could be stimulated by an “incentive compatibility” to yield extraordinary performances. In this regard, the qualified resources could effectively contribute to Haier’s basic research innovation, in combination with its product development innovation.|$|E
40|$|Microelectromechanical systems, {{which can}} be moved or rotated with {{nanometre}} precision, already find applications in such fields as radio-frequency electronics, micro-attenuators, sensors and many others. Especially interesting are those which allow fine control over the motion on the atomic scale because of self-alignment mechanisms and forces acting on the atomic level. Such machines can produce well-controlled movements {{as a reaction to}} small changes of the external parameters. Here we demonstrate that, for the system of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride, the interplay between the van der Waals and elastic energies results in graphene mechanically <b>self-rotating</b> towards the hexagonal boron nitride crystallographic directions. Such rotation is macroscopic (for graphene flakes of tens of micrometres the tangential movement can be on hundreds of nanometres) and can be used for reproducible manufacturing of aligned van der Waals heterostructures.
