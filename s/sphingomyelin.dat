5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk <b>sphingomyelin</b> could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by <b>sphingomyelin</b> supplementation. Milk <b>sphingomyelin</b> and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E

This optimum coincides with the liquid-condensed/liquid-expanded phase transition for each of the <b>sphingomyelins.</b> At initial surface pressures (pi 0) below the optimum, reaction rates are controlled mainly by surface density of the substrate; above the optimal pi 0, reaction rates decrease with increasing surface pressure.

We included 800 French volunteers aged between 18 and 86, equally distributed according to sex, free of any medication and considered healthy on the basis of their medical history, clinical examination and standard laboratory tests. We quantified 185 plasma metabolites, including amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, <b>sphingomyelins</b> and hexose, using tandem mass spectrometry with the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p 180 kit. Principal components analysis was applied to identify the main factors responsible for metabolome variability and orthogonal projection to latent structures analysis was employed to confirm the observed patterns and identify pattern-related metabolites. We established a plasma metabolite reference dataset for 144 / 185 metabolites. Total blood cholesterol, gender and age were identified as the principal factors explaining metabolome variability. High total blood cholesterol levels were associated with higher plasma <b>sphingomyelins</b> and phosphatidylcholines concentrations. Compared to women, men had higher concentrations of creatinine, branched-chain amino acids and lysophosphatidylcholines, and lower concentrations of <b>sphingomyelins</b> and phosphatidylcholines.

5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as <b>sphingomyelin</b> and gangliosides {{are highly}} {{concentrated in the}} brain and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, <b>sphingomyelin</b> is a key component of the myelin sheath, which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by oligodendrocyte glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and {{the first two years of}} life, but which can also continue up to 5–10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated within the brain’s gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and synapse formation. Brain ganglioside accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early years of life, coinciding with the most active period of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis.|$|E

5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as <b>sphingomyelin,</b> appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we used cholestatrienol (CTL) as a {{fluorescent}} reporter molecule to study sterol-rich Lo domains in complex lipid bilayers. CTL is {{a fluorescent}} cholesterol analog that mimics {{the behavior of}} cholesterol well. The ability of 12 SLPC to quench the fluorescence of cholestatrienol gives {{a measure of the}} amount of sterol included in Lo domains in mixed lipid membranes. The stability of sterol-rich domains formed in complex lipid mixtures containing saturated <b>sphingomyelins,</b> phosphatidylcholines, or galactosylceramide as potential domain-forming lipids were studied. The amount of sterol associated with sterol-rich domains seemed to always increase with increasing temperature. The quenching efficiency was highly dependent on the domain-forming lipid present in complex lipid mixtures. <b>Sphingomyelins</b> formed stable sterol-enriched domains and were able to shield CTL from quenching better than the other lipids included in this study. The saturated phosphatidylcholines also formed sterol-rich domains, but the quenching efficiency in membranes with these was higher than with <b>sphingomyelins</b> and the domains melted at lower temperatures. PGalCer was not able to form sterol-enriched domains. However, we found that PGalCer stabilized sterol-rich domains formed in PSM-containing bilayers. Using a fluorescent ceramide analog, we also demonstrated that N-palmitoyl-ceramide displaced the sterol from sphingolipid-rich domains in mixed bilayer membranes...|$|R
5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as <b>sphingomyelin</b> and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E
5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions {{of the inner}} and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine, <b>sphingomyelin</b> and a variety of glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E
5|$|The lipid {{component}} of MFGM {{is rich in}} phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being <b>sphingomyelin</b> (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide side chain. Each of these lipid classes is known to play functional roles within the body, including the support of gut, immune, and central nervous system development.|$|E

However, a comprehensive lipidomic analysis of the major lipid classes within atherosclerotic lesions has not been reported. The objective {{of this study was}} to produce a detailed framework of the lipids that comprise the atherosclerotic lesion of a widely used pre-clinical model of plaque progression. Male New Zealand White rabbits were administered regular chow supplemented with 0. 5 % cholesterol (HC) for 12 weeks to induce hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Our lipidomic analyses of plaques isolated from rabbits fed the HC diet, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry, detected most of the major lipid classes including: Cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, <b>sphingomyelins,</b> diacylglycerols, fatty acids, phosphatidylserines, lysophosphatidylcholines, ceramides, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidylethanolamines. Given that cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines comprise greater than 75 % of total plasma lipids, we directed particular attention towards the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the fatty acid composition of these lipids. We additionally found that <b>sphingomyelins</b> were relatively abundant lipid class within lesions, and compared the abundance of <b>sphingomyelins</b> to their precursor phosphatidylcholines.

Similar chain length-dependent recycling was observed for unlabeled <b>sphingomyelins</b> (SMs). The findings 1) establish acyl chain length as an important determinant in the endocytic trafficking of SMs, 2) implicate ESCRT complex proteins and NPC 1 in the endocytic recycling of ordered domain lipids to the plasma membrane, and 3) introduce long-chain PyrSM as the first fluorescent lipid tracing this pathway...|$|R

While most organisms fail upon oxygen deprivation (anoxia), the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is able to face this stress for 48 hours.

It suggests that the accumulation of some species of sphingolipid (glucosylceramides and <b>sphingomyelins)</b> may have a toxic effect that could weaken the nematode in anoxic condition. It reveals that the tetratricopeptide protein (TTC- 1) has an important role in maintaining the sphingolipid homeostasis and is essential to counteract the anoxia hypersensitivity found in a mutant that is depleted for its ceramide synthase (HYL- 2). The depletion of TTC- 1 restores a normal resistance to 48 hours of anoxia in HYL- 2 mutants by avoiding the accumulation of C 24 /C 25 glucosylceramides and C 24 /C 25 /C 26 <b>sphingomyelins...</b>|$|R
25|$|In contrast, {{the outer}} part of the {{membranes}} of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges {{since most of the}} lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes. Thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine and <b>sphingomyelin,</b> even though {{a small portion of the}} membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged gangliosides. Therefore, the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic face of amphipathic antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids on the cell surface of mammalian cell membranes plays a major role in the formation of peptide-cell binding. However, the hydrophobic interaction is relatively weak when compared to the electrostatic interaction, thus, the antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with bacterial membranes.|$|E
25|$|Choline can {{be found}} in milk as free choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, <b>sphingomyelin,</b> and phosphatidylcholine, and choline levels within breast milk are {{correlated}} with choline levels in maternal blood.

Choline may enter the milk supply either directly from the maternal blood supply, or choline-containing nutrients may be produced within the mammary epithelium. Choline reaches the milk through a transporter specific for choline from the maternal blood supply (against a concentration gradient) into the mammary epithelial cells. At high concentrations (greater than that typically seen in humans), choline can diffuse across the cell membrane into the mammary epithelium cell. At more normal concentrations, it passes via what is believed to be a calcium/sodium-dependent, phosphorylation-related, active transporter into the cell.|$|E
25|$|Human ABC {{transporters}} {{are involved}} in several diseases that arise from polymorphisms in ABC genes and rarely due to complete loss of function of single ABC proteins. Such diseases include Mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, Tangier disease, immune deficiencies, progressive familial intraheptic cholestasis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia, X-linked sideroblastosis and anemia, age-related macular degeneration, familial hypoapoproteinemia, Retinitis pigmentosum, cone rod dystrophy, and others. The human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family is responsible for multiple drug resistance (MDR) against a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. ABCB1 or MDR1 P-glycoprotein is also involved in other biological processes for which lipid transport is the main function. It is found to mediate the secretion of the steroid aldosterone by the adrenals, and its inhibition blocked the migration of dendritic immune cells, possibly related to the outward transport of the lipid platelet activating factor (PAF). It has also been reported that ABCB1 mediates transport of cortisol and dexamethasone, but not of progesterone in ABCB1 transfected cells. MDR1 can also transport cholesterol, short-chain and long-chain analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), <b>sphingomyelin</b> (SM), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Multispecific transport of diverse endogenous lipids through the MDR1 transporter can possibly affect the transbilayer distribution of lipids, in particular of species normally predominant on the inner plasma membrane leaflet such as PS and PE.|$|E
40|$|Ceramides are {{the major}} {{component}} of the stratum corneum, accounting for 30 %- 40 % of stratum corneum lipids by weight, and are composed of at least seven molecular groups (designated ceramides 1 – 7). Stratum corneum ceramides, together with cholesterol and fatty acids, form extracellular lamellae {{that are responsible for}} the epidermal permeability barrier. Previous studies indicated that β-glucocerebrosidase- and sphingomyelinase-dependent ceramide production from glucosylceramides and <b>sphingomyelins,</b> respectively, is important for epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis. A recent study indicated that <b>sphingomyelins</b> are precursors of two stratum corneum ceramide molecular groups (ceramides 2 and 5). In this study, we have examined the role of glucosylceramides in the generation of each of the seven stratum corneum ceramide molecular groups. First, the structures of various glucosylceramide species in human epidermis were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results indicate that total epidermal glucosylceramides are composed of six distinct molecular groups, glucosylceramides 1 – 6. Glucosylceramide 1 contains sphingenine and nonhydroxy fatty acids, glucosylceramide 2, phytosphingosine and nonhydroxy fatty acids, glucosylceramide 3, phytosphingosine with one double bond and nonhydroxy fatty acids, glucosylceramide 4, sphingenine and α-hydroxy fatty acids, glucosylceramide 5, phytosphingosine and α-hydroxy fatty acids, and glucosylceramide 6, phytosphingosine with one double bond and α-hydroxy fatty acids. The nonhydroxy fatty acids typically have 16 – 24 -carbon-length chains, whereas α-hydroxy fatty acids are limited to 24 -, 25 -, and 26 -carbon chains. The sphingosine bases are C 18 or C 20 chains. Next, acylglucosylceramides and glucosylceramides were treated with β-glucocerebrosidase and the ceramides released were compared with stratum corneum ceramides. Ceramide moieties of acylglucosylceramides and glucosylceramides 1, 2, 4 – 6 correspond to stratum corneum ceramides 1 – 7. These results, together with those of our previous reports characterizing epidermal <b>sphingomyelins,</b> indicate that all ceramide species, including ω-hydroxy fatty-acid-containing ceramides, are derived from glucosylceramides, and fractions of ceramides 2 and 5 are from <b>sphingomyelins.</b> Furthermore, structural analysis of glucosylceramides revealed that human epidermal glycosphingolipids display a unique lipid profile that is rich in very long chain hydroxylated (α- and ω-hydroxy) fatty acids and phytosphingosine...|$|R
