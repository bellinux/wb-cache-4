40|$|The {{energy crisis}} {{and a greater}} {{awareness}} among the general public regarding the issue of climate change have, between them, led to a notable increase in the interest shown by governments {{in relation to the}} problem of environmental sustainability. An example has been the initiative taken by the President of France to set up a commission, known as the Sarkozy Commission, named after the President, bringing together renowned economists to study and propose forms of economic performance measurement related to social progress. This article aims to propose a methodology to establish a quantitative definition of sustainability structured on the principles of minimum and maximum entropy production, and, based on this, outline a way of organizing the many sources of, and kinds of energy, we have available to us in order of the intensity of their respective environmental impacts. Based on this, we could produce an Environmental Sustainability Index, linked to existing statistical indicators of human development, and thereby arrive at a Sustainable Human Development Index, which would be positively or negatively influenced by parameters linked to environmental sustainability and quality of life. In order to ensure that this index can produce practical results, the WTO (World Trade Organization) would have to establish a <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>increments,</b> to be applied to export tariffs on products originating in countries with different indexes.

40|$|The {{state of}} a {{stochastic}} process evolving over a time t is typically assumed {{to lie on}} a normal distribution whose width scales like t^ 1 / 2. However, processes where the probability distribution is not normal and the scaling exponent differs from 1 / 2 are known. The search for possible origins <b>of</b> such "anomalous" <b>scaling</b> and approaches to quantify them are the motivations for the work reported here. In processes with stationary increments, where the stochastic process is time-independent, auto-correlations between increments and infinite variance <b>of</b> <b>increments</b> can cause anomalous scaling. These sources have {{been referred to as}} the Joseph effect the Noah effect, respectively. If the increments are non-stationary, then <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>increments</b> with t can also lead to anomalous scaling, a mechanism we refer to as the Moses effect. Scaling exponents quantifying the three effects are defined and related to the Hurst exponent that characterizes the overall <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> the stochastic process. Methods of time series analysis that enable accurate independent measurement of each exponent are presented. Simple stochastic processes are used to illustrate each effect. Intraday Financial time series data is analyzed, revealing that its anomalous scaling is due only to the Moses effect. In the context of financial market data, we reiterate that the Joseph exponent, not the Hurst exponent, is the appropriate measure to test the efficient market hypothesis.

As a benchmark, we use minimum variance filters and smoothers which are non-linear generalisations of Kalman filters and smoothers. We show that use of the best linear approximation leads to a filter whose prior has first moment unapproximated compared with the benchmark, and second moment whose departure from the benchmark is bounded independently of the derivative of the map, with similar results for smoothers. This is particularly advantageous where the maps in question are strongly non-linear on the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> the <b>increments.</b> Furthermore, the best linear approximation works equally well for maps which are non-differentiable.

40|$|If the excised, {{parturient}} rabbit uterus is repeatedly {{treated with}} a Krebs solution free from Ca, its tension in a tetanus drops gradually, and in 15 to 30 minutes becomes zero. We call such a uterus "Ca-deficient. " The uterus in this condition has a high threshold, it is non-propagating, "inexcitable," fails to respond to oxytocics in a characteristic fashion, but retains maximum contractility. As Ca is gradually restored to the Krebs, these lost qualities return in a graded fashion and tension of the tetanized uterus becomes a log function of the [Ca]. If the [Ca] is kept low, i. e. 1 / 10 to 1 / 20 of the normal, tetanic tension is small but steady, and the preparation offers a full <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> tension <b>increment</b> for the measurement of oxytocic potency. Keeping the stimulus and the [Ca] constant, excitability (measured by tension increment) is a log function of the drug concentration. The recovery of excitability by restoring Ca to the Ca-deficient uterus is strongly temperature-dependent. The Ca-deficient uterus is a useful preparation {{for the study of}} the mechanism of regulation. When its excitability is partially recovered by Ca, the electrically stimulated uterus becomes an excellent tool for the quantitative measurement of oxytocic potency...|$|R

40|$|We analyze scale-dependent {{statistics}} of correlated random hydrogeological variables and their extremes using neutron porosity data from six deep boreholes, in three diverse depositional environments, as example. We show that key statistics <b>of</b> porosity <b>increments</b> behave and scale in manners {{typical of many}} earth and environmental (as well as other) variables. These scaling behaviors include a tendency <b>of</b> <b>increments</b> to have symmetric, non-Gaussian frequency distributions characterized by heavy tails that decay with separation distance or lag; power-law <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> sample structure functions (statistical moments <b>of</b> absolute <b>increments)</b> in midranges <b>of</b> lags; linear relationships between log structure functions of successive orders at all lags, known as extended self-similarity or ESS; and nonlinear <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> structure function power-law exponents with function order, a phenomenon commonly attributed in the literature to multifractals. Elsewhere we proposed, explored and demonstrated a new method of geostatistical inference that captures all of these phenomena within a unified theoretical framework. The framework views data as samples from random fields constituting <b>scale</b> mixtures <b>of</b> truncated (monofractal) fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) or fractional Gaussian noise (tfGn). Important questions not addressed in previous studies concern the distribution and statistical <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> extreme incremental values.

40|$|Population {{growth and}} {{economic}} development are the two major driving forces of water demand. In developing countries, the rapid population growth together with an eagerness to develop the national economy, typically through industrialization, has generated a strong demand for additional water. This situation has been the basis underlying many projections of a substantial expansion of industrial water use. While the increase in industrial water use is a trend evident in many countries, it is also observed that industrial water use in some developed countries has experienced an increase, level-off and then decrease with the economic development and income rises. This inverted U-shaped trend resembles the well-known Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). Prior to this study, however, {{there has been no}} systematic investigation into changes in industrial water use associated with the process of industrialization. This paper investigates the existence of the Kuznets curve in industrial water use. It focuses on the following questions: does an inverted U-shaped relationship generally exist between industrial water use and the level of income? If so, where is the turning point of industrial water use? And, what are the preconditions for the decline? Based on the results from the analysis of the OECD countries, preliminary discussion is made for developing countries on the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> potential <b>increment</b> in industrial water use before reaching the turning point. A standard EKC model is expressed as a quadratic function of the level of income (Eq. 1).
