40|$|Abstract – Energy {{conservation}} {{is a major}} issue in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In order to obtain energy conservation, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) has been discussed as one of the potential solution. Many researchers proposed TDMA as a Media Access Control (MAC) in order to conserve energy. The main advantage to using TDMA MAC is avoidance of collision of data packets during transmission and the added facility to use <b>sleep</b> <b>modes.</b> The use of <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> <b>enables</b> switching off the radio antennas thus reducing the energy conservation. Prior to usage of TDMA MAC, scheduling of the sensor nodes, i. e. providing time slot to the sensor nodes must be performed. Efficient scheduling of transmitting time slot in a TDMA is important for low power WSN. In this work, two decentralized scheduling algorithms Distributed Randomized TDMA (DRAND) and Deterministic Distributed TDMA (DDTDMA) are compared. In these algorithms, flowing the messages among the sensor nodes the scheduling is performed by assigning transmitting time slot to each node. So, their efficiency is analyzed based on schedule length, message complexity and convergence time to obtain scheduling. It was found that DDTDMA is an efficient algorithm than DRAND in terms of schedule length, message complexity and convergence time...|$|R

40|$|The Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) is a {{promising}} alterna-tive to DDRx memory {{due to its}} potential to achieve signifi-cantly higher bandwidth. However, the high static power of an HMC device compromises power efficiency when the device is lightly utilized.

We introduce a new technique that alleviates the long wake-up penalty of an HMC by employing erasure codes.
