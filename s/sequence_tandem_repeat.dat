Results: We present TRAL, a tandem repeat annotation library that allows running and parsing of various detection outputs, clustering of redundant or overlapping annotations, several statistical frameworks for filtering false positive annotations, and importantly a tandem repeat annotation and refinement module based on circular profile hidden Markov models (cpHMMs). Using TRAL, we evaluated {{the performance of}} a multi-step tandem repeat annotation workflow on 547 [*] 085 sequences in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

40|$|Abstract Background Unique {{structural}} {{characteristics of}} centromere chromatin {{enable it to}} support assembly of the kinetochore and its associated tensions. The histone H 3 variant CENH 3 (centromeric histone H 3) is viewed as the key element of centromere chromatin and its interaction with centromere DNA is epigenetic in that its localization to centromeres is not sequence-dependent. Results In order to investigate what influence the DNA sequence exerts on CENH 3 chromatin structure, we examined CENH 3 nucleosome footprints on maize centromere DNA. We found a predominant average nucleosome spacing pattern of roughly 190 -bp intervals, which was also the dominant arrangement for nucleosomes genome-wide. For CENH 3 -containing nucleosomes, distinct modes of nucleosome positioning were evident within that general spacing constraint. Over arrays of the major ~ 156 -bp centromeric satellite <b>sequence</b> (<b>tandem</b> <b>repeat)</b> CentC, nucleosomes were not positioned in register with CentC monomers but in conformity with a striking ~ 10 -bp periodicity of AA/TT dimers within the sequence. In contrast, nucleosomes on a class of centromeric retrotransposon (CRM 2) lacked a detectable AA/TT periodicity but exhibited tightly phased positioning. Conclusions These data support a model in which general chromatin factors independent of both DNA sequence and CENH 3 enforce roughly uniform centromeric nucleosome spacing while allowing flexibility in the mode in which nucleosomes are positioned. In the case of tandem repeat DNA, the natural bending effects related to AA/TT periodicity produce an energetically-favourable arrangement consistent with conformationally rigid nucleosomes and stable chromatin at centromeres. </p...|$|E
40|$|More than 20 human genetic {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} inheriting an unstable expanded DNA simple <b>sequence</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat,</b> for example, CTG (cytosine–thymine–guanine) repeats in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM 1) and CAG (cytosine–adenine–guanine) repeats in Huntington disease (HD). These sequences mutate by changing the number of repeats not just between generations, but also during the lifetime of affected individuals. Levels of somatic instability contribute to disease onset and progression but as changes are tissue-specific, age- and repeat length-dependent, interpretation {{of the level of}} somatic instability in an individual is confounded by these considerations. Mathematical models, fitted to CTG repeat length distributions derived from blood DNA, from a large cohort of DM 1 -affected or at risk individuals, have recently been used to quantify inherited repeat lengths and mutation rates. Taking into account age, the estimated mutation rates are lower than predicted among individuals with small alleles (inherited repeat lengths less than 100 CTGs), suggesting that these rates may be suppressed {{at the lower end of}} the disease-causing range. In this study, we propose that a length-specific effect operates within this range and tested this hypothesis using a model comparison approach. To calibrate the extended model, we used data derived from blood DNA from DM 1 individuals and, for the first time, buccal DNA from HD individuals. In a novel application of this extended model, we identified individuals whose effective repeat length, with regards to somatic instability, is less than their actual repeat length. A plausible explanation for this distinction is that the expanded repeat tract is compromised by interruptions or other unusual features. We quantified effective length for a large cohort of DM 1 individuals and showed that effective length better predicts age of onset than inherited repeat length, thus improving the genotype–phenotype correlation. Under the extended model, we removed some of the bias in mutation rates making them less length-dependent. Consequently, rates adjusted in this way will be better suited as quantitative traits to investigate cis- or trans-acting modifiers of somatic mosaicism, disease onset and progression...|$|E

40|$|Several human genetic diseases, {{including}} {{myotonic dystrophy}} type 1 (DM 1) and Huntington disease (HD), {{are associated with}} inheriting an abnormally large unstable DNA simple <b>sequence</b> <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat.</b> These sequences mutate, by changing the number of repeats, many times during the lifetime of those affected, with a bias towards expansion. High repeat numbers are associated with early onset and disease severity. The presence of somatic instability compromises attempts to measure intergenerational repeat dynamics and infer genotype-phenotype relationships. Modelling the progression of repeat length throughout the lifetime of individuals has potential for improving prognostic information {{as well as providing}} {{a deeper understanding of the}} underlying biological process. Dr Fernando Morales, Dr Anneli Cooper and others from the Monckton lab have characterised more than 25, 000 de novo somatic mutations from a large cohort of DM 1 patients using single-molecule polymerase chain reaction (SM-PCR). This rich dataset enables us to fully quantify levels of somatic instability across a representative DM 1 population for the first time. We establish the relationship between inherited or progenitor allele length, age at sampling and levels of somatic instability using linear regression analysis. We show that the estimated progenitor allele length genotype is significantly better than modal repeat length (the current clinical standard) at predicting age of onset and this novel genotype is the major modifier of the age of onset phenotype. Further we show that somatic variation (adjusted for estimated progenitor allele length and age at sampling) is also a modifier of the age of onset phenotype. Several families form the large cohort, and we find that the level of somatic instability is highly heritable, implying a role for individual-specific trans-acting genetic modifiers. We develop new mathematical models, the main focus of this thesis, by modifying a previously proposed stochastic birth process to incorporate possible contraction. A Bayesian likelihood approach is used as the basis for inference and parameter estimation. We use model comparison analysis to reveal, for the first time, that the expansion bias observed in the distributions of repeat lengths is likely to be the cumulative effect of many expansion and contraction events. We predict that mutation events can occur as frequently as every other day, which matches the timing of regular cell activities such as DNA repair and transcription, but not DNA replication. Mutation rates estimated under the models described above are lower than expected among individuals with inherited repeat lengths less than 100 CTGs, suggesting that these rates may be suppressed at the lower end of the disease causing range. We propose that a length-specific effect may be operating within this range and test this hypothesis by introducing such an effect into the model. To calibrate this extended model, we use blood DNA data from DM 1 individuals with small alleles (inherited repeat lengths less than 100 CTGs) and buccal DNA from HD individuals who almost always have inherited repeat lengths less than 100 CAGs. These datasets comprise single DNA molecules sized using SM-PCR. We find statistical support for a general length-specific effect which suppresses mutational rates among the smaller alleles and gives rise to a distinctive pattern in the repeat length distributions. In a novel application of this new model, fitted to a large cohort of DM 1 individuals, we also show that this distinctive pattern may help identify individuals whose effective repeat length, with regards to somatic instability, is less than their actual repeat length. A plausible explanation for this distinction is that the expanded repeat tract is compromised by interruptions or other unusual features. For these individuals, we estimate the effective repeat length of their expanded repeat tracts and contribute to the on-going discussion about the effect of interruptions on phenotype. The interpretation of the levels of somatic instability in many of the affected tissues in the triplet repeat diseases is hindered by complex cell compositions. We extend our model to two cell populations whose repeat lengths have different rates of mutation (fast and slow). Swami et al. have recently characterised repeat length distributions in end stage HD brain. Applying our model, we infer for each frontal cortex HD dataset the likely relative weight of these cell populations and their corresponding contribution towards somatic variation. By comparison with data from laser captured single cells we conclude that the neuronal repeat lengths most likely mutate at a higher rate than glial repeat lengths, explaining the characteristic skewed distributions observed in mixed cell tissue from the brain. We confirm that individual-specific mutation rates in neurons are, in addition to the inherited repeat length, a modifier of age of onset. Our results support a model of disease progression where individuals with the same inherited repeat length may reach age of onset, as much as 30 years earlier, because of greater somatic expansions underpinned by higher mutational rates. Therapies aimed at reducing somatic expansions would therefore have considerable benefits with regard to extending the age of onset. Currently clinical diagnosis of DM 1 is based on a measure of repeat length from blood cells, but variance in modal length only accounts for between 20 - 40...|$|E

Researchers in bio-informatics in the last 20 years have proposed many formal definitions for the rather loose notion of a <b>Tandem</b> <b>Repeat</b> and have proposed exact or heuristic algorithms to detect TRs in genomic sequences. The general trend has been to use formal (implicit or explicit) definitions of TR for which verification of the solution was easy (with complexity linear, or polynomial in the TR 2 ̆ 7 s length and substitution+indel rates) while the effort was directed towards identifying efficiently the sub-strings of the input to submit to the verification phase (either implicitly or explicitly).

These results are discussed in relation with the formation of macronuclear DNA...|$|R
40|$|Simulations of {{originally}} existent biological sequences {{are helpful}} for computational analysis and manipulations, rather than wet lab experiments, considerably reducing {{the cost and}} time associated with traditional wet lab experiments. The basic idea is to compare {{the results of a}} run on real data to many runs on random data. This paper discusses the need for random biological sequence analysis and an alternative for generating biological random sequences. A novel random generation algorithm which uses the statistical distributions to generate numbers and to map these numbers into biological random sequences is conceived. Algorithm for generating random sequences with normal and binomial distributions is implemented; random <b>sequences</b> with <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats,</b> GC base control and nucleotide position control are also incorporated by modifying this algorithm. The newly proposed algorithm and all the mentioned features are also implemented as a platform independent tool named Biolets which can be freely downloaded from the web sit...|$|R
40|$|Apart from {{contributing}} to Computer Science, this research {{also contributes to}} Bioinformatics, {{a subset of the}} subject discipline Computational Biology. The main focus of this dissertation is the development of a data-analytical and theoretical algorithm to contribute to the analysis of DNA, and in particular, to detect microsatellites. Microsatellites, considered {{in the context of this}} dissertation, refer to consecutive patterns contained by genomic <b>sequences.</b> A perfect <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat</b> is defined as a string of nucleotides which is repeated at least twice in a <b>sequence.</b> An approximate <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat</b> is a string of nucleotides repeated consecutively at least twice, with small differences between the instances. The research presented in this dissertation was inspired by molecular biologists who were discovered to be visually scanning genetic sequences in search of short approximate <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> or so called microsatellites. The aim of this dissertation is to present three algorithms that search for short approximate <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats.</b> The algorithms comprise the implementation of finite automata. Thus the hypothesis posed is as follows: Finite automata can detect microsatellites effectively in DNA. "Effectively" includes the ability to fine-tune the detection process so that redundant data is avoided, and relevant data is not missed during search. In order to verify whether the hypothesis holds, three theoretical related algorithms have been proposed based on theorems from finite automaton theory. They are generically referred to as the FireìSat algorithms. These algorithms have been implemented, and the performance of FireìSat 2 has been investigated and compared to other software packages. From the results obtained, it is clear that the performance of these algorithms differ in terms of attributes such as speed, memory consumption and extensibility. In respect of speed performance, FireìSat outperformed rival software packages. It will be seen that the FireìSat algorithms have several parameters that can be used to tune their search. It should be emphasized that these parameters have been devised in consultation with the intended user community, in order to enhance the usability of the software. It was found that the parameters of FireìSat can be set to detect more <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> than rival software packages, but also tuned to limit the number of detected <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats.</b> CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|Abstract Background Centromeres are {{essential}} for chromosome segregation, yet their DNA sequences evolve rapidly. In most animals and plants that have been studied, centromeres contain megabase-scale arrays of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats.</b> Despite their importance, very {{little is known about}} the degree to which centromere <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> share common properties between different species across different phyla. We used bioinformatic methods to identify high-copy <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> from 282 species using publicly available genomic sequence and our own data. Results Our methods are compatible with all current sequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to find <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat</b> monomers up to 1, 419 bp. We assumed that the most abundant <b>tandem</b> <b>repeat</b> is the centromere DNA, which was true for most species whose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a general property of genomes. High-copy centromere <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> were found in almost all animal and plant genomes, but repeat monomers were highly variable in sequence composition and length. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence conservation beyond approximately 50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an overall lack of <b>sequence</b> conservation, centromere <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> from diverse species showed similar modes of evolution. Conclusions While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically determined, our results indicate that <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> are highly prevalent at centromeres of both animal and plant genomes. This suggests a functional role for such repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Centromeres are an {{essential}} structural domain of chromosomes and play {{an essential}} role accu-rate chromosomal segregation during mitosis and meiosis. In humans, centromeric regions of all chromosomes contain a huge repetitive sequence, known as alphoid DNA that constitutes as much as 3 – 4 % of chromosomal DNA (Mitchell et al., 1985; Alexandrov et al., 2001). Alphoid <b>sequences</b> consist of <b>tandem</b> <b>repeats</b> of an AT-rich 171 -bp alphoid monomer unit, organized into higher order repeats (HORs). These monomers appear to be conserved among all human chromosomes, but the nucleotide sequence {{and the organization of}} the monomeric units are known to vary from one chromosome to another, showing substantial chromosome-specifi...|$|R
