40|$|AbstractElectricity {{consumption}} in urban railway <b>stations</b> <b>accounts</b> for almost {{one third of}} the total energy consumption of a subway network of a city like Paris. The overall systemʼs efficiency can be optimized by taking advantage of available sources of energy such as regenerative braking of trains or local renewable energy resources. This can be achieved by handling the intermittent nature of the various sources and consumption points and by redesigning the station energy grid in a global approach. Microgrids have been an actively researched subject since a few years with the growing interests in smart electricity networks as a mean to decentralize the global power supply facilities. We present hereby a methodology for the optimal management of a microgrid connecting regenerative braking energy sources, eventual distributed energy resources, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) systems, specific electricity consumptions and electricity storage systems (ESS) for energy management in subway stations. The overall energy cost is minimized adjusting in real-time electricity demand and availability using demand-response strategies while ensuring an optimal thermal comfort and a safe indoor air quality environment...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 31) With {{the enormous}} growth in telecommunication industry, energy efficiency {{has become a}} critical issue. Base <b>stations</b> <b>account</b> for {{a significant portion of}} the energy budget of a cellular network. Traditional energy saving techniques switch some base stations off completely during light loads to save energy. This creates problems for the backhaul network and also for quickly returning to full capacity when demand increases. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called cell zooming to reduce energy consumption at base stations. With cell zooming, base stations dynamically adjust their coverage radius and hence their transmit powers based on user locations. The transmit power is set to the minimum required level depending on user locations and signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) required. Base stations are never completely switched off. Simulations show that the proposed cell zooming algorithm reduces the energy consumption of base stations by up to 40 % without compromising the quality of service (QoS) for users compared to traditional static-coverage-area base stations...|$|R
