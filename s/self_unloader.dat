5000|$|The yard {{closed on}} 31 December 1976 after the Navy {{contracts}} ran out. Along with its dwindling navy contracts {{in its final}} handful of seasons, the yard was contracted for three larger Great Lakes Freighter projects. The first project was construction of the 68'x 104'7"x 46'6" [...] bow section to the 1000' long integrated tug and barge Presque Isle. The bow was launched July 27, 1972 and was towed to Erie by the tugs Maryland and Laurence C. Turner arriving October 6, 1972. There it was combined with {{the balance of the}} barge which was under construction at Erie, PA. The combined tug and barge unit would be the second 1000' vessel trading on the lakes. The second was the conversion of 690' S/S Herbert C. Jackson from a conventional style Great Lakes freighter to a <b>self</b> <b>unloader.</b> The final major project was the conversion of the 620' lake freighter Richard J. Reiss from steam to diesel power. All three vessels are still activity trading on the Great Lakes, the latter sailing now as the M/V Manistee. The site of the shipyard later became the location for H. H. Hirschfield & Sons scrap yard. Hirschfield was recently bought out by OmniSource, Inc., another scrap company.|$|E
40|$|The "Lake Manitoba" {{was built}} by Davie Shipbuilding, Ltd. in Lauzon, P. Q. in 1968. Until 1986, she was owned by Nipigon Transport, Ltd, of Montreal. That year she was {{purchased}} by Algoma Central Marine of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The following year, she was renamed the "Algomarne". In 1989, she was converted to a <b>self</b> <b>unloader...</b>|$|E
40|$|The "Robert W. E. Bunsen" {{was built}} at Chicago, Illinois in 1900 by the Chicago Shipbuilding Company. She was owned next by the Pittsburgh Steamship Company. She was {{converted}} to a <b>self</b> <b>unloader</b> at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin in 1957 by the Roen Transportation Company. Her name was changed to the "Marquis Roen" at that time. She was bought by the Burnside Terminal Company of New Orleans, Louisiana in 1972...|$|E

50|$|Depending {{on their}} application, lakers {{may also be}} {{referred}} to by their type, such as oreboats (primarily for iron ore), straight deckers (no self-unloading gear), bulkers (carry bulk cargo), sternenders (all cabins aft), <b>self</b> <b>unloaders</b> (with <b>self</b> unloading gear), longboats (due to their slender appearance), or lakeboats, among others.|$|R
50|$|Lakers are {{generally}} bulk carriers; that is, they carry cargoes of rock, ore, salt or grain in large contiguous holds, not packed in containers. The earlier ships required rail cars unloading on ore docks and unloading machinery at the receiving docks, but modern lakers are <b>self</b> <b>unloaders,</b> {{allowing them to}} unload faster and in more ports.|$|R
40|$|The "George F. Rand" {{was built}} of steel as the "William C. Agnew" at Lorain, Ohio in 1911. She was of 6533 gross tons and owned by Boland and Cornelius of Buffalo, New York. The name change to "George F. Rand" {{took place in}} 1926. The vessel was {{converted}} by the American Shipbuilding Company as a <b>self</b> <b>unloader</b> for coal at Lorain, Ohio September 1936. She was sold for scrapping and departed for Quebec on May 8, 1974. She was scrapped at Valencia, Spain, before June 7, 1974...|$|E
40|$|This is {{believed}} to be the whale back originally named the "Samuel Mather. " She was built in 1892. In the final years of her existence (1923 / 1924), she was renamed the "Clifton" and was converted to a <b>self</b> <b>unloader.</b> When headed for Detroit from Sturgeon Bay with a load of stone, she was lost in a storm believed to be about 25 miles out in Lake Huron off Thunder Bay on the night of September 22, 1924. The entire crew of 28 men perished. Because none of their bodies were ever found, it is assumed that she sank quickly, preventing the crew from abandoning the ship or lowering lifeboats...|$|E
40|$|This 6077 gross ton {{vessel was}} built in 1910 by the Great Lakes Engineering Works of St Clair, Michigan. She was {{initially}} owned by the American Steamship Co. of Buffalo, New York. In 1934, she was converted to a <b>self</b> <b>unloader</b> at Lorain, Ohio by the American Ship Building Co. In 1962, she was sold to the Redwood Enterprises, Ltd., Port Credit, Ontario. From 1958 to 1962, she {{was known as the}} "Fred A. Manske. " From 1962 to 1978, she was known as the "Leadale. " In 1971, she grounded at Port Huron, Michigan after the failure of her steering gear. She was sold to Marine Salvage at Port Colborne, Ontario in 1978...|$|E
50|$|Self-unloading {{equipment}} is {{usually in the}} form of a boom on deck. The boom is usually positioned on the back half of the vessel, pointing forward. The boom is swung out to either side of the vessel, a conveyor system is started, and the offloading process begins. The boom is a much more efficient method of unloading and allows the boat to serve a wider variety of ports which have no shore-side unloading gear. This also allows a greater variety of cargoes to be hauled and, therefore, the opportunity to run more trips each season. Many historic straight deckers have been converted to self-unloaders or retired from service. For instance, the steam-powered straight decker James Norris was converted to a self-unloader in 1980 but, by 2008, still had not been converted from steam to diesel. The largest straight-decker, the 806-foot John Sherwin has not sailed under its own power since 1981, and its conversion to a diesel self-unloader in 2008 was suspended because of the world economic downturn.Some <b>self</b> <b>unloaders</b> can have a rather straight decker look. For example, the 1000-foot Stewart J. Cort has a shuttle boom inside the aft deckhouse. The shuttle boom can be extended to reach hoppers on the docks, specially designed for the purpose.|$|R
40|$|George M. Humphrey" was a steel {{ore carrier}} built at Lorain, Ohio, in 1927, for the Kinsman Transit Co. of Cleveland, Ohio. On June 15, 1943, {{in a heavy}} fog, it sunk in a {{collision}} with the "D. M. Clemson," in 77 feet {{of water in the}} Straits of Mackinac, 1. 5 miles northeast of Mackinaw City, Michigan. It went down within twenty minutes. It was abandoned to underwriters. The War Department cleared claims on the wreck and by the fall, Captain John Roen, of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, took over the clearing job, with the million dollar ship as a prize. During these operations, he used his barges, "Maitland" and "Hilda," along with his powerful tug "John Roen III," to pull the "George M. Humphrey" to the dock for repair. The tugboat had hauled the vessel across Lake Michigan to Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, mid a triumphal celebration. Repaired, "George M. Humphrey" was placed in service in the spring of 1945, under its new name of "Captain John Roen. " Along with the vessel, 11, 000 tons of ore was also salvaged from the wreck. In March of 1947, the "Captain John Roen" was sold to the American Steamship Co. {{to be used in the}} bulk freight trade. In 1948, its name was changed to "Adam E. Cornelius" and it was rebuilt, at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, into a <b>self</b> <b>unloader...</b>|$|E
