As such, the Grom missile is used by other <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>defence</b> systems of Polish design, including ZSU-23-4MP Biała, ZUR-23-2 kg and POPRAD self-propelled artillery system.

5000|$|In April 2012, the Ministry of Defence {{identified}} {{the water tower}} as a potential location for <b>surface-to-air</b> missile <b>defences</b> during the 2012 Summer Olympics.

5000|$|Akash (Sanskrit: आकाश Ākāś [...] "Sky") is a medium-range mobile <b>surface-to-air</b> missile <b>defence</b> system {{developed}} by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Ordnance Factories Board and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) in India. The missile system can target aircraft up to 30 km away, at altitudes up to 18,000 m.|$|R
5000|$|Akash (Sanskrit: आकाश Ākāś [...] "Sky") is a medium-range <b>surface-to-air</b> missile <b>defence</b> system {{developed}} by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), and supported by Ordnance Factories Board and Bharat Electronics (BEL) in India. The missile system can target aircraft up to 30 km away, at altitudes up to 18,000 m. A pre-fragmented warhead could potentially give the missile the capability to destroy both aircraft and warheads from ballistic missiles. It is in operational service with the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force.|$|R
5000|$|Barak-8 is a {{long-range}} anti-air and anti-missile naval defence system being developed jointly by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India. The Indian Army is considering induction of {{a variant of}} Barak 8 missile to meet its requirement for a medium-range <b>surface-to-air</b> air <b>defence</b> missile. The naval version of this missile will {{have the capability to}} intercept incoming enemy cruise missiles and combat jets targeting its warships at sea. [...] India has a joint venture for this missile with Israel.|$|R
50|$|To {{supplement}} the Hunter's interception capabilities, Switzerland purchased a <b>surface-to-air</b> missile (SAM) <b>defence</b> {{system from the}} United Kingdom, closely based on the Bristol Bloodhound II. High-altitude air defence was maintained by these SAM batteries and Dassault Mirage III fighters, while medium-to-lower altitudes were patrolled by the Hunters.|$|R
50|$|Within 9 {{days of the}} {{invasion}} of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, 12 Panavia Tornado F3 interceptors from 5 (AC) Sqn and 29 (F) Sqn from RAF Coningsby had arrived in Saudi Arabia, alongside aircraft of the USAF. Later, Jaguar aircraft from RAF Coltishall and Tornado GR1s, redeployed from service in Germany deployed to the theatre. Buccaneer aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth were also deployed in order to laser designate ground targets for the Tornado. This action {{had the effect of}} maintaining the confidence of friendly nations, and limiting the potential for further Iraqi expansion. When an economic embargo was placed on Iraq, these aircraft also helped maintain it. The force of F3s was expanded to 18 drawn from the three British bases then housing F3s (Leuchars, Leeming and Coningsby), with 27 air crew and 350 ground personnel. They were based at the Royal Saudi Air Force base at Dhahran, from where they flew patrols inside the range of Iraqi ground radar systems. Before the launch of the operation to liberate Kuwait they flew over 2000 sorties. Hercules, VC10 and TriStar aircraft supplied both the air force and other military endeavours; Nimrod MR.2P aircraft assisted naval operations. At bases in Tabuk, Dhahran and Muharraq, the RAF deployed Rapier missiles as part of <b>surface-to-air</b> <b>defences.</b> In total, around 6,000 RAF personnel were deployed to the Gulf.|$|R
2500|$|Initially, {{the basic}} attack flight profile was [...] "high-high-high" [...] {{at a speed}} of Mach 1.85, {{engaging}} targets up to a maximum radius of 3,500km (2,175mi). In the late 1960s, when the threat of <b>surface-to-air</b> missile <b>defences</b> made high-altitude flight too hazardous, the Mirage IVA was modified for low-altitude penetration. Flying low, the maximum attack speed was reduced to 1,100km/h (680mph) and the combat radius was also decreased. By 1963, the majority of missions involving the Mirage IV were being planned as low-level flights. By 1964, Mirage IVAs were conducting training penetration runs {{at an altitude of}} 200ft, without the assistance of terrain-following radar, which subjected pilots to considerable workload and those on board to high levels of turbulence.|$|R

5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained {{an arsenal of}} conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a <b>surface-to-air</b> missile (SAM) <b>defence</b> system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|R
