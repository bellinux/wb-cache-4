50|$|The {{reactor core}} is 1.03 meters tall with a {{diameter}} of 2.05 meters. It has 369 fuel assemblies, mounted vertically, each consisting of 127 fuel rods enriched to between 17 - 26% 235U. In comparison, normal enrichment in other Russian reactors is between 3 - 4% 235U. The control and scram system comprises 27 reactivity control elements including 19 <b>shimming</b> <b>rods,</b> two automatic control rods, and six automatic emergency shut-down rods.

40|$|The Belgian Material Test Reactor (MTR) BR 2 is {{strongly}} heterogeneous high flux engineering test reactor at SCK-CEN (Centre d'Etude de l'energie Nucléaire) in Mol at a thermal power 60 to 100 MW. It deploys highly enriched uranium, water cooled concentric plate fuel elements, positioned inside a beryllium reflector with complex hyperboloid arrangement of test holes. The {{objective of this}} paper is the validation of a MCNP&ORIGEN-S 3 D model for reactivity predictions of the entire BR 2 core during reactor operation. We employ the Monte Carlo code MCNP- 4 C for evaluating the effective multiplication factor keff and 3 D space dependent specific power distribution. The 1 D code ORIGEN-S is used for calculation of isotopic fuel depletion versus burn up and preparation of a database (DB) with depleted fuel compositions. The approach taken is to evaluate the 3 D power distribution at each time step and along with DB to evaluate the 3 D isotopic fuel depletion at the next step and to deduce the corresponding <b>shim</b> <b>rods</b> positions of the reactor operation. The capabilities of the both codes are fully exploited without constraints on the number of involved isotope depletion chains or increase of the computational time. The reactor has a complex operation, with important shutdowns between cycles, and its reactivity {{is strongly}} influenced by poisons, mainly 3 He and 6 Li from the beryllium reflector, and burnable absorbers 149 Sm and 10 B in the fresh UAlx fuel.

Comparison of the fuel burnup calculated from the gamma measurements and by the flux-time method shows good agreement. This means that the gammaray distribution measurements could be a good method of determining the U/sup 235 / consumption in fuel elements. Distributions of the macroscopic absorption cross section and the infinite multiplication factor along fuel elements are computed from the gamma dose rate distribution.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate a new concept for a Tokamak type fusion reactor blanket. The design was based on using a packed bed of lithium aluminate as the breeding material with helium gas cooling. The unique aspect of the design was the assumption that small coolant leaks were inevitable and should not necessitate major maintenance. A modularized design was chosen with cylindrical breeder rods and graphite shim rods. Redundancy was provided by designing the blanket such that if a module failed it could be depressurized and its heat load shared by the neighboring operating modules. The thermal hydraulic analysis evolved analytical and computational methods for determining the temperature profiles of all components and the pumping power requirements. A computer program TRIPORT was developed to evaluate the tritium retention and transport. A one dimensional ANISN code was used to determine the breeding ratio for different configurations. !  The thermal hydraulic, neutronic and mechanical aspects of the Breeder Rod <b>Shim</b> <b>Rod</b> (BRSR) design were combined to determine a design window, that is the allowable range of system parameters. Unfortunately adequate breeding could not be demonstrated so that there was no open window. Basically the low breeding was caused by -he inherently poor breeding potential of LiAlO, combined with the additional structure required for failure mode operation. However, this conclusion is based on a specific design concept (BRSR) and further research in the area may prove more fruitful.

40|$|A new reactor burn-up {{strategy}} CANDLE was proposed, where {{shapes of}} neutron flux, nuclide densities and power density distributions remain constant but move to an axial direction. Here important points {{are that the}} solid fuel is fixed at each position and that any movable burn-up reactivity control mechanisms such as control rods are not required. This burn-up strategy can derive many merits. The change of excess reactivity along burn-up is theoretically zero, and <b>shim</b> <b>rods</b> will not be required for this reactor. The reactor becomes free from accidents induced by unexpected control rods withdrawal during power operation. The core characteristics, such as power feedback coefficients and power peaking factor, are not changed along burn-up. Therefore, {{the operation of the}} reactor becomes much easier than the conventional reactors especially high burn-up reactors. The transportation and storage of replacing fuels become easy and safe, since they are free from criticality accidents. In our previous works it appeared that application of this burn-up strategy to neutron rich fast reactors makes excellent performances. Only natural or depleted uranium is required for the replacing fuels. The average burn-up of the spent fuel is about 40 % of total charged fuel. It i...|$|R
40|$|The two-dimensional, time dependent, three-group {{diffusion}} equations for {{the proposed}} designed core of the MIT reactor are written with an extra source term accounting for the photoneutrons generated in the D 20 reflector. An analytical expression is developed for this term. Then an approximate flux composed of two spatial shapes chosen beforehand, each having an unknown time coefficient, is inserted into the time dependent multigroup equations and the weighted residual criteria is applied. This yields multimode kinetics equations with generalized definitions for the conventional matrix parameters: generation time, reactivity, delayed neutron (and photoneutron) fractions matrices. Computational methods for these parameters are presented. An accident concerning {{the withdrawal of the}} <b>shim</b> <b>rods</b> is examined with the code OZAN written for the purpose of-the computations required by the present work.

40|$|This {{progress}} report covers {{the period from}} November 15, 1963 to February 15, 1964. A study indicated that the most desirable type of blower drive turbine is one using main turbine throttie steam conditions and exhausting to the main turbine cross-over line. Preliminary planning for the initiation of a dynamic structural analyses of the overall steam generator was completed. External pressure loading and thermal stress calculations show that the calandria has a suitable design margin. A revised fuel latch operable from the rear face of the core was designed. A study was initiated to determine the feasibility of substituting Zircaloy for the stainless steel tubing within the active core. Preliminary sizing of control rod extensions and gang plates was completed. Initial loading of the second configuration of the 630 A critical experiment reactor was completed. Detailed power distributions were measured in the 11 typical positions. Subcritical and critical rod worth curves were obtained in the critical experiment with up to 132 <b>shim</b> <b>rods</b> in the core. Moderator temperature coefficient measurements were made and agreed well with analytical data. Critical experiment correlation of fine radial power calculations in the revised mock-up showed good agreement. Performance specifications were prepared for a 1 -Mw(e) power plant. Parametric thermal analyses, based on various tube sheet thicknesses and heating rates, were completed for {{the top and bottom}} tube sheets. The shield plug was redesigned to accommodate additional <b>shim</b> <b>rods</b> and to facilitate fabrication and moderator flow adjustments. Calculations of the operating and shutdown dose at the nuclear sensor location was started. Studies were performed to determine the size of the port openings needed to prevent buckling in the containmert vessel in the event of ship sinking. A blower shaft static seal was built and tested with satisfactory results. Manufacture and procurement of all parts for two developmental dynamic rod actuators were completed. The two-tube boiler was modified and operated satisfactorily on automatic control down to 20 percent power. A reactor control system that meets response and accuracy requirements was simulated on the analog computer. Investigation of a possible test site for power testing the prototype reactor was continued with cost estimates and a facility layout drawing being made for the IET facility at ITS. Specimen ORF- 4 was removed from test after 4800 hours of actual operation at 1300 deg F, equivalent to approximately 15, 000 hours of full- power 630 A operation. An estimated 40 percent burnup of the /sup 235 /U atoms occurred. Creep tests on warm-finished fuel sheet have accumulated more than 12, 000 hours at 630 A stress and temperature conditions with no greater than 0. 75 percent plastic creep. Cladding-stock creep tests have surpassed 15, 000 hours at various combinations of stress and temperature with satisfactory results. (auth...|$|R
40|$|The Power Burst Facility (PBF) reactor {{operated}} from 1972 to 1985 on the SPERT Area I of the Idaho National Laboratory, {{then known}} as Nuclear Reactor Test Station. PBF was designed to provide experimental data to aid in defining thresholds for and modes of failure under postulated accident conditions. PBF reactor startup testing began in 1972. This evaluation focuses on two operational loading tests, chronologically numbered 1 and 2, published in a startup-test report in 1974 [1]. Data for these tests was used {{by one of the}} authors to validate a MCNP model for criticality safety purposes [2]. Although specific references to original documents are kept in the text, all the reactor parameters and test specific data presented here was adapted from that report. The tests were performed with operational fuel loadings, a stainless steel in-pile tube (IPT) mockup, a neutron source, four pulse chambers, two fission chambers, and one ion chamber. The reactor's four transition rods (TRs) and control rods (CRs) were present but TR boron was completely withdrawn below the core and CR boron was partially withdrawn above the core. Test configurations differ primarily in the number of <b>shim</b> <b>rods,</b> and consequently the number of fuel rods included in the core. The critical condition was approached by incrementally and uniformly withdrawing CR boron from the core. Based on the analysis of the experimental data and numerical calculations, both experiments are considered acceptable as criticality safety benchmarks...|$|R
50|$|Engine {{performance}} {{began to}} decrease with EPA restrictions on tailpipe emissions and grams per mile emissions requirements, forcing gear ratios to taller and taller ratios, dropping to {{as low as}} 2.41:1. A new common frame/suspension design {{was introduced in the}} latest generation Sixty Special which was also used in other GM full size cars. While the other GM divisions used a front-steer setup (steering linkage in front of the engine crossmember), all Cadillac RWDs retained the 1961-vintage front suspension (rear steering linkage, eccentric cams in the steering knuckle in lieu of <b>shims,</b> strut <b>rods</b> attached to the framerails for caster adjustment). Rear suspensions were now driven by the Pontiac-designed -inch ring-gear 10-bolt Salisbury live axle. A new trailer towing package was added allowing larger trailer loads to be pulled. Coupled with heavy duty cooling, 3.23 gearing, high output 80 amp large frame alternator and heavy-duty THM400 transmission, the long wheelbase was ideal to pull trailers weighing up to 7,000 lb (3,200 kg).|$|R
