40|$|The {{operating}} theatre is a {{very complex}} environment shared, for a certain period, by a group of people having highly different needs: on one side, there is the surgical team that must carry out a demanding job that in some cases can be very stressful (e. g. orthopedics surgery or those lasting more than four hours) and on the other, there is the anesthetized patient often subject to liquid infusion. Up to today little consideration has been given to the different needs of the surgical team whose members show different reactions according to their positions with respect to the <b>scialytic</b> <b>lamp</b> and above all to the task had within the team. Also the clothing influences the surgical team comfort degree: in fact, in some surgery (orthopedics, neurosurgery etc.) surgeons and assistants must wear non transpiring paper overalls beneath plasticized overalls besides protective masks and caps; then, if X-rays are needed during surgery, the second surgeon and the assistants must also wear lead overalls and lead thyroid collars and gloves while the anesthetists and nurses will keep on wearing non transpiring paper overalls; therefore the clothing thermal resistance of the surgical staff involved in the same surgical operation should be very different. The purpose of the present work is to report the first data obtained during an experimental campaign carried out at the SS. Annunziata hospital in Cento (Ferrara, Italy) and presents the developed investigation methodology...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{environment}} of the operating theatre is shared {{by a group of}} people having highly different needs: on one side, there is a surgical team whose work may last many hours and, on the other, an anaesthetized patient often subject to liquid infusion. Up to now, little consideration has been given to the different needs of the surgical team who may be affected according to their positions with respect to the <b>scialytic</b> <b>lamp</b> and their particular task. Clothing influences the comfort of the surgical team to a considerable degree: in fact, in some surgery (orthopaedics, neurosurgery and so on), surgeons and assistants must wear paper overalls beneath non-breathable plastic overalls and protective masks and caps; then, if X-rays are needed during surgery, the second surgeon and the assistants must also wear lead overalls and lead thyroid collars and gloves while the anaesthetists and nurses will keep on wearing non-breathable paper overalls. In consequence, the thermal resistance of the clothing of the surgical staff involved in the same surgical operation could be very different. The purpose of the present work is to report investigations carried out at the SS. Annunziata Hospital in Cento (Ferrara, Italy) and present some of the data obtained. The article describes experimental and theoretical research activities, both ongoing and proposed, inherent to the thermo-hygrometric comfort problems of medical personnel. This study falls within a larger research programme, concerning the microbiological, chemical and physical pollution phenomena and the patientâ€™s hypothermia problems in an operating theatre...|$|E
