In {{view of the}} {{phenomenon}} that the curved duct in anchorage zone of cable-stayed bridges result in non-uniformity of each of <b>steel</b> <b>strand,</b> we analyzed the position change law of the prestressed <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> in curved duct. Simulating real bridge design, a simple method was proposed to compute non-uniformity level of prestressed <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> {{in the process of}} tensioning.

50|$|The {{aluminium}} alloy and temper {{used for the}} outer strands in the United States and Canada is normally 1350-H19 and elsewhere is 1370-H19, each with 99.5+% aluminium content.

The diameters of the strands used for both the aluminum and <b>steel</b> <b>strands</b> vary for different ACSR conductors.|$|E
50|$|ACSR {{conductors}} {{are available}} in numerous specific sizes, with single or multiple center steel wires and generally larger quantities of aluminium strands. Although rarely used, there are some conductors that have more <b>steel</b> <b>strands</b> than aluminum strands. An ACSR conductor can in part be denoted by its stranding, for example, an ACSR conductor with 72 aluminium strands with a core of 7 <b>steel</b> <b>strands</b> will be called 72/7 ACSR conductor. Cables generally range from #6 AWG (“6/1” - six outer aluminum conductors and one steel reinforcing conductor) to 2167 kcmil (“72/7” - seventy two outer aluminum conductors and seven steel reinforcing conductors).|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the tests and analysis on the coefficient of thermal expansion for the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> under combined low temperatures and prestressing forces. A test program was firstly carried out to study the thermal expansion behaviour of the seven-wire strand under combined different low temperatures ranging from 20 to −  165  °C and different prestressing levels ranging from 0 to 0.75 ft/ftk. The test results exhibited the thermal expansion behaviours of the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> under low temperatures in terms of thermal strain versus temperature curves, transit linear thermal expansion coefficient, and average thermal expansion coefficient. The influences of the low temperature and prestressing levels on the thermal expansion behaviours of the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> were separately discussed and analysed. Based on the test data, mathematical models were developed to predict the thermal expansion coefficients including transit and average of the <b>steel</b> <b>strand.</b> The developed regression models fully considered the influences of the low temperature and prestressing stresses acted on the strand. Finally, design equations were proposed to predict the transit and average thermal expansion coefficient of the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> under combined low temperature and prestressing forces.|$|R

50|$|The hybrid {{composite}} beam is single structural element, a beam. It is constructed as {{a composite of}} three materials <b>steel</b> <b>strands,</b> concrete, and fiber reinforced polymer. The materials are arranged {{in a manner that}} the materials act as what would traditionally be separate structural elements. The concrete is in the shape of an arch and carries compressive load internal to the beam. The <b>steel</b> <b>strands</b> act as a tie for the arch and carry the tensile load internal to the beam. The FRP shell carries the shear and bending moment internal to the beam. This means that the beam acts structurally in a hybrid nature, somewhere between a tied-arch and a beam.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{different}} styles of OPGW are made. In one type, between 8 and 48 glass optical fibers are placed in a plastic tube. The tube is inserted into a stainless steel, aluminum, or aluminum-coated steel tube, with some slack length of fiber allowed to prevent strain on the glass fibers. The buffer tubes are filled with grease to protect the fiber unit from water {{and to protect the}} steel tube from corrosion, the interstices of the cable are filled with grease. The tube is stranded into the cable with aluminum, aluminium alloy or <b>steel</b> <b>strands,</b> similar to an ACSR cable. The <b>steel</b> <b>strands</b> provide strength, and the aluminum strands provide electrical conductivity. For very large fiber counts, up to 144 fibers in one cable, multiple tubes are used.|$|E

30|$|During each test, the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> was firstly {{put into}} the cooling chamber and {{installed}} on the reaction frame. Followed, prestressing was carried out to the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> by the hydraulic jack. Considering the contracting stress due to the low temperature, a gap of 30  kN to each target presressing level was reserved for the test before the cooling process. After the prestressing on the strand, liquid nitrogen was injected into the cooling chamber. Six thermal couples were averagely distributed {{on the surface of}} the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> to monitoring its temperature. After achieving the target temperature of −  165  °C, the injection of the liquid nitrogen will be controlled to maintain this temperature level. Then, the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> was prestressed to the target prestressing levels, and this prestressing level was maintained during the thermal expansion behaviour test. After that, the temperature in the cooling chamber will be gradually increased to the ambient temperature step-by-step. During this heating process, linear varying displacement transducers (LVDTs) were used to monitor the displacements at the two ends of the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> as shown in Fig.  1. All the readings of the sensors including the thermocouples, load cell, and LVDTs were monitored and recorded by software running on the PC during the testing.|$|R

5000|$|Most commonly, dam {{prestressing}} {{takes the}} form of post-tensioned anchors drilled into the dam's concrete structure and/or the underlying rock strata.

(1988) {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} mechanical {{properties of the}} <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> under temperatures of 20 and −  165  °C that included yield strength, ultimate strength, and fracture strains. The mechanical properties of the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> under low temperature ranging from 20 to −  165  °C has been reported by Nie (Nie 2012). The thermal expansion coefficients of the steel reinforcement used in the PC structure were experimentally studied by Elices et al. (Elices et al. 1982, 1986). The geometrically nonlinear behaviour of the strand has been reported by Gasparion and Gautam (2002). Liu et al. (2007) reported the linear expansion factor of strand used for the water-heated instruments under elevating temperature. Chen and Liu (2010) continued the experimental study on the thermal expansion factor of the cables used in the spatial structures. Sun et al. (2011) analytically and experimentally investigated the thermal expansion mechanism of the steel cables under the natural environmental temperatures. However, most of the previous experimental studies focused on the mechanical properties of the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> or reinforcements under low temperatures. The information on the thermal expansion of the <b>steel</b> <b>strand</b> under low temperatures ranging from 20 to −  165  °C is still quite limited.|$|R

50|$|High-voltage {{overhead}} conductors are {{not covered}} by insulation. The conductor material is nearly always an aluminum alloy, made into several strands and possibly reinforced with <b>steel</b> <b>strands.</b> Copper was sometimes used for overhead transmission, but aluminum is lighter, yields only marginally reduced performance and costs much less. Overhead conductors are a commodity supplied by several companies worldwide. Improved conductor material and shapes are regularly used to allow increased capacity and modernize transmission circuits. Conductor sizes range from 12 mm2 (#6 American wire gauge) to 750 mm2 (1,590,000 circular mils area), with varying resistance and current-carrying capacity. Thicker wires would lead to a relatively small increase in capacity due to the skin effect (which causes most of the current to flow close {{to the surface of the}} wire). Because of this current limitation, multiple parallel cables (called bundle conductors) are used when higher capacity is needed. Bundle conductors are also used at high voltages to reduce energy loss caused by corona discharge.|$|E

5000|$|To help avoid {{confusion}} due to {{the numerous}} combinations of stranding of the steel and aluminium strands, code words are used to specify a specific conductor version. In North America bird names are used for the code words while animal names are used elsewhere. For instance in North America, Grosbeak is a [...] (636 kcmil) ACSR conductor with 26/7 Aluminium/Steel stranding whereas Egret is the same total aluminium size ( [...] , 636 kcmil conductor) but with 30/19 Aluminium/Steel stranding. Although the number of aluminium strands is different between Grosbeak and Egret, differing sizes of the aluminium strands are used to offset {{the change in the}} number of strands such that the total amount of aluminium remains the same. Differences in the number of <b>steel</b> <b>strands</b> result in varying weights of the steel portion and also result in different overall conductor diameters. Most utilities standardize on a specific conductor version when various versions of the same amount of aluminum to avoid issues related to different size hardware (such as splices). Due to the numerous different sizes available, utilities often skip over some of the sizes to reduce their inventory. The various stranding versions result in different electrical and mechanical characteristics.|$|E
