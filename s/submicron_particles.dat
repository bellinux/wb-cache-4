40|$|A {{laboratory}} furnace {{was constructed}} {{to study the}} mechanism of <b>submicron</b> <b>particle</b> formation in pulverized coal boilers. Simulation was achieved by matching characteristic kinetic times in laboratory and field units. This was done by matching volumetric heat extraction rates. Reynolds number and geometric scaling were not deemed essential for the simulation. Combustion-generated submicron aerosols from the laboratory furnace were characterized by size and composition distribution measurements using an electrical mobility analyzer and a low-pressure impactor. Elemental analysis of size-classified mass samples was done by alpha particle-induced X-ray emission spectrum analysis. The influence of macroscopic combustion parameters {{on the characteristics of}} fine particle emissions was investigated. Total <b>submicron</b> <b>particle</b> volume concentration was found to depend on burner type and to increase with temperature for each burner type tested. The particle volume concentration was found to increase with exhaust NO concentration. The fine particle composition was found to differ from that of larger residual ash particles which generally reflected the composition of the bulk ash. It was also found that combustion conditions (overall fuel-air equivalence ratio and wall temperature) influenced the composition of the smallest ash particles. Species enrichment data are generally supportive of the vaporization-condensation mechanism of <b>submicron</b> <b>particle</b> formation. Measured dependence of particle volume-mean diameter is consistent with theoretical predictions based on free-molecular Brownian coagulation of particles formed by nucleation of vaporized ash. Strong dependence of <b>submicron</b> <b>particle</b> volume concentration on char particle temperatures in the hot zone further suggests vaporization of ash to be the principal source of material from which fine particles are formed. A semi-quantitative combustion model was formulated to calculate char particle temperature-time histories in the laboratory furnace. An Arrhenius vaporization rate expression was fitted to the laboratory measurements of total <b>submicron</b> <b>particle</b> volume concentration using the particle temperature histories calculated from the combustion model. Estimates of kinetic parameters were compared with those of other investigators. The model calculations suggest that the mass-specific rate of ash vaporization is strongly dependent on parent coal particle size. This is due to higher burning temperatures of smaller particles together with a high apparent activation energy for ash vaporization. Recommendations for further work are given...|$|R

In order to investigate the impact of vehicle density and speed on the concentrations of <b>submicron</b> <b>particles</b> in the atmosphere, a study was conducted in Hangzhou, a city in Southeast China.

In the case of above micron particles, the deterioration of filter removal efficiency has been mainly due to the blocking effect of deposited particles and not by the number of deposited particles. Deposition of large numbers of <b>submicron</b> <b>particles</b> changed the surface characteristics of collectors (filter grain associated with deposited particles) and enhanced unfavorable surface conditions.

A majority of this organic component (0. 1  -  0. 4  μ m- 3) consisted of organic hydroxyl (including polyol and other alcohol) groups characteristic of saccharides, similar to biogenic carbohydrates found in seawater. The large fraction of organic hydroxyl groups measured during ICEALOT in submicron atmospheric aerosol exceeded those measured in most previous campaigns but were similar to particles in marine air masses in the open ocean (Southeast Pacific Ocean) and coastal sites at northern Alaska (Barrow) and northeastern North America (Appledore Island and Chebogue Point).

40|$|Hydrous {{aluminum}} oxide colloids of 0. 5 Am diameter {{were used to}} study the coagulation of <b>submicron</b> <b>particles</b> under water-treatment conditions. The research was aimed at understanding the effects of pH and ligands (organic and inorganic) on precipitation of the added coagulant and their influences on incorporation of the colloids into larger flocs. The reduction in the concentration of <b>submicron</b> <b>particles</b> {{as a result of}} alum coagulation was monitored by conventional jar-test experiments. Scanning electron microscopy was used for submicron particle counting. Up to three orders of magnitude reduction in submicron particle concentrations were observed in jar-test experiments. Higher pH (i. e., 7. 5) and alum dose (i. e., 1. 0 mg L⁻¹) favored homogeneous precipitation of aluminum hydroxide, whereas heterogeneous precipitation occurred at lower pH (i. e., 6. 5) and alum dose (i. e., 0. 5 mg L⁻¹). Homogeneous precipitation, involving formation of Al(OH) ₃(s) from aqueous species, formed large masses of light-weight flocs that can effectively remove <b>submicron</b> <b>particles</b> by subsequent coagulation. Heterogeneous precipitation, which involves precipitation on the surfaces of the seed particles, resulted in destabilized particles that can efficiently coagulate with each other. The presence of ligands, inorganic (e. g., HCO₃⁻) and organic (e. g., functional groups of humic substances) inhibited the coagulation process, reducing particle removal up-to 250 fold. While these ligands inhibit coagulation by modifying particle surfaces, they may enhance the precipitation reactions of aluminum hydroxide. The presence SO₄²⁻ enhanced precipitation relative to NO₃⁻. Electrophoretic mobility values were used to derive equilibrium constants for aluminum speciation and precipitation reactions, both on the surface of particles and in solution. The adsorption of ligands lowered the pHiep, by almost 2 pH units in the presence of HCO₃⁻, and to a pH of less than 3 in the presence of organics. Aluminum species elevated the pHiep by 1 pH unit. Stoichiometric ratios of aluminum hydroxide precipitation were determined using a pH stat. This ratio (1. 9 to 3. 7) is a function of pH, and concentrations of particles and organics. These results were modeled as spherical precipitates (OH/A 1 = 3) with adsorbed aluminum species (OH/A 1 = 1 to 4). The results of this research suggest that the aluminum precipitation pathway dictates the removal of <b>submicron</b> <b>particles.</b> <b>Submicron</b> <b>particles</b> provide most of the surfaces from particulate matter, thus suggesting the importance of surface precipitation for their removal.
