5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted the take off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the <b>steel</b> <b>cords</b> with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E

This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.Just after Cole's C-130 left Khâm Đức, a C-123 flown by Major Ray D. Shelton landed and took out 44 U.S. engineers and 21 South Vietnamese civilians. Shortly after Shelton had landed his aircraft, he reported that enemy fire was coming in from all quadrants, but he was able to take off safely after just three minutes on the ground. By 11:10, just 145 people had been evacuated by Shelton's aircraft, and a handful of helicopters. After that, another three C-130s also arrived in the vicinity of Khâm Đức, but the pilots were told not to try landings. In the afternoon, the C-130 Hercules resumed their operations; at 15:25, Major Bernard L. Bucher's C-130 approached Khâm Đức's airfield from the south and landed despite taking numerous hits. Some 150 Vietnamese women and children rushed onto the aircraft; as soon as the aircraft was full, Bucher made his takeoff in the north direction, unaware that opposing forces were concentrated in that area. At 15:30 Bucher took off, and his aircraft was quickly riddled by ground fire; it crashed {{less than a mile from}} the end of the runway.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{indentation}} rolling resistance of <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> conveyor belt and compares the results with those for fabric reinforced conveyor belt. Due to the steel cables imbedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution between the belt and a conveyor idler roll is not uniform. The fluctuating pressure {{means that a}} two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model - which is suitable {{for the analysis of}} fabric belt - cannot be readily applied to the analysis of <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> belt. To cope with this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the conveyor idler. The pressures determined by the finite element analysis are compared with experimental results found with the Tekscan pressure measurement system, and the reaction loads are used in the two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model developed by Wheeler [2]. The results from Wheeler's model are summed to determine an overall indentation rolling resistance for the <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> belt...|$|R

40|$|Externally Bonded (EB) {{composite}} materials {{are becoming a}} widespread solution for strengthening interventions on masonry buildings, even Cultural Heritage structures, due to several positive aspects mainly related to their high strength-to-weight ratio. In recent years, beside common epoxy-based Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRP), steel-based composites have been proposed: they are composed by unidirectional high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>cords</b> that can be coupled to either organic (Steel Reinforced Polymers, SRP) or inorganic (Steel Reinforced Grouts, SRG) matrices, {{in relation to their}} optimized spacing. The bond behaviour of all these EB composites has a strong influence over the effectiveness of interventions, since the detachment of reinforcements from the substrate generally represents the weaker failure mechanism. In order to improve this aspect, several anchorage devices have been proposed, being spikes, among them, one of the most suitable for masonry supports. Spikes are made of a bundle of fibres partly {{in the form of a}} bar, to be inserted and glued into a hole drilled in the substrate, and partly loose, to be spread and connected to reinforcement strips. Despite their importance also from a design point of view and considering the variety of shapes and materials, there are still few investigations in this field, being clear that both the spike-to-reinforcement and the spike-to-masonry connections need to be studied. Focused on the spike-to-masonry connection, this paper is aimed at investigating the performance of steel cord spikes applied to existing clay brick masonry, by means of overall 39 pull-out tests carried out taking into account the bonded length (equal to the hole depth), the type of embedding material and the number of <b>steel</b> <b>cords</b> forming the anchorage.

An experimental programme based on a four-point bending test configuration is proposed to characterize the stiffness, ductility and strength response of strengthened wood beams. Mechanical tests on the strengthened wood showed that external bonding of steel fibers produce high increases in flexural stiffness and capacity. Finally experiment results are used to calibrate existing analytical formulations for capacity prediction. This economic and effective technique may be an interesting alternative to glass or carbon fibers or other expensive retrofitting methods...|$|E

High speed multi pass wet {{wire drawing}} {{has become very}} common for {{production}} of high carbon <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> because {{of the increase in}} customer demand and production rates in real industrial fields. Although the wet wire drawing is preformed at a high speed usually above 1000 m/min, greater speed is required to improve productivity.

The excessive temperature rise makes the wire more brittle and finally leads to wire breaks. In this study, the variations in wire temperature during wet wire drawing process were investigated. A multi pass wet wire drawing process with 21 passes, which was used to produce <b>steel</b> <b>cord,</b> was redesigned by considering the increase in temperature.

In addition to these <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> macrofibers, microfibers {{are used to}} enhance the pre- and post-cracking strength and behavior. The three specific hybrid fiber blends pursued in this investigation are SC and polyethylene (PE), SC and polypropylene (PP) as well as SC and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers. The research results show that SC macrofibers with high ultimate strain, strength and bond stress can bridge the macrocracks in the matrix. Therefore, cement-based composites reinforced with SC fibers exhibit a pseudo-strain hardening in tension {{as a result of}} the formation of multiple cracks. The microfibers improved pre-peak mechanical performance, strength, and fracture process by delaying the formation of a macrocrack.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the noise of a defect {{electromagnetic}} signal of the <b>steel</b> <b>cord</b> conveyor belt used in coal mines, a new signal noise reduction method by combined use of the improved threshold wavelet and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is proposed.

Then, the EMD is used to decompose the denoised signal and then the effective Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) is extracted by the dominant eigenvalue strategy. Finally, the signal reconstruction is carried out by utilizing the obtained IMF.
