500|$|Scientists {{have studied}} the {{characteristics}} of cirrus using several different methods. One, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), gives highly accurate information on the cloud's altitude, length, and width. Balloon-carried hygrometers give information on the humidity of the cirrus cloud but are not accurate enough to measure {{the depth of the}} cloud. Radar units give information on the altitudes and thicknesses of cirrus clouds. Another data source is satellite measurements from the <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>Aerosol</b> and Gas Experiment (SAGE) program. These satellites measure where infrared radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere, and if it is absorbed at cirrus altitudes, then it is assumed that there are cirrus clouds in that location. The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) also gives information on the cirrus cloud cover by measuring reflected infrared radiation of various specific frequencies during the day. During the night, it determines cirrus cover by detecting the Earth's infrared emissions. The cloud reflects this radiation back to the ground, thus enabling satellites to see the [...] "shadow" [...] it casts into space. Visual observations from aircraft or the ground provide additional information about cirrus clouds.|$|E

2500|$|Stratospheric sulfur {{aerosols}} are sulfur-rich particles which {{exist in}} the stratosphere region of the Earth's atmosphere. [...] The layer of the atmosphere in which they exist {{is known as the}} Junge layer, or simply the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>aerosol</b> layer. [...] These particles consist of a mixture of sulfuric acid and water. [...] They are created naturally, such as by photochemical decomposition of sulfur-containing gases, e.g. carbonyl sulfide. [...] When present in high levels, e.g. after a strong volcanic eruption such as Mount Pinatubo, they produce a cooling effect, by reflecting sunlight, and by modifying clouds as they fall out of the stratosphere. [...] This cooling may persist for a few years before the particles fall out.|$|E
