25|$|Reformed theologians {{affirm that}} the Bible is true, but {{differences}} emerge among {{them over the}} meaning and extent of its truthfulness. Conservative followers of the Princeton theologians take {{the view that the}} Bible is true and inerrant, or incapable of error or falsehood, in every place. This view is very similar to that of Catholic orthodoxy as well as modern Evangelicalism. Another view, influenced by the teaching of Karl Barth and Neo-Orthodoxy, is found in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s Confession of 1967. Those who take this view believe the Bible to be the primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of God, but also that some parts of the Bible may be false, not witnesses to Christ, and not normative for today's church. In this view, Christ is the revelation of God, and the scriptures witness to this revelation rather than being the revelation itself. Dawn DeVries, a professor at Union Presbyterian Seminary, has written that Barth's doctrine of Scripture is not capable of resolving conflicts in contemporary churches, and proposed that Scripture not be thought of as the Word of God at all, but only human reports of the revealed Jesus Christ.|$|E

It cited Andrew Ryder, a theologian at All Hallows College in Dublin, who wrote, [...] "While he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality, Tolle is very much concerned that, as we make our way through the ordinary events of the day, we keep in touch with the deepest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> being." ...|$|E
500|$|Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles {{realize they}} must work as one unit to defeat Adam. They are {{captured}} sneaking into the Initiative, but Adam trips the power, releasing all the demons and a fight breaks {{out all over}} the facility. Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles get themselves into a room adjacent to 314 as Willow starts to cast the spell to join them all temporarily. Riley distracts Adam's demonoid minions while Buffy confronts Adam. However, Adam, after modulating his arm to dispense a minigun, is able to overpower her. Suddenly, the spell begins to work: to function as one unit, Willow becomes the spirit, Giles the mind, Xander the heart, and Buffy the hand, or strength of their ensemble. They work through Buffy to neutralize Adam, telling him [...] "You could never hope to grasp the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> power". Adam, alone but intrigued, shoots at them to no avail. Adam then shoots a missile, which is changed into doves, and his gun is reverted into his arm. They are able, through Buffy, to punch inside Adam's chest, remove his uranium core, destroying him.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{dispensed}} with these alternative explanations, he identifies the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of necessary connections as {{arising out of}} observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances.

5000|$|A common mistake, however, is to {{consider}} Bacon an empiricist. For, although he exhorted men to reject as idols all pre-conceived notions and lay themselves alongside of nature by observation and experiment, so as gradually to ascend from facts to their laws, nevertheless he was far from regarding sensory experience as the whole origin of knowledge, and in truth had a double theory, that, while sense and experience are the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge <b>of</b> the natural world, faith and inspiration are the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge <b>of</b> the supernatural, of God, and of the rational soul, having given an admonition in his work [...] "The Great Instauration", [...] "that men confine the sense {{within the limits of}} duty in respect to things divine: for the sense is like the sun, which reveals the face of earth, but seals and shuts up the face of heaven".|$|R

Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, {{who was responsible for}} seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger.

[...] The WHO report agrees that [...] "drinking water, with some rare exceptions, is not {{the major source of}} essential elements for humans" [...] and is [...] "not the major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> calcium and magnesium intake", yet states that demineralized water is harmful anyway. [...] "Additional evidence comes from animal experiments and clinical observations in several countries. Animals given zinc or magnesium dosed in their drinking water had a significantly higher concentration of these elements in the serum than animals given the same elements in much higher amounts with food and provided with low-mineral water to drink." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1993 essay {{entitled}} [...] "Ecofeminism: Toward Global Justice and Planetary Health" [...] authors Greta Gaard and Lori Gruen outline {{what they}} call the [...] "ecofeminist framework". The essay provides a wealth of data and statistics in addition to laying out the theoretical aspects of the ecofeminist critique. The framework described is intended to establish ways of viewing and understanding our current global situations so that we are better able to understand how we arrived at this point and what may be done to ameliorate the ills. The four sides of the frame are: the mechanistic materialist model of the universe that resulted from the scientific revolution and the subsequent reduction of all things into mere resources to be optimized, dead inert matter to be used; the rise of patriarchal religions and their establishment of gender hierarchies along with their denial of immanent divinity; self and other dualisms and the inherent power and domination ethic it entails; and capitalism and its intrinsic need for the exploitation, destruction and instrumentalization of animals, earth and people {{for the sole purpose of}} creating wealth. They hold that these four factors have brought us to what ecofeminists see as a [...] "separation between nature and culture" [...] that is the root <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> planetary ills.|$|E

6000|$|All pure {{mathematics}} is a priori, like logic. This was strenuously denied by the empirical philosophers, who maintained that experience {{was as much}} the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of arithmetic as of our knowledge of geography. They maintained that by the repeated experience of seeing two things and two other things, and finding that altogether they made four things, we were led by induction {{to the conclusion that}} two things and two other things would always make four things altogether. If, however, this were the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge that two and two are four, we should proceed differently, in persuading ourselves of its truth, from {{the way in which we}} do actually proceed. In fact, a certain number of instances are needed to make us think of two abstractly, rather than of two coins or two books or two people, or two of any other specified kind. But as soon as we are able to divest our thoughts of irrelevant particularity, we become able to see the general principle that two and two are four; any one instance is seen to be typical, and the examination of other instances becomes unnecessary.(1) ...|$|E

60|$|Thus it {{cannot be}} {{concealed}} that, on July 29 (granting Letter IV {{to have a}} basis), the plot, as far as Logan knew, was ‘in the air.’ If Fastcastle was {{to be used by}} the conspirators, it must have been taken in the rough, on the chance that it was provided, or that Gowrie could bring his own supplies from Dirleton by sea. This extreme vagueness undeniably throws great doubt on Logan’s part in the plot; Letter IV, if genuine, being the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> perplexity. But, if it is not genuine, that is, in substance, there is only rumour, later to be discussed, to hint that Logan was in any way connected with Gowrie.|$|E
