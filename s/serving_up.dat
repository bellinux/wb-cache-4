25|$|Although {{in the end}} {{nobody was}} indicted for the {{harassment}} of Cooper, the wider campaign of criminal activity was successfully prosecuted by the United States Government. Mary Sue Hubbard, Jane Kember, Henning Heldt, Morris Budlong, Duke Snider, Dick Weigand, Greg Willardson, Mitchell Hermann and Cindy Raymond were indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} on charges of theft, burglary, conspiracy, and other crimes.

25|$|Worcestershire's fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar had a {{field day}} despite <b>serving</b> <b>up</b> no balls on the first day at Northampton, but that was only the first day, and Northamptonshire came back to win the game. The match had started well enough for the hosts Northamptonshire, but a menacing spell from the Pakistani fast bowler reduced them from 150 for 2 to 173 for 8 - Matt Mason helping out with two wickets as well. Shoaib {{finished}} with six for 47, including twenty runs conceded due to no-balls - while Monty Panesar and Jason Brown rescued the hosts to 299 with a last-wicket stand of 62. Young wicket-keeper Steve Davies then made a career-best 95 in his sixth first-class game, which helped lift Worcestershire to 381, a lead of 82.|$|E
25|$|England started {{positively}} in reply, taking 39 off {{the first}} 34 legal deliveries (while Gillespie served up four wides and a no-ball in his first over), but Glenn McGrath took revenge by <b>serving</b> <b>up</b> a good yorker to have Marcus Trescothick bowled for 16. Two overs later, Andrew Strauss went in identical fashion, and Vaughan and Collingwood were forced to consolidate. They did, although in jerky fashion, Collingwood eventually falling to Kasprowicz and Flintoff mistiming a hit off Hogg to see England into a spot of bother at 119 for 4 after 27.2 overs, with Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Edges and runs followed, but when England lost Vaughan and Geraint Jones in quick succession, and were 93 short with only 74 deliveries left, it looked dark for England. Pietersen then upped the ante. Smashing runs to all corners, especially off Gillespie, he reached his fifty off 46 balls, and then took 19 more deliveries to bring up an additional 41 runs – although surviving an extremely close run-out decision near the 40th over. A level headed 7 not out from Lewis – making up somewhat for his bowling – ensured the English were home by three wickets and 15 deliveries – and the Australians had only managed two points from their first two matches, while England had gained 11.|$|E

500|$|The {{book has}} also been {{attacked}} {{for the quality of}} its journalism and research. The author admitted that much of the material came from the Internet and discharged the burden of proof by claiming that it was for the American government to refute the allegations rather than for him to prove them. This produced anger among authors using more conventional journalistic methods: [...] "The line in the sand is when respectable media and publishers start <b>serving</b> <b>up</b> fiction as truth," [...] was the response of Oliver Schrom (whose study of the 9/11 attacks pointed the finger at intelligence failures, rather than a more spectacular claim of CIA complicity).|$|E

Critics commented on the summer scenery of the video. Gil Kaufman from Billboard said that the group is [...] "dancing and <b>serving</b> <b>up</b> their best surfside poses while singing the reggae-tinged song on a picturesque beach". Commenting on the video's integration of the track's themes, Anna Gaca of Spin wrote the video [...] "takes the song's reggae-tinged vibe to its natural conclusion with a sun-kissed, oceanside party and, naturally, an appearance by guest star Fetty Wap".|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} critics.

Chrysta Cherrie, writing for Allmusic, gave the album a positive {{three and a half}} stars out of five and credited the album for its maturity and progression from the band from their debut, saying: [...] "Wildlife is the best of both worlds, <b>serving</b> <b>up</b> the energy and power fans have come to expect from La Dispute, but showing a maturity beyond the band’s years." [...] Joshua Khan on Blare Magazine gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 star rating, describing the album's four monologues as [...] "tormented progressive rock outbursts" [...] and describes the instrumentation as bringing character to the vocals and lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Julia Pistor, the film's co-producer, {{said that}} {{although}} Nickelodeon (which owns the SpongeBob trademark) wanted to sell character-themed backpacks, lunch boxes and wristwatches it respected Hillenburg's integrity and gave him control of merchandising. Hillenburg {{had no problem with}} candy and ice cream tie-ins, Pistor said (because of the treats' simplicity), but he had issues with fast food tie-ins; according to him, the latter was [...] "full of hidden additives." [...] Pistor said, [...] "The trouble is that you can't go out with animated films without a fast-food tie-in People don't take you seriously." [...] Hillenburg replied, [...] "Yeah, well, my take on that is that we shouldn't do that We didn't want to suddenly become the people <b>serving</b> <b>up</b> food that's not that good for you - especially kids. We work with Burger King, and they make toys and watches. But to actually take the step of pushing the food, that's crossing the line. I don't want to be the Pied Piper of fast food." ...|$|E

500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. Due {{to the success of the}} show, the New York Daily News reported that Nickelodeon picked up SpongeBob SquarePants for an eighth season on December 14, 2009, during the year which the show was celebrating its tenth anniversary on television. Brown Johnson, president of animation for Nickelodeon and MTVN Kids & Family Group, announced the renewal of the series. The season was ordered with 26 episodes, that would bring the total number of episodes for the series to 178. With its episode count of 178, SpongeBob SquarePants surpassed Rugrats in episodes to claim the spot as the Nickelodeon series with most episodes. Johnson said [...] "After a decade on our air, SpongeBob has emerged as one of the most beloved and popular characters in television history.

500|$|Simon Eden of Cross Rhythms {{gave the}} album ten {{out of ten}} squares, saying [...] "With 'Lifesong' being officially [...] second release, the {{pressure}} is on {{to see if they can}} deliver. The simple answer is quite probably yes as the band use a refreshing formula that challenges the Church instead of <b>serving</b> <b>up</b> milk and cookies". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave it three out of five stars, opining [...] "Overall, Lifesong is musically an assortment of experimentation and familiarity, as the band continues to offer songs with relatable messages to the church body. Frontman and chief songwriter Mark Hall's strained, shouting-style vocals is [...] still an acquired taste, along with his straightforward and often simplistic lyrics, but Lifesong is a noteworthy second chapter in an already impressive career for this young band". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting [...] " [...] comes from the school of U2-influenced modern-worship music, so its songs predictably build to sweeping choruses and dramatic climaxes. The band's message is more distinctive, calling out the [...] "happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples" [...] to offer themselves to the lonely, the grieving, the desperate".|$|E

Shut Your Mouth featured little improvement to the commentary, which was then removed completely from Here Comes the Pain. WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW received a more positive review than previous games, as GameShark stated that it was [...] "a wonderful new edition to the SmackDown! family, <b>serving</b> <b>up</b> slick graphics, vastly enhanced gameplay, and lots of other bells and whistles that make the whole package shine." [...] WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 received a positive review and a 9.2/10 rating by IGN due to the additions of matches, the General Manager mode, and the ability to defend championships in exhibition mode. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 {{received more}} negative reviews due to lack of an appealing season mode and little improvement of features, with the exceptions of the [...] "Ultimate Control moves," [...] "Struggle system," [...] and the ECW Extreme Rules matches.|$|E

500|$|Town Point Park in {{downtown}} plays host {{to a wide}} variety of annual events from early spring through late fall. Harborfest, the region's largest annual festival, celebrated its thirtieth anniversary in 2006. It is held during the first weekend of June and celebrates the region's proximity and attachment to the water. The Parade of Sail (numerous tall sailing ships from around the world form in line and sail past downtown before docking at the marina), music concerts, regional food, and a large fireworks display highlight this three-day festival. Bayou Boogaloo and Cajun Food Festival, a celebration of the Cajun people and culture, had small beginnings. This three-day festival during the third week of June has become one of the largest in the region and, in addition to <b>serving</b> <b>up</b> Cajun cuisine, also features Cajun music. Norfolk's Fourth of July celebration of American independence contains a spectacular fireworks display and a special Navy reenlistment ceremony. The Norfolk Jazz Festival, though smaller by comparison to some of the big city jazz festivals, still manages to attract the country's top jazz performers. It is held in August. The Town Point Virginia Wine Festival has become a showcase for Virginia-produced wines and has enjoyed increasing success over the years. Virginia's burgeoning wine industry has become noted both within the United States and on an international level. The festival has grown with the industry. Wines can be sampled and then purchased by the bottle and/or case directly from the winery kiosks. This event takes place during the third weekend of October.
