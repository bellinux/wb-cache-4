Previous studies have distinguished three types of layer 5 pyramids in S 1 : tall-tufted, tall-simple, and <b>short.</b> <b>Layer</b> 5 pyramidal neurons were retrogradely labeled from several known targets: contralateral S 1, superior colliculus, and thalamus. The complete dendritic arbors of labeled cells were reconstructed to allow for unambiguous classifi cation of cell type. We confi rmed that the tall-tufted pyramids project to the superior colliculus and thalamus and that <b>short</b> <b>layer</b> 5 pyramidal neurons project to contralateral cortex, as previously described. We found that tall-simple pyramidal neurons contribute to corticocortical connections. Axonal reconstructions show that corticocortical projection neurons have a large superfi cial axonal arborization locally, while the subcortically projecting neurons limit axonal arbors to the deep layers. Furthermore, reconstructions of local axons suggest that tall-simple cell axons have extensive lateral spread while those of the short pyramids are more columnar. These differences were revealed by the ability to completely label dendritic and axonal arbors in vivo and have not been apparent in previous studies using labeling in brain slices...|$|E

In particular, we reduce their 11 -stage computation -H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C- into an 8 -stage computation {{of the form}} -H-C-CZ-P-H-P-CZ-C-. We show arguments in support of using -CZ- stages over the -C- stages: not only the use of -CZ- stages allows a <b>shorter</b> <b>layered</b> expression, but -CZ- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement compared to the -C- stages. Relying on the 8 -stage decomposition we develop a two-qubit depth-(14 n- 4) implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate library P,H,CNOT, executable in the LNN architecture, improving best previously known depth- 25 n circuit, also executable in the LNN architecture.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} manufacturing process of a carbon fibre composite bicycle crank by using the compressionmoulding (CM) technology. Bulk moulding compound (B. M.

The crank body is treated as a composite sandwichstructure, where the interior is a <b>short</b> fibre <b>layer</b> (B. M.

The composite material was hot pressed and manufactured into crank body to reduce most of its weight.

Its characteristics include base composite material, interface ring, hollow square inner wall and exterior projected rib. The inner reinforcing layer provides the maximum bending strength and to reduce stress concentration of themetallic interface ring- to-crank attachment. The FEM model was then calibrated {{on the basis of}} the constituent material characterization and the definition of suitable boundary conditions in order to achieve a reliable simulation of the experimental tests and optimum design. Several designs of composite cranks were given to demonstrate the feasibility and applications of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} light-cured composite resins {{are related to the}} material composition, but also vary according to the light-source characteristics used for polymerization. In this study we followed the compressive strength variation for a light-cured composite resin according to the time of exposure to the curing light. With that end in view, 18 test pieces were made from a light-cured hybrid composite material (Filtek Z 250). The test pieces where then submitted to a compressive force by a {{mechanical properties}} universal testing machine. Our results didn’t show an increase of the compressive strength according to the light-curing time increasing, than only in the light-curing time limit indicated by the manufacturer. A longer light-curing time may induce a shrinkage polymerization growth with the formation of internal tensions inside the material. The composite materials light-curing in <b>short</b> <b>layers</b> {{as long as there is}} indicated by the manufacturer seems to be a safer method to make the best from a resin qualities, then an exaggerated increase of the light-curing time. The light-curing is indicated to be done in the direction of the compressive forces. To confirm this supposition other mechanical tests are also necessary.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we improve the layered {{implementation}} of arbitrary stabilizer circuits introduced by Aaronson and Gottesman in Phys. Rev. A 70 (052328), 2004 : {{to implement a}} general stabilizer circuit, we reduce their 11 -stage computation -H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C- over the gate set consisting of Hadamard, Controlled-NOT, and Phase gates, into a 7 -stage computation of the form -C-CZ-P-H-P-CZ-C-. We show arguments in support of using -CZ- stages over the -C- stages: not only the use of -CZ- stages allows a <b>shorter</b> <b>layered</b> expression, but -CZ- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement compared to the -C- stages. Based on this decomposition, we develop a two-qubit gate depth-$(14 n{-} 4) $ implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate library {H, P, CNOT}, executable in the LNN architecture, improving best previously known depth-$ 25 n$ circuit, also executable in the LNN architecture. Our constructions rely on Bruhat decomposition of the symplectic group and on folding arbitrarily long sequences of the form $($-P-C-$) ^m$ into a 3 -stage computation -P-CZ-C-.

This reduction is based on the Bruhat decomposition of the symplectic group. This result also implies a new normal form for stabilizer circuits. We show that a circuit in this normal form is optimal in the number of Hadamard gates used. We also show that the normal form has an asymptotically optimal number of parameters.

[...] "Dreamland" [...] and [...] "The Tenth World", featuring Chaka Khan on backing vocals, were percussion-dominated tracks. Other songs continued the jazz-rock-folk collisions of Hejira. Mitchell also revived [...] "Jericho", written years earlier (a version is found on her 1974 live album) but never recorded in a studio setting. Don Juan's Reckless Daughter was released in December 1977. The album received mixed reviews but still sold relatively well, peaking at No. 25 in the US and going gold within three months. The cover of the album created its own controversy: Mitchell was featured in several photographs, including one where she was disguised as a black man, wearing a curly afro wig, a white suit and vest, and dark sunglasses. The character, whom she called Art Nouveau, was based on a pimp who, she says, once complimented her while walking down an LA street – and was a symbol of her turn toward jazz and streetwise lyrics.|$|R
