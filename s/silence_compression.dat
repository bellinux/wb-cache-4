50|$|G.729 {{has been}} {{extended}} in Annex B (G.729b) which provides a <b>silence</b> <b>compression</b> method that enables a voice activity detection (VAD) module. It is used to detect voice activity in the signal. It also includes a discontinuous transmission (DTX) module which decides on updating the background noise parameters for non speech (noisy frames). It uses 2-byte Silence Insertion Descriptor (SID) frames transmitted to initiate comfort noise generation (CNG). If transmission is stopped, and the link goes quiet because of no speech, the receiving side might assume that the link has been cut. By inserting comfort noise, analog hiss is simulated digitally during silence to assure the receiver that the link is active and operational.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{identifies the}} problems encountered in transmitting {{voice over the}} Internet and proposes approaches to solve these problems. The current Internet is not very suitable for transmitting real-time data because its underlying protocols and switches were only engineered to transmit non-real time data. The problems posed by voice over the Internet are studied by conducting a series of experiments. These problems caused by high loss, large delay, and jitter will seriously affect the transmission quality. A good design thus needs to combine different components that solve these problems together. <b>Silence</b> removal and <b>compression</b> is used to reduce bandwidth usage. Jitter buffers are used to smooth the burstiness in the received stream caused by the network. To conceal loss, we investigate existing methods and propose two new nonredundant reconstruction algorithms based on a simple but effective average reconstruction scheme.

40|$|Speech signal {{processing}} for voice communications can be characterised {{in terms of}} <b>silence</b> <b>compression,</b> noise reduction, and speech compression. The limit in the channel bandwidth of voice communication systems requires efficient compression of speech and silence signals while retaining the voice quality. <b>Silence</b> <b>compression</b> by means of both voice activity detection (VAD) and comfort noise generation could present transparent speech-quality while substantially lowering the transmission bit-rate, since pause regions between talk spurts do not include any voice information. Thus, this thesis proposes smoothed likelihood ratio-based VAD, designed {{on the basis of}} a behavioural analysis and improvement of a statistical model-based voice activity detector. Input speech could exhibit noisy signals, which could make the voice communication fatiguing and less intelligible. This task can be alleviated by noise reduction as a preprocessor for speech coding. Noise characteristics in speech enhancement are adapted typically during the pause regions classified by a voice activity detector. However, VAD errors could lead to over- or under- estimation of the noise statistics. Thus, this thesis proposes mixed decision-based noise adaptation based on a integration of soft and hard decision-based methods, defined with the speech presence uncertainty and VAD result, respectively. At low bit-rate speech coding, the sinusoidal model has been widely applied because of its good nature exploiting the phase redundancy of speech signals. Its performance, however, can be severely smeared by mis-estimation of the pitch. Thus, this thesis proposes a robust pitch estimation technique based on the autocorrelation of spectral amplitudes. Another important parameter in sinusoidal speech coding is the spectral magnitude of the LP-residual signal. It is, however, not easy to directly quantise the magnitudes because the dimensions of the spectral vectors are variable from frame to frame depending on the pitch. To alleviate this problem, this thesis proposes mel-scale-based dimension conversion, which converts the spectral vectors to a fixed dimension based on mel-scale warping. A predictive coding scheme is also employed in order to exploit the inter-frame redundancy between the spectral vectors. Experimental results show that each proposed technique is suitable for enhancing speech quality for voice communications. Furthermore, an improved speech coder incorporating the proposed techniques is developed. The vocoder gives speech quality comparable to TIA/EIA IS- 127 for noisy speech whilst operating at lower than half the bit-rate of the reference coder.
