40|$|The oceans {{comprise}} 70 % of {{the surface}} area of our planet, contain some of the world’s richest natural resources and {{are one of the}} most significant drivers of global climate patterns. As the marine environment continues to increase in importance as both an essential resource reservoir and facilitator of global change, it is apparent that to find long-term sustainable solutions for our use of the sea and its resources and thus to engage in a <b>sustainable</b> <b>blue</b> <b>economy,</b> an integrated interdisciplinary approach is needed. As a result, interdisciplinary working is proliferating. We report here our experiences of forming interdisciplinary teams (marine ecologists, ecophysiologists, social scientists, environmental economists and environmental law specialists) to answer questions pertaining to the effects of anthropogenic-driven global change on the sustainability of resource use from the marine environment, and thus to transport ideas outwards from disciplinary confines. We use a framework derived from the literature on interdisciplinarity to enable us to explore processes of knowledge integration in two ongoing research projects, based on analyses of the purpose, form and degree of knowledge integration within each project. These teams were initially focused around a graduate program, explicitly designed for interdisciplinary training across the natural and social sciences, at the Gothenburg Centre for Marine Research at the University of Gothenburg, thus allowing us to reflect on our own experiences within the context of other multi-national, interdisciplinary graduate training and associated research programs...|$|E

Winder and Le Heron (2017) advocate for geographers to engage directly and critically with the <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy</b> and to remove the ‘disciplinary framings’ from which the notion of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy</b> has emerged. While endorsing Winder and Le Heron’s call for human geography to engage with debates about the <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy,</b> I argue that the lack of critical engagement within the geographical community with respect to the <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy</b> has not been imposed by disciplinary framings. Instead I ask Winder and Le Heron to clarify how a social and cultural critique of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy</b> will expand the current knowledge base of our oceans and seas. I also ask whether a critique of extensive literature within economics, planning and governance on the ocean resource have been the building blocks for the critical analysis of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy</b> provided by Winder and Le Heron...|$|R
40|$|The World Ocean {{presents}} many opportunities, {{with the}} <b>blue</b> <b>economy</b> projected {{to at least}} double {{in the next two}} decades. However, capitalizing on these opportunities presents significant challenges and a multi-sectoral, integrated approach to managing marine socio-ecological systems will be required to achieve the full benefits projected for the <b>blue</b> <b>economy.</b> Integrated ecosystem assessments have been identified as the best means of delivering the information upon which marine resource management decisions can be made. By their nature, these assessments are inter-disciplinary, but to date have mostly focused on the natural sciences. Inclusion of human dimensions into integrated ecosystem assessments has been lagging, but is fundamental. Here we report on a Symposium, and the articles emmanating from it that are included in this Theme Set, that address how to more effectively include human dimensions into integrated ecosystem assessments. We provide an introduction to each of the main symposium topics (governance, scenarios, indicators, participatory processes, and case studies), highlight the works that emerged from the symposium, and identify key areas in which more work is required. There {{is still a long way}} to go before we see end-to-end integrated ecosystem assessments inclusive of all the major current and potential ocean use sectors that also encompass multiple aspects of human dimensions. Nonetheless, it is also clear that progress is being made and we are developing tools and approaches, including the human dimension, that can inform management and position us to take advantage of the multi-sectoral opportunities of <b>sustainable</b> <b>blue</b> growth...|$|R

At the European level there is strong political pressure to enhance the growth of maritime economy sectors. The European Union has developed the Integrated Maritime Policy to support the sustainable development of the seas and oceans.

Doing so might produce a different conceptualisation of the <b>blue</b> <b>economy,</b> while concurrently establishing new challenges for blue economic practices. In this commentary, I focus on three key areas: 1) the ontological separation of land and sea and the conceptualisation of ‘marine space’; 2) the ‘liveliness’ of oceans; and 3) practical possibilities for <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy</b> policies to draw on and engage with ‘wet ontologies’.

This {{research}} is part of a UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office initiative to develop a roadmap for the <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy</b> in Small Island Developing States (SIDS).  The research first considers the unique characteristics of SIDS and the continuing difficulties and challenges of traditional methods of capture fisheries management. The key features of a <b>blue</b> <b>economy</b> approach to fisheries management are then articulated, highlighting what is ‘new’ about the <b>blue</b> <b>economy</b> approach to management.   The potential benefits that could result from adopting such an approach are considered. Case studies of the Maldives, Seychelles and Fiji show how these SIDS have adopted many <b>blue</b> <b>economy</b> strategies and associated activities. The research argues that in order for capture fisheries to contribute to enhanced economic and social benefits, while minimising environmental degradation and adapting to climate change, three mutually reinforcing and linked <b>blue</b> <b>economy</b> strategies should be: 1.     A more integrated approach by increasing participation, transparency, and partnerships both within the sector, and with other sectors. 2.     Minimising negative environmental impacts and carbon footprint of the fisheries by improving waste management, reduced emissions and a shift from harmful subsidies towards sustainability incentives. 3.     Increased value addition through technical and other innovations that increase business productivity, reduce waste, and get more from a limited resource. A wide range of activities and outputs are proposed, which when coupled with capacity development and additional support to ensure enabling conditions, will deliver these ‘blue economy’ strategies...|$|R
