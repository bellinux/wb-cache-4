In this study, we characterize {{the function of the}} novel gene <b>strim</b> 1, which encodes a tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein, that adds to the list of genes constituting the epithelial-mesenchymal signaling network. We report that <b>strim</b> 1 is expressed in ectoderm regions adjacent to the bilateral clusters of PMCs and that its misexpression leads to severe skeletal abnormalities.

Blastomere transplantation experiments establish that the defects in PMC patterning, number and skeletal growth depend upon <b>strim</b> 1 misexpression in ectoderm cells. Furthermore, clonal expression of <b>strim</b> 1 into knocked down embryos locally restores skeletogenesis. We also provide evidence that the Otp and Pax 2 / 5 / 8 regulators, as well as FGFA, but not VEGF, ligand act downstream to <b>strim</b> 1 in ectoderm cells, and that <b>strim</b> 1 triggers the expression of the PMC marker sm 30, an ectoderm-signaling dependent gene.

40|$|The {{building}} of the skeleton in the indirect developing sea urchin embryo is a complex morphogenetic process that is executed by the Primary Mesenchyme Cells or PMCs (Ettensohn et al, 1997; Wilt 2002). It {{is well known that}} the PMCs acquire most of the positional and temporal information from the overlying ectoderm for skeletal initiation and growth (Armstrong 1993; Cavalieri et al, 2003; Röttinger et al, 2008). In this study, we analyze the function of a novel gene, encoding for a tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein denoted <b>strim</b> 1, that adds up to the list of genes constituting the epithelial-mesenchymal signaling network. We show that <b>strim</b> 1 is expressed in ectoderm regions adjacent to the bilateral clusters of PMCs. <b>Strim</b> 1 misexpression causes the number of PMCs to double and leads to skeletal abnormalities. By micromere transplantations, we establish that skeletal defects depend upon <b>strim</b> 1 misexpression in ectoderm cells. Reciprocally, knock-down of <b>strim</b> 1 function abrogates PMC migration and blocks skeletogenesis. Identical phenotype is shown by chimeras in which <b>strim</b> 1 function is blocked selectively in the ectoderm. We also show that clonal expression of <b>strim</b> 1 into ectoderm cells from knocked-down embryos restores the correct skeletogenic program. Finally, we report that <b>strim</b> 1 triggers the expression of the ectodermspecific gene pax 2 / 5 / 8, and the PMC marker sm 30 (an ectoderm signaling dependent gene). We conclude that <b>strim</b> 1 function is able to elicit specific gene expression both in ectoderm cells and PMCs to guide the biomineralization during morphogenesis.

40|$|Intriguing {{studies suggest}} that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) tend to act in cis with {{neighboring}} protein-coding genes. Based on this notion, we assessed whether lncRNAs originate from adjacent genomic regions of selected protein-coding genes, such as early-H 2 A histone and <b>strim</b> 1, that play important functions during development of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Downregulation of H 2 A expression relies on the sns 5 chromatin insulator placed at the 3 '-end of H 2 A. Northern blot hybridization show that a lncRNA (of 600 nt), not overlapping with the H 2 A mRNA, is transcribed from sns 5, following H 2 A expression. The <b>strim</b> 1 locus encodes the first echinoderm TRIM-containing factor which functional role has been characterized. By RT-PCR and gene-transfer analysis we found that a lncRNA originates from the <b>strim</b> 1 gene promoter, and that its transcription positively correlates with that of <b>strim</b> 1. Our preliminary {{findings are consistent with}} the notion that lncRNAs might be important regulators for developmental processes...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{wealth of}} genomic data has {{confirmed}} that bilaterians {{as simple as}} nematodes and as complex as humans use the same basic toolkit of transcription factors and signaling molecules to process spatial and temporal information during development (1, 2). Among these regulators, the TRIM/RBCC (Tripartite motif/RING-Bbox-Coiled Coil) family {{represents one of the}} largest classes of putative E 3 ubiquitin ligases that play essential roles in cell cycle regulation and development (3). It consists of rapidly evolving genes, identified in eukaryotic organisms (4, 5). In the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus we have identified a locus containing two copies, probably originated from a duplication event, of a gene coding for a TRIM-containing factor that we named <b>strim</b> (sea urchin TRIM). Both genes consist of a single 1839 bp-long exon and share extensive sequence similarity. As embryogenesis occurs, zygotic transcription of <b>strim</b> starts at the very early cleavage and reaches its maximum at the morula stage. From the gastrula stage onward, <b>strim</b> expression fades out and very low amounts of mRNA are detectable, by RT-PCR, at prism stage. Very interestingly, whole mount in situ hybridization showed that <b>strim</b> transcripts are asymmetrically localized in the embryo, being restricted exclusively to the oral ectoderm. These results could suggest a role for <b>strim</b> in cell specification of the oral domain...|$|R

Roughly 625 lb of leaves were harvested per hectare, six times per year. The leaves were dried for half a day, then chopped into small pieces with a <b>strimmer</b> and sprinkled {{with a small amount}} of powdered cement (replacing sodium carbonate from former times). Several hundred pounds of this mixture were soaked in 50 gal of gasoline for a day, then the gasoline was removed and the leaves were pressed for remaining liquid, after which they could be discarded. Then battery acid (weak sulfuric acid) was used, one bucket per 25 kg of leaves, to create a phase separation in which the cocaine free base in the gasoline was acidified and extracted into a few buckets of [...] "murky-looking smelly liquid". Once powdered caustic soda was added to this, the cocaine precipitated and could be removed by filtration through a cloth. The resulting material, when dried, was termed pasta and sold by the farmer. The 3750 pound yearly harvest of leaves from a hectare produced 2.5 kg of pasta, approximately 40-60% cocaine. Repeated recrystallization from solvents, producing pasta lavada and eventually crystalline cocaine were performed at specialized laboratories after the sale.|$|E

40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} TRIM (TRIpartite Motif) super-family {{represents one}} of the largest classes of putative E 3 ubiquitin ligases involved in several processes, including epigenetic control of development and disease. In the post-genomic era, new approaches allow genome-wide studies of gene family. In particular, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the TRIM repertoire in selected sea urchin species. By combining iterations of ab initio predictions and pairwise comparative methods, we first retrieved the full complement of TRIM genes in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, whose full genome sequence was available. Interestingly, such a DNA sequence set includes not previously classified, echinoderm-specific, TRIM genes as well as multiple copies of known ones. We also retrieved a landscape of cDNA sequences from staged EST libraries, indicating that most of these genes are actively transcribed during development. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced proteins, using set of TRIMs from various species, revealed a degree of genetic variation between species. Worth of mention, we predicted the occurrence of transposition events involving some of these genes, according with the documented rapid evolution of this family. Next, we adopted heuristic algorithms and post-processing steps to investigate the evolutionarily distant Paracentrotus lividus, Allocentrotus fragilis and Lytechinus variegatus genomes, whose sequencing projects are actually in progress. We assembled partial pools of TRIM genes and specifically associated them to EST-derived cDNA sequences.
