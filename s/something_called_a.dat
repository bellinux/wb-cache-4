25|$|The {{general idea}} behind hydropathy during the 1800s {{was to be}} able to induce <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> crisis. The {{thinking}} was that water invaded any cracks, wounds, or imperfections in the skin, which were filled with impure fluids. health was considered to be the natural state of the body, and filling these spaces with pure water, would flush the impurities out, which would rise {{to the surface of the}} skin, producing pus. The event of this pus emerging was called a crisis, and was achieved through a multitude of methods. These methods included techniques such as sweating, the plunging bath, the half bath, the head bath, the sitting bath, and the douche bath. All of these were ways to gently expose the patient to cold water in different ways.|$|E
500|$|Fettel {{is located}} {{by means of}} a {{satellite}} tracking device and hunted by F.E.A.R. and Delta Force over several locations. While the villain evades capture by the special forces, the player witnesses unexplained, and occasionally life-threatening, paranormal phenomena, including hallucinations that frequently afflict him, all of which are centered on a red-dressed little girl named Alma (Melissa Roberts). Laptops found {{in the course of the}} mission, remotely hacked by Commissioner Betters, provide details regarding the background story; the player learns how Fettel was raised to become a telepathic military commander, that he is the son of Alma, who is described as being a powerful psychic as part of Project Origin,. The files mention <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Synchronicity Event", in which Alma telepathically linked with Fettel when he was ten years old, despite her being in a coma, and which is said to have resulted in several deaths. The files also mention the existence of another child of Alma, who was born before Fettel.|$|E
500|$|Unconnected {{with the}} Pynchon case, DCI Wilder Blanks (Walker) begins seeing visions {{related to the}} Stoics, [...] "a group {{dedicated}} {{to the destruction of}} magic" [...] in favor of [...] "reason, rationality, and [...] science"a laughable prospect, but one about which they are deadly serious. [...] Twelve years previously (1999), the Stoics committed a series of murders to further their cause, but have neither been seen nor heard of since. [...] Blanks retrieves DS Mira Barkley (Channing) from her dissatisfying work in another precinct to help with the Stoics; Barkley was his partner during the previous Stoics case. [...] Blanks partners Barkley with rookie detective Jimmy Travers (Long) due to the latter's potential as an intuitive savant. [...] Investigating a nuisance case in an apartment building, Barkley and Travers unwittingly allow the Stoics access to murder an otherwise protected tenant, a college professor of [...] "advanced magical engineering and biology with an emphasis on power plant design." [...] In the dénouement, it is revealed that the Stoics use [...] "mechanical, rather than 'true' magic" [...] which nothing in their world can defend against; the professor was killed using the Stoics' means, <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> bullet.|$|E

50|$|However, {{even with}} a {{theoretically}} perfect sensor that could capture and distinguish all colors at each photosite, Moiré and other artifacts could still appear. This is an unavoidable consequence of any system that samples an otherwise continuous signal at discrete intervals or locations. For this reason, most photographic digital sensor incorporates <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>an</b> optical low-pass filter (OLPF) or an anti-aliasing (AA) filter. This is typically a thin layer {{directly in front of}} the sensor, and works by effectively blurring any potentially problematic details that are finer than the resolution of the sensor.|$|R
2500|$|To {{add another}} level of complexity, in mammals there are three Fringe GlcNAc-transferases, named lunatic fringe, manic fringe, and radical fringe. [...] These enzymes are {{responsible}} for <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "fringe effect" [...] on notch signaling. [...] If Fringe adds a GlcNAc to the O-fucose sugar then the subsequent addition of a galactose and sialic acid will occur. [...] In {{the presence of this}} tetrasaccharide, notch signals strongly when it interacts with the Delta ligand, but has markedly inhibited signaling when interacting with the Jagged ligand. The means by which this addition of sugar inhibits signaling through one ligand, and potentiates signaling through another is not clearly understood.|$|E
2500|$|Foster cites his {{interest}} in bass guitar as coming from hearing Duane Eddy's song [...] "Rebel Rouser" [...] for the first time. [...] "A school friend played the 78 on his parents' big radiogram and it just filled the room with this powerful sound. It {{was one of those}} rare moments when your soul is touched and I realised that the deep sound behind Eddy's guitar came from <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> bass guitar, though I didn't see one until I watched Jet Harris on TV. So I bought an acoustic guitar for £2 and figured that I'd get that bass sound if I just tuned the strings down an octave, but of course it just made a pointless, flapping noise." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Buddhism, Anatta (Pali, Sanskrit cognate An-atman) is {{the concept}} that in human beings and living creatures, there is no [...] "eternal, {{essential}} and absolute <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> soul, self or atman". Buddhist philosophy rejects the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (maya), asserting instead the theory of [...] "no-self" [...] and [...] "no-soul". Most schools of Buddhism, from its earliest days, have denied {{the existence of the}} [...] "self, soul" [...] in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In contrast to Advaita, which describes knowing one's own soul as identical with Brahman as the path to nirvana, in its soteriological themes Buddhism has defined nirvana as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has [...] "no self, no soul".|$|E
5000|$|Tsongkhapa, {{the founder}} of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, argued that the Prāsaṅgika {{position}} allowed for the postulation of <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>an</b> [...] "act's cessation" [...] (las zhig pal) which persists and is in fact a substance (rdzas or dngos po, S. vastu), and which explains the connection between cause and result. Gorampa, an important philosopher of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, accused Tsongkhapa of a doctrinal innovation not legitimately grounded in Candrakīrti's work, and one which amounted to little more than a (non-Buddhist) Vaiśeṣika concept. Gelugpa scholars offered defenses of the idea.|$|R

6000|$|It {{would be}} like {{counting}} the bacteria of an infection to trace how ideas of insubordination came drifting into Sir Isaac's Paradise. The epidemic is in the air. There is no Tempter nowadays, no definitive apple. The disturbing force has grown subtler, blows in now like a draught, creeps and gathers like the dust,--a disseminated serpent. Sir Isaac brought home his young, beautiful and rather crumpled and astonished Eve and by all his standards he was entitled to be happy ever afterwards. He knew of one danger, but against {{that he was very}} watchful. Never once for six long years did she have a private duologue with another male. But Mudie and Sir Jesse Boot sent parcels to the house unchecked, the newspaper drifted in not even censored: the nurses who guided Ellen through the essential incidents of a feminine career talked of <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "movement."

6000|$|I {{have already}} had {{occasion}} to mention, indeed I have quoted, a certain high-browed gentleman living at Highbury, wearing a golden pince-nez and writing {{for the most part}} in that beautiful room, the library of the Reform Club. There he wrestles with what he calls [...] "social problems" [...] in a bloodless but at times, I think one must admit, an extremely illuminating manner. He has a fixed idea that <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "collective intelligence" [...] is wanted in the world, which means in practice that you and I and everyone have to think about things frightfully hard and pool the results, and oblige ourselves to be shamelessly and persistently clear and truthful and support and respect (I suppose) a perfect horde of professors and writers and artists and ill-groomed difficult people, instead of using our brains in a moderate, sensible manner to play golf and bridge (pretending a sense of humour prevents our doing anything else with them) and generally taking life in a nice, easy, gentlemanly way, confound him! Well, this dome-headed monster of intellect alleges that Mr. Polly was unhappy entirely through that.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was within}} a few days of the holidays, the term-end examinations, and, more {{important}} still, the issue of the College paper which Beetle edited. He had been cajoled into that office by the blandishments of Stalky and McTurk and the extreme rigor of study law. Once installed, he discovered, as others have done before him, that his duty was to do the work while his friends criticized. Stalky christened it the [...] "Swillingford Patriot," [...] in pious memory of Sponge--and McTurk compared the output unfavorably with Ruskin and De Quincey. Only the Head took an interest in the publication, and his methods were peculiar. He gave Beetle the run of his brown-bound, tobacco-scented library; prohibiting nothing, recommending nothing. There Beetle found a fat arm-chair, a silver inkstand, and unlimited pens and paper. There were scores and scores of ancient dramatists; there were Hakluyt, his voyages; French translations of Muscovite authors called Pushkin and Lermontoff; little tales of a heady and bewildering nature, interspersed with unusual songs--Peacock was that writer's name; there was Borrow's [...] "Lavengro"; an odd theme, purporting to be a translation of <b>something,</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Ruba'iyat," [...] which the Head said was a poem not yet come to its own; there were hundreds of volumes of verse---Crashaw; Dryden; Alexander Smith; L. E. L.; Lydia Sigourney; Fletcher and a purple island; Donne; Marlowe's [...] "Faust [...] "; and--this made McTurk (to whom Beetle conveyed it) sheer drunk for three days--Ossian; [...] "The Earthly Paradise"; [...] "Atalanta in Calydon"; and Rossetti--to name only a few. Then the Head, drifting in under pretense of playing censor to the paper, would read here a verse and here another of these poets, opening up avenues. And, slow breathing, with half-shut eyes above his cigar, would he speak of great men living, and journals, long dead, founded in their riotous youth; of years when all the planets were little new-lit stars trying to find their places in the uncaring void, and he, the Head, knew them as young men know one another. So the regular work went to the dogs, Beetle being full of other matters and meters, hoarded in secret and only told to McTurk of an afternoon, on the sands, walking high and disposedly round the wreck of the Armada galleons, shouting and declaiming against the long-ridged seas.|$|E

60|$|As {{will be seen}} later on, Pygmalion needs, not a preface, but a sequel, which I have {{supplied}} in its due place. The English have {{no respect}} for their language, and will not teach their children to speak it. They spell it so abominably that no man can teach himself what it sounds like. It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him. German and Spanish are accessible to foreigners: English is not accessible even to Englishmen. The reformer England needs today is an energetic phonetic enthusiast: that is why I have made such a one the hero of a popular play. There have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for many years past. When I {{became interested in the}} subject {{towards the end of the}} eighteen-seventies, Melville Bell was dead; but Alexander J. Ellis was still a living patriarch, with an impressive head always covered by a velvet skull cap, for which he would apologize to public meetings in a very courtly manner. He and Tito Pagliardini, another phonetic veteran, were men whom it was impossible to dislike. Henry Sweet, then a young man, lacked their sweetness of character: he was about as conciliatory to conventional mortals as Ibsen or Samuel Butler. His great ability as a phonetician (he was, I think, the best of them all at his job) would have entitled him to high official recognition, and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject, but for his Satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in general who thought more of Greek than of phonetics. Once, in the days when the Imperial Institute rose in South Kensington, and Joseph Chamberlain was booming the Empire, I induced the editor of a leading monthly review to commission an article from Sweet on the imperial importance of his subject. When it arrived, it contained nothing but a savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature whose chair Sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only. The article, being libelous, had to be returned as impossible; and I had to renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight. When I met him afterwards, for the first time for many years, I found to my astonishment that he, who had been a quite tolerably presentable young man, had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his personal appearance until he had become a sort of walking repudiation of Oxford and all its traditions. It must have been largely in his own despite that he was squeezed into <b>something</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> Readership of phonetics there. The future of phonetics rests probably with his pupils, who all swore by him; but nothing could bring the man himself into any sort of compliance with the university, to which he nevertheless clung by divine right in an intensely Oxonian way. I daresay his papers, if he has left any, include some satires that may be published without too destructive results fifty years hence. He was, I believe, not in the least an ill-natured man: very much the opposite, I should say; but he would not suffer fools gladly.|$|E
