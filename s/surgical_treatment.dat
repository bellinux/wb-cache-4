5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for <b>surgical</b> <b>treatment</b> to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris; <b>surgical</b> <b>treatment</b> was effective in these cases.|$|E

40|$|Corticosteroids {{are used}} {{incidentally}} in dentoalveolar <b>surgical</b> <b>treatments</b> to reduce possible postsurgical problems. Natural corticosteroids are {{produced in the}} adrenal cortex. Synthetic corticosteroids {{are known to have}} anti-inflammatory effects when they are administered in doses exceeding the normal physiological amounts which the body produces. Several contraindications and side effects are known. Administration of corticosteroids for dentoalveolar <b>surgical</b> <b>treatments</b> shows a reduction of edema and pain. When using corticosteroids, the risk of infections is not known to be higher than usual and the risk of adverse effects is minimal.

5|$|Superior {{mesenteric}} artery syndrome (SMA) is {{an extremely}} rare life-threatening condition that can either be congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and maywhen congenitalresult from a short suspensory muscle. One <b>surgical</b> <b>treatment</b> is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised <b>surgical</b> <b>treatment.</b> He thought a tumour unlikely, {{and expected to}} find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation {{there seemed to be}} an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the <b>surgical</b> <b>treatment</b> of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar {{excision}} (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no <b>surgical</b> <b>treatment</b> needed to be performed.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice {{for the first time in}} May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, <b>Surgical</b> <b>Treatment</b> of Coronary Arteriosclerosis.|$|E

5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with <b>surgical</b> <b>treatment</b> appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. <b>Surgical</b> <b>treatment</b> includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E
