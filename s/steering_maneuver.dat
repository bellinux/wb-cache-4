40|$|This paper {{presents}} analytical {{models to}} investigate the <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers</b> of planetary exploration rovers on loose soil. The models are based on wheel-soil interaction mechanics, or terramechanics, with which the traction and dis-turbance forces of a wheel are evaluated for various slip conditions. These traction forces are decomposed into the longitudinal and lateral directions of the wheel. The latter component, termed the side force has a major influ-ence in characterizing the <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers</b> of the rover. In this paper, the wheel-soil mechanics models are developed with {{particular attention to the}} side force, and the validity of the model is confirmed by using a single-wheel test bed. The motion profile of the entire rover is numerically evaluated by incorporating the wheel-soil models into an articulated multibody model that describes the motion dynamics of the vehicle’s body and chassis. Steering ma-neuvers are investigated under different steering angles by using a four-wheel rover test bed on simulated lunar soil (regolith simulant). The experimen-tal results are compared with the simulation results using the corresponding model parameters. The proposed wheel-and-vehicle model demonstrates bet-ter accuracy in predicting <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers</b> as compared to the conventional kinematics-based model. ...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing how {{a vehicle}} is steered and then {{alerting}} drivers {{in real time}} is of utmost importance to the vehicle and driver’s safety, since fatal accidents are often caused by dangerous vehicle maneuvers, such as rapid turns, fast lane-changes, etc. Existing solutions using video or in-vehicle sensors have been employed to identify dangerous vehicle maneuvers, but these methods {{are subject to the}} effects of the environmental elements or the hardware is very costly. In the mobile computing era, smartphones have become key tools to develop innovative mobile context-aware systems. In this paper, we present a recognition system for dangerous vehicle steering based on the low-cost sensors found in a smartphone: i. e., the gyroscope and the accelerometer. To identify vehicle <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers,</b> we focus on the vehicle’s angular velocity, which is characterized by gyroscope data from a smartphone mounted in the vehicle. Three <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers</b> including turns, lane-changes and U-turns are defined, and a vehicle angular velocity matching algorithm based on Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW) is adopted to recognize the vehicle steering. The results of extensive experiments show that the average accuracy rate of the presented recognition reaches 95 %, which implies that the proposed smartphone-based method is suitable for recognizing dangerous vehicle <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{pitchover}} maneuver {{consists of}} the rocket gimbaling its engine slightly to direct some of its thrust to one side. This force creates a net torque on the ship, turning {{it so that it}} no longer points vertically. The pitchover angle varies with the launch vehicle and is included in the rocket's inertial guidance system. For some vehicles it is only a few degrees, while other vehicles use relatively large angles (a few tens of degrees). After the pitchover is complete, the engines are reset to point straight down the axis of the rocket again. This small <b>steering</b> <b>maneuver</b> is the only time during an ideal gravity turn ascent that thrust must be used for purposes of steering. The pitchover maneuver serves two purposes. First, it turns the rocket slightly so that its flight path is no longer vertical, and second, it places the rocket on the correct heading for its ascent to orbit. After the pitchover, the rocket's angle of attack is adjusted to zero for the remainder of its climb to orbit. This zeroing of the angle of attack reduces lateral aerodynamic loads and produces negligible lift force during the ascent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The current {{test methods}} are {{insufficient}} {{to evaluate and}} ensure the safety and reliability of vehicle system for all possible dynamic situation including the worst case such as rollover, spin-out and so on. Although the known NHTSA Sine with dwell <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers</b> are applied for the vehicle performance assessment, they aren't enough to estimate other possible worst case scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial for us to verify the various worst cases including the existing severe <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers.</b> This paper includes useful worst case based upon the existing worst case scenarios mentioned above and worst case evaluation for vehicle dynamic controller in simulation basis and UCC HILS. The only human steering angle is selected as a design parameter here and optimized to maximize the index function to be {{expressed in terms of}} both yaw rate and side slip angle. The obtained scenarios were enough to generate the worst case to meet NHTSA worst case definition.

40|$|Abstract—Inspired by insect flight, flapping-wing micro-aerial {{vehicles}} (FWMAVs) are {{an ongoing}} design problem, posing exceptional challenges in morphological construction, force production, and control methodology. Some impressive initial results {{have emerged from}} work focused on generating sufficient lift force for levitation or vertical acceleration [1]; however, effective methods for motion control remain an open problem. In this work, we propose and analyze a simplified approach to the FWMAV maneuvering problem that 1) focuses on motion control and steering in the horizontal plane and 2) employs a wing design that relies on tunable passive dynamics to set the angle of attack. Our simulated experiments with this method demonstrate an exceptional capability in handling pitch tracking and <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers,</b> even in presence of measurement noise. We compare the performance of our approach with that of another promising technique for steering: the “split cycle ” [2]. Simulation results suggest that in our approach, <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers</b> and planar motion are both faster and smoother. Furthermore, a passive dynamic control approach in FWMAV proves to have considerably lower bandwidth requirements. We will discuss how this is advantageous when designing a real FWMAV...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify and compare the kinematics and shoulder belt position of child anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) during emergency <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers.</b> Furthermore, the ATDs were compared to the results from child volunteers aged 4 to 12 in the same test setup (Bohman, Stockman, et al. 2011). Methods: A driving study was conducted on a test track comprising 4 ATDs: the Q 6, Q 10, and Hybrid III (HIII) 6 - and 10 -year-old ATDs restrained in the rear seat of a passenger vehicle. The ATDs were exposed to 2 repeated <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers</b> in each restraint system. The Q 6 and HIII 6 -year-old were restrained on booster cushions as well as high-back booster seats. The Q 10 and HIII 10 -year-old were restrained on booster cushions or restrained by 3 -point seat belts directly on the seat. Lateral motion of the forehead and upper sternum was determined, as well as shoulder belt movement on shoulder and torso tilting angle. Results: All ATDs began to move approximately at the same point in time corresponding to a vehicle lateral acceleration of just below 0. 2 g. In the later phase of the maneuver, Q 10 had moved 26 percent less than the children when restrained by seat belt only and 35 percent less when on a booster cushion. Corresponding numbers for the HIII 10 -year-old were 43 and 44 percent higher than for children. Compared to children, the Q 6 had moved 34 percent less when restrained on a high-back booster seat and 31 percent less when on a booster cushion. Corresponding numbers for HIII 6 -year-old were 7 and 28 percent higher than for children. Due to extensive variety of lateral displacements observed in the children, child performance range covers both ATD families for the evaluated sizes of 6 - and 10 -year-old ATDs. Conclusions: Compared to children, the HIII ATDs were closer with regards to mean values in the initial phase of the maneuver and the Q ATDs were closer in the end of the ramping phase of the lateral acceleration. The question regarding which ATD replicates better the behavior of children exposed to <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers</b> still remains open. As shown in this study, it depends on the focus of the comparison and on what phase of the maneuver is of interest. This study provides valuable knowledge on how representative the current ATDs are for replicating potential precrash postures of children as a result of vehicle emergency <b>steering</b> <b>maneuvers</b> for a variety of restraint systems and ATD sizes...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{collision}} avoidance systems (CAS) are an intensive research topic since {{the majority of}} all traffic accidents are collisions that are caused due to inattention or unadjusted driving behavior of the driver. Up to date prototypic CAS are based on on-board environmental sensors, such as camera or radar systems, that scan the vehicle's surrounding environment {{in order to assess}} the situation's hazardousness. The functionality of the used sensors under varying environmental conditions and the limited sensor covering area require an enormous effort to ensure a reliable detection of obstacles, and thus limit the application of the systems. In order to expand the operating field of such systems, a Galileo-based CAS will be developed within the project ‘Galileo above’ (application centre for ground based traffic). This advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) detects surrounding vehicles that are on collision course and reacts autonomously, if the driver does not intervene to avoid the crash. For this purpose the system initiates an emergency stop and/or an emergency <b>steering</b> <b>maneuver.</b> For the development of the CAS the Galileo test centre automotiveGATE in Aldenhoven, Germany will be used. On this test area pseudolites will be installed which provide Galileo-like navigation signals. Thus, the development respectively tuning of Galileo-based vehicle systems will be enabled, so as to have them available on the market when the Galileo satellite system reaches its full operational capability (FOC).

One {{of the proposed}} controls is a model-based feed-forward control using a characteristic diagram, called a Thrust-cornering characteristic diagram.

An appropriate <b>steering</b> <b>maneuver</b> for slope traversal can be found using the diagram with slope traversal criteria. The other control is a sensor-based feedback control. A key approach to this feedback control is to compensate for three types of slip, namely, the vehicle sideslip and longitudinal/lateral slips of a wheel. The feedback control cal-culates both steering and driving maneuvers that can compensate for these slips and also allow the rover to successfully traverse a sandy slope.

Dynamic and kinematic considerations reveal that an evasive <b>steering</b> <b>maneuver</b> has high potential for collision avoidance in many driving situations. Three different system layouts are described: driver-initiated evasion, corrective evasion, and automatic evasion assistance. Since an automatic steering intervention is a challenging and responsible task, the technological requirements for situation analysis and environment perception are stated. Many technical solutions for a steering intervention are conceivable; therefore several actuator concepts are discussed and assessed with respect to human machine interface (HMI) impacts. A short survey of research activities of industry and academia is given. As an example for a research level prototype, the Daimler automatic evasion assistance system for pedestrian protection is presented in detail.

40|$|Small {{unmanned}} ground vehicles (SUGVs) {{are widely}} used in nuclear, military, space exploration, agriculture, mining, and construction applications. Energy storage, management, and efficient conversion are always critical issues for SUGV designs and controls, and fast and accurate power consumption models are required to avoid immobilization by energy depletion or reduced traction capability. This dissertation studies methods to improve the locomotion power consumption modeling for both tracked and wheeled SUGVs. As SUGVs are usually operated off-road, terramechanics models {{can be used to}} capture the relationship between the running gear and terrain. Most SUGVs use skid steering because of its simplicity and robustness. However, due to the sliding between the running gear and terrain, skid steering can consume a lot of the propulsion power. Thus the skid steering must be included in the power consumption models of SUGVs. Single track-terrain and single wheel-terrain interaction are first studied and modeled based on terramechanics theory. Skid <b>steering</b> <b>maneuver</b> is then studied using three widely used models of tracked vehicles. None of these models achieve desired computation efficiency and accuracy simultaneously.

The accuracy of the FESS model is validated by experiments using a 6 -wheel-drive track/wheel interchangeable test robot on dry sand.
