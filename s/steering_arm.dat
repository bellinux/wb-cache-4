25|$|López {{lost control}} of his car's {{rear-end}} on lap 24, and spun into the turn eight wall, necessitating the deployment of the safety car, eliminating the time gaps in the field. The safety car was withdrawn {{at the end of}} lap 29, and racing resumed with di Grassi using FanBoost to pull clear from Vergne who was being pressured by teammate Sarrazin. Prost moved aside to allow teammate Buemi through for fifth place. Abt aggressively overtook Prost shortly after to move into sixth place and continued his goal of drawing closer to Buemi. On the 31st lap, Rosenqvist, who was challenging for a podium place, impacted the wall exiting the chicane, damaging his left-rear suspension and causing the Mahindra's <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> to become bent. This enabled Buemi to take over fourth place and Rosenqvist fell down the order. Vergne drew close to di Grassi and was close behind him in the closing two laps. He feigned an overtaking manoeuvre on di Grassi but the latter defended the lead.|$|E
25|$|Di Grassi won {{the pole}} {{position}} for the first race by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and held off an challenge from Sarrazin to maintain the lead {{at the start of}} the event. He pulled away from the field and attention focused on his championship rival Sébastien Buemi, demoted from second to twelfth on the grid for changing his battery, after sustaining <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> damage on the first lap but was able to move up the field during the course of the race. The race was neutralised with a full course yellow flag when Loïc Duval and Nick Heidfeld collided on the 14th lap. Most drivers made pit stops to switch into a second car and di Grassi remained the leader following the end of the pit stops. Sarrazin ceded second to teammate Vergne who then started to draw closer to di Grassi but his chase was neutralised when López crashed on lap 24, necessitating the safety car's deployment. Di Grassi kept the lead at the restart five laps later and held off Vergne for the remainder of the race to secure his second victory of the season and the sixth of his career. No lead changes occurred as di Grassi was the only driver to lead laps in the first race.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} lap, di Grassi led Sarrazin, Rosenqvist, Evans, Vergne, Prost, Carroll, Turvey, Duval, Dillmann, Heidfeld, Abt, Félix da Costa, Frijns, Engel, Buemi, López, d'Ambrosio, Bird and Piquet. Di Grassi began to pull away from the rest of the field. Sarrazin was put under {{pressure}} by Rosenqvist but defended his position from him. Attention then switched to Buemi who was beginning his move up the field. He adopted the positioning of his left hand on his steering wheel against his bent <b>steering</b> <b>arm.</b> Heidfeld and Abt were able to enter the top-ten places and both battled for position. Abt passed Heidfeld for ninth place on the ninth lap. After ten laps Buemi had passed four drivers to run in 12th place. After Buemi had overtaken Duval for tenth position on the 14th lap, Heidfeld attempted to overtake Duval on the outside line, but Duval defended his position, leaving Heidfeld without any space on the dirty part of the track and the two made contact at turn six. Duval resumed but Heidfeld's front-right suspension was bent and drove to the side of the track at turn 12 to retire. Heidfeld's stricken car prompted the activation of the full course yellow procedure to enable marshals to remove it from the circuit and most drivers elected to make pit stops for the mandatory change into their second cars.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea of a}} driverless tractor {{has been}} around since as early as 1940, when Frank W. Andrew invented his own. To guide his driverless tractor, a barrel or fixed wheel would be put {{in the center of the}} field and around it would wind a cable {{attached}} to a <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> on the front of the tractor. In the 1950s Ford developed a driverless tractor that they called [...] "The Sniffer" [...] but it was never produced because it could not be operated without running wire underground through the field. There were no major advances in driverless tractor technologies until 1994 when engineers at the Silsoh Research Institute developed the picture analysis system, which was used to guide a small driverless tractor designed for vegetable and root crops. This new tractor could even handle slight headland turns.|$|E

It was offered with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic.|$|R
50|$|Other {{systems for}} {{steering}} exist, but are uncommon on road vehicles. Children's toys and go-karts often use a very direct linkage {{in the form}} of a bellcrank (also commonly known as a Pitman arm) attached directly between the steering column and the <b>steering</b> <b>arms,</b> and the use of cable-operated steering linkages (e.g. the capstan and bowstring mechanism) is also found on some home-built vehicles such as soapbox cars and recumbent tricycles.|$|R

50|$|Articulated {{steering}} is {{a system}} by which a four-wheel vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge. The front and rear halves are connected {{with one or more}} hydraulic cylinders that change the angle between the halves, including the front and rear axles and wheels, thus steering the vehicle. This system does not use <b>steering</b> <b>arms,</b> king pins, tie rods, etc. as does four-wheel steering. If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles, it also eliminates the need for a central differential, as both front and rear axles will follow the same path, and thus rotate at the same speed. Long road trains, articulated buses, and internal transport trolley trains use articulated steering to achieve smaller turning circles, comparable to those of shorter conventional vehicles. Articulated haulers have very good off-road performance.|$|R
5000|$|The Coupé is a {{mid-engined}} two-seater {{sports car}} {{designed to give}} outstanding performance for its time, and impeccable handling. The design composed of two Mini front subframes, with traditional Mini rubber cone suspension, linked by a sheet steel semi-monocoque chassis. The chassis' deep centre tunnel backbone is supplemented by two generous sills. The car is mid-engined: the rear subframe contained the engine as in a Mini with the <b>steering</b> <b>arms</b> locked in position with adjustable rods and ball joints.

5000|$|Rather {{than the}} {{preceding}} [...] "turntable" [...] steering, where both front wheels turned around a common pivot, each wheel gained its own pivot, {{close to its}} own hub. While more complex, this arrangement enhances controllability by avoiding large inputs from road surface variations being applied {{to the end of}} a long lever arm, as well as greatly reducing the fore-and-aft travel of the steered wheels. A linkage between these hubs pivots the two wheels together, and by careful arrangement of the linkage dimensions the Ackermann geometry could be approximated. This was achieved by making the linkage not a simple parallelogram, but by making the length of the track rod (the moving link between the hubs) shorter than that of the axle, so that the <b>steering</b> <b>arms</b> of the hubs appeared to [...] "toe out". As the steering moved, the wheels turned according to Ackermann, with the inner wheel turning further. If the track rod is placed ahead of the axle, it should instead be longer in comparison, thus preserving this same [...] "toe out".|$|R
50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four tie rods, one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the tie rods), an idler arm on the passenger side, and a pitman arm on the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. The inner tie rods are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the <b>steering</b> <b>arms</b> and outer tie rods. All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|R
40|$|Describes a {{steering}} system for a wheeled vehicle, particularly one with independent suspension of the steerable wheels. This {{is characterized by the}} lack of any necessity for a direct physical linkage between <b>steering</b> control <b>arms</b> of the left and right wheels and by the use of separate, independent fluid pressure cylinder pairs connected by fluid pressure conduit for imparting motion to the respective steerable wheels. Coordination between the angular motion of the left and right steerable wheels is attained by a direct mechanical linkage between actuator members of the hydraulic cylinders remote from the wheel suspension which linkage can be arranged for non-linear relative motion that will result in desired coordinated but unequal motion of left and right steerable wheels. Such linkage between actuator members is operated directly or indirectly by the steering wheel, steering levers, or other device. Preferably the fluid pressure cylinders connected to <b>steering</b> control <b>arms</b> of the wheels extend substantially parallel to suspension arms of the wheel suspension, and fluid pressure lines to such cylinders are flexible hoses which permit wide angle motion of the independent wheel suspension. Each fluid pressure cylinder may include between its ports a by-pass conduit and a valve releases the constraint between the interconnected fluid pressure cylinders. This facilitates alignment of the vehicle wheels or other adjustments. Preferably the fluid pressure system is pressurized at over 100 psi...|$|R

40|$|To {{create an}} energy {{efficient}} vehicle {{there are a}} number of aspects that need to be optimized, namely; the drive train of the vehicle and energy source, aerodynamics and weight. Focusing on weight reduction, while still maintaining the desired performance and structural strength, many manufacturers are turning to advanced composites due to their superior strength to weight characteristics. Solar car racing provides a research platform that drives this innovation through technology development and efficiency. A lightweight vehicle suspension system design is being presented, together with an introduction into future testing. A suspension system is made up of a number of critical components which are dynamically loaded during standard operation due to undulating forces imposed by the road surface. Unidirectional cross-wound carbon fiber tubing is used for suspension and <b>steering</b> <b>arms.</b> The tubing is interfaced with small steel inserts and pivoting arm tie rod ends. Concerns within the design are the adhesive bonding of the carbon tubing to the steel inserts, and what type of tensile loading the interface can withstand. Due to forces imposed on the system during cornering and shock loading the components are required to withstand a minimum of 1. 2 times the weight of the overall vehicle, i. e. 258 kg. Tensile test results show that the mechanical properties of the adhesive joints rely somewhat on the surface characteristics and bond preparation. The target load of 258 kg was successfully obtained under static loading for two types of sample sets. The first based on the standard for describing the lap shear strength of adhesively bonded carbon fiber to aluminum, and the second based on the working component itself...|$|R
