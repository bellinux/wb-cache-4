[...] Carnivàle, as The Australian stated, [...] "seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms" [...] which [...] "can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television." [...] A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as [...] "too artsy and esoteric" [...] because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding [...] "what the heck was going on, [...] can be a problem for a dramatic television series." [...] TV Zone however considered Carnivàle [...] "a series like no other and [...] {{the fact that it is}} so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths." [...] Carnivàle was lauded for bringing [...] "the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life" [...] and for being among the first TV shows to show [...] "unmitigated pain and disappointment", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the [...] "slowly unfolding sadness" [...] appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.|$|E

This thesis examines U. S. Army foodways at Fort Yamhill and provides a basis for future work on the subject. Combining the archaeological and archival data from the site provided the unique opportunity to examine the foodways of the mid- 19 th century U. S. Army holistically. Results of this research suggests that although the soldiers stationed at Fort Yamhill were at the end of long supply lines and far from populated cities, the diet consumed by the soldiers was adequate and often abundant. Procuring subsistence stores from many sources soldiers were able to procure a <b>steady</b> and healthful <b>diet</b> and often had the opportunity to display social and economic status through their patterns of food consumption...|$|R

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Zootécnica - Produção Animal - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaNutrition {{plays an}} {{important}} role in reproduction and is very used in the reproductive manipulation of farm animals. The lupin seed (Lupinus spp.), a grain legume with high energy and protein content, has been extensively used as a supplement to improve the reproductive efficiency of sheep. In this work it was studied the effect of Lupinus albus supplementation of Merino Branco ewes on some metabolic blood metabolites (non esterified fatty acids, glucose, urea and albumin) in order to assess the nutritional status of ewes, and on some reproductive parameters (the interval between the removal of the sponges and the beginning of oestrus and the conception rate). For these studies four groups of fifteen animals each had been formed: group 1 C (increasing body condition, control diet), group 1 T (increasing body condition, diet with lupin), group 2 C (steady body condition, control diet), group 2 T (<b>steady</b> body condition, <b>diet</b> with lupin). Estrous was synchronized on all ewes using intravaginal progestagen impregnated sponges which remaining in situ for 6 days (D 0 -D 6). On the day before sponges were removed prostaglandin F 2 α was administered. Control diets and diets with lupin were given from D 1 to D 6. Diets of groups 1 T and 1 C had equal amounts of protein and energy, and also diets of groups 2 T and 2 C. On D 7 and on D 8 rams were introduced to detect ewes in estrous and mate them. Body condition score (BCS) was evaluated on D- 1, 6 and 28, and live weight (LW) was evaluated on D- 1, 14 and 28. Progesterone was measured on blood samples taken on D 6, 7, 8, 14 and 25. The above refered metabolic metabolites were measured on samples collected on D- 3, 2, 4, 6 and 14. The estrus synchronization protocol used was efficient and oestrus occurred within the normal time range in all animals. The pregnancy rate was lower in animals of group 2 T, having animals in increasing body condition (groups 1 T and 1 C) better results, showing a positive effect of nutritional status. All animals consumed the total amount of feed offered, with the exception of those belonging to group 2 T, which had a reduced feed intake at the beginning of the supplementation period. This reduction might be due to the high content of alkaloids present at the lupin seed used. The BCS increased between D- 1 and D 6 in animals of group 1 T. The LW increased between D 6 and D 28 in animals of group 1 C. This lack of improvement of BCS and LW observed in animals of group 2 T, after a short-term lupin supplementation period, has already been refered by several authors. The results of non esterified fatty acids, glucose, urea and albumin have showed that the nutritional status of the animals was balanced in all groups, being all animals in a positiveenergy balance. Nevertheless, group 2 T had significantly higher concentrations of non esterified fatty acids at the beginning of the supplementation period, which might be due to the reduction of the feed intake observed, which lead to the mobilization of fat reserves. The analysis between groups did not detect any differences in the concentrations of glucose nor albumin. Group 1 C had higher urea concentration in D 6 than group 1 T and 2 T. This suggests a better utilization of protein in animals from groups receiving lupin, showing a better balance between protein and energy content of lupin or a better protein quality of this seed...|$|R
6000|$|Quite {{like other}} boys Lowell was {{subjected}} to the processes of the more formal education of books. He was first sent to a [...] "dame school," [...] {{and then to the}} private school of William Wells, under whose rigid tuition he became thoroughly grounded in the classics. Among his schoolfellows was W.W. Story, the poet-sculptor, who continued his life-long friend. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, {{who was one of the}} younger boys of the school, recalls the high talk of Story and Lowell about the Fairie Queen. At fifteen he entered Harvard College, then an institution with about two hundred students. The course of study in those days was narrow and dull, a pretty <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> of Greek, Latin and Mathematics, with an occasional dessert of Paley's Evidences of Christianity or Butler's Analogy. Lowell was not distinguished for scholarship, but he read omnivorously and wrote copiously, often in smooth flowing verse, fashioned after the accepted English models of the period. He was an editor of Harvardiana, the college magazine, and was elected class poet in his senior year. But his habit of lounging with the poets in the secluded alcoves of the old library, in preference to attending recitations, finally became too scandalous for official forbearance, and he was rusticated, [...] "on account of constant neglect of his college duties," [...] as the faculty records state. He was sent to Concord, where his exile was not without mitigating profit, as he became acquainted with Emerson and Thoreau. Here he wrote the class poem, which he was permitted to circulate in print at his Commencement. This production, which now stands at the head of the list of his published works, was curiously unprophetic of his later tendencies. It was written in the neatly, polished couplets of the Pope type and other imitative metres, and aimed to satirize the radical movements of the period, especially the transcendentalists and abolitionists, with both of whom he was soon to be in active sympathy.|$|E
