50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} {{hex socket head}} set screws, and Hallowell patented a shaft collar with this safety-style set screw. His safety <b>set</b> <b>collar</b> was soon copied by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety <b>set</b> <b>collar</b> {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|R

50|$|Stayclip {{is a form}} of shirt collar {{stiffener}} (also {{known as}} collar stays). Stayclip is a patented design that stores a <b>set</b> of <b>collar</b> stiffeners which have specially designed holes in their ends. The Stayclip system uses a unique holder with a clip, to keep the <b>set</b> of <b>collar</b> stiffeners together. By pressing a button on the holder, the arms of the Stayclip open and close to provide easy access to the stiffeners.|$|R

50|$|<b>Set</b> screw <b>collars</b> {{are best}} used when the {{material}} of the shaft is softer than the set screw. Unfortunately, the set screw causes damage to the shaft - a flare-up of shaft material - which makes the collar harder to adjust or remove. It is common to machine small flats onto the shaft at the set screw locations to eliminate this problem.|$|R
5000|$|The first mass-produced shaft <b>collars</b> were <b>set</b> screw <b>collars</b> {{and were}} used {{primarily}} on line shafting in early manufacturing mills. These early shaft collars were solid ring types, employing square-head set screws that protruded from the collar. Protruding screws {{proved to be}} a problem because they could catch on a worker's clothing while rotating on a shaft, and pull them into the machinery.|$|R

60|$|It was {{a lovely}} afternoon, and the sun shone outside the green tracery of a {{hornbeam}} alley in the Deanery garden, leading from the cloister to the river. Here lay Lancelot, on the long cushion of a sofa, while Wilmet sat stitching at {{the last of the}} <b>set</b> of <b>collars</b> that would always bring so many recollections. For this was a Saturday afternoon, and on the Monday Lance was to go to Ewmouth to join Felix, who was to have his holiday extended another month on that account. Alda, who had had a quarter's allowance from her uncle, had made this possible; and Wilmet was doubly gratified by its having been her twin's gift and thought.|$|R
40|$|Specific {{regions of}} the cell {{envelope}} associated with the flagellar basal complex of the gram-negative bacterium Aquaspirillum (Spirillum) serpens were identified by studying each of the envelope layers: outer membrane, mucopeptide, and plasma membrane. The outer membrane around the flagella insertion site was differentiated by concentric membrane rings and central perforations surrounded by a closely <b>set</b> <b>collar.</b> The perforations in both the outer membrane and the isolated mucopeptide layer were of a size accomodating the central rod of the basal complex but smaller than either the L or the P disks. The P disk of the complex may lie between the mucopeptide and the outer membrane. Electron microscopy of intact, spheroplasted, or autolyzed preparations did not adequately resolve {{the location of the}} inner pair of disks of the basal complex. Freeze-etching, however, revealed differentiation within the plasma membrane that appeared {{to be related to the}} basal complex. The convex fracture face showed depressions which are interpreted as impressions of a disk surrounded by a set of evenly spaced macromolecular studs and containing a central "plug" interpreted as the central rod. In thin sections, blebs, which appear to be associated with the flagellar apparatus, were seen on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Superimposing the dimensions of the flagellar basal complex and the spacings of the cell envelope layers and using the position of the L disk within the outer membrane for reference, showed that the S disk might be within and the M disk beneath the plasma membrane. A tentative model was developed for comparison with that based on the structure of the Escherichia coli basal complex...|$|R

5000|$|Frank Oz {{has stated}} that Animal's {{character}} {{can be summed up}} in five words: sex, sleep, food, drums, and pain. However, Animal has retorted: [...] "Drums are food!" [...] Animal's vocabulary is generally limited to guttural shouts and monosyllabic grunts, often repeating a few simple phrases, as well as his trademark gravelly laugh. During performances, Animal is usually chained to the drum <b>set</b> by a <b>collar</b> around his neck, as his musical outbursts are extremely violent. In some episodes, he has been summoned to chase off performers who are 'being annoying'.|$|R
5000|$|The Doric {{capital is}} the {{simplest}} of the five Classical orders: it consists of the abacus above an ovolo molding, with an astragal <b>collar</b> <b>set</b> below. In the Temple of Apollo, Syracuse (c. 700 BC), the echinus moulding has become a more definite form: this in the Parthenon reaches its culmination, where the convexity {{is at the top}} and bottom with a delicate uniting curve. The sloping side of the echinus becomes flatter in the later examples, and in the Colosseum at Rome forms a quarter round (see Doric order).|$|R

40|$|Can job {{assignment}} {{based on}} comparative advantage {{and learning about}} workers’ ability explain wage and promotion dynamics within firms? In order {{to answer this question}} the Gibbons and Waldman (1999 b) model is estimated in a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) framework using a unique data <b>set</b> on white <b>collar</b> workers in Norway for the years 1987 - 1997. The estimation is carried out on two different occupational groups: technical and administrative white collar workers. The selection of workers into a given position within a firm hierarchy is based on comparative advantage. Both measurable and unmeasurable skills are important. This holds in both occupations studied. When it comes to firms’ learning about their workers the results are not so clear. But overall the results on learning seem to have stronger support than what previous studies have found. In general, there is more evidence for learning about administrative white collar workers than about technical white collar workers...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of 2 <b>sets</b> of <b>collars</b> (Kiltix(R) Collar, Bayer AG), containing different plasticisers and impregnated with the acaricides flumethrin (2. 25 %) and propoxur (10 %), was compared against adult Rhipicephalus sanguineus on experimentally infested, kennelled dogs. Thirty individually penned dogs were infested with 25 male and 25 female, unfed R. sanguineus. On {{the following day}} they were allocated to 3 groups of 10 dogs each on the magnitude of their tick burdens. Two days after infestation, medicated collars containing 1 of the plasticisers were fitted to 10 of the dogs and similar collars containing the other plasticiser were fitted to 10 others. The remaining 10 dogs were the untreated controls. Seven and 28 days after having fitted the collars, all dogs were re-infested with 50 unfed adult ticks of both sexes, and again at approximately 28 -day intervals up to the 5 th month, and then at approximately 14 -day intervals during the 6 th month. Efficacy was determined by comparing {{the mean number of}} live, attached ticks on the untreated control group with those on the collared dogs 2 days after each re-infestation. Immediate {{efficacy of}} the collars (Day + 2) was &gt; 95 %, and residual efficacy was &gt; 98 % up to and including Day + 114, and &gt; 93 % up to Day + 170 on both groups of collared dogs.

40|$|Traditionally, {{infrared}} (IR) space instruments {{have been}} focused by iterating {{with a number}} of different thickness shim rings in a thermal vacuum chamber until the focus meets requirements. This has required a number of thermal cycles that are very expensive as they tie up many integration and test (I&T) / environmental technicians/engi neers work ing three shifts for weeks. Rather than creating a test shim for each iteration, this innovation replaces the test shim and can focus the instrument while in the thermal vacuum chamber. The focus tool consists of three small, piezo-actuated motors that drive two sets of mechanical interface flanges between the instrument optics and the focal- plane assembly, and three optical-displacement metrology sensors that can be read from outside the thermal vacuum chamber. The motors are used to drive the focal planes to different focal distances and acquire images, from which it is possible to determine the best focus. At the best focus position, the three optical displacement metrology sensors are used to determine the shim thickness needed. After the instrument leaves the thermal vacuum chamber, the focus tool is replaced with the precision-ground shim ring. The focus tool consists of two <b>sets</b> of <b>collars,</b> one that mounts to the backside of the interface flange of the instrument optics, and one that mounts to the backside of the interface flange of the focal plane modules. The collars on the instrument optics side have the three small piezo-actuated motors and the three optical displacement metrology systems. Before the instrument is focused, there is no shim ring in place and, therefore, no fasteners holding the focal plane modules to the cameras. Two focus tooling collars are held together by three strong springs. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) mission spectrometer was focused this way (see figure). The motor described here had to be moved five times to reach an acceptable focus, all during the same thermal cycle, which was verified using pupil slicing techniques. A focus accuracy of. 20. 100 microns was achieved...|$|R
40|$|The central {{pillar of}} European climate policy, the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), is {{currently}} under scrutiny, as the allowance price is persistently low at around 58 ̆ 0 /tCO 2. The cap was met and emissions actually declined in recent years, ensuring the environmental {{effectiveness of the}} scheme. However, the low price may affect the long-term cost-effectiveness of the instrument by reducing the incentive for investment and deployment of low carbon technologies. No {{significant increase in the}} allowance price is expected before 2020, and probably not beyond, without reform. While the reasons for the price decline are controversial, empirical analysis shows that {{only a small portion of}} price fluctuations can be explained by factors such as the economic crisis, renewable deployment or international offsets. Therefore, it is likely that political factors and regulatory uncertainty have played a key role in the price decline. As a consequence, any reform of the EU ETS has to deliver a mechanism that reduces such uncertainty and stabilizes expectations of market participants. The Market Stability Reserve proposed by the EU Commission is unlikely to address the current problem of price uncertainty and insufficient dynamic efficiency. The key element of the alternative reform proposal described in this paper is to <b>set</b> a price <b>collar</b> in the EU ETS with lower and upper boundaries. This is likely to reinforce the long-term credibility and reliability of the price signal. In addition, a price for GHG emissions not covered by the EU ETS has to be set. If additional market failures prevent the market from functioning efficiently, specific policy instruments related to innovation and technology diffusion should be implemented in addition to carbon pricing. Carbon leakage could be addressed through tailor-made trade policies. In parallel, increasing the coalition of countries included in the carbon pricing should remain a priority. This reform package would bring the EU ETS back to life, while avoiding a relapse into potentially costly and inefficient national climate and energy policies...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of ewes was obtained by deploying GPS collars on sheep on a commercial property on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the relationship between local weather, topography and use of shade and shelter by sheep in 2 paddocks of 20 ha. Paddock A was characterised by 3 distinct areas: "exterior shelter" consisting of perimeter shelter belts (3 – 4 rows of native trees), "lone trees" consisting of individual free-standing trees within the paddock, and "remainder of paddock". Paddock B contained areas that were categorised as for paddock A, plus an "interior shelter", a single, internal boomerang-shaped shelter belt. Over 2 lambing seasons (spring 2008 and 2009, 43 – 51 days), a random sample of 5 ewes from each of the 2 flocks of 200 – 300 ewes (2 – 5 years old and shorn 2 weeks prior to commencement of the experiment) were fitted with GPS <b>collars</b> <b>set</b> to log position every 10 min. Four weather stations and 55 temperature loggers were strategically located throughout the paddocks to provide localized hourly measurements of temperature, wind speed and precipitation over the observation periods. Daily temperatures ranged between – 6 °C and 27 °C; nights were generally still and frost was common; days were often sunny and windy. Wind speed reached a mean maximum of 49. 6 km/h. Strong westerly winds prevailed; northerly and southerly winds were unusual. The average rainfall during the observation period was 760 mm. As the number of times that sheep were detected in the various paddock categories was similar in each year, data for the 2 years were combined. The percentage of observations in which sheep were within 25 m of each shelter class was determined during 3 key phases of the diurnal behavioural cycle: 19 : 00 – 04 : 00 (night camping); 05 : 00 – 11 : 00 (morning grazing) and 12 : 00 – 18 : 00 (afternoon grazing). During night camping and when an internal shelter belt was provided (Paddock B), sheep spent more time in the vicinity (0 – 25 m) of the interior shelter belt (56...|$|R
