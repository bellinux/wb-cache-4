40|$|The {{majority}} of current security architectures for grid systems use {{public key infrastructure}} (PKI) to authenticate identities of grid members and to secure resource allocation to these members. Identity-based cryptography (IBC) has some attractive properties which seem to align well {{with the demands of}} grid computing. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the use of identity-based techniques to provide an alternative grid security architecture. We propose a customised identity-based key agreement protocol which fits nicely with the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) and provides a more lightweight secure job submission environment for grid users. <b>Single</b> sign-on and <b>delegation</b> services are also supported in a very natural way in our identity-based architecture. ...|$|R
40|$|PKI is {{generally}} considered as the most appropriate solution for e-commerce and mutual authentication, owing to its digital signature and non-repudiation features. Asymmetric key operations of PKI require by far more CPU cycles than a symmetric cryptographic algorithm. It hampers the usability of PKI on resource-constrained devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new PKIbased authentication protocol and security infrastructure enhanced with <b>single</b> sign-on and <b>delegation</b> technology for a device with a restricted computing power. Although a conventional delegation mechanism cannot support nonrepudiation mechanism against malicious user’s behavior, our proposed protocol and security infrastructure can provide the mechanism by devising a referee server that generates binding information between a device and authentication messages, and retains the information in its local storage for future accusation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of high speed wide area networks makes grid computing a reality. However grid applications that need reliable data transfer still have difficulties to achieve optimal TCP performance due to network tuning of TCP window size to improve bandwidth {{and to reduce}} latency on a high speed wide area network. This paper presents a Java package called JPARSS (Java Parallel Secure Stream (Socket)) that divides data into partitions that are sent over several parallel Java streams simultaneously and allows Java or Web applications to achieve optimal TCP performance in a grid environment without the necessity of tuning TCP window size. This package enables <b>single</b> sign-on, certificate <b>delegation</b> and secure or plaintext data transfer using several security components based on X. 509 certificate and SSL. Several experiments {{will be presented to}} show that using Java parallel streams is more effective than tuning TCP window size. In addition a simple architecture using Web services to facilitate peer to peer and third party file transfer will be presented. ...|$|R

In order to provide the PKI-based ubiquitous security infrastructure in consideration of the issues, we propose a PKI-based single signon protocol that provides a user with a transparent security mechanism and seamless authentication services using delegation technology. It also enables cost-effective deployment of the security services by offloading complex PKI operations from the devices to the infrastructure. Although a conventional delegation mechanism cannot support non-repudiation mechanism against malicious user’s behavior, our proposed protocol and security infrastructure can provide the mechanism by devising a referee server that generates binding information between a device and authentication messages, and retains the information in its local storage for future accusation. The detailed design of the protocol and a PKI-based service infrastructure are presented and then protocol analysis is given in terms of a user authentication latency and the protocol’s completeness.

40|$|As digital data-collection has {{increased}} in scale and number, it becomes an important type of resource serving a wide community of researchers. Cross-institutional data-sharing and collaboration introduce a suitable approach to facilitate those research institutions that are suffering the lack of data and related IT infrastructures. Grid computing has become a widely adopted approach to enable cross-institutional resource-sharing and collaboration. It integrates a distributed and heterogeneous collection of locally managed users and resources. This project proposes a distributed data warehouse system, which uses Grid technology to enable data-access and integration, and collaborative operations across multi-distributed institutions {{in the context of}} HV/AIDS research. This study is based on wider research into OGSA-based Grid services architecture, comprising a data-analysis system which utilizes a data warehouse, data marts, and near-line operational database that are hosted by distributed institutions. Within this framework, specific patterns for collaboration, interoperability, resource virtualization and security are included. The heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the Grid environment introduces a number of security challenges. This study also concerns a set of particular security aspects, including PKI-based authentication, <b>single</b> sign-on, dynamic <b>delegation,</b> and attribute-based authorization. These mechanisms, as supported by the Globus Toolkit’s Grid Security Infrastructure, are used to enable interoperability and establish trust relationship between various security mechanisms and policies within different institutions; manage credentials; and ensure secure interaction...|$|R

The realisation of <b>single</b> sign-on and <b>delegation</b> of privileges in accessing resources such as the UK e-Science National Grid Service (NGS - [URL] and other national facilities is typically facilitated by X. 509 -based Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) and exploitation of proxy certificates.

30|$|In this study, the {{proposed}} efficient identity-based QER cryptographic scheme must satisfy Shamir’s original concepts in a strict sense, i.e., {{it does not}} need any interactive earliest communications in, respectively, data transmission. It provides longer {{and higher levels of}} security than the schemes using IFP and the general formulation of DLP. The presented scheme needs nominal operations in encryption and decryption proses, thus makes it is very efficient. The offered out comes provides the special result from the security point of view, because we face the problem of solving IFP and DLP simultaneously in the multiplicative group define over finite fields as compared with the other identity-based cryptographic scheme. Using our propose scheme, we can develop an identity-based encryption model based on lightweight public key management techniques. It has small sizes key pair’s private and public keys as compared with other Identity-based cryptographic schemes available in literature. It is more benefited in grid security architecture. The grid environment may have a large number of members that join and leave over time and that certificates are used extensively for every job submission. This would inevitably complicate key management and increase the bandwidth requirement of a grid system. It was also noted that these problems could be simplified using certificate-free identity-based cryptographic scheme. Moreover, in the identity-based cryptographic setting, a user’s public key can be created and used immediately without the need for a public key certificate to be forwarded to the intended recipient [normally via a Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake]. However, the supposedly dynamic use of identity-based keys was hindered by some traditional limitations of identity-based cryptographic scheme, such as key escrow, and the need to distribute private keys through secure channels. More importantly, some of the essential security requirements desired in the Globus Toolkit (GT) require using proxy credentials for <b>single</b> sign-on and <b>delegation,</b> but our developed efficient identity-based QER cryptographic scheme is free from certificate and key escrow problems.|$|R
