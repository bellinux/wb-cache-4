The first studies were dedicated to avalanche released systems. Later, experiments focused on avalanche dynamics and avalanche impact pressures both in relation with the fundamental knowledge of <b>snow</b> <b>flow</b> rheology and the engineering of defense structures and avalanche hazard zoning. Recent instrumentation developments now provide rich-documented in situ measurements of avalanche flow. 20 cm-resolution vertical profiles of pressure and velocity get inside into the internal structure of snow flows with a time sampling rate of 3 kHz. In complement to this Eulerian measurement, the Lagrangian velocity of the avalanche front is measured along the track by digital high-speed stereo-photogrammetry. This remote sensing system also provides the initial surface and volume conditions in the starting zone. These measurements are associated to a 2 d shallow water avalanche dynamics model to retrieve best possible rheological parameters (i. e. basal friction law) to be fitted on each avalanche event...|$|E

Eulerian non-granular multiphase model was chosen to model the <b>snow</b> <b>flow</b> in the surrounding atmospheric air domain. Both air and snow were assumed as laminar and incompressible fluids. User defined functions(UDF) were written for the computation of bi-viscous Bingham fluid viscosity and wall shear stress of snow to account for the slip at the interface between the flowing snow and the stationary snow chute surface. Using the proposed CFD model, the velocity, dynamic pressure and debris deposition were simulated for flowing snow mass in the chute.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} device {{has been}} built to measure velocity profiles and friction laws in channeled <b>snow</b> <b>flows.</b> The measurements show that the velocity depends linearly on the vertical position in the flow and that the friction coefficient is a first-order polynomial in velocity (u) and thickness (h) of the flow. In all flows, oscillations {{on the surface of}} the flow were observed throughout the channel and measured at the location of the probes. The experimental results are confronted with a shallow water approach. Using a Saint-Venant modeling, we show that the flow is effectively uniform in the streamwise direction at the measurement location. We show that the surface oscillations produced by the Archimedes's screw at the top of the channel persist throughout the whole length of the channel and are the source of the measured oscillations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{surface wind}} field is an {{important}} factor controlling the surface mass balance of Antarctica. This paper focuses on the observed atmospheric circulation during summer of an Antarctic blue ice area in Queen Maud Land. Blue ice areas are characterised by a negative surface mass balance and henceforth provide an interesting location to study the influence of meteorological processes on large local mass balance gradients. During lapse conditions, synoptic forcing determines the surface-layer flow. No significant horizontal temperature gradient with coastal stations could be detected along isobaric surfaces, indicating weak or absent thermal wind. Observations performed at the coastal stations Halley and Georg von Neumayer show the pronounced effects of synoptic forcing. The surface winds in the valley of the blue ice area could be divided into two distinct flow patterns, occurring with about equal frequency during the experiment. Flow type I is associated with cyclonic activity at the coast, resulting in strong easterly winds, precipitation and drifting <b>snow.</b> <b>Flow</b> characteristics inside and outside of the valley are similar during these conditions. Flow type I/occurs when a high pressure system develops in the Weddell Sea, weakening the free atmosphere geostrophic winds. A local circulation is able to develop inside the valley of the blue ice area during these tranquil conditions. The transition from flow type II to flow type I is associated with front-like phenomena inside the valley. Some simple theoretical considerations show that surface-layer stability and the upper air geostrophic wind determine the surface flow direction in the valley. Finally, the influence of the observed circulation on the energy and mass balance of the blue ice area is discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} {{concerns}} with the parametrical dependencies of inverse grading in granular flows from material properties of individual particles {{involved in the}} flow. The investigations were initiated and motivated by the search for {{an explanation of the}} function principle of the avalanche airbag, which prevents a skier from going under in a flowing avalanche. The functionality of the avalanche airbag cannot be understood in the frame of the classical hydrodynamical avalanche models: the hydrostatic buoyancy caused by the avalanche airbag is not sufficient to keep a skier on the surface of a flowing avalanche. Starting from this motivation, a short phenomenological and historical overview over snow avalanches and the development of the avalanche airbag is given. Existing field observations and laboratory experiments are described to outline the occurrence and main features of granular flows. It is discussed, how far these observations and experiments indicate specific properties of granular flows such as inverse grading. Mathematical modelling of avalanches or granular flows can easily be adjusted to the specific investigated problems and does not consume as much property as physical modelling in laboratory experiments does. Different classes of mathematical and numerical models of avalanches and granular flows are reported with respect to the question how far they allow qualitative or quantitative insight into the nature of inverse grading. Comparing continuum dynamic avalanche models, analytic models of granular flow and discrete element models (DEM), {{it can be seen that}} DEMs are well suited for the investigation of inverse grading. According to the type of the granular flow which has to be investigated, either the hard sphere or the soft sphere type of DEM is the appropriate description for the flow. Quasistatic granular flows, which are dominated by multiparticle interactions over longer durations are described by soft sphere models. For rapid granular flows, hard sphere models are the appropriate approach. In this case, it is assumed, that the flow is dominated by instantaneous binary contacts which extend over time intervals that can be neglected compared to the time intervals of free particle motion. In the current work, snow avalanches are considered as rapid flows. According to this, a hard sphere DEM was used for the investigation of inverse grading in granular flow. 1 n the used model, binary collisions of particles are parametrized by the particle elasticities e and b in longitudinal and transversal direction and by the Coulomb coefficient μ of the colliding particles. The model can reproduce the effect of inverse grading in a defined range of particle material parameters. Therefore, the global flow and segregational behaviour of the granular flow can be considered to depend from the interaction behaviour of individual particles. The longitudinal restitution coefficient e, which describes the particle elasticity in longitudinal direction, seems to be the parameter, which influences the flow– and segregational behaviour most strongly. It is tried to establish a link between the model results and continuum dynamic granular flow models by searching for a constitutive relation between stress and strain in the model flow. However, a unique relation could not be found, probably because the model flow fails to meet some principle requirements for the derivation of stress tensors in granular flows. On the other hand, the method of stochastic analysis could successfully be applied to the model flow data: the time series of the vertical position of individual particles are apparently noisy and have Markov properties. This allows to derive deterministic, particle size dependent segregational dynamics of one single particle from its time series of vertical position. The fixed points of these dynamics for large particles lie in upper flow layers, where the fixed points of smaller particles are situated near the bottom. The results of the investigations in the frame of the numerical DEMs are compared with field observations and with results of laboratory measurements of the longitudinal restitution coefficient e of snow. Field measurements of mean snow lump size profiles correspond qualitatively to the particle size profiles obtained from the numerical simulations. The measured value of e &#x 2248; 0. 1 [...] . 0. 3 for snow differs significantly from the value of e &#x 2248; 0. 8, which is necessary to obtain granular model flows which are exhibiting inverse grading. This difference can be explained by the fact that <b>snow</b> <b>flow</b> avalanche dynamics also incorporate particle interactions extended in time, for which the numerical hard sphere model cannot account. Conceptually, this work spans an arc from the application of the avalanche airbag to an explanation of the typical granular flow behaviour or inverse grading in the frame of a numerical hard sphere approach...|$|E

40|$|Snow {{avalanches}} break, uproot and overturn trees causing {{damage to}} forests. The extent of forest damage provides useful information on avalanche frequency and intensity. However, impact forces depend on avalanche flow regime. In this paper, we define avalanche loading cases representing four different avalanche flow regimes: powder, intermittent, dry and wet. In the powder regime, {{the blast of}} the cloud can produce large bending moments in the tree stem because of the impact area extending over the entire tree crown. We demonstrate that intermittent granular loadings are equivalent to low-density uniform dry snow loadings under the assumption of homogeneous particle distributions. In the wet snow case, avalanche pressure is calculated using a quasi-static model accounting for the motion of plug-like wet <b>snow</b> <b>flows.</b> Wet <b>snow</b> pressure depends both on avalanche volume and terrain features upstream of the tree. Using a numerical model that simulates both powder and wet snow avalanches, we study documented events with forest damage.
