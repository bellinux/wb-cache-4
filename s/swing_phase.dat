5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the <b>swing</b> <b>phase,</b> the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
25|$|The dynamic {{interactions}} between Spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust {{the timing and}} amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. It {{is important to note}} that inputs from the hip appear to play a critical role in spinal locomotion. Experiments on spinal animals showed that when one limb is held with the hip flexed, locomotion on that side stops while the other limb continues walking. However, when the stopped limb is extended at the hip joint to a point normally reached at the end of stance during walking, it suddenly flexes and starts walking again provided that the contralateral limb is a position to accept the weight of the hindquarters. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it.|$|E
25|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{processes}} and interprets proprioception {{in a manner}} similar to how our visual system processes information. When we view a painting, the brain interprets the total visual field, as opposed to processing each individual pixel of information independently, and then derives an image. At any instant the spinal cord receives an ensemble of information from all receptors throughout the body that signals a proprioceptive “image” that represents time and space, and it computes which neurons to excite next based on the most recently perceived “images.” The importance of the CPG is not simply its ability to generate repetitive cycles, but also to receive, interpret, and predict the appropriate sequences of actions during any part of the step cycle, i.e., state dependence. The peripheral input then provides important information from which the probabilities of a given set of neurons being active at any given time can be finely tuned to a given situation during a specific phase of a step cycle. An excellent example of this is when a mechanical stimulus is applied to the dorsum of the paw of a cat. When the stimulus is applied during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase,</b> the flexor muscles of that limb are excited, and the result is enhanced flexion in order to step over the obstacle that created the stimulus. However, when the same stimulus is applied during stance, the extensors are excited. Thus, the functional connectivity between mechanoreceptors and specific interneuronal populations within the spinal cord varies according to the physiological state. Even the efficacy of the monosynaptic input from muscle spindles to the motor neuron changes readily from one part of the step cycle to another, according to whether a subject is running or walking.|$|E
50|$|During locomotion, Ib input excites {{rather than}} {{inhibits}} motoneurons of the receptor-bearing muscles, and {{it affects the}} timing of the transitions between the stance and <b>swing</b> <b>phases</b> of locomotion. The switch to autogenic excitation is a form of positive feedback.|$|R
30|$|Our results {{indicated}} that basic gait parameters, such as the gait cycle, peak joint angle timing, and angular velocity parameters, significantly differ between elderly and very elderly women. Delayed peak joint angle timing and angular velocity parameters occurred during critical phases throughout the gait cycle: pre-swing, initial swing, and terminal <b>swing</b> <b>phases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Six {{distinct}} stages {{are involved}} in the kick: the approach angle, the plant foot force, the swing limb loading, the <b>swinging</b> <b>phase,</b> ball contact, and the follow through. The first is the “approach angle” when a kicker runs up to the ball. The second stage is the plant foot force, which involves situating the supporting foot at a distance lateral from the ball prior to kicking. The third stage is the swing limb loading that requires the preparation of the hip flexors and knee extensors to load or eccentrically stretch for forward movement in order for the swinging limb to strike the ball. It is also known as the backswing phase. The fourth stage is when the hip flexors and knee extensors initiate a forceful contraction in the swinging limb at a high velocity towards the ball. This stage is considered the <b>swinging</b> <b>phase.</b> The fifth stage is when the swinging foot makes complete contact with the ball. Lastly, once the foot makes impact, the kicker should try to keep their foot in contact with the ball as long as they can. This is possible by proceeding with the swing of the limb until ball is out of contact. This stage is also known as the follow through phase.|$|R
2500|$|Energetic cost {{increases}} with longer step lengths {{due to increased}} ground reaction forces during double-support and more hip torque during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase.</b> [...] According to the dynamic walking model, mechanical work in the step-to-step transitions increases proportional to step length and can be described by , where [...] is mechanical work rate and [...] is step length, which equates to a proportional increase in net metabolic rate. [...] This relationship is due to reduced vertical force contribution for redirecting the COM at the wider step angles associated with longer step lengths. [...] Larger step lengths also require additional hip torque during the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> to travel a wider angle, which contributes to the rate of metabolic cost {{by a factor of}} leg length squared ...|$|E
2500|$|Milton Hildebrand {{pioneered the}} {{contemporary}} scientific analysis and {{the classification of}} gaits. [...] The movement of each limb was partitioned into a stance phase, where the foot was {{in contact with the}} ground, and a <b>swing</b> <b>phase,</b> where the foot was lifted and moved forwards. [...] Each limb must complete a cycle in the same length of time, otherwise one limb's relationship to the others can change with time, and a steady pattern cannot occur. [...] Thus, any gait can completely be described in terms of {{the beginning and end of}} stance phase of three limbs relative to a cycle of a reference limb, usually the left hindlimb.|$|E
2500|$|The dorsiflexor {{muscles are}} small {{relative}} to other major muscles of the leg involved in locomotion such as the gluteals, hamstrings, quadriceps and the plantarflexors of the ankle. [...] These muscles must exert large amounts of force at two points during the walking stride at high speeds: 1) The beginning of the stance phase of walking, when the heel touches down and the raised toes must be stabilized to avoid [...] "slapping" [...] the forefoot on the ground. [...] 2) [...] During the <b>swing</b> <b>phase,</b> the trailing leg is moved ahead of the foot planted {{on the ground and}} the toes must be raised to avoid colliding with the ground. [...] Because of their relatively small size, these muscles are prone to fatigue quickly when asked to exert large amounts of force during high speed walking. [...] The transition to running reduces the load on the dorsiflexor muscles and reduces the feeling of discomfort associated with fatigue of these muscles.|$|E
50|$|Electromyographic (EMG) {{studies of}} the leg muscles in PD {{patients}} have shown an extreme reduction in the activation of the tibialis anterior muscle in the early stance {{and in the early}} and late <b>swing</b> <b>phases,</b> and a reduction in triceps surae muscle bursting at push-off. The quadriceps and hamstring muscles on the other hand, show prolonged activation in the stance phase of gait. This implies that PD patients have higher passive stiffness of ankle joints, show larger background EMG activity and more co-contraction of leg muscles in stance. Stiffer joints lead to abnormal postural sway in the PD patients.|$|R
5000|$|If step cycle {{durations}} {{and muscle}} activations were fixed, {{it would be}} impossible to change body velocity and adapt to varying terrain. It has been suggested that the mammalian locomotor CPG comprises a “timer” (possibly in the form of coupled oscillators) which generates step cycles of varying durations, and a “pattern formation layer,” which selects and grades the activation of motor pools.Increasing the neural drive from the midbrain locomotor region (MLR) to the spinal CPG increases the step cycle frequency (the cadence). [...] Swing and stance phase durations co-vary in a fairly fixed relationship, with stance phases changing more than <b>swing</b> <b>phases.</b>|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{findings}} in this study support the hypothesis that differences in gait appear between the subcategories of elderly and very elderly in Japanese women. Furthermore, a number of differences were noted in the timing of peak angle and angular velocity parameters between elderly and very elderly women. Interestingly, these peak timings appeared in the pre-swing, initial swing, and terminal <b>swing</b> <b>phases</b> (Fig.  7), which are related to the position and advancement of the limb from its trailing position, toe clearance, and preparation for the next initial contact, respectively. Therefore, understanding joint angle and angular velocity parameters is essential to develop an understanding of aging-related changes in gait.|$|R

Returning is when the dipper swings back to the bank, and involves lowering the dipper into the tuck position to close the dipper door.|$|R

50|$|The speed-adaption {{mechanism}} is a mechanism {{used to determine}} the required torque from the joints at different moving speeds. During the stance phase it has been seen that quasistiffness, which is the derivative of the torque angle relationship with respect the angle, changes constantly as a function of walking speed. This means that over the stance phase, depending on the speed the subject is moving, there is a derivable torque angle relationship {{that can be used to}} control a lower limb prosthesis. During the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> joint torque increases proportionally to walking speed and the duration of the <b>swing</b> <b>phase</b> decreases proportionally to the stride time. These properties allow for trajectories to be derived that can be controlled around that accurately describe the angle trajectory over the <b>swing</b> <b>phase.</b> Because these two mechanism remain constant from person to person this method removes the speed and patient specific tuning required by most lower limb prosthetic controllers.|$|E

The specific objective of this preliminary study was to present the key temporal and spatial gait characteristics. Methods Four male transfemoral amputees fitted with a fixation were asked to performe 3 trials of straight level walking. The speed of walking, cadence, duration of gait cycle, support and <b>swing</b> <b>phases,</b> length of stride and step, and walking base were extracted from displacements of foot markers using a 3 D motion analysis system recording at 200 Hz. Results The speed of walking and the cadence were 0. 81 ± 0. 16 m/s and 46. 03 ± 4. 70 steps/min, respectively. The duration of the gait cycles, support and <b>swing</b> <b>phases</b> were 1. 31 ± 0. 13 s, 0. 76 ± 0. 07 s and 0. 55 ± 0. 07 s, respectively.

Our simulation results showed that the sensory signals related to the force in the ankle extensor muscle make a larger contribution than sensory signals related to the joint angle at the hip to produce robust walking against disturbances, as observed in the simulation results of cat locomotion. This suggests that such a sensorimotor mechanism is a general property and is also embedded in the neuro-control system of human bipedal walking...|$|R
