[...] Holmes says that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> keen on recycling and saving the planet so she wanted to explore the ways bears and other animals might react to humans destroying their homes and habitats.

500|$|All of Wollstonecraft's writings, {{including}} the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, address {{the concerns of}} women in eighteenth-century society. As in previous works, she discusses concrete issues such as childcare and relationships with servants, but unlike her more polemical books such as Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787) or the Rights of Woman, this text emphasizes her emotional reactions to nature and maternity. Yet she does not depart from her interest in promoting women's education and rights. In Letter 19, the most explicitly feminist letter, Wollstonecraft anticipates readers' criticisms: [...] "still harping on the same subject, you will exclaim – How can I avoid it, {{when most of the}} struggles of an eventful life have been occasioned by the oppressed state of my sex: we reason deeply, when we forcibly feel." [...] Wollstonecraft comes to the realization that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> forced to experience the world as a woman—it is the defining feature of her sense of self.|$|E

The book was popular, going into four editions between first publication in 1868 and 1889.

Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with {{a real sense of}} history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra.

A singer herself in her earlier years, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a never-ending source of songs.

2500|$|Before being cast as Erica Kane, Lucci did {{not have}} much success in her acting career. A casting {{director}} discouraged her from pursuing roles on television because her hair, skin, and eyes were too dark. Though Lucci's olive complexion held her back from other acting opportunities, it worked in her favor while up for the role of Erica. [...] "Agnes Nixon, the show's creator, really wanted somebody dark to play this part. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> ahead of her time," [...] Lucci said. Lucci debuted in episode 10 of the series. In portraying Erica, the actress drew on the [...] "self-centered" [...] and [...] "haughty" [...] traits she recognized in herself while in college. Lucci said, [...] "I love playing her. I enjoyed playing her when she was a 15-year-old high school girl, the naughty girl in town, and I enjoy playing her now, when she's still the naughty girl, but she's broadened her area of operation to include the entire world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Hazumu's transformation, she is unsure {{on how to}} {{live life}} as a girl and is {{initially}} very clueless about typical female matters. Hazumu is also confused about how different people treat her after the change, though Hazumu resigns herself to live life as a girl. Despite Hazumu's physical change, {{there is not much}} change in her personality, as she still scares very easily, and has always been rather effusive, expressive and quite sensitive, which makes her fit well as a girl after the change. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> quite indecisive, which causes problems in the course of her changing relationship with both Yasuna and Tomari. Hazumu ends up becoming more feminine as time goes on, which is shown through her actions, mannerisms and personality. One exception to this, however, is that she never gets over referring to herself using the term , meaning [...] "I", which is usually only used by males in Japan. Hazumu is very selfless, thinking of others before herself and worries about her friends greatly. Yasuna has observed that Hazumu only smiles greatest when she is surrounded by her many loved ones.|$|E
2500|$|Manrico realises {{that he is}} not the son of Azucena, but {{loves her}} as if she were indeed his mother, as <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{faithful}} and loving to him - and, indeed, saved his life only recently, discovering him left for dead on a battlefield after being caught in ambush. Manrico tells Azucena that he defeated di Luna in their earlier duel, but was held back from killing him by a mysterious power (Duet: Mal reggendo / [...] "He was helpless under my savage attack"): and Azucena reproaches him for having stayed his hand then, especially since it was the Count's forces that defeated him in the subsequent battle of Pelilla. [...] A messenger arrives and reports that Manrico's allies have taken Castle Castellor, which Manrico is ordered to hold in the name of his prince: and also that Leonora, who believes Manrico dead, is about to enter a convent and take the veil that night. Although Azucena tries to prevent him from leaving in his weak state (Ferma! Son io che parlo a te! / [...] "I must talk to you"), Manrico rushes away to prevent her from carrying out this intent.|$|E
2500|$|The twelfth {{locomotive}} was a one-off order, {{similar in}} design to her two sisters purchased in 1905. [...] Built in 1908 (Beyer Peacock works number 5126), and named after company director W. A. Hutchinson, she {{was delivered to}} the railway with Salter safety valves and a deeper tone of whistle than had previously been employed. [...] Still in service today, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{one of the most}} active members of the fleet, perhaps only surpassed by No. 11 Maitland and appearance-wise has had a chequered career. [...] Today, she is largely in 1950s condition, carrying the Indian red livery of the period but her previous guise was much more contrasting. [...] When the newly nationalised railway was in need of infrastructure refurbishment, No. 12 was the second loco to be fitted with a new Hunslet boiler. [...] At this time she was given larger water tanks and a square [...] "house" [...] or cab supposedly similar to that carried by No. 16 Mannin. [...] These features, together with a non-prototypical blue livery gave the loco a somewhat odd appearance when compared with her shed-mates, and the look was not widely liked. [...] Due to the higher side tanks, she was inclined to roll more at speed than the other locomotives in her rebuilt form. [...] She did however remain in this guise until withdrawn from service for rebuild and re-entered traffic in 2001 in traditional form. [...] Also of note is that she was one of only two engines (the other being No. 5) to carry a brass fleet number above the name plate on tank. [...] This was lost prior to the 1981 rebuild and was reinstated for the 2009 season. Returned to service in April 2017 following a winter overhaul.|$|E

He later writes a novel titled A Fortunate Son, about a Rabbi and his son.

At the beginning of the series, he is roommates with a man with whom he owns a dog-washing business. When his roommate gets married, he becomes roommates with Donna, with whom he later becomes best friends. As he attempts to continue his writing career, he holds a number of jobs: dogwasher, reporter, and freelancer. He eventually marries his girlfriend, Carole Tobey (Sara Mornell), who has breast cancer, and leaves with her for San Francisco. The impending move causes Amy to become angry with Vincent, but when Amy finds out about Carole's breast cancer, she makes amends with him, gives him legal advice on his movie deal – even giving him the family's good luck talisman [...] "the Surfing Monkey" [...] at the airport. He comes home briefly when his mother calls and asks him to come help Maxine and Amy patch things up – as a fight has resulted in Amy moving out with extreme tension existing between mother and daughter. Because of Vincent's visit, Amy buys the family home, Maxine becomes a renter, and the family is put back together. Sometime later, his cousin Kyle arranges for him to arrive as a surprise to Amy's wedding to Stuart Collins. The wedding never happens. He returns home permanently soon after, explaining that Carole has left him for her oncologist.

Stuck after his book deal is canceled and he is in debt to the publishing company, he starts driving for the Department of Social Services, then gets a job at a teen center.
