5|$|The entire Slavonia {{belongs to}} the Danube basin and the Black Sea {{catchment}} area, but it is divided in two sub-basins. One of those drains into the Sava—itself a Danube tributary—and the other into the Drava or directly into the Danube. The drainage divide between the two sub-basins runs along Papuk and Krndija mountains, in effect tracing the southern boundary of the Virovitica-Podravina County and the northern boundary of Požega-Slavonia County, cuts through the Osijek-Podravina County north of Đakovo and finally bisects the Vukovar-Syrmia County running between Vukovar and Vinkovci to reach Fruška Gora southwest of Ilok.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An attempt {{has been}} made to utilize SRTM DEM data and GIS to {{determine}} the geomorphic indices and their influence on tectonic activity in the Kaneri River basin of northern Karnataka, south west coast of India. Drainage networks of 23 <b>sub-basins</b> of Kaneri River basin were extracted from SRTM DEM and analyzed the five commonly used morphotectonic indices- stream length-gradient index (SL), asymmetry factor (Af), hypsometric integral (Hi), drainage basin shape (Bs) and valley floor width-to-height ratio (Vf). High SL values are observed in <b>sub-basins</b> located at the downstream area. The longitudinal profiles of these <b>sub-basins</b> show several knick points indicating the tectonic control of this area. High Af values (> 15) are located in the middle part of the basin except two which are close to the river mouth. <b>Sub-basins</b> located in the high relief areas of Western Ghat mountain range area show high Hi values with downward concave hypsometric curves. About 90 % of the studied <b>sub-basins</b> show high Bs values (> 1. 30) which indicate that most of the <b>sub-basins</b> are elongated in shape. Values of Vf vary from 0. 51 to 32. 38 and they are relatively high for most of the <b>sub-basins.</b> All the geomorphic indices except Vf show higher values in the <b>sub-basins</b> located at the downstream area of the basin. Comparisons of field observations of tectonic activity along the Kaneri River agree very well with the values of geomorphic indices. Further, the study indicates that a systematic analysis of geomorphic indices using SRTM data and GIS provide significant value to the understanding of tectonic activity...|$|R

25|$|Today, the sediments of the Honda Group {{are exposed}} in the Middle (Valle Medio del Magdalena, VMM) and Upper Magdalena Basin (Valle Superior del Magdalena, VSM) in an intermontane valley between the Central Ranges {{in the west}} and the Eastern Ranges in the east. The valley in between the two major orogenic chains is filled by the Magdalena River, the longest river of Colombia. The Upper Magdalena Valley geologically is {{subdivided}} into the Neiva <b>Sub-basin</b> with the Girardot <b>Sub-basin</b> of the southernmost Middle Magdalena Valley to the north, divided by the Natagaima Arch. The Neiva <b>Sub-basin</b> is bound by the Chusma Fault {{in the west and}} to the east by the west-verging Garzon Fault. The Tatacoa Desert, where the type section of the Honda Group has been redefined is an unusually dry region in Colombia, caused by a mountain induced rain-shadow effect. In Middle Miocene times, the geography was more comparable to the present eastern foothills of the Andes.|$|E

25|$|The Silver Dart (or Aerodrome #4) was a {{derivative}} {{of an early}} aircraft built by a Canadian/U.S. team, which after many successful flights in Hammondsport, New York, earlier in 1908, was dismantled and shipped to Baddeck, Nova Scotia. It was flown off the ice of Baddeck Bay, a <b>sub-basin</b> of Bras d'Or Lake, on 23 February 1909, making it the first controlled powered flight in Canada. The aircraft was piloted by one of its designers, John McCurdy.

25|$|During the Eocene and Early Oligocene, {{the western}} part of the basin was exposed and modest {{deposition}} concentrated in the Ranchería <b>Sub-basin.</b> The previously humid ecosystem changed to an arid plain environment. In contrast, the Neogene conglomerates of the Cuesta Formation show a larger thickness in the southwestern part of the basin, close to the connected Middle Magdalena Valley. During this period, especially in the Late Miocene to Pliocene, the Oca and Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Faults were tectonically active, which is still observed in the present day. Ongoing uplift and reverse faulting created the intermontane fluvial-dominated basin architecture of today.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of sediment packages throughout the Northern Carnarvon Basin and Exmouth Plateau varies with location during the Jurassic. By the Pliensbachian, the general beginning {{structure of the}} Northern Carnarvon Basin was formed, creating the Exmouth, Barrow, and Dampier <b>sub-basins</b> along the proximal end of the northwestern Australian margin. Rapid subsidence of the Northern Carnarvon <b>sub-basins</b> ensued the deposition of the Dingo Claystones. These Claystones are thick marine shale deposits separated into two sequence, the Upper and Lower Dingo Claystones. The Lower Dingo sequence cannot {{be found in the}} Exmouth Plateau, because deposition During the Early to Middle Jurassic was restricted to sediments filling in the empty troughs of the Northern Carnarvon <b>sub-basins.</b> As deposition continued through the Middle and Late Jurassic, the troughs of <b>sub-basins</b> filled allowing more of the Dingo sediment overflow into the distal margins of the region. This depositional sequence characterizes the Upper Dingo Claystones, which are found as thick proximal sequences in the Northern Carnarvon <b>sub-basins</b> and thinner distal sequences in the Exmouth Plateau.|$|R

25|$|The Ocetá Páramo {{is part of}} the El Cocuy <b>sub-basin,</b> an {{inverted}} basin in the Eastern Ranges. During the Hauterivian, the El Cocuy and Tablazo sub-basins formed a continuous basin due to the flooding of the Santander-Floresta paleohigh. The main uplift in the Eastern Ranges occurred between the late Oligocene and Pleistocene, with increased tectonic uplift in the Plio-Pleistocene. The Neogene compression {{led to the formation of}} alluvial fans in the intermontane valleys of the Eastern Cordillera. Pollen analysis has shown the transition from lowland tropical forests to colder mountainous vegetation over the last 5 million years. The youngest uplifted eastern chain of the Colombian Andes formed the provenance area for the Magdalena River. In the vicinity of the area of Ocetá, to the southwest in Iza and Paipa for the Eastern Cordillera unique volcanic and magmatic activity is noted from 4.7 to 2.1 Ma.|$|E
25|$|MTBE, a major {{gasoline}} additive (10% by volume), {{was discovered}} in the city's water wells in August 1995. The MTBE was found almost by accident since it {{was not on the}} list of known contaminants and acceptable level had not been set. The city waters engineers had to research the hazard and they raised the alarm. Within a year all five wells were closed, leading to the loss of 45% of the city's water supply. One well had a concentration of 600 parts per billion, while another rose from 14 parts per billion to 490 parts per billion within a year. The California EPA guidelines now call for no more than 35 parts per billion. The city's well field is in the Charnock <b>Sub-Basin,</b> a small aquifer in Mar Vista, Los Angeles that both Santa Monica and Culver City draw upon. To maintain supply to customers Santa Monica was forced to purchase water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) at a cost of over $1.1 million per year. Cleanup of the site is ongoing at a current cost of $3 million per year, paid for by the responsible parties, principally: Shell Oil Company, Chevron, and Exxon. Following this discovery other water districts began testing that revealed tens of thousands of MTBE pollution cases across the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{evolution}} of the Main Porcupine Basin {{can be divided into}} pre-rift, syn-rift and post-rift stages. The syn-rift/post-rift transition represents a gradual change from extensive fault activity through localized faulting and passive infiil to sporadic faulting during post-rift times. This Transition Sequence ispresent in localized areas (<b>sub-basins).</b> It infills the remnant syn-rift opography after which the post-rift stage begins. <b>Sub-basins</b> developed during the syn-rift stage have a general N-S to NE-SW orientation and range in size from approximately 30 km x 20 km to approximately 12 km × 8 km. Their shapes range from symmetrical fault-bounded dcpocentres to haif-graben. The <b>sub-basins</b> have several internal unconformities which merge into a single composite erosion surface at the margins. Areas in which the Transition Sequence isdeveloped usually have an element of fault control, especially during the early stages. Clastic fans arc identified prograding from fault scarps. Later passive onlap during a rising sea-level progressively infills the <b>sub-basins.</b> The age of the Transition Sequence is problematical, but borehole data suggests that it spans uppermost Kimmeridgian/Tithonian to cnd-Bcrriasian times.

It was possible to visualize the areas and perimeters of the <b>sub-basins</b> were observed did not differ significantly. Compactness all coefficient values obtained were higher for unit 1, indicating that the <b>sub-basins</b> are elongated shape. Comparing the lengths of channels between the SRTM and ASTER images, {{we can see a}} considerable difference. The values obtained in ASTER images tend to be higher, ie, due to a better resolution of the image resulting in a more detailed delineation of the basins. The results of the drainage density calculations show that the sub-watersheds have low density. It is notable that generate high resolution images in more detail in the definition of basins, however, in some cases, these details large, difficult to visualize and understand the basin generated.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{relative}} importance of low flow indicators for the River Rhine and to identify their appropriate temporal lag and resolution. This is done in the context of low flow forecasting with lead times of 14 and 90 days. First, the Rhine basin is subdivided into seven <b>sub-basins.</b> By considering the dominant processes in the <b>sub-basins,</b> five low flow indicators were selected: precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, groundwater storage, snow storage and lake storage. Correlation analysis was then carried out to determine the relationship between observed low flows and preselected indicators with varying lags (days) and temporal resolutions (from 1 day to 7 months). The results show that the most important low flow indicators in the Alpine <b>sub-basins</b> for forecasts with a lead time of 14 days are potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution, and lake levels with a small lag and temporal resolution. In the other <b>sub-basins</b> groundwater levels with a small lag and temporal resolution are important in addition to potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution. The picture is slightly different for forecasts with a lead time of 90 days. The snow storage in the Alpine <b>sub-basins</b> and the precipitation in the other <b>sub-basins</b> also become relevant for low flows. Consequently, the most important low flow indicators in the Alpine <b>sub-basins</b> for forecasts with a lead time of 90 days are potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution, lake levels with a small lag and temporal resolution and snow storage with a small lag and large temporal resolution. The resultant correlation maps provide appropriate lags and temporal resolutions for indicators to forecast low flows in the River Rhine with different lead times...|$|R
