50|$|In a steam flood, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a <b>steam</b> <b>drive,</b> some wells are used as steam injection wells and other wells are used for oil production. Two mechanisms are at work to improve the amount of oil recovered. The first is to heat the oil to higher temperatures and to thereby decrease its viscosity so that it more easily flows through the formation toward the producing wells. A second mechanism is the physical displacement employing {{in a manner similar}} to water flooding, in which oil is meant to be pushed to the production wells. While more steam is needed for this method than for the cyclic method, it is typically more effective at recovering a larger portion of the oil.|$|E

5000|$|Canadian Natural Resources employs cyclic steam or [...] "huff and puff" [...] {{technology}} to develop bitumen resources. This technology requires one well bore {{and the production}} consists of the injection to fracture and heat the formation prior to the production phases. First steam is injected above the formation fracture point for several weeks or months, mobilizing cold bitumen, the well is then shut in for several weeks or months to allow the steam to soak into the formation. Then the flow on the injection well is reversed producing oil through the same injection well bore. The injection and production phases together comprise one cycle. Steam is re-injected to begin a new cycle when oil production rates fall below a critical threshold due to the cooling of the reservoir. Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) also {{has a number of}} CSS Follow-up or Enhancement Processes, including Pressure Up and Blow Down (PUBD), Mixed Well <b>Steam</b> <b>Drive</b> and Drainage (MWSDD), Vapor Extraction (Vapex), Liquid Addition to Steam for Enhanced Recovery of Bitumen (LASER) and HPCSS Assisted SAGD and Hybrid Process.|$|E
40|$|The <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> {{process has}} been {{extensively}} used in the recovery of moderately viscous crude oils in California, Venezuela and Canada. This {{study was conducted to}} scrutinize the application of the <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> process for two other reservoir conditions which have not been considered attractive in the past. ❧ The earliest analytical studies of the <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> process conceived of the <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> to create a steam chest which frontally displaces the reservoir fluid. As a result of this assumed mechanism, a marked effect of reservoir thickness was predicted. However, the results of many field operations have revealed a surprising insensitivity of the oil/steam ratio (the energy balance of the process) to the reservoir thickness. This, together with the repeated observations in field operations that the steam overrides the oil column, has led to the hypothesis that the mechanism by which the <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> works is different than that originally proposed. ❧ This study, as well as previously published studies with vacuum scaled physical models, show that the <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> is a two-fold process. The overriding or channeling of the steam results in the heating of the oil at the interface between the oil column and the steam zone, and the heated oil is then displaced by a gas (<b>steam)</b> <b>drive.</b> It would follow from such a mechanism that thickness would have only a minor effect on the resulting oil/steam ratio. The scaled physical modeling described in this work has confirmed this hypothesis. ❧ The results obtained in this study confirm the results of an earlier study which showed the efficiency of the <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> to be dependent on a fractional power of the reciprocal of the viscosity of the crude oil at steam temperature. It was therefore hypothesized that the oil/steam ratio would become very high if the <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> was applied to a reservoir containing a high gravity, low viscosity crude. Contrary to earlier suggestions by other authors {{for the use of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> for recovering high gravity crudes, this study shows that the efficiency of <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> in such a process is not related to the volatility of the high gravity crude, but merely depends upon a high steam injection rate to efficiently displace the crude to a low residual saturation, while reducing the thermal losses from the reservoir. ❧ The scaled model studies reported here show that a high rate <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> is extremely efficient in reservoirs containing low viscosity fluids. Favorable oil/steam ratios may be achieved in numerous water-flooded reservoirs containing residual saturations of high gravity crudes. ❧ This work has not explored the economic feasibility of implementing these novel uses for the steam drive; however, some of the conditions that would have to be met to achieve economic feasibility are discussed. ❧ Earlier work with the scaled physical models have shown a high degree of correlation with the results of commercial field developments. This work has extended the use of the scaling procedures to situations where not scaling the reservoir lithology and reservoir fluid interaction may be of significance; hence, confirmation of the results in field pilots and demonstration projects is required. ❧ A quasi-theoretical description of the insensitivity of the <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> process to reservoir thickness where steam overriding occurs has been developed in this work...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{estimated}} 10 {{billion barrels of}} original oil in place (OOIP) in diatomaceous reservoirs in Kern County, California. These reservoirs have low permeability ranging from 0. 1 to 10 mD. Injection pressure controlled <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> {{has been found to}} be an effective way to recover oil from these reservoir. However, <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> in these reservoirs has its own complications. The rock matrix is primarily silica (SiO 2). It is a known fact that silica is soluble in hot water and its solubility varies with temperature and pH. Due to this fact, the rock matrix in diatomite may dissolve into the aqueous phase as the temperature at a location increases or it may precipitate from the aqueous phase onto the rock grains as the temperature decreases. Thus, during <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> silica redistribution will occur in the reservoir along with oil recovery. This silica redistribution causes the permeability and porosity of the reservoir to change. Understanding and quantifying these silica redistribution effects on the reservoir permeability might prove to be a key aspect of designing a <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> project in these formations...|$|E

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{influence}} of complexity of reservoir properties in porous media and the diversity of operating conditions on the steam distillation rate of crude oil in the process of heavy oil exploitation with steam injection, steam distillation simulation devices are used to study steam distillation rate of crude oil in porous media. Then steam distillation ratio is obtained under the condition of different core permeability, oil saturation, steam temperatures, system pressure, steam injection rates and steam distillation rates with different viscosities of crude oil. The results show that the steam distillation rate of crude oil in porous media depends mainly {{on the nature of the}} crude oil itself, for temperature and pressure are the key factors compared with the pore structure, the initial oil saturation and steam injection rate.

40|$|Heavy oil {{recovery}} {{has been a}} major focus in {{the oil and gas industry}} to counter the rapid depletion of conventional reservoirs. Various techniques for enhancing the recovery of heavy oil were developed and pilot-tested, with <b>steam</b> <b>drive</b> techniques proven in most circumstances to be successful and economically viable. The Wafra field in Saudi Arabia is at the forefront of utilizing steam recovery for carbonate heavy oil reservoirs in the Middle East. With growing injection volumes, tracking the steam evolution within the reservoir and characterizing the formation, especially in terms of its porosity and permeability heterogeneity, are key objectives for sound economic decisions and enhanced production forecasts. We have developed an integrated reservoir history matching framework using ensemble based techniques incorporating seismic data for enhancing reservoir characterization and improving history matches. Examining the performance on a synthetic field study of the Wafra field, we could demonstrate the improved characterization of the reservoir formation, determining more accurately the position of the steam chambers and obtaining more reliable forecasts of the reservoir’s recovery potential. History matching results are fairly robust even for noise levels up to 30 %.
