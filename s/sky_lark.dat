5000|$|Ramases's {{second album}} Glass Top Coffin was {{recorded}} at Phonogram Studios in 1975 in London, but Ramases {{was unhappy with}} the strings and chorus which were added post-production without his permission, and he was unhappy with the cover. [...] The album did not sell well. Ramases and Selket left London {{and returned to the}} country of Felixstowe Ferry. A third album, to be titled <b>Sky</b> <b>Lark</b> or The <b>Sky</b> <b>Lark</b> got as far as cassette demos, but Ramases became increasingly despondent and on December 2, 1976 he took his own life. [...] His death was not widely reported in musical circles until the early 1990s, and by then much of the Ramases history including the <b>Sky</b> <b>Lark</b> demos had been burned by Selket's jealous second husband.|$|E

Unfortunately for the local sand martins whose nest holes were in the cliffs at Glengad Beach, Royal Dutch Shell sent in their diggers and removed the cliffs, placing nets to stop the birds returning. The 'new' temporary cliffs they rebuilt mechanically don't seem to hold the same appeal for the species.

40|$|Aims to {{describe}} the variation in breeding bird populations that occur on different types of Irish peatlands and their associated habitat characteristics. Methods: Bird abundance and diversity were compared between four peatland habitat types: fens; raised bogs; Atlantic blanket bogs; and montane blanket bogs at twelve study sites using transects. Various measures of habitat quality were also taken at each location. Results: Only 21 species were recorded during the study with Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis and <b>Sky</b> <b>Lark</b> Alauda arvensis accounting for over 80 % of all birds recorded. Fens had greater bird species diversity and densities than the other three peatland types. Raised bogs, Atlantic blanket bogs and montane blanket bogs were very similar {{in terms of their}} avian diversity. Each of the recorded bird species were associated with different aspects of the peatland habitat. Conclusion: This study shows that despite the relatively low avian species diversity of Irish peatlands, they are of enormous conservation value due to the presence of species of high conservation concern such as Red Grouse (Willow Ptarmigan) Lagopus lagopus and Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata...|$|E

40|$|New Zealand {{could be}} {{regarded}} as an acclimatization laboratory, i. e., the consequence {{of a wide range}} of animal introductions in the period 1840 - 1907. Species introduced ranged from camels to hedge-hogs, ostriches to <b>sky</b> <b>larks.</b> Fortunately many failed to survive. The majority of these liberations were made by Acclimatization Societies or private individuals, often with Government approval and protection. The most damaging species were several species of deer, rabbits, Australian opossums, goats, pigs, tahr, wallabies, and chamois. The establishment, natural dispersion and colonization of unoccupied habitat by these animals was successful and surpassed all expectations. Pastoral land development in the early days usually consisted of firing large tracts of indigenous forest and native grassland and this practice assisted the dispersion of some animals, particularly the rabbit. The impact of these animals was to upset the natural stability of habitat and damage soil and water values. As a result of these liberations a multiplicity of animal control problems have occurred. Organizations were constituted by Government with the responsibility of conducting control. They have in recent years made dramatic progress in reducing some animal populations such as rabbits to tolerable levels. This has only been achieved by positive policy changes over the years, plus the development and utilization of more effective control techniques, especially in the field of poisoning...|$|R
40|$|Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is {{a remote}} sensing {{technology}} that offers {{the ability to}} collect high horizontal sampling densities of high vertical resolution vegetation height data, over larger spatial extents than could be obtained by field survey. The influence of vegetation structure on the bird is a key mechanism underlying bird–habitat models. However, manual survey of vegetation structure becomes prohibitive {{in terms of time}} and cost if sampling needs to be of sufficient density to incorporate fine-grained heterogeneity at a landscape extent. We show that LiDAR data can help bridge the gap between grain and extent in organism–habitat models. Two examples are provided of bird–habitat models that use structural habitat information derived from airborne LiDAR data. First, it is shown that data on crop and field boundary height can be derived from LiDAR data, and so have the potential to predict the distribution of breeding <b>Sky</b> <b>Larks</b> in a farmed landscape. Secondly, LiDAR-retrieved canopy height and structural data are used to predict the breeding success of Great Tits and Blue Tits in broad-leaved woodland. LiDAR thus offers great potential for parameterizing predictive bird–habitat association models. This could be enhanced by the combination of LiDAR data with multispectral remote sensing data, which enables a wider range of habitat information to be derived, including both structural and compositional characteristics...|$|R

60|$|Though {{dressed with}} Quaker-like sobriety, {{and without the}} elegance of form {{distinguishing}} the swan or peacock, this bird yet appeals to the aesthetic feelings in man more than any species I am acquainted with. Voice {{is one of its}} strong points, as one might readily infer from the name: nevertheless the name is not an appropriate one, for though the bird certainly does scream, and that louder than the peacock, its scream is only a powerful note of alarm uttered occasionally, while the notes uttered at intervals in the night, or in the day-time, when it soars upwards like the lark of some far-off imaginary epoch in the world's history when all tilings, larks included, were on a gigantic scale, are. properly speaking, singing notes and in quality utterly unlike screams. Sometimes when walking across Regent's Park I bear the resounding cries of the bird confined there attempting to sing; above the concert of cranes, the screams of eagles and macaws, the howling of dogs and wolves and the muffled roar of lions, one can hear it all over the park. But those loud notes only sadden me. Exile and captivity have taken all joyousness from the noble singer, and a moist climate has made him hoarse; the long clear strains are no more, and he hurries through his series of confused shrieks as quickly as possible, as if ashamed of the performance. A lark singing high up in a sunny <b>sky</b> and a <b>lark</b> singing in a small cage hanging against a shady wall in a London street produce very different effects; and the spluttering medley of shrill and harsh sounds from the street singer scarcely seems to proceed from the same kind of bird as that matchless melody filling the blue heavens. There is even a greater difference in the notes of the crested screamer when heard in Regent's Park and when heard on the pampas, where the bird soars upwards until its bulky body disappears from sight, and from that vast elevation pours down a perpetual rain of jubilant sound.|$|R
6000|$|In one {{of these}} meditations it {{occurred}} to her that she had forgotten Tom's school-books, which had been sent home in his trunk. But she found the stock unaccountably shrunk down to the few old ones which had been well thumbed,--the Latin Dictionary and Grammar, a Delectus, a torn Eutropius, the well-worn Virgil, Aldrich's Logic, and the exasperating Euclid. Still, Latin, Euclid, and Logic would surely be a considerable step in masculine wisdom,--in that knowledge which made men contented, and even glad to live. Not that the yearning for effectual wisdom was quite unmixed; a certain mirage would now and then rise on the desert of the future, in which she seemed to see herself honored for her surprising attainments. And so the poor child, with her soul's hunger and her illusions of self-flattery, began to nibble at this thick-rinded fruit of the tree of knowledge, filling her vacant hours with Latin, geometry, and the forms of the syllogism, and feeling a gleam of triumph now and then that her understanding was quite equal to these peculiarly masculine studies. For a week or two she went on resolutely enough, though with an occasional sinking of heart, as if she had set out toward the Promised Land alone, and found it a thirsty, trackless, uncertain journey. In the severity of her early resolution, she would take Aldrich out into the fields, and then look off her book toward the <b>sky,</b> where the <b>lark</b> was twinkling, or to the reeds and bushes by the river, from which the waterfowl rustled forth on its anxious, awkward flight,--with a startled sense that the relation between Aldrich and this living world was extremely remote for her. The discouragement deepened as the days went on, and the eager heart gained faster and faster on the patient mind. Somehow, when she sat at the window with her book, her eyes would fix themselves blankly on the outdoor sunshine; then they would fill with tears, and sometimes, if her mother was not in the room, the studies would all end in sobbing. She rebelled against her lot, she fainted under its loneliness, and fits even of anger and hatred toward her father and mother, who were so unlike what she would have them to be; toward Tom, who checked her, and met her thought or feeling always by some thwarting difference,--would flow out over her affections and conscience like a lava stream, and frighten her with a sense that it was not difficult for her to become a demon. Then her brain would be busy with wild romances of a flight from home in search of something less sordid and dreary; she would go to some great man--Walter Scott, perhaps--and tell him how wretched and how clever she was, and he would surely do something for her. But, in the middle of her vision, her father would perhaps enter the room for the evening, and, surprised that she sat still without noticing him, would say complainingly, [...] "Come, am I to fetch my slippers myself?" [...] The voice pierced through Maggie like a sword; there was another sadness besides her own, and she had been thinking of turning her back on it and forsaking it.|$|R
