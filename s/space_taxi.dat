5000|$|At first, Captain Kork is very {{reluctant}} to follow the order to return to Earth immediately (because he, Spuck and Schrotty intend {{to try out for}} a 'Miss Waikiki' contest), but ultimately, he changes his mind. Technical problems ("damage done by martens") prevent direct transport, however, so Kork orders Schrotty to call a <b>space</b> <b>taxi.</b> The taxi is driven by Rock (played by Til Schweiger), who is found attractive by both Kork and Spuck. Rock manages to break through the Martian blockade, but during the action, the taxi is chased and damaged heavily, finally crashing beside the Queen's palace. Kork, Spuck and Schrotty are advised on their mission and are then seated into the time machine, which looks like an old sofa. When the Regulator's forces attack the capital city, Rock and Metapha join Kork and Spucky [...] "in" [...] the device, while Schrotty remains behind. Jens Maul acquires the time machine's manual, builds his own and follows the foursome back in time.|$|E
5000|$|... "Space Taxi" [...] in Mystery In Space #21 (August - September 1954) {{introduced}} the first long-term series {{to the title}} - Space Cabbie (also known as Space Cabby), whose stories involved taking people from planet to planet in a battered <b>space</b> <b>taxi</b> he called [...] "the jalopy" [...] and the scrapes he got into as a result; written by Otto Binder with art by Howard Sherman. There was no indication the story {{was the first of}} a series, yet Space Cabby returned just three issues later in [...] "Hitchhiker In Space" [...] (Mystery In Space #24, February - March 1955), and then had an unbroken 22-issue run until [...] "The Riddle of the Rival Space Cabbies!" [...] (Mystery In Space #47, October 1958). The next few issues featured only short stories, and it was almost a year before another continuing series appeared in the pages of Mystery In Space. A story by Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino, [...] "Menace of the Robot Raiders!" [...] (Mystery In Space #53, October 1959) featured one of the most enduring and fondly remembered space heroes of the next ten years, Adam Strange, in a 10-page tale which led to the best known period for the Mystery In Space title. Adam Strange had begun in a three-issue run in Showcase #17 (November - December 1958), and although DC considered that those issues had not sold sufficiently to warrant granting him his own title, his return a year later in Mystery In Space#53 was to last an impressive 42 appearances over the next seven years. The Adam Strange space opera tales were crafted by Gardner Fox in the best Flash Gordon tradition, with the hero caught between two planets and a love a galaxy away, giant menacing robots, dust devils, perils on two worlds, and distinctive art by Carmine Infantino and Murphy Anderson who drew almost all issues until #92 (June 1964). A number of these stories are considered among the finest of the 1960s, including the full-issue tale [...] "The Planet That Came to a Standstill!" [...] (Mystery In Space #75, May 1962), which won comic fandoms Alley Award for the [...] "Best Book-Length Story" [...] of 1962, and was fairly unusual for the time inasmuch as it featured a cross-over with other major DC characters, the Justice League of America. The following year Mystery In Space gained a further Alley Award, for [...] "Comic Displaying Best Interior Color Work" [...] - a result of the stylistic Infantino/Anderson Adam Strange pages.|$|E
40|$|For {{propulsion}} {{applications that}} {{require that the}} propellants are storable for long periods, have a high density impulse, and are environmentally clean and non-toxic, the best choice {{is a combination of}} high-concentration hydrogen peroxide (High Test Peroxide, or HTP) and a liquid hydrocarbon (LHC) fuel. The HTP/LHC combination is suitable for low-cost launch vehicles, <b>space</b> <b>taxi</b> and space maneuvering vehicles, and kick stages. Orbital Sciences Corporation is under contract with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in cooperation with the Air Force Research Lab to design, develop and demonstrate a new low-cost liquid upper stage based on HTP and JP- 8. The Upper Stage Flight Experiment (USFE) focuses on key technologies necessary to demonstrate the operation of an inherently simple propulsion system with an innovative, state-of-the-art structure. Two key low-cost vehicle elements will be demonstrated - a 10, 000 lbf thrust engine and an integrated composite tank structure. The suborbital flight test of the USFE is scheduled for 2001. Preceding the flight tests are two major series of ground tests at NASA Stennis Space Center and a subscale tank development program to identify compatible composite materials and to verify their compatibility over long periods of time. The ground tests include a thrust chamber development test series and an integrated stage test. This paper summarizes the results from {{the first phase of the}} thrust chamber development tests and the results to date from the tank material compatibility tests. Engine and tank configurations that meet the goals of the program are described...|$|E

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to recent attempts to provide ethnographically and historically nuanced accounts of Africa's mobile phone ‘revolution’. It does so {{by examining the}} coming of mobile phones in one particular place and time: Bugamba Sub-County, in rural Mbarara District, South-western Uganda, between the years 2000 and 2012. In so doing, it extends recent anthropological scepticism regarding the transformative potential of mobile communication per se, by showing how in this case, the most notable effects generated by mobile telephony were in fact those produced {{by a series of}} exchanges of phone-related objects, which took place in a sense ‘prior’ to communication. These circulations effected a kind of ‘time–space expansion’, which allowed for new imaginaries of physical and social mobility. The article illustrates these arguments through a detailed examination of the mobile <b>spaces</b> of <b>taxis,</b> and through a discussion of changing burial practices. Richard Voke...|$|R

40|$|T’ûrot’û (its name {{derived from}} the Korean {{pronunciation}} of the English, trot) is a South Korean sentimental love song style performed {{with an abundance of}} vocal inflections. While this popular music has existed in the music scene of Korea for more than eight decades, it has been received differently at differ-ent times throughout its history. For instance, t’ûrot’û enjoyed its heyday as the dominant Korean popular music until the 1970 s, and it remains popular par-ticularly among older adults (sôngin) and working people (sômin). According {{to a survey by the}} Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) program Kayosho (Popular Song Show) in 2003, 64 out of 100 of the all-time favorite Korean popular songs were t’ûrot’û songs. 1 Hence, this grassroots popular music genre can be easily heard in such <b>spaces</b> as <b>taxis,</b> buses, marketplaces, local festivals, and noraebang (private rooms for karaoke). In addition, the social meaning of t’ûrot’û has been complicated by its rela-tions to successive ideological structures of Korea, such as the elite nationalism of the Japanese colonial period (1910 – 45), the cultural imperialism of the Col...|$|R
50|$|Producer John E. Blakeley had {{no prior}} {{experience}} in film production; {{he had seen}} comedian George Formby doing his stage act and approached him to star in a feature film. Blakeley's modest studio was a one-room loft <b>space</b> above a <b>taxi</b> garage. The makeshift stage was not soundproofed, so whenever the crew members wanted to film a scene, they had to signal the garage to stop its noisy work below. The studio also had pictorial limitations, and couldn't replicate much more than simple room interiors (many scenes were staged in cramped corners). Thus the nightclub scenes in Boots! Boots! were filmed in near-darkness, hiding the absence of set decorations, with a single spotlight trained on the performer being photographed.|$|R

Blakeley's first production was Boots! Boots! (1934), starring the young variety entertainer George Formby. Production values were so low that some scenes were filmed in semi-darkness, to hide the lack of set decorations. Despite the technical flaws, the debut film was a huge success in the local provinces, recouping Blakeley's investment several times over and launching George Formby as Britain's leading screen comedian.
