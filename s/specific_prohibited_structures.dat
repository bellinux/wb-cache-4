A secret sharing scheme is called perfect, if any subset of participants who cannot recover the master key obtains no information regarding the master key. In this paper, we propose an efficient construction of perfect secret sharing schemes for graph-based <b>prohibited</b> <b>structures</b> where a vertex denotes a participant and an edge does a pair of participants who cannot recover the master key.

40|$|Secret sharing is that {{a dealer}} {{distributes}} a piece of information (called a share) about a secret to each participant such that authorized subsets of participants can reconstruct the secret but unauthorized subsets of participants cannot determine the secret. If any unauthorized subset of participants can not obtain any more information regarding the secret, then the scheme is called perfect. A hypergraph is a general graph in which each edge may be formed by more than two vertices. A <b>prohibited</b> <b>structure</b> is a family of the subset of participants such that any subset belongs to this set can not reconstruct the secret. In this paper, we propose a new perfect secret sharing schemes for <b>prohibited</b> <b>structure</b> based on r-uniform hypergraph where a vertex denotes a participant and an edge {{is a set of}} participants who cannot recover the secret. The information rate of our schemes is max{r/(C(n 1, r 1) d + r + 1), r/(C(n 1, r 1) d + 1) }, where n is the number of participants and d is the minimum degree of the hypergraph. We will show this scheme is perfect and, makes the scheme of Sun to be a special case. Besides, we also show that this scheme is better than TUM scheme when given a same <b>prohibited</b> <b>structure.</b> 1...|$|R

A secret sharing scheme is called perfect if any subset of participants who cannot recover the master key obtains no information regarding the master key.

In late 2012, {{the village of}} Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, denied permission to potential Little Free Library projects and required that an existing Little Free Library be removed because of a village ordinance that <b>prohibited</b> <b>structures</b> in front yards. Village trustees also worried about inappropriate material being placed in the boxes. However, in August 2013, the village approved a new ordinance that specifically allowed Little Free Library boxes to be put up on private property.|$|R

50|$|Some states allow private {{businesses}} {{to post a}} <b>specific</b> sign <b>prohibiting</b> concealed carry within their premises. The exact language and format of such a sign varies by state. By posting the signs, businesses create areas where {{it is illegal to}} carry a concealed handgun; similar to regulations concerning schools, hospitals, and public gatherings.|$|R

50|$|It {{is popular}} for its serene ambiance {{and as a}} {{departure}} point for liveaboard scuba diving trips to the Similan Islands. Khao Lak is approximately 60 km north of the island of Phuket along Phetkasem Road (Thai Route 4), one of four major highways in Thailand. Khao Lak is serviced regularly by buses. Phuket International Airport (HKT) is 74 km south {{on the island of}} Phuket. Though Thailand's economy is mostly export-dependent, Khao Lak remains mostly tourist-dependent, with surrounding agriculture and commercial fishing making up a small contribution to Thailand's overall economy. Differentiating Khao Lak from neighboring tourist destinations like Phuket are its quiet, up-scale, secluded coastal resorts; uncrowded beaches; family-friendly nighttime environment and provincial ordinances that <b>prohibit</b> <b>structures</b> taller than the height of a coconut palm tree, keeping Khao Lak down to earth (but subject to sprawl).|$|R
5000|$|On February 2, 2017, GNC {{threatened}} to sue the Fox Broadcasting Company for [...] "significant economic and reputational damages, lost opportunities, and consequential damages", after an advertisement for the chain was blocked from airing during Super Bowl LI. Despite repeated approvals by Fox, the network stated that the ad had been vetoed by the National Football League because of GNC's placement on an NFLPA blacklist for selling products that contain substances banned by the NFL. The letter of intent claimed that Fox had not informed them of any such rules when they purchased the ad time, and cited that the purchase induced them to [...] "spend {{millions of dollars in}} production costs and {{in the development of a}} national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign" [...] around the commercial. The NFL itself does not prohibit ads for health stores unless they contain references to <b>specific</b> <b>prohibited</b> products; the GNC ad only contained motivational themes and no references to its products.|$|R
50|$|He also {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} the wall due to a 1970 international treaty {{between the two countries}} that <b>prohibits</b> <b>structures</b> that may obstruct water flow from being built along the Rio Grande and Colorado River basins. Oliver cites the example of an existing border fence that had to be built several miles inland on the Texas side of the border - resulting in the fence having to cross onto the grounds of a Brownsville golf course - because of the law, and legal implications stemming from the fence's construction. He also points loopholes that may be used for migrants and drugs to enter the country illegally despite the wall's presence. At the end, Oliver shows research that dispute claims inferred by Trump that most migrants residing in the U.S. largely entered illegally from Mexico and that the rate of violent crimes committed by immigrants were higher than those by American citizens.|$|R
50|$|In these countries, {{there is}} no <b>specific</b> law <b>prohibiting</b> the {{exchange}} of sex for money, but in general most forms of procuring (pimping) are illegal. These countries also generally have laws against soliciting {{in a public place}} (e.g., a street) or advertising prostitution, making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law. In countries like India, though prostitution is legal, it is illegal when committed in a hotel.|$|R

Rape, although illegal, rarely results in prosecution of the perpetrator. Haitian law (article 269) excuses a husband for murdering his wife if the wife is found in an adulterous affair. Wives do not enjoy the same right.|$|R

50|$|Double {{taxation}} {{can also}} happen {{within a single}} country. This typically happens when subnational jurisdictions have taxation powers, and jurisdictions have competing claims. In the United States a person may legally have only a single domicile. However, when a person dies different states may each claim that the person was domiciled in that state. Intangible personal property may then be taxed by each state making a claim. In the absence of <b>specific</b> laws <b>prohibiting</b> multiple taxation, {{and as long as}} the total of taxes does not exceed 100% of the value of the tangible personal property, the courts will allow such multiple taxation.|$|R
