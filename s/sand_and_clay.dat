30|$|It {{is shown}} in the {{previous}} sections that the compression behaviour of different <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> (separately) can be uniquely represented using the new normalisation scheme. An obvious step forward thus would be to directly compare the compression response of <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> so that a unified compression relationship could be developed for both soils.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland {{was going through}} a period of turmoil and {{constant}} devastating wars, it lacked modern permanent fortifications. To make up for it, three lines of earthworks, ramparts and palisades were constructed {{on both sides of the}} Vistula. The earthworks, usually several metres high and constructed mostly of <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay,</b> were reinforced with gabions and surrounded by a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup.|$|E
5|$|The rising land {{beside the}} coast, between {{the valley and}} the eastern cliffs, is known as 'The Downs' (no {{relation}} to the North or South Downs). This area has been named a Site of Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area for Birds. The whole of the north east Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The geology of the town consists mainly of London Clay, overlaid with brickearth in the west. The <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay</b> of The Downs are subject to landslips.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay,</b> differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E

5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region One, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand, and deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region Two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in Region Two than Region One. Region Three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to Region Two. <b>Sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay</b> dominate the soil of this region, and tend to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region Four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E

25|$|Moraine State Park {{is named}} for the glacial moraines that cover its land. The moraines were formed at the {{conclusion}} of the Last glacial period, a time when glaciers covered much of North America. A tongue of the glacier reached into Pennsylvania and, as the ice receded, left deposits of gravel, <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay.</b> These created a landscape of gently rolling hills.|$|E
25|$|The Akapana East {{was built}} on the eastern side of early Tiwanaku. Later it was {{considered}} a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area. It was made of a thick, prepared floor of <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay,</b> which supported a group of buildings. Yellow and red clay were used in different areas for what seems like aesthetic purposes. It was swept clean of all domestic refuse, signaling its great importance to the culture.|$|E
25|$|Heavy crude oil, {{which is}} much more viscous than {{conventional}} crude oil, and tar sands, where bitumen is found mixed with <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay,</b> are becoming more important as sources of fossil fuel. Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen, a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield synthetic crude oil when heated (pyrolyzed). These materials have yet to be exploited commercially. These fuels can be employed in internal combustion engines, fossil fuel power stations and other uses.|$|E

25|$|After excavation, {{hot water}} and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) {{is added to the}} sand, and the {{resulting}} slurry is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and the oil skimmed from the top. Provided that the water chemistry is appropriate to allow bitumen to separate from <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay,</b> the combination of {{hot water and}} agitation releases bitumen from the oil sand, and allows small air bubbles to attach to the bitumen droplets. The bitumen froth floats to the top of separation vessels, and is further treated to remove residual water and fine solids.|$|E
25|$|The {{landscape}} of the region is much more agrarian than other parts of Burgundy with pastures and orchards interspersed among vineyards. The soft rolling hills of the area reach altitudes between 750-1,050 feet (230–320 metres). These hills provide some protection from frost and hail damage. The soil is predominately limestone mixed with <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay</b> and the occasional iron deposit. Around the city of Mercurey, the soil has {{a high concentration of}} iron-enriched marl. The diversity in slopes and soils creates a myriad of microclimates that can greatly influence the varying quality of wine from the Côte Chalonnaise, even among vineyards labeled as premier cru.|$|E
25|$|The soils of the Pomerol {{region are}} very diverse {{with a mixture}} of gravel, <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> <b>clay</b> {{scattered}} across the plateau. Roughly speaking the vineyard soils to the north and east, closer to the border of Saint-Émilion tend to have more clay while the soils to the west and south become lighter and more gravelly. The plateau on which Pomerol sits is bordered by three rivers, the Barbanne to the north, the Isle to the west and Dordgogne and the city of Libourne to the south. As the terrain moves down the slopes of the plateau and towards these rivers the soils become more alluvial and sandy.|$|E
50|$|Stratigraphically {{on top of}} the Zenne Group are {{the late}} Eocene <b>sands</b> <b>and</b> <b>clays</b> of the Maldegem Formation, which is not divided into a group. The Zenne Group is almost {{everywhere}} found {{on top of the}} early Eocene Ieper Group.|$|R
