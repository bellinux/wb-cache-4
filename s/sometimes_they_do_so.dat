40|$|Author Summary Viruses, such as HIV, {{are able}} to evade host immune {{responses}} through escape mutations, yet <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> at a cost. This cost is {{the reduction in the}} ability of the virus to replicate, and thus selective pressure exists for a virus to revert to its original state {{in the absence of the}} host immune response that caused the initial escape mutation. This pattern of escape and reversion typically occurs when viruses are transmitted between individuals with different immune responses. We develop a phylogenetic model of immune escape and reversion and provide evidence that it outperforms existing models for the detection of selective pressure associated with host immune responses. Finally, we demonstrate that amino acid toggling is a pervasive process in HIV- 1 evolution, such that many of the positions in the virus that evolve rapidly, under the influence of positive Darwinian selection, nonetheless display quite low sequence diversity. This highlights the limitations of HIV- 1 evolution, and sites such as these are potentially good targets for HIV- 1 vaccines...|$|E

Organizations aspire for performance management processes to help employees develop, improve employee-manager communications, align individual and organizational goals, and help employees and teams reach their highest potential (Pulakos). These four items all drive employee performance and, ultimately, business performance. To align PM to organizational aspirations, companies are changing their PM processes in new ways (see Figure 1). <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> with limited data on results, like when dropping performance ratings. Changes, even in uncharted territory, do generally improve individual performance. Of companies that participated in Deloitte’s 2017 Human Capital Survey, 90 % that have redesigned performance management see direct improvements in engagement, 96 % say the processes are simpler, and 83 % say they see the quality of conversations between employees and managers increases (Schwartz et al.). This is because organizations are strategically implementing effective PM versus doing the bare minimum. To highlight improvements made to PM systems, we will point out changes and results in three key areas: employee evaluation, goal setting, and feedback...|$|E

Firstly, the foundation market is a free market. Foundations belong, according to philanthropy experts Anheier and Leat, to the “freest institutions of the world, as they are not held accountable by the general public, political or market forces”. Second, the world of foundations is a playground for entrepreneurial philanthropists who are eager to introduce business principles into the NGO sector. And remember: giving is not just giving away – it’s investing. The founder of the academic discipline of philanthropy, Bob Payton, sees a particular role for philanthropy. Together with his co-author Moody, he stresses the “advocacy” and ”civic role” of philanthropy, which is essential in democracies: “We have argued that philanthropy plays {{an essential role in}} defining, advocating and achieving the public good. Philanthropic actions are {{a key part of the}} ongoing public deliberation about what the public good is and how best to pursue it [...] . Both government and philanthropy provide public goods. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in partnership – government money is a primary source of funding for non-profit organizations – and other times philanthropy steps in to provide public goods [...] . when both the market and government fail to do so. Democracy needs philanthropy because democracy is not simply a political phenomenon”. More than ever before, with the troubles facing the world today, democratic forces need to act. Foundations do...|$|E
40|$|We {{may finally}} be {{emerging}} from a 2 ̆ 2 Great Recession. 2 ̆ 2 But the economy remains quite fragile. What bankers did was an important cause of the recession.

Some evidence suggests that bankers knew the quality of mortgages being securitized was plummeting; indeed, given the dramatically increasing volume of mortgages being securitized, they had to at least suspect significant declines in quality. They also knew, or should have known, that the huge volume of mortgages being made could be having broader effects, including enormous and probably unsustainable housing price inflation. And they engaged in other problematic behavior, including the use, for themselves and for their clients, of techniques designed to conceal debt and otherwise improve financial appearance...|$|R
40|$|Communications {{consumers}} in the UK do not switch provider enough, and when <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> irrationally. As the government conducts a welcome review of the landscape of consumer representation in the UK, they {{should be aware that}} there is an ongoing, permanent need for consumer representation that is specific to the communications sector. The government’s proposals, by shifting consumer advocacy to the Citizen’s Advice Bureau, are likely to result in an increase in costs to the public purse. Within the current model Ofcom and its consumer panel receive almost half their funding from the private sector. If the body is moved to Citizens Advice, the proportion met by public funding will be higher. The fast changing, technical complexity of the communications sector makes a consumer representative particularly important. Consumer advocacy in communications will be most efficient if it is within Ofcom, but has much more effective operational independence from it...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Large IT {{systems are}} often {{acquired}} in a tender process where the customer states the system requirements, {{a number of}} suppliers submit their proposals, and the customer selects one of them. Usually the supplier uses an existing system as basis for his proposal. He adapts it more or less to the customer's requirements. This paper is a study of a specific tender process. The customer was a Danish municipality that supplied electrical power, water, gas, garbage collection, etc. for around 100, 000 households. The customer wanted a new system for meter inspection, invoicing, planning the meter inspector's routes, etc. We have studied the requirements, how they were perceived by the suppliers, {{and how they were}} intended by the customer. The main findings are that the parties didn't understand each other, although the suppliers <b>sometimes</b> pretended that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> One consequence was that the business goals pursued by the customer were not properly achieved. Among the causes of this were an excessive democratic elicitation process and an inadequate use of requirements techniques, particularly use cases. There were also issues that existing requirements techniques couldn't deal with, for instance integration with future systems...|$|R
40|$|Deep {{cognitive}} activation {{occurs when}} a thought is so accessible as to have measurable effects on behavior or judgment, but is yet not consciously reportable. This state of mind has unique properties mimicking some characteristics of the psychoanalytic unconscious, but following theoretically from a consideration of processes of cognitive activation. The sources and consequences of deep cognitive activation are examined, with a view toward understanding how this state is implicated in the assessment, etiology, and treatment of psychopathology. Thoughts and ideas can have an active influence on people's minds {{even when they are}} not in consciousness [...] and <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> precisely because they are not in consciousness. This assertion is familiar to anyone who has ever heard the word psychoanalysis, but it may not inspire much faith no matter how familiar the word. Much has been said about the unconscious, after all, but often {{on the basis of the}} flimsiest of evidence, and this has left many wondering whether the concept is useful. As it turns out, however, new data accumulating from cognitive research methods provide a more substantial basis for proposing and evaluating theoretical claims about the nature of the unconscious mind. These data suggest that it is useful to introduce the notion of deep cognitive activation as a means of portraying the unconscious. In deep cognitive activation, a thought is accessible or primed [...] in the sense that evidence can be found for its influence-yet this same thought is not reportably conscious. For example, a person may try not to think about something for a while and eventually achieve a modicum of success, in that the thought does not appear in the person's report of conscious thought content. Yet subtle measures indicate that this thought is still interfering with others or influencing their expression, and so can be deemed accessible despite the lack of consciousness (Wegner & Erber, 1992). Deep cognitive activation is a volatile state of mind, then, a tendency to think that does not carry with it the occurrence of the conscious thought. Like the unconsciou...|$|E
40|$|Business ethics {{research}} has developed along three main lines: {{the ethics of}} the business institution and the economic laws from which it derives; the ethics of the business organisation, {{and the issue of}} ascribing moral responsibility to a nonphysical entity; and the ethics of the business actor (Wood, 1991 a). Focusing on the latter level of enquiry, we argue that understanding the ethics of business actors requires to articulate why and how ethical people sometimes do unethical things, and why and how <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> abstain from <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b> In order to investigate this "grey zone" (Levi, 1989), we focused on the moral perception and moral experiences of managers. Managers often occupy a key position in organisations, acting as an interface with various organisational and external stakeholders. Furthermore, managers face issues of a moral dimension almost everyday (Carroll, 2002). Moral philosophers and business ethicists have both endeavoured to define the moral character of management. In particular. Virtue Ethics in the tradition of Aristotle (1992), or interpreted by MacIntyre (1985) or Solomon (1992; 2002), has challenged the traditional approach to the issue of personal morality and emphasizes individual reflection on, and practice of, the virtues and of phronesis (practical wisdom). This important moral element remains ill-defined however. Psychology-based studies have attempted to decipher the process of ethical decision-making, but they have failed to consider the individual as a whole, rather than as an essentially cognitive or emotional being. Carl Jung's view of the psyche (1977; 2001 b) is characteristically opposed to such approach. The archetypal self, representing the essence of the individual, is construed as the centre of the psyche, itself constituted by the conscious, the personal unconscious and a collective unconscious. In a Jungian perspective, achieving one's individuality, that is becoming "individuated", enables the person to relate to an ethical conscience, which is connected to the self and transcends the moral rules set up by customs and social habits (Jung, 1978 b; 2002). Adopting an interpretivist perspective, a study was designed to explore the relevance of this conceptual framework and provide new elements to better understand the moral experiences of managers. Twenty-five managers were interviewed, and seven cases were analysed in depth. The findings suggest that the self occupies a central role in managers' morality, and that being connected to one's self and acting as an individual, freed from the collective persona we often play, fosters moral strength and moral courage, and enhances phronesis...|$|R
6000|$|If one {{of these}} {{supposed}} galaxies is so remote that its distance dwarfs our interstellar spaces into points, and therefore makes the dimensions of our whole sidereal system relatively insignificant; does it not inevitably follow that the telescopic power required to resolve this remote galaxy into stars, must be incomparably greater than the telescopic power required to resolve the whole of our own galaxy into stars? Is it not certain that an instrument which can just exhibit with clearness the most distant stars of our own cluster, must be utterly unable to separate {{one of these}} remote clusters into stars? What, then, are we to think when {{we find that the}} same instrument which decomposes hosts of nebulæ into stars, fails to resolve completely our own Milky Way? Take a homely comparison. Suppose a man who was surrounded by a swarm of bees, extending, as <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>do,</b> <b>so</b> high in the air as to render some of the individual bees almost invisible, were to declare that a certain spot on the horizon was a swarm of bees; and that he knew it because he could see the bees as separate specks. Incredible as the assertion would be, it would not exceed in incredibility this which we are criticising. Reduce the dimensions to figures, and the absurdity becomes still more palpable. In round numbers, the distance of Sirius from the Earth is half a million times the distance of the Earth from the Sun; and, according to the hypothesis, the distance of a nebula is something like half a million times the distance of Sirius. Now, our own [...] "starry island, or nebula," [...] as Humboldt calls it, [...] "forms a lens-shaped, flattened, and everywhere detached stratum, whose major axis is estimated at seven or eight hundred, and its minor axis at a hundred and fifty times the distance of Sirius from the Earth."[11] And since it is concluded that the Solar System is near the centre of this aggregation, it follows that our distance from the remotest parts of it is some four hundred distances of Sirius. But the stars forming these remotest parts are not individually visible, even through telescopes of the highest power. How, then, can such telescopes make individually visible the stars of a nebula which is half a million times the distance of Sirius? The implication is, that a star rendered invisible by distance becomes visible if taken twelve hundred times further off! Shall we accept this implication? or shall we not rather conclude that the nebulæ are not remote galaxies? Shall we not infer that, be their nature what it may, they must be at least as near to us as the extremities of our own sidereal system? ...|$|R
