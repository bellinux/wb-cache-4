30|$|In the {{synthesis}} of n-decane nanofluids, a surfactant (<b>Sorbitan</b> <b>Oleate)</b> {{was added to the}} mixture to promote chemical stability of the suspension. The mechanism is called steric stabilization. The long chain surfactant molecules attach to the solid particle and form a layer between the particle and the surrounding fluid molecules. Such layers increase the potential between particles and impart a repulsive force between them. This in turn can reduce surface energy and thus surface tension.|$|E
30|$|We have {{recently}} {{described in this}} Journal the promising results of detailed testing of the GreenCaps {{in the formation of}} greener one component polyurethane foams (OCFs) under standard conditions [1]. Proposed as potential new solid curing agents, the GreenCaps are comprised of microporous silica-based microspheres encapsulating aqueous glycerol [2]. Adding to their environmental merit, the GreenCaps microparticles, in addition, are made using biodegradable, non toxic surfactant <b>sorbitan</b> <b>oleate</b> (Span 80) derived from natural products oleic acid and sorbitol [3].|$|E
30|$|Renewable, non toxic {{glycerol}} {{today is}} entirely {{obtained from the}} biodiesel and oleochemicals industries; [7] while the higher amount of hydroxyl groups in the triol glycerol molecule (compared to diol glycols) results in both considerably lower percentage of free monomeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and higher crosslinking density of the cured foam, which results in less curing shrinkage and less outflow of the sprayed material. It is also remarkable, from a green chemistry viewpoint, that the surfactant {{used to make the}} above mentioned silica microspheres, (namely <b>sorbitan</b> <b>oleate,</b> Span 80) is a biodegradable, non toxic ingredient derived from oleic acid and sorbitol, namely two natural products [8].|$|E
40|$|In this work, we applied multi-scale {{modeling}} and rheological measurements {{to understand the}} structure-property relationships of surfactant solutions. We used molecular dynamics (MD) and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations to address behavior extending from the molecular level to the micellar mesoscale, the Cates model to bridge the micellar mesoscale to macroscale rheological behavior, and rheometry to measure rheological behavior and compare it to predictions of the Cates model. Starting with a simple surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate, we compared force field effects on micellar properties at various aggregation numbers by MD simulations. We found the parameters that control the shape of large micelles were the Lennard-Jones parameters of Na+ and ionic oxygen atoms, {{as well as the}} water model, which controls hydration of Na+ in the presence of surfactants. These parameters control the degree of binding of Na+ to ionic oxygens and head group packing, and resulted in different micellar shapes. We also studied structure-property relationships of a commercial surfactant mixture, polyoxyethylene (PEO) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>oleates,</b> which contains multiple species and were represented as five “typical” structures varying the lengths of EO head groups and the number of tails using MD simulations. We found structures with more than one tail, and with shorter EO head group that attaches the tail to the sorbitan ring, pack more efficiently within micelles and at interfaces. This efficient packing leads to lower interfacial tensions at air–water and oil–water interfaces at the same surfactant interfacial density. Finally to assess the behavior of complex body washes containing cylindrical micelles, we studied the effects of salts (NaCl) and perfume raw materials (PRMs) by combining results from rheology, the micellar Cates model, and DPD modeling. We determined the relationship between viscosity and average micelle length, and elasticity and micellar characteristic time. Salts modify viscoelasticities of body washes by condensing Na+ near micellar surface, changing surfactant head groups packing, and maintaining the cross-section radius constant. PRMs modify viscoelasticities of body washes by partitioning into the micelles according to their octanol/water partition coefficients and chemical structures, adjusting surfactant packing at head and/or tail regions, and possibly changing the cross-section radius...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} carried out was to develop an {{analytical}} method for characterising sorbitan ester surfactants, {{which could be used}} to monitor their manufacture and establish structure activity relationships. HPLC was the first analytical technique used, however despite evaluating various stationary and mobile phases a repeatable method could not be found. High temperature GC with splitless injection was then tried. A range of single polyol esters of varying fatty acid chain lengths were prepared and analysed to establish the ester species that would elute from the column. Using optimised conditions for the injector, detector and final oven temperature of 380 degC and a DB 1 -ht column, it was found that all possible ester species elute for the short chain fatty acid esters studied. However as the chain length increases the number of ester species eluting decreases, for the longer fatty acid chain length esters based on oleic and stearic acid the sorbitan and sorbitol tri esters are the largest esters to elute. HT-GC analysis of a range of manufactured sorbitan mono esters based on palmitic, stearic and oleic acid was successful with all the mono ester species separated and identified and these separated from the di and tri esters. Validation of the method with <b>sorbitan</b> mono <b>oleate</b> showed that the method was precise and therefore a suitable method for characterising sorbitan mono esters. HT-GC with on-column injection was also investigated and it was found that for the longer chain fatty acid esters more ester species eluted than when using splitless injection. Validation would be required to establish the precision of the method, however it may also be a suitable method for characterising sorbitan esters.

30|$|For {{water based}} nanofluids, only Al 2 O 3 and MWCNTs were considered; {{and the purpose}} was to compare to {{existing}} data in the literature. In general, ethanol-based nanofluids have much better suspension quality than n-decane-based nanofluids, due to ethanol’s increased wettability. MWCNTs were suspended well in water and ethanol without the need of a surfactant; however they did not disperse well in n-decane even with the aid of surfactant. <b>Sorbitan</b> <b>Oleate,</b> a typical surfactant used for metal or metal oxides/oil suspensions, was used to stabilize n-decane based nanofluids. The surface tension measurements were performed immediately after sonication; therefore it was assumed that the nanofluids are stable with minimum agglomeration at the time of testing.|$|E
40|$|When Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate) {{was given}} as a {{supplement}} in basal ammonium sulphate/glucose medium to the yeast Trigonopsis variabilis, it induced the development, throughout growth, of populations consisting almost entirely of triangular cells. This induction was inhibited {{by an increase in}} growth temperature and by adding specific concentrations of short-chain alcohols to the medium. Only Tween 80 among the Tween detergents and Span 80 (sorbitan mono-oleate) among the Span detergents induced the formation of triangular cells, and Brij 96 (polyoxyethylene- 10 -oleyl ether) and sodium oleate were ineffective. These results indicate that the ester-linked <b>sorbitan</b> <b>oleate</b> is the chemical characteristic which is responsible for the effect of Tween on the morphology of T. variabilis, in a system more reproducible than any other previously investigated...|$|E
40|$|Os objetivos deste trabalho foram desenvolver e avaliar a estabilidade física de emulsões O/A contendo óleo de pequi (Caryocar brasiliense). Emulsões O/A contendo 10, 0 % (p/p) de óleo de pequi foram preparadas e, para promover a estabilidade, a adição de carbomer, {{magnesium}} sulfate, {{sodium chloride}} e <b>sorbitan</b> <b>oleate,</b> foram estudadas. O tipo de emulsão foi verificado pelo método de diluição e o aspecto, homogeneidade e características organolépticas avaliadas através de análises macroscópicas. Como testes preliminares foram utilizados a centrifugação, ciclo gela-degela e o estresse térmico. Para avaliar a estabilidade acelerada as amostras foram submetidas em diferentes condições de estresse e analisadas a partir do valor de pH, análises macroscópicas e comportamento reológico. As emulsões preparadas com óleo de pequi, 0, 3 % (p/p) de Acrylates/C 10 - 30 Alkyl Acrilate Crosspolymer e 0, 2 % (p/p) de carbomer apresentaram-se estáveis com propriedades pseudoplásticas e tixotrópicas. As características macroscópicas e valores obtidos de pH, viscosidade aparente, índices de fluxo e de consistência da área de histerese durante a estocagem indicaram estabilidade da formulação. The aims {{of this study}} were to development and evaluated the physical stability of O/W emulsions containing "Pequi" oil (Caryocar brasiliense). O/W emulsions containing 10. 0 % (w/w) of Pequi oil were prepared, and to improve the stability, the carbomer, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>oleate</b> were added and studied. The direction of the emulsions was evaluated by dilution method and by macroscopic analysis, the appearance, homogeneity and organoleptic properties were evaluated. The centrifugation, freeze/defrost cycles and stress thermal were used to investigate the preliminary stability. To evaluate the accelerated stability, the samples were stored at different stress conditions and evaluated the pH value, macroscopic analysis and rheological behaviour. The O/W emulsions prepared with Pequi oil, 0. 3 % (w/w) of Acrylates/C 10 - 30 Alkyl Acrilate Crosspolymer and 0. 2 % (w/w) of Carbomer {{have been found to be}} stables. These presented pseudoplastic flow behaviour and thixotropy. The macroscopic characteristics, the pH values and the values of the apparent viscosity, both consistency and flow index and hysteresis areas during aging indicated good long-term stability of this formulation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to enhance the {{solubility}} and stability of Acacia concinna extract by loading in a microemulsion for topical application. Both physical appearance and biological activities of the extract-loaded microemulsion were determined in comparison with the extract solution. Pseudoternary phase diagrams of three oil types including tea seed oil, grape seed oil, and sesame oil, together with polysorbate 85 or the mixture of polysorbate 85 and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>oleate</b> as surfactants, and absolute ethanol as a co-surfactant were constructed to optimize the microemulsion area. The selected microemulsion was then characterized for droplet size, polydispersity index, and viscosity. Tea seed oil exhibited the highest microemulsion area in the phase diagram because it had the highest unsaturated fatty acid content. The microemulsion composed of tea seed oil (5 %), polysorbate 85 (40 %), ethanol (20 %), and water (35 %) exhibited Newtonian flow behavior with the droplet size and polydispersity index of 68. 03 [*]±[*] 1. 09 [*]nm and 0. 44 [*]±[*] 0. 04, respectively. After 4 % w/w of the extract was incorporated into the microemulsion, larger droplets size was observed (239. 77 [*]±[*] 12. 69 [*]nm) with a lower polydispersity index (0. 37 [*]±[*] 0. 02). After storage in various conditions, both physical appearances and the stability of biological activity of the extract-loaded microemulsion were improved compared to the solution. Therefore, the A. concinna loaded microemulsion may be a promising carrier for further development into a topical formulation and clinical trials for pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical applications are also suggested...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{preparation}} of water-in-oil-in-micelle-containing water (W/O/W(m)) Multiple emulsions using the one-step emulsification method is reported. These multiple emulsions were normal (not temporary) and stable over a 60 day test period. Previously, reported multiple emulsion by the one-step method were abnormal systems that formed at the inversion point of simple emulsion (where there is an incompatibility in the Ostwald and Bancroft theories, and typically these are O/W/O systems). Pseudoternary phase diagrams and bidimensional process-composition (phase inversion) maps were constructed to assist in process and composition optimization. The surfactants used were PEG 40 hydrogenated castor oil and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>oleate,</b> and mineral and vegetables oils were investigated. Physicochemical characterization studies showed experimentally, for the First time, {{the significance of the}} ultralow surface tension point oil multiple emulsion formation by one-step via phase inversion processes. Although the significance of ultralow surface tension has been speculated previously, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first experimental confirmation. The multiple emulsion system reported here was dependent not only upon the emulsification temperature, but also upon the component ratios, therefore both the emulsion phase inversion and the phase inversion temperature were considered to fully explain their formation. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the formation of these normal multiple emulsions is not a result of a temporary incompatibility (at the inversion point) during simple emulsion preparation, as previously reported. Rather, these normal W/O/W(m) emulsions are a result of the simultaneous occurrence of catastrophic and transitional phase inversion processes. The formation of the primary emulsions (W/O) is in accordance with the Ostwald theory and the formation of the multiple emulsions (W/O/W(m)) is in agreement with the Bancroft theory.
