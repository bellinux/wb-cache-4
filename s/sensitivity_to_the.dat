5|$|Severe {{childhood}} {{trauma is}} {{also associated with}} a general increase {{in the risk of}} drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.|$|E

Supportive treatment of symptoms includes respiratory physiotherapy to remove secretions from the lungs by postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration.

Immunization against pneumococcal pneumonia and annual influenza vaccination is administered due to increased <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diseases.

25|$|Anhydrous ammonia is {{classified}} as toxic (T) and dangerous for the environment (N). The gas is flammable (autoignition temperature: 651nbsp&°C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%). The permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the United States is 50nbsp&ppm (35nbsp&mg/m3), while the IDLH concentration is estimated at 300nbsp&ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50nbsp&ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100nbsp&ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes copper- and zinc-containing alloys, and so brass fittings {{should not be used}} for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack rubber and certain plastics.|$|E
