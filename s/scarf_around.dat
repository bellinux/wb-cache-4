25|$|In colonial times, a {{judge in}} Singapore dressed {{in a manner similar}} to some of his {{counterparts}} in the United Kingdom. He wore a long scarlet robe with a grey cape or mantle and a black <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> his shoulders, a white wing-collared shirt, and bands (a linen collar made of two rectangular pieces tied at the throat). Subsequently, the ordinary and ceremonial dress worn by judges was adapted from two of the various forms of court dress of English courts. On 9 January 1993, at the Opening of the Legal Year, the Chief Justice announced that judges would henceforth wear a lightweight black robe over an ordinary white shirt with a turn-down collar and a tie. The difficulty of obtaining shirts with wing collars and the growing sense that the traditional gown was inappropriate for the judiciary of an independent republic were cited as reasons for this change. On ceremonial occasions such as the Opening of the Legal Year, Supreme Court judges wear red robes with a black strip around the collar and extending down the front of the robe. The black strip on the Chief Justice's robe is edged with gold.|$|E
25|$|Beckham {{returned}} to Old Trafford {{for the second}} leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match {{was the first time}} Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2. Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.|$|E

500|$|On 4 December 1997, {{a bronze}} statue of Bill Shankly was {{unveiled}} at the visitors' centre {{in front of}} the Kop. Standing at over [...] tall, the statue depicts Shankly with a fan's <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> his neck, in a familiar pose he adopted when receiving applause from fans. Inscribed on the statue are the words [...] "Bill Shankly – He Made The People Happy". The Hillsborough memorial is situated alongside the Shankly Gates, and is always decorated with flowers and tributes to the 96people who died in 1989 {{as a result of the}} disaster. At the centre of the memorial is an eternal flame, signifying that those who died will never be forgotten. Since 2014, the memorial was temporarily removed during the expansion of the Main Stand of the stadium.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by French duo Jonas & François in London, England. It featured choreography by Jamie King, who worked on Madonna's Confessions, Re-Invention and Drowned World tours {{as well as her}} video for the single [...] "Sorry" [...] (2006). Japanese hip hop dancing duo Hamutsun Serve also made an appearance in the video. Before its release, Rolling Stone said that in the video Madonna and Timberlake act as if they were [...] "superheroes" [...] while they evade multiple obstacles. In the video, Madonna wore a cream colored corset, glistening black boots and styled her hair in platinum blond waves while Timberlake wore mainly denims and a <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> his neck. Regarding the idea behind the music video, Madonna said that [...] "it was conceptualistic". She explained that the video was shot like a march past; [...] "It's a movement, and we want to take everybody with us."

500|$|In 2004, she {{appeared}} on Australian television {{for the first}} time since 1999, playing Dr. Grace Connelly in six episodes of All Saints. The day after she completed filming of her scenes, she returned to Los Angeles for the pilot season. She got a small part as a flight attendant in the pilot episode of Lost. Joseph's scenes, on an airplane set, were filmed over two and a half days in Los Angeles. An early script draft of the pilot called for her character to be seen dead on a beach, though subsequent rewrites removed the scene. A producer liked Joseph and her character, and planned to bring both back to the series at a later date. She returned at the beginning of the second season, when it was revealed that her character, given the name Cindy Chandler, had survived the plane crash in the pilot episode along with other passengers from the tail section of the plane. Despite being asked not to change her appearance too much after the pilot, Joseph had her hair cut, so in her first few episodes of the second season she had to [...] "go through the whole debacle of putting a Rambo <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> [...] head, which just looked ridiculous." [...] Her episodes for season two were filmed over five weeks and were broadcast in 2005. Her character was abducted in the middle of an episode and was not seen again until in the third season, when Joseph reprised the role for two episodes and the whereabouts of her character are revealed. Joseph resumed the role for the sixth and final season in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} police, Taylor {{eventually}} admitted kidnapping Tiernan. His explanation {{was that he}} had not visited Haughley Gill for many years, but by chance had been there on the afternoon that Tiernan went missing. He said that she had walked past him and on impulse he had seized her from behind, tied her hands behind her back with a dog leash, covered her head with his jacket and forced her to walk to his home in nearby Cockshott Drive. He then forced her into his bedroom and onto the bed where, during a struggle, she had fallen off the bed, striking her head on the floor. He said that he had then picked her up by the <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> her neck, at which point she had died, and claimed that her death was an accident. He said he had panicked and hidden her body in Lindley Woods.|$|E
2500|$|Eakins {{began the}} first {{painting}} of Addie Williams in late February 1899; his wife Susan Macdowell Eakins recorded {{in her diary}} that work had commenced on February 26. In it Addie is seen in three-quarters profile in a dark blouse, described as [...] "prison-bar black", with a light <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> her neck, its bow tied {{at the front of}} her throat. Her hair is tightly tied back, and she sits erect and anxious. The portrait is unflinching in its verisimilitude to the lines of the sitter's face and her subtle frown, and has been seen as representative of [...] "spinsterhood" [...] for its characterization of a fastidious and prim personality. Later Susan Eakins recalled that Addie had been [...] "rather worried" [...] at the time. Eakins continued to work on the painting at least through mid-May of that year. The painting entered the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1939.|$|E

60|$|At {{the age of}} {{eighteen}} Christina was declared free to govern the kingdom by herself {{without the aid of}} a regency.

5000|$|According to A Storm of Swords, [...] "There {{were three}} sorts of Dornishmen ....

The salty Dornishmen {{had the most}} Rhoynish blood, the stony Dornishmen the least. All three sorts seemed well {{represented}} in Doran’s retinue. The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright <b>scarfs</b> <b>around</b> their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brownhaired or blond, with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning." ...|$|R

60|$|Passing on to a gray-lichened cliff, {{overhanging}} and gloomy, {{he paused}} there {{to rest and}} to listen. A faint crack of hoof on stone came to him from above, apparently farther on to the right. Eventually his pursuers would discover {{that he had taken}} to the canyon. But for the moment he felt safe. The wound in his forearm drew his attention. The bullet had gone clear through without breaking either bone. His shirt sleeve was soaked with blood. Jean rolled it back and tightly wrapped his <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> the wound, yet still the dark-red blood oozed out and dripped down into his hand. He became aware of a dull, throbbing pain.|$|E
60|$|In {{that light}} and {{attitude}} {{she might have}} seemed some rapt acolyte abandoned to self-communion. But whatever yearning her soul might have had for higher sympathy or deeper consolation, I fear that the spiritual Tabernacle of Excelsior and the Reverend Mr. Wynn did not meet that requirement. She only felt the dry, oven-like heat of that vast shell, empty of sentiment and beauty, hollow in its pretense and dreary in its desolation. She only saw in it a chief altar for the glorification of this girl who had absorbed even the pure worship of her companion, and converted and degraded his sublime paganism to her petty creed. With a woman's withering contempt for her own art displayed in another woman, she thought how she herself could have touched him with the peace that the majesty of their woodland aisles--so unlike this pillared sham--had taught her own passionate heart, had she but dared. Mingling with this imperfect theology, she felt she could have proved to him also that a brunette and a woman of her experience was better than an immature blonde. She began to loathe herself for coming hither, and dreaded to meet his face. Here a sudden thought struck her. What {{if he had not}} come here? What if she had been mistaken? What if her rash interpretation of his absence from the wood that night was simple madness? What if he should return--if he had already returned? She rose to her feet, whitening yet joyful with the thought. She could return at once; what was the girl to her now? Yet there was time to satisfy herself if he were at HER house. She had been told where it was; she could find it in the dark; an open door or window would betray some sign or sound of the occupants. She rose, replaced her hat over her eyes, knotted her flaunting <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> her throat, groped her way to the door, and glided into the outer darkness.|$|E
60|$|Walking {{a little}} carelessly, I {{took a turn}} too far northward, and found myself {{in one of the}} streets leading out of Shaftesbury Avenue. I was on the point of taking a passage which would lead me more in my proper direction, when my {{attention}} was attracted by a large motor-car standing outside one of the small foreign restaurants which abound in this district. I was always interested in cars, but I noticed this one more particularly from the fact of its utter incompatibility with its surroundings. It was one of the handsomest cars I had ever seen,--a sixty to eighty horse-power Daimler,--fitted up inside with the utmost luxury. The panels were plain, and the chauffeur, who sat motionless in his place, wore dark livery and was apparently a foreigner. I slackened my pace to glance for a moment at the non-skidding device on the back tire, and as I passed on I saw the door of the little restaurant open, and a tall commissionnaire hurried out. He held open the door of the car and stood at attention. Two men issued from the restaurant and crossed the pavement. I turned deliberately round to watch them--vulgar curiosity, perhaps, but a curiosity which I never regretted. The first man--tall and powerful--wore the splendid dress and black silk cap of a Chinese of high rank. The man who followed him was Delora. I knew him in a second, although he wore a white silk <b>scarf</b> <b>around</b> his neck, concealing the lower part of his face, and a silk hat pushed down almost over his eyes. I saw his little nervous glance up and down the street, I saw him push past the commissionnaire as though in a hurry to gain the semi-obscurity of the car. I stopped short upon the pavement, motionless for one brief and fatal moment. Then I turned back and hastened {{to the side of the}} car. I knocked at the window.|$|E
