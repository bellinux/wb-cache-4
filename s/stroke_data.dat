40|$|Historically the low {{peak current}} {{portion of the}} {{positive}} cloud-to-ground lightning <b>stroke</b> <b>data</b> set is discarded since it is dominated by misclassified strokes. This thesis presents a self-consistent resolution {{to the problem of}} analysing lightning <b>stroke</b> <b>data</b> sets where misclassified strokes are present, without discarding sections of the data set. It is shown in this thesis that the misclassification problem is present in all the data sets, but is most prominent in the positive cloud-to-ground data set. The effect of truncating the positive cloud-to-ground lightning <b>stroke</b> <b>data</b> set from the South African Lightning Detection Network is that 43 � is discarded by truncating the data set below 10 kA, and 53 � is discarded if the data set is truncated below 15 kA. The statistical distribution of lightning stroke peak current over southern Africa is computed with the self-consistent method. A new measure of lightning activity is established that, in addition to activity, describes the energy of strokes. A previously undocumented inverse relationship between lightning stroke activity and peak current is presented in this thesis. The self-consistent method is extended to describe the diurnal variation of intracloud and cloud-to-ground parameters. The presence of positive cloud-to-ground lightning {{at the beginning and end}} of storms is verified from lightning detection network measurements. The new measure is applied to single storm days and single storms, and from this measure the charge distribution of the lightning producing clouds is inferred. To complement the diurnal and temporal variations, the unique orographic sensitivity of the various lightning polarity type combinations is presented over the extensive altitude of the Drakensberg mountain range. The self-consistent method presented in this thesis has direct application in meteorology; transmission line design and fault investigations; as well as improving risk analyses by providing the true distribution of lightning stroke peak currents...|$|E

40|$|In a very {{interesting}} empirical study, König et al. investigated the ability of two cross validation (CV) methods, tenfold CV and leave-one-center-out CV, to predict the generalizability of prognostic models [1]. Three different prognostic models, based on logistic regression, support vector machines and random forests, were established and validated. The goal of the prognostic models was to predict accurately the functional independence status of patients 100 days after an acute ischemic <b>stroke.</b> <b>Data</b> from the German <b>Stroke</b> <b>Data</b> bank were used. The CV methods, which operate on training data, generally overestimated the temporal and geographic transportability of the prognostic models. No important differences {{in the distribution of}} the prognostic factors between the training set and the temporal and external validation sets were discerned that could explain the overoptimistic results of the CV methods. However, distributional data for the outcome measure were not presented or discussed. The outcome, the functional status of each patient after 100 days, was measured by Barthel index (BI), which is a continuous measure between 0 (total functional dependence) and 100 (total functional independence).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the risk factors for subtypes of stroke (cerebral microangiopathy, singular lacunar infarcts, territorial infarcts) and carotid stenosis and occlusion. Validity of the lacunar syndromes was also tested with lacunar infarcts. Method: A clinical sample of 242 patients with complete clinical, neuroradiological, dopplersonographical and echocardiographical examinations were registered in the second pilot project of the Berlin <b>Stroke</b> <b>Data</b> Bank between May 1991 and October 1992. Odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval were used for statistical significance. Results: Diabetes mellitus {{was significantly associated with}} cerebral microangiopathy and also with singular lacunar infarcts; Diabetes mellitus with cerebral microangiopathy: odds ratio 4. 2; confidence interval 1. 70 - 10. 37; Diabetes mellitus with singular lacunar infarcts: odds ratio 8. 1; confidence interval 2. 66 - 24. 32). Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with carotid stenosis and occlusion, and also with hemodynamic carotid stenosis and occlusion; Carotid stenosis and occlusion: odds ratio 2. 7; confidence interval 1. 51 - 4. 80; hemodynamic carotid stenosis and occlusion: odds ratio 5. 1; confidence interval 2. 34 - 11. 06). Major cardiac sources of embolism were more frequently found in territorial infarcts (odds ratio 3. 9; confidence interval 1. 37 - 10. 98) than in cerebral microangiopathy. The validity of the clinical syndromes (lacunar/non lacunar) for a new or old lacunar infarct in CCT yielded 44 % sensitivity, 77 % specificity, 57 % positive predictive value and 66 % negative predictive value. Discussion: On one hand, the results from the present study were consistent with the Berlin <b>Stroke</b> <b>Data</b> Bank with regard to the significant associations between Diabetes mellitus and cerebral microangiopathy, between cigarette smoking and carotid stenosis and occlusion, and between major cardiac sources of embolism and territorial infarcts. On the other hand, the current study failed to replicate the significant association between arterial hypertension and cerebral microangiopathy which was demonstrated by the Berlin <b>Stroke</b> <b>Data</b> Bank.
