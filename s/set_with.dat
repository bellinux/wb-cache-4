5|$|Given a <b>set</b> <b>with</b> an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example.

40|$|The known {{families}} of difference sets can be subdivided into three classes: difference <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> Singer parameters, cyclotomic difference sets, and difference <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> gcd$(v,n) > 1 $.

In 1997, Jungnickel and Schmidt posed the problem of constructing difference <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> gcd$(v,n) > 1 $ that do not satisfy this property. In an attempt to attack this problem, we use difference <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> three nontrivial character values as candidates, and get some necessary conditions. Comment: 17 page...|$|R

40|$|Mortality in {{longline}} fisheries is {{the most}} critical global threat to most albatross and large petrel species. Identifying and mainstreaming seabird avoidance methods that not only {{have the capacity to}} minimize bird interactions, but are also practical and provide crew with incentives to employ them effectively, will help resolve this problem. Seabird bycatch rates for Hawaii pelagic longline tuna vessels were calculated from Hawaii longline onboard observer data collected over a 14 month period. Vessels employed one of three gear configurations: (a) side <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> untreated bait, (b) stern <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> blue-dyed bait, and (c) stern <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> untreated bait (no seabird avoidance methods). Side setting had the lowest mean seabird bycatch rate (0. 0 captures/ 1000 hooks (0. 0000 – 0. 0000 95 % nonparametric bootstrapped (n = 1000) confidence interval)), which was significantly lower than stern <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> untreated bait (0. 0130 captures/ 1000 hooks (0. 0026 – 0. 0240)), but not significantly difference than stern <b>setting</b> <b>with</b> blue-dyed fish bait (0. 0043 captures/ 1000 hooks (0. 0000 – 0. 0129)).

40|$|Frequency hopping {{sequences}} (FHSs) with favorable partial Hamming correlation properties {{have important}} applications in many synchronization and multiple-access systems. In this paper, we investigate constructions of FHSs and FHS <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> optimal partial Hamming correlation. We first establish a correspondence between FHS <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> optimal partial Hamming correlation and multiple partition-type balanced nested cyclic difference packings {{with a special}} property. By virtue of this correspondence, some FHSs and FHS <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> optimal partial Hamming correlation are constructed from various combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packings, and cyclic relative difference families. We also describe a direct construction and two recursive constructions for FHS <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> optimal partial Hamming correlation. As a consequence, our constructions yield new FHSs and FHS <b>sets</b> <b>with</b> optimal partial Hamming correlation. Comment: 16 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1506. 0737...|$|R
