40|$|This paper {{makes two}} {{contributions}} to the literature. First, it introduces a new, easily accessed and objective measure of the enforceability of contracts and the security of property rights. Second, it uses this measure to provide additional and more direct evidence {{about the importance of}} secure property and contract rights for economic growth and investment. In the analysis below, we briefly review the arguments that link the quality of third-party contract enforcement to growth and investment. We then show how the new measure, which we call “contract-intensive money” or CIM, relates to the subjective measures employed in the literature. We test empirically the proposition that this variable, as a measure of the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and property rights, is positively related to income, growth and investment. ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{efforts to}} trace the effects of income {{inequality}} on growth have focused on redistribution. However, empirical investigation has not substantiated either the positive association of income inequality with redistribution or the negative association of redistribution with economic growth. The authors analyze the effects of inequality in the broader context of social polarization. They argue that social polarization, whether rooted in income inequality or in ethnic tension, makes large changes in current policies (including those guaranteeing the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and property rights) more likely under {{a wide range of}} institutional arrangements. The resulting uncertainties in the policy and contractual environment hinder growth. They find strong empirical support for both parts of this argument. The policy implications of their argument are quite distinct from those of arguments that inequality reduces growth by increasing pressures for redistribution. If redistributive policies per se were to blame for the low growth resulting from inequality, governments that seek to mitigate income inequality must inevitably confront a tradeoff between equity and growth. If, on the other hand, the insecurity of property rights slows growth in unequal or otherwise polarized societies, governments that commit over the long run to particular redistributive policies incur less risk of slowing economic growth. Fiscal redistribution that reduces inequality may actually increase growth by reducing the risks of political uncertainty.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{estimates}} of the land area that could potentially be dedicated to perennial energy crops such as short rotation coppice (SRC) willow and miscanthus in the UK, but little is known about how farmers will respond to the opportunities presented by these relatively novel crops. Perennial energy crops face competition from other, arguably more flexible, uses of farmland, and if not seen as attractive propositions to individual farmers, they will not be grown. Farmers' decisions are therefore a key constraint on potential supply. This paper reviews the policy background and considers whether policy is based on any consideration of likely supply response, before presenting outcomes of focus groups composed of farmers who already grow or are considering growing perennial energy crops. There appear to be a number of barriers to adoption. In addition to concerns over the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> the current high wheat price increases the opportunity cost of committing land to perennial energy crops. There are also worries about the impact of willow roots on field drains and the cost of returning the land to other uses.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes to}} examine the {{position}} that is currently occupied by two doctrines developed by Courts of Equity, as they are applied to relief sought against the legal consequences of default by a borrower under various forms <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>contracts.</b> These are the doctrine of penalty and the doctrine of relief against forfeiture. In relation to security contracts, {{the need for such}} remedies results from a failure at two levels, firstly the failure of legislators to respond to the need for comprehensive consumer protection legislation, and secondly the failure of lawyers to evolve consistent forms <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>contracts</b> in order to fulfil genuine security needs without injustice to either party. Given the accepted views <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> {{it is difficult to see}} any justification for the court's remaking <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> between commercial parties all supported by expert legal advice, which should obviate the need for the protection still necessary in the case of consumers. Accepting that there is a place for such equitable relief, the remedies provided under the doctrine of penalty and, to a lesser extent relief against forfeiture, suffer in their application to security contracts from some inherent defects which render them inappropriate in many circumstances for the purpose of providing a just remedy. If, however, the concept of justice is to remain within our legal system, then such discretionary remedies should always be a part of it, but their place in the system should be that of last resort. They have no place in relieving the legislators and lawyers from their responsibilities for reform. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

5000|$|The case came {{to symbolize}} a {{profound}} transformation in Story's tenure on the Court. Initially Marshall's most influential ally, Story enjoyed {{the success that}} came along with the nearly uniform agreement by the justices in Marshall's Court. Following {{the death of the}} chief justice and the arrival of the Age of Jackson, Story {{for the first time on}} the bench, seemed out of step with the rest of the Court. The Court ruled 4-2 in favor of the Warren Bridge, rejected the petitioner's claim that their charter granted them exclusive rights. Story, writing for the minority, noted [...] "I stand upon the old law." [...] Story's dissent would develop rhetoric from earlier Marshall Court cases such as Dartmouth College v. Woodward to argue that the charter must be read expansively and as such granted exclusive rights which could not be violated without impairing the obligation <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> forbidden under the <b>Contracts</b> Clause <b>of</b> Article 1 Section 10 of the Constitution. Story noted that perhaps the greatest irony of the case was that the Taney who wrote in favor of the Warren Bridge, claimed that granting exclusive rights to the Charles River Bridge Company would harm the community. To Story, the irony was the same legislature that granted said monopoly to the Charles River Bridge Company did so on the basis that a bridge would benefit the public. Story argued one ought not to second guess the motives of the legislature, only examine the charter which was to be understood expansively. Charles River Bridge illustrates the end of the Marshall Court's contract philosophy. In a clash that pitted the interests of entrenched capital and the needs of expanding communities, Story stood upon [...] "the old law" [...] and upheld the Marshall Court's belief in that contracts were sacred and must be regarded with deference in order to encourage investment. Oddly, both Taney and Story claimed that their views ought to prevail as it was required for economic growth and development. Taney stressed the wellbeing of the community as the primary impetus for economic growth, while Story stressed the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> as a necessary condition for investment. Story's dissent also possessed elements of nationalism, in that he sought to secure capital by restraining state legislatures from amending contracts.|$|R
