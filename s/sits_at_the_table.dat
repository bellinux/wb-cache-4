One of the apostles holds a cup and another a knife. In the case of three of the apostles, the {{sculptor}} uses the device to show they are speaking by showing them placing the index finger of their right hand on the thumb of their left hand.|$|E

60|$|UNDERSHAFT. Do {{not disturb}} Miss Hill: I have a {{fountain}} pen. [Jenny halts. He <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and writes the cheque. Cusins rises {{to make more}} room for him. They all watch him silently].|$|E

6000|$|... "Friends, if {{you would}} send me {{to be of the}} company that <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> of Osiris and not at Pharaoh's feasts, you will repeat this foolish greeting, whereof our Lord Amenmeses will hear with little joy." ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--[Dully] Maybe--and maybe not. Maybe I'll get drunk, too. Maybe I'll--But {{what the}} hell do you care what I do? Go on and beat it. [CHRIS turns stupidly and goes out. ANNA <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> staring {{straight}} in front of her.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Seeing {{that they}} will not settle down while she is standing, she [...] <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> They {{gradually}} take their seats. Each [...] member of the deputation in his own way is severely hanging back [...] from any mention of the subject in hand; and KATHERINE as intent [...] on drawing them to it.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> guests <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{and pass}} <b>the</b> dishes around {{to one another}} in the style of a family. There are usually long queues waiting to get in.|$|R
50|$|Should <b>the</b> ship's captain <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>the</b> {{mathematical}} functions speed up; {{the customers}} become more vociferous and wave at each other. Eventually, the equation balances, and the customers become polite and civil once more. The more heated the argument, {{the more complex}} the equation, and the farther the ship may travel.|$|R
60|$|Then young Alboin {{asked his}} father to let him <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with him. No, he could not do that, by Lombard custom, till he has become son-at- arms to some {{neighbouring}} king.|$|R
60|$|He {{crosses the}} kitchen to the oak chest and sits sulkily on it. Mrs Bridgenorth shrugs her {{shoulders}} and <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> in Reginald's neighborhood listening in placid helplessness. Lesbia, out of patience with Leo's tears, goes into the garden and sits there near the door, snuffing up the open air in her relief from the domestic stuffness of Reginald's affairs.|$|E
60|$|BLANCO [ignoring the interruption]--and {{you found}} a man without a horse. Is {{a man on a}} horse the same as a man on foot? Yah! Take your witness away. Who's going to believe her? Shove her into the dustbin. Youve got to find that horse before you get a rope round my neck. [He turns away from her contemptuously, and <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{with his back to the}} jury box].|$|E
60|$|But {{the little}} old lady is not alone now. Old Mr Rigonda <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{opposite}} to her, with his forehead in his hands, as though he sought to squeeze ideas into his head from a book which lies open before him on the table. Vain hope, for the book is upside down. Profound silence reigns, {{with the exception of}} the clicking needles and the purring cat.|$|E
5000|$|We must <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> we must {{shift the}} {{paradigm}} {{and change the}} culture, we must understand that beauty equates to Leadership and young people ( [...] boys and girls) are carriers of Great Initiative. — Princess Halliday ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} isn't," [...] Bruno said, {{in a tone}} as if he rather pitied my ignorance; [...] "but if oo're not even Sir Anything, oo ca'n't expect {{to be allowed to}} <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> oo know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like enough, like enough," [...] {{returned}} Joseph, with a contemptuous laugh.

6000|$|PEW. No chink, no drink? That's your motto, is it? Well, that's sense. Now, look here, ma'am, I ain't {{beautiful}} like you; but I'm good, and I'll {{give you}} warrant for it. Get me a noggin of rum, and suthin' to scoff, and a penny pipe, and a half-a-foot of baccy; and there's a guinea for the reckoning. There's plenty {{more in the}} locker; so bear a hand, and be smart. I don't like waiting; it ain't my way. (Exit MRS. DRAKE, R. PEW <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> R.

50|$|As {{the season}} finale closes, the family <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> eating. The camera changes to a view through a rifle scope. The cross hairs pan around the table, finally {{settling}} on Nancy's head. The screen goes black as a shot is fired.|$|E
5000|$|Time {{has passed}} and John is now {{chopping}} wood {{in front of}} their house while Madison brings out a bowl of chili and they go inside. John goes and <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> while Madison pours him a cup of water. Narration starts about how [...] "Eli controls everything".|$|E
50|$|Don arrives home {{drunk and}} finds an angry Megan <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dinner <b>table.</b> She throws her plate {{against the wall}} and asks where he’s been.

5000|$|... "No {{white man}} {{wants to be}} accused of leaving the battle line. The Negro doesn't care.... people think being from the South we don't like Negroes.(sic.)

6000|$|She {{paused for}} a moment, and then she {{positively}} refused. [...] "I cannot bring myself to ask Mrs. Leslie to dine in this house. If she comes to dine with you, of course I shall <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> but she will be sure {{to see that she}} is not welcome." ...|$|R
50|$|When the House is in committee, the {{chairman}} <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{rather than in}} the Speaker's Chair; the first woman to occupy the Speaker's Chair was the Conservative Party MP Betty Harvie Anderson (Conservative), on 2 July 1970, who took the Chair during the debate on the Queen's Speech.|$|E
5000|$|After Ruby faints {{when she}} finds the cops at her house, she wakes {{up the next morning}} believing her parents' {{accident}} was only a nightmare.

60|$|Joe {{was equally}} as unwilling {{to move from}} the side of the tug, where slight but cooling {{draughts}} of air afforded the long-needed relief from intense heat, and Jim's feast was but little more than a cold lunch when the weary ones were ready to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> in <b>the</b> stuffy cabin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I want Victor {{opposite}} me, with Leo at {{his right}} and Louise at his left. Mr. Stinchfield {{will then be}} able to operate his wires.

5000|$|From the 1890s, {{a number}} of English {{language}} sources relate the [...] "unlucky" [...] thirteen to an idea that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Last Supper, Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, was <b>the</b> 13th to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> Bible says nothing about {{the order in which}} the Apostles sat, but there were thirteen people <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Also, <b>the</b> number 13 is not uniformly bad in the Judeo-Christian tradition. For example, the attributes of God (also called the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy) are enumerated in the Torah (Exodus 34:6-7).|$|R
50|$|An {{older man}} (Hall) {{is sitting at}} a table with a younger man (Kirk Baltz) at a diner {{discussing}} a matter over cigarettes and coffee.

50|$|In 1937 the U.S. Post Office {{released}} a commemorative stamp {{to celebrate the}} 150th anniversary of {{the signing of the}} U.S. Constitution.
