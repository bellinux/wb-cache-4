40|$|With the {{development}} of automatic control and communication technology, communication-based train control system is adopted by more and more urban mass transit system to automatically supervise the train speed to follow a desired trajectory. Taking reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety into consideration, 2 [*]×[*] 2 -out-of- 2 <b>safety</b> computer <b>platform</b> is usually utilized as the hardware platform of safety-critical subsystem in communication-based train control. To enhance the safety integrity level of <b>safety</b> computer <b>platform,</b> safety-related logics have to be verified before integrating them into practical systems. Therefore, a significant problem of developing <b>safety</b> computer <b>platform</b> is how to guarantee that system behaviors will satisfy the function requirements as well as responding to external events and processes within the limit of right time. Based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of function and timing characteristics, this article introduces a formal modeling and verification approach for this real-time system.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} slipstream, the airflow induced by a {{vehicles}} movement, of high-speed trains (HSTs). Such flows can be hazardous to waiting commuters at <b>platforms,</b> <b>track-side</b> workers and infrastructure. Scaled wind-tunnel and moving-model experimental methodologies {{were developed to}} assess the slipstream risk of HSTs in their prototype design phase. The slipstream of an Inter-City-Express 3 (ICE 3) HST was measured and compared to full-scale experimental data. The scaled methodologies replicated the full-scale slipstream profiles and gust results when measured at low positions. However, they appeared less accurate at high measurement positions. This difficulty is proposed {{to be caused by}} the presence of ambient wind in the full-scale results and the higher Reynolds numbers, which reduces the overall coherence of the wake topology responsible for the peak slipstream velocities. Analysis of the scaled moving-model and full-scale results provided insight into the causal flow physics of the peak slipstream velocities. These results indicated that the fluctuation and resulting peak instantaneous velocity are a result of alternating `types' of individual slipstream runs that could be explained by capturing a periodic wake at different phases. A model of the salient time-averaged and unsteady features of the wake has been developed from numerous experimental wind-tunnel techniques and analysis. The wake features a pair of streamwise counter-rotating vortices that move downwards and outwards causing the largest slipstream velocities. The unsteady wake was found to contain vortex shedding from the train's sides and weaker vortex shedding from the roof that interact and merge with the streamwise vortices. This results in an anti-symmetric spanwise oscillation of the streamwise vortices with additional vertical translation at a frequency of St= 0. 2. These dynamics cause the slipstream velocity to oscillate and results in the maximum instantaneous slipstream velocities measured, as the near-wake oscillated towards a stationary observer. The effect of modelling a reduced length train on the slipstream and wake was also investigated. Increasing L/H resulted in a thicker surface boundary layer that increased slipstream velocity above the streamwise vortices. The slipstream at low measurement positions and the time-average and unsteady wake appeared to be insensitive to the L/H modelled...|$|R

30|$|It is {{important}} to notice that these last two figures provide the utilisation rate (assuming 20 daily operating hours) {{as a function of}} the number of movements in the stations; it means that each train (entering the station and then leaving) in reality counts for 2 movements (i.e. the total number of served trains is equal to half of the total number of movements). Additionally the abacuses account for different scenarios related to the percentages of trains which only pass through the node (thus on the main tracks, i.e. platforms 1 and 2), which stop on the <b>track-side</b> <b>platforms</b> (1 and 2) and/or which stop on passing platforms.|$|R

40|$|Motion {{planning}} for planetary rovers must consider control uncertainty {{in order to}} maintain the <b>safety</b> of the <b>platform</b> during navigation. Modelling such control uncertainty is difficult due to the complex interaction between the platform and its environment. In this paper, we propose a motion planning approach whereby the outcome of control actions is learned from experience and represented statistically using a Gaussian process regression model. This model is used to construct a control policy for navigation to a goal region in a terrain map built using an on-board RGB-D camera. The terrain includes flat ground, small rocks, and non-traversable rocks. We report the results of 200 simulated and 35 experimental trials that validate the approach and demonstrate the value of considering control uncertainty in maintaining <b>platform</b> <b>safety...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pluripotent {{stem cells}} offer great {{therapeutic}} promise for personalized treatment platforms for numerous injuries, disorders, and diseases. Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT 4) {{is a key}} regulatory gene maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal of mammalian cells. With site-specific integration for gene correction in cellular therapeutics, use of the OCT 4 promoter may have advantages when expressing a suicide gene if pluripotency remains. However, the human OCT 4 promoter region is 4 [*]kb in size, limiting the capacity of therapeutic genes and other regulatory components for viral vectors, and decreasing the efficiency of homologous recombination. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to characterize the functionality of a novel 967 bp OCT 4 -short response element during pluripotency and to examine the OCT 4 titer-dependent response during differentiation to human derivatives not expressing OCT 4. Our findings demonstrate that the OCT 4 -short response element is active in pluripotency and this activity is in high correlation with transgene expression in vitro, and the OCT 4 -short response element is inactivated when pluripotent cells differentiate. These studies demonstrate that this shortened OCT 4 regulatory element is functional and may be useful as part of an optimized safety component in a site-specific gene transferring system that could be used as an efficient and clinically applicable <b>safety</b> <b>platform</b> for gene transfer in cellular therapeutics...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSleepiness is {{considered}} to be the major cause of increased traffic accidents in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). Until now, OSAS patients' driving ability has been assessed using driving simulators, but no assessment in a more natural driving environment has been carried out to date. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate driving parameters in OSAS and in controls on a road <b>safety</b> <b>platform,</b> and to compare them with attentional in-laboratory measures before and after continuous positive airway pressure treatment. The parameters measured were: reaction time; distance to stop and number of collisions on the platform; maintenance of wakefulness; and sustained, selective and divided attention in laboratory. Patients exhibited much longer reaction times than controls, leading to a lengthening of the vehicle's stopping distance of 8. 8 m at 40 km. h(- 1) and to twice the number of collisions. Patients did not demonstrate objective sleepiness or selective and sustained attention deficits. Divided attention deficits were found. However, they did not allow the prediction of real driving impairment. After CPAP treatment, there was no longer any difference between patients and controls regarding driving and attention performances. Driving abilities are significantly impaired in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. After continuous positive airway pressure treatment, deficits were normalised. This stresses the importance of evaluating attentional parameters in apnoeic patients and of offering continuous positive airway pressure treatment even to non-sleepy subjects...|$|R
