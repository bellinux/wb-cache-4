25|$|In {{order to}} develop the {{technique}} essential for creating designs that utilize an assortment of materials, the artist must first practice standardized styles. The classic standard Banmi Shofu Ryu designs are Moribana, Nageire, Chabana, Oseika and Gendaika. Ric Bansho also introduced a modern designed called Hashibana which comes in three expressions. These expressions are Maru (Global or spherical), Uate (tall and narrow) and Saba (low and narrow). Technical points that an artist needs to focus on when creating a design are: {{the length of the}} stems, degrees of slant, intentional space to be used, number of sections in the container, and whether the arrangement will be right or left-sided. Moribana, Nageire Keishatai, Oseika, and Banmi Shofu Chabana are only a few of such designs. Each design has its own characteristics, using particular flowers and <b>specific</b> <b>arrangements</b> styles, which may be appropriate for a certain environment such as a tearoom. The balance of the plants and flowers, combined with the appropriate container and spirit of the materials, creates a beautiful composition, which incorporates the naturalness of each design.|$|E
500|$|In {{recent years}} it has been {{demonstrated}} that nanocrystalline BaFCl:Sm as prepared by a co-precipitation {{can serve as a}} very efficient x-ray storage phosphor. The co-precipitation leads to nanocrystallites of the order of 100-200nm in size and their sensitivity as x-ray storage phosphors is increased an astounding ∼500,000 times because of the <b>specific</b> <b>arrangements</b> and density of defect centres in comparison with microcrystalline samples prepared by sintering at high temperature. The mechanism is based on the reduction of Sm to Sm by trapping electrons that are created upon exposure to ionizing radiation in the BaFCl host. The [...] D- F f-f luminescence lines can be very efficiently excited via the parity allowed 4f →4f 5d transition at around 417nm. The latter wavelength is ideal for efficient excitation by blue-violet laser diodes as the transition is electric dipole allowed and thus relatively intense (400 l/(mol⋅cm)).|$|E

Objects are often stacked and aligned in <b>specific</b> <b>arrangement</b> patterns to improve storage efficiency. There are typical patterns in the <b>arrangement</b> patterns.

2500|$|George {{was opposed}} to or {{suspicious}} of all intellectual property privilege, because his classical definition of 'land' included [...] "all natural forces and opportunities". Therefore, George proposed to abolish or greatly limit intellectual property privilege. In George's view, owning a monopoly over <b>specific</b> <b>arrangements</b> and interactions of materials, governed {{by the forces of}} nature, allowed title-holders to extract royalty-rents from producers, in a way similar to owners of ordinary land titles. George later supported limited copyright, on the ground that temporary property over a unique arrangement of words or colors did not in any way prevent others from laboring to make other works of art. George apparently ranked patent rents as a less significant form of monopoly than the owners of land title deeds, partly because he viewed the owners of locations as [...] "the robber that takes all that is left". People could choose not to buy a specific new product, but they cannot choose to lack a place upon which to stand, so benefits gained for labor through lesser reforms would tend to eventually be captured by owners and financers of location monopoly.|$|E

2500|$|The vital {{rates of}} a species (in {{particular}} r – the intrinsic rate of increase; see Population dynamics) interact with the habitat quality of an occupied patch to determine local density, and in multiple patches, can result in an O–A relationship. Holt et al. modelled a system where dispersal between habitat patches could ensure that all suitable habitat patches were occupied, but where dispersal was sufficiently limited so that immigration did not significantly affect the population size in occupied patches. In this system the population size within any given habitat patch was a function only of birth and death rates. By causing habitat quality to vary (increasing or decreasing birth and death rates) Holt was able to generate a positive intraspecific O–A relationship. Holt et al.’s model requires many data to test even for intraspecific relationships (i.e. vital rates of all populations through time). [...] Freckleton et al. use {{a version of the}} model proposed by Holt et al., but with varying habitat quality between patches to evaluate parameters that could be observed in species O–A data. Freckleton et al. show that aggregation of individuals within sites, and the skewness of population size should correlate with density and occupancy, depending on <b>specific</b> <b>arrangements</b> of habitat quality, and demonstrate that these parameters vary in accordance with positive intra- and interspecific O–A relationships for common farmland birds in Britain.|$|E
