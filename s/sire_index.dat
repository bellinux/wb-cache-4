If breeding values of all objective traits can be predicted with accuracy {{equal to the}} square root of heritability, genomic selection could increase overall response for a terminal <b>sire</b> <b>index</b> by about 30 %, and a fine wool merino index by about 40 %.

40|$|Selection indexes for feedlot {{performance}} {{have been}} developed by U. S. beef breed associations to help commercial producers with multiple trait selection decisions. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the implications of backgrounding cattle after weaning on selection for feedlot profitability. Carcass data records for 11, 011 animals and a three generation pedigree were obtained from the American Simmental Association database. Carcass traits of primary interest in this analysis were marbling score (MARB), 12 th rib fat thickness (CFT), 12 th rib ribeye area (CREA), and hot carcass weight (HCW). Estimated post weaning gain (EPWG) was determined using weaning weight and HCW for each individual. Post-weaning management strategies of direct placement into the feedlot (Calf-Fed) or backgrounding then placement into the feedlot (Yrlg-Fed) were evaluated. When HarvestCG and percent Simmental were included as fixed effects in multiple trait models, Calf-Fed management heritability estimates for EPWG, MARB, CFT, CREA, and HCW were 0. 38, 0. 38, 0. 46, 0. 38, and 0. 45, respectively. Management as Yrlg-Fed reduced heritability estimates of EPWG, MARB, CFT, CREA, and HCW by 0. 25, 0. 09, 0. 36, 0. 10, and 0. 16, respectively. Expression of EPWG, MARB, CFT, CREA, and HCW had strong positive genetic correlations under Calf-Fed and Yrlg-Fed management of 0. 84, 0. 95, 0. 85, 0. 79, and 0. 61, respectively. We also investigated several potential shifts to the economic environment and how these shifts would influence sire selection decisions based on the selection index for feedlot profit under Calf-Fed management. A dynamic economic sensitivity analysis was performed. The <b>sire</b> <b>index</b> rank correlation was greater than or equal to 0. 872 between any of the dynamic economic shifts. Furthermore, efficiency of selection when a dynamic economic shift occurs between selection of parents and production of progeny was greater than 0. 893 across all of our dynamic economic shifts. It is very likely that the same sires would be selected for profit in feedlot performance across all of our tested economic situations. Overall, the Calf-Fed management system helped to better identify genetic differences among animals for carcass traits and selection index values based on Calf-Fed management data were very robust across a multitude of economic situations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Less than a {{third of}} Norwegian-Swedish Coldblooded Trotters (NSCTs) have started racing as three year olds since the year 2000 despite the fact that large sums are paid out as price-money in the three year season. Recruitment races are {{arranged}} by the Norwegian Trotting Association (NTA) to stimulate early training. The management of young horses varies considerably and a large majority is reared by amateurs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to identify predictors of early race starts in young NSCT horses under field conditions. Methods Of the 801 registered NSCT horses born in 2005, 144 were randomly selected by stratified sampling with gender and paternal progeny as stratification factors. All horses were examined clinically. Further data were collected from NTA and by interviews of breeders, owners and trainers. The set of dependent variables consisted of "passed recruitment race", "start in regular race by the end of the three year season" and "start in regular race by the end of October in the four year season". Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed. Results Genetic performance potential, as indicated by best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) indices, was the major predictor of the three dependent variables despite large variation in management. Dam's index was a better predictor than <b>sire's</b> <b>index.</b> However, the probability of early race starts in a horse with a low genetic performance potential can be increased by a favourable management. Examples of advantageous management factors in the present study were a flat pasture the first summer and early training. Nearly all horses racing in the three or four year seasons had passed a recruitment race in the two year season. Conclusions The results confirm the value of the published BLUP index as an important tool for the NSCT breeding program. Recruitment races stimulate early training. </p...|$|R
40|$|Data for {{the first}} three cycles of the Germ Plasm Evaluation (GPE) program at the Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) were used to {{determine}} indexes in retrospect, for Angus and Hereford cattle, to explain the lack of change in gestation length (GL). Estimates of variance components, heritabilities, and genetic correlations between pairs of traits were obtained. Birth weight (BWT), weaning weight (WWT), yearling weight (YWT), and mature weight (MWT) were used to determine <b>indexes</b> for Angus <b>sires</b> and calving difficulty (CD), BWT, WWT, and YWT were used for Hereford sires. Calves with two-year old dams typically have greater variation for CD and BWT. In addition to CD and BWT of calves of dams of all ages, CD and BWT for calves of two-year-old dams were analyzed separately as well as with all traits. A total of four indexes were calculated for both Angus and Hereford <b>sires.</b> <b>Indexes</b> 1 and 2 consisted of two known components, the genetic (co) variance matrix (G), and genetic selection differentials (ΔG), from which the selection index weights (b) can be found. Indexes 3 and 4 used the phenotypic (co) variance matrix instead of the G matrix. Indexes 1 and 3 were derived from records of calves of two-year old dams for CD and BWT and records of calves from all ages of dam for all other traits. Indexes 2 and 4 were derived from records of calves of all ages of dams for all traits. Expected correlated responses were calculated using the weights (b) for the indexes in retrospect. To determine factors that influence GL, changes in ΔG were made until the correlated response for GL was zero. For most indexes, WWT appeared to have the largest influence on GL. ...|$|R
40|$|Data in {{the present}} study came from two {{separate}} beef cattle breeding projects at Iowa State University. Data set-I included growth and carcass information of progeny in the small, medium, and large lines of synthetic cattle. Progeny were born during the years 1978 through 1990 at Rhodes and McNay research farms. Data were used to evaluate selection practices in the three synthetic lines, to evaluate effects of some crossbreeding parameters on carcass traits, and to estimate genetic parameters and genetic trends for carcass traits. Data set-II included carcass and serially measured live-animal traits collected over a 6 -year period (1991 [...] 1996). Most of the data came from progeny of purebred Angus and Simmental sires with known expected progeny difference and synthetic females from a previous project. Data set-II was used to study effects of sex and breed on growth and composition of feedlot cattle and to determine the best strategy to adjust serially measured traits to a constant age end point. The overall mean generation interval was 4. 11 years. When averaged by line, 1. 82, 1. 47, and 1. 28 generations of selection was made in the small, medium, and large lines, respectively. Mean actual <b>sire</b> <b>index</b> differentials per generation were, 1. 28, -. 47, and. 84 sigma for the small, medium, and large lines, respectively. There was a significant (P 3 ̆c. 05) difference in direct additive effect between Jersey, Angus, and the Simmental breeds for most of the carcass traits considered. However, differences in breed maternal, average individual heterosis, and average maternal heterosis were not different from zero (P 3 ̆e. 10). Heritability of hot carcass weight, dressing percentage, longissimus muscle area, fat thickness, and percentage of kidney, pelvic, and heart fat in the small line were,. 30,. 09,. 21,. 34, and. 15, respectively. The respective values in the medium line were,. 52,. 35,. 33,. 29, and. 07. Heritability values in the large line were in the order of. 31,. 18,. 17,. 31, and. 18, respectively. Sire selection based on weaning indices showed a significant (P 3 ̆c. 05) genetic change for some of the carcass traits. It was concluded that index equations designed to improve beef carcasses need to incorporate carcass information in an index. Analysis of serially measured fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, body weight, hip height, and ultrasound percentage intramuscular fat showed a limitation in the use of growth models based on pooled data. Therefore, it was concluded that regression parameters from a within-animal regression of a serially measured trait on age, averaged by sex and breed, are the best choice in describing growth and adjusting data to a constant age end point...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{lean meat}} yield % (LMY%) and rapid growth are {{important}} profit drivers in the sheep supply chain. To optimise these traits, Australian prime lamb producers use the Carcase Plus Index (CP) for selecting <b>sires.</b> The <b>index</b> originally combined breeding values for weight, eye muscle depth and decreased fat depth, with weightings of 60 : 20 : 20 (old CP). Due to perceived gains in leanness in Terminal sires, and concern over reducing intramuscular fat levels in lamb meat, this index was altered {{to the current}} weightings of 65 : 30 : 5 (new (CP). Given that selection for reduced fat depth results {{in an increase in}} LMY%, we hypothesised that the new CP will return less LMY% and therefore reduced carcase value compared to the old CP Lamb carcases (n= 1, 800) from the Sheep CRC Information Nucleus Flock were collected from 6 research stations over 5 years. Carcases were scanned in 3 sections, fore, saddle and hind, using Computed Tomography (CT) to determine fat, lean and bone weights. Data was analysed using the allometric equation y=axb, fitted in its log-linearised form log y = log a + b. log x. The impact on carcase value was determined for new and old CP indexes in a 23 kg carcase. Within the 76 unit range of Terminal <b>sire</b> CP <b>index</b> values, the old CP Index delivered 2. 2, 1. 2 and 0. 5 percentage units more lean in the fore, saddle and hind sections (P< 0. 01) compared to the new CP index. Across this same range in CP index values the old CP increased the value of carcase lean by $ 9. 27, compared to $ 6. 49 for the new CR equating to a value difference of $ 2. 78 within a 23 kg carcase. Aligning with our hypothesis there was decreased gain in LMY% and carcase value using the new CP weightings. The cost in LMY% represents a substantial loss in daily profit for processors, especially when the potential improvement to intramuscular fat levels is not currently rewarded...|$|R
40|$|Procedures for {{selecting}} sires are compared {{in terms of}} making maximum genetic progress in economic merit. A quadratic index, a simplified form of the quadratic index and a linear index to evaluate economic merit, and a restricted index to improve milk as much as possible while holding milk fat percentage constant, all result in nearly equal expected genetic progress in economic merit. Selection for milk production results in less expected genetic progress in economic merit, the extent of the decrease depending on the economic value of milk production at a given base test and on the test differential. Evaluation of sires for economic merit depends on the economic values and on the means of milk production and test.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare selection costs in cattle populations of 1, 000 to 15, 000 females, with the constraint of 1 % of inbreeding per generation. Three selection schemes were analysed: no progeny test, with selection of <b>sires</b> on pedigree <b>index</b> (NPT); progeny test of sires of sires (PT 3); classical progeny test of sires of sires and sires of dams (PT 4). With the progeny test schemes, bulls were either culled after semen collection for progeny testing, or kept alive. Costs per year increased linearly with population size and showed divergent trends among strategies. PT 4 was the most expensive scheme, ranging from 125, 700 Euro (1, 000 females) to 318, 900 Euro (15, 000 females) with the alive bull strategy, and from 20, 200 Euro to 206, 300 Euro with the cull bull strategy.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{was developed to}} rank AI sires on utility. The utility function con-sidered transmitting abilities for produc-tion, udder depth, teat placement; and foot angle, semen cost, timing of costs and revenues, gene flow, and risk.

Utility was expressed relative to an average first evaluation non-AI sire. Moderate change in the rela-tive weights of production versus the type traits (3 :l versus 2 :l) had little effect on sire rankings (rank correlations above. 97). The effect of changing risk aversion on sire rankings was subtle except when risk aversion was increased to high levels (three times average levels reported in literature). Rank correlation between se-men utility based on 7 units of semen required to produce a heifer at calving age and nine units of semen required to produce a heifer at calving age (and cor-responding expected calving intervals) was. 98. However, the correlation be-tween semen utility based on 5 and 9 units was. 91. Similar parameters could be used in ranking sires on utility for many producers.

40|$|Genetic indices {{for growth}} and carcass {{classification}} are published for beef sires used in Ireland for artificial insemination (AI). The objective {{of this study was}} to compare growth and carcass traits of progeny of Limousin sires of low and high genetic index for growth. A total of 70 progeny (42 males and 28 females) out of predominantly Holstein-Friesian cows by 7 AI Limousin sires were reared together to slaughter. The 7 sires were classified as low (n= 3) or high (n= 4) index based on their published genetic index for growth. The male progeny were reared entire and all animals were slaughtered at about 20 months of age. Carcasses were classified for conformation and fatness, and a rib joint (ribs 6 to 10) was separated into fat, muscle and bone. Growth rate did not differ significantly between the index groups but tended to be higher for the high index progeny. This higher growth rate, com-bined with a significantly higher kill out proportion, resulted in carcass weight and carcass weight per day of age being significantly higher for the high index progeny. Carcass conformation and fat class were not affected by genetic index, nor was the composition of the rib joint. Compared with males, females had a significantly lower growth rate and kill out proportion and, consequently, had a significantly lower carcass weight. The proportions of fat and bone in the rib joint were signifi-cantly higher, and the proportion of muscle was significantly lower for females than for males. It is concluded that carcass weight reflected <b>sire</b> group genetic <b>index</b> for growth but feed intake, carcass classification and rib joint composition were not affected...|$|R
40|$|A {{stochastic}} simulation {{was used}} in the first study to evaluate the effects of international scenario, type of sire, number of selected sires, selection criterion, herd size and planning horizon. Response variables were profit, lower 95 % confidence limit for profit, and utility. Responses for selection of <b>sires</b> on profit <b>index</b> at year 10 or 20 were similar and superior to responses from selecting on the basis of milk-fat-protein indexes. Less favorable economic conditions within an international scenario, use of a 10 -year planning horizon, or selection in scenarios with lower absolute responses favor the optimum of using inexpensive randomly chosen young sires. Under a scenario of average economic conditions, use of selected proven and young sires was generally superior to use of randomly chosen young sires for profit and lower 95 % confidence limit for profit at 20 -year planning horizon in all combinations, but was inferior for utility at year 10. Effect of herd size was generally small. ^ A second study investigated optimum conditions for maximizing genetic response in nucleus herds of dairy cattle using multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro embryo production (IVEP) and sperm sexing technologies. Deterministic modeling was used to compare 15 -year selection responses in nucleus herds with different combinations of herd size, number of sires used by year, female to male ratio and number of progeny per donor female. Adult nucleus herds of 655 to 2300 first lactation cows had rates of genetic gain adjusted for inbreeding depression comparable to those of an efficient progeny testing program. Effects of semen sexing were comparatively small. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} genetic factors, such as breed and single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs), on beef fatty acid composition were investigated in the current study. The first objective was to identify {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) in the thioesterase (TE) domain of bovine fatty acid synthase (FASN) gene and evaluate {{the extent to which}} they were associated with beef fatty acid composition. The four exons in FASN that encode for TE were sequenced, and three SNPs, AF 285607 :g. 17924 A 3 ̆eG, g. 18663 T 3 ̆eC, and g. 18727 C 3 ̆eT, were identified. Purebred Angus bulls (n = 331) were classified into three genotype groups, AA (n = 121), AG (n = 168), and GG (n = 42), based on SNP g. 17924 A 3 ̆eG. The g. 17924 A 3 ̆eG genotype was significantly associated with fatty acid composition of longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of purebred Angus bulls. Cattle with the GG genotype had lower myristic acid (C 14 : 0; P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and total saturated fatty acids contents (SFA; P 3 ̆c 0. 01), greater health index (HI; P 3 ̆c 0. 001), oleic acid content (C 18 : 1; P 3 ̆c 0. 001), and total monounsaturated fatty acids concentrations (MUFA; P 3 ̆c 0. 01) in the total lipids and triacylglycerols (TAG) fraction than did those with the AA genotype. Because of the linkage disequilibrium between SNPs g. 17924 A 3 ̆eG and g. 18663 T 3 ̆eC, similar significant associations of fatty acid contents with the g. 18663 T 3 ̆eC genotypes were observed. In conclusion, the SNPs g. 17924 A 3 ̆eG and g. 18663 T 3 ̆eC may be used as DNA markers to select breeding Angus cattle that have a healthier fatty acid composition.;The second objective of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter I (PI) region of bovine acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha (ACC-alpha) gene and evaluate {{the extent to which they}} were associated with lipid content and fatty acid composition of beef. Eight novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Complete linkage disequilibrium was observed among 6 of the 8 SNPs. Phenotypic data were collected from 573 cross-bred steers. The association of genotypes determined by each SNP with lipid content and fatty acid composition was investigated. A mixed model was used for the statistical analysis that included genotype, sire line, and dam line as fixed effects and contemporary groups as random effect. The genotype of SNP g. 2350 T 3 ̆eC was significantly associated with the lipid content of beef (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). No significant association, however, was detected between the genotype of any SNPs with fatty acid composition.;The last objective of this study was to estimate the effects of sire breed on fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols (TAG), phospholipids (PL), and total lipids extracted from bovine Longissimus muscle (LM). Steer progeny resulting from artificial insemination mating of Angus and MARC III females with Hereford, Angus, Brangus, Beefmaster, Bonsmara, and Romosinuano males were used in the current study. Angus-sired steers had the greatest content of total lipids in LM, which could be attributed to its greatest content of TAG in LM. The concentration of each individual fatty acid in TAG was significantly affected by the sire breed. Bonsmara-sired steers had the greatest content of myristic acid (C 14 : 0) and the lowest concentration of total MUFA compared with steers from other <b>sire</b> breeds. The <b>index</b> of atherogenicity (IA) was therefore greater in Bonsmara-sired steers than in progeny of other sire breeds. High negative correlation (r = - 0. 98) was observed between the content of total SFA and MUFA in TAG after accounting for the known sources of variation from the analysis model. The concentrations of fatty acids were less influenced by sire breed in PL than those in TAG. The content of total SFA and the value of IA did not differ significantly among the steers with different sire breeds. Great negative correlation was observed between the content of total MUFA and PUFA in PL (r = - 0. 91). Because more than 90...|$|R
40|$|Field data {{recorded}} {{in the early seventies}} showed that dystocia (calving difficulty) in the main Dutch cattle breeds occurred at a rate of 15 - 17 % in heifers and 5 - 6 % in cows. Corresponding stillbirth rates were 9 - 12 % and 2. 5 - 3. 5 % respectively. In the sixties and seventies many research papers on dystocia and stillbirth appeared which dealt with frequencies in various breeds and breed crosses, causes, associated factors, economic consequences and factors with systematic impact. These papers are reviewed in chapter 1. Important conclusions can be summarized as follows. 1. Dystocia is a major cause of stillbirth: 40 to 60 % of the stillbirth cases encountered in field data are associated with dystocia. Additional negative consequences of dystocia are increased labour and veterinary costs, reduced fertility and milk yield, and an increased culling rate. 2. First-calf heifers and older cows differ both in frequency and in cause of dystocia. The frequency of calving difficulty in eifers is generally three to four times as high as in cows. In heifers, the most frequent cause of dystocia is feto-pelvic-incompatibility, i. e. a disproportion between the size of the calf and the pelvic dimensions of its dam. Deviations in the presentation of the calf account for a second substantial part. In cows, feto-pelvic- incompatibility is encountered less frequently, whereas other causes such as weak labour, uterine torsion and insufficient cervical dilation are rela tively more important. 3. Within parity, the probability of dystocia is positively related, i. e. increases, with the weight and dimensions of the calf at birth. The (phenotypic) relationships show a threshold character, i. e. the probability of dystocia increases strongly when the size of the calf exceeds a certain threshold value. The probability of dystocia is positively related with gestation length as well, probably mediated by calf size. With respect to the dimensions of the pelvic inlet of the dam a negative relationship is found. The size of the calf and the dimensions of the dam's pelvic inlet are the basic elements in feto-pelvic-incompatibility. 4. Apart from parity of the dam, factors with systematic influence on the frequency of calving difficulty are sex of calf and season of calving. In male calves the frequency is about twice as high as in females which is mainly due to the larger average size of the males. In the North-Western part of Europe dystocia tends to be more frequent in autumn and early winter than in spring and summer. This seasonal pattern is often, but not always, found to be associated with a seasonal fluctuation in birth weight. 5. Dystocia, stillbirth, as well as the associated calving traits birth weight and gestation length, are influenced by the genotype of both the calf and its dam, which results in a complicated genetic model. With a view to sire selection, the influence of the genotype of the calf is generally referred to as sire-of-calf effect, direct genetic effect or mate effect. Similary, the influence of the genotype of the dam is referred to as maternal-grandsire effect or indirect genetic effect. The mode of action of the direct genetic effect is supposed to be relatively simple: the sire transfers genes to the calf which are expressed in the calf phenotype (e. g. size, gestation length) which may affect the ease of birth. The maternal grandsire is supposed to act upon calving traits in a more complicated way. First, the maternal-grandsire effect contains a direct genetic component since the sire of the dam also transfers genes to the calf. This part of the maternal-grandsire effect is similar to the sire-of- calf effect but half of the size. Besides, the maternal grandsire may in fluence calving traits by transferring genes to the dam which actual ly find expression in the dam, for instance in the pelvic dimensions or by means of a maternal effect {{on the size of the}} calf. This is referred to as the maternal genetic component. The direct and mater nal genetic component are suspected to interact. Estimates of rele vant parameters are summarized in tables III to VI of chapter 1. 6. Difficulties are encountered in the genetic-statistical analysis of data on ease of calving and stillbirth because of their categorical nature. At least in theory, the non-normality, the location dependent variance and the non-additivity of-effects involved reduce the value of the usual estimation and prediction techniques based on the linear model and on normality of traits. In the sixties and seventies AI-organisations in the Netherlands gradually started to apply the results from the research on calving traits, those on the effect of parity and the sire-of-calf effect in particular, by introducing a so-called heifer-bull-programme. This involves the testing of young bulls for direct genetic effect on calving traits and the recommendation of low-risk bulls with respect to dystocia and stillbirth for heifer matings. At that time, the data collection procedure was not uniform over AI-organisations, whilst the method of sire evaluation was not optimized. At the end of the seventies the research project which underlies this thesis was started, with two main objectives: 1. Optimization of the heifer-bull-programme including data collection and sire evaluation. 2. Examination of alternative sire-selection strategies to reduce dystocia, with emphasis on the impact of maternal genetic effects and direct maternal-interaction. Sire evaluation for categorical traitsThe optimization of data collection within the framework of the heiferbull-programme is no subject-matter of this thesis, but one of the main results, a mark-sense card for birth recording which is used nation-wide now, is shown as figure 1 in chapter 4. In the optimization of sire evaluation, emphasis was laid on a comparison between the method of Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP), which has optimal properties with normally distributed data, and a pseudo- Bayesian nonlinear method of sire evaluation for categorical variates based on the "threshold', concept, when applied to binary and ordered tetrachotomous reponses. Chapter 2 refers to a comparison of these two methods with simulated data with a family structure consisting of half-sib groups of equal or unequal size. Simulations were done at varying levels of heritability and incidences of the binary trait. The methods were compared for their ability to elicit responses to truncation selection. The nonlinear procedure, which is theoretically more appealing, proved to be superior in a mixed model setting when the responses were binary, the layout was highly unbalanced, heritability was moderate to high and the incidence was below 25 %. When a one-way model was tenable or when responses were tetrachotomous, the results by both methods were very similar. In a similar simulation study, it was examined whether the incorporation of heteroscedastic residual variance into the BLUP-model would improve the sire-ranking ability of this method with categorical variates (chapter 3). Such an "adjustment" was proposed in the literature. The results indicated however that the ability of BLUP to rank sires correctly for categorical traits is impaired by adjustments of this kind, particulary when responses are binary, in spite of a reduction in apparent prediction error variance. This is consistent with deductions from the theory of threshold models. In a third study (chapter 4) BLUP, with homogeneous residual variance, and the nonlinear method were compared in estimating genetic merits for ease of calving and stillbirth under field conditions, i. e. with a data sample from the birth recording programme in the Netherlands. Since only minor differences in sire ranking were observed between the two methods, it is concluded that there is no clear advantage in applying the nonlinear prcedure, which entails more complicated and time consuming computations than BLUP, in sire evaluation for dystocia and stillbirth. The results of these studies lead to the conclusion that BLUP with homogeneous residual variance, which is a standard method of sire evaluation for dairy traits in many countries, is fairly robust against the departures from normality and linearity arising with categorical data. Because of the computational expenses involved in the nonlinear procedure, particulary with large data sets, an appropriate BLUP-model which should at least correct for parity, sex of calf, herd and season of calving is advised for the evaluation of sires for dystocia and stillbirth in the Netherlands. Sire selection for dystociaSire selection for direct genetic effect on dystocia may not be very appealing under the Dutch market conditions because dystocia is very highly cor related, in the genetic sense, with birth weight (r g ≈ 0. 9) as shown in chapter 4. A reduction in level of dystocia by this type of selection would almost inevitably entail a reduction in birth weight which will lower the proceeds from the sale of young calves from the dairy farm. Since maternal effects are assumed to be involved in ease of birth, selection for traits contributing to maternal calving performance might be an alternative. With the exception of the pelvic inlet dimensions, which are difficult to measure and hence unsuitable for al large scale progeny test, such traits had not been identified. Chapter 5 refers to a study into the phenotypic association between ease of calving and a number of, mainly morphologic, dam traits in Holstein, Dutch Red and White and Dutch Friesian heifers. However, the only factor clearly associated with ease of calving was the size of the calf. Since the attempt to identify dam traits with significant effect on calving performance failed, alternatives left apart from the heifer- bull-programme, are selection for direct genetic effect, with the disadvantage discussed, or selection for maternal-grandsire effect. Because of the suspected negative covariance between the direct and maternal genetic effects, it was felt necessary to examine the sign and the size of the covariance between the direct genetic effect and the maternal-grandsire effect. This necessity was underlined by a reluctancy among herdsmen to use the low-risk bulls identified in the heifer-bull-programme because they suspected that these bulls would sire small calves, which develop into small heifers and which run an increased risk of dystocia. In chapter 6 this hypothesis is examined in a two-way sireselection trial with purebred Holstein, Dutch Red and White and Dutch Friesian cattle. Although the results were not entirely consistent over breeds, this study yielded additional evidence that direct and maternal-grandsire merits for ease of birth as well as for birth weight and gestation length are correlated positively. It was conjectured that the maternal- grandsire effect on ease of birth is dominated by direct inheritance of calf size. This conclusion implies that selection of sires for ease of birth of their progeny as calves is expected to yield a favourable response with respect to the ease of calving of their daughters and vice versa. Selection programmesIn the final chapter, the monetary (discounted) returns from three schemes of breeding bull selection for calving traits (score for calving ease, birth weight, gestation length), viz. identification of lowrisk bulls for heifer matings among breeding bulls selected for dairy traits, selection on direct genetic merit for calving traits in addition to selection for dairy traits and selection on maternal-grandsire merit for calving traits in addition to selection for dairy traits are estimated for several calf price levels and incidences of dystocia. The first scheme, i. e. the heifer-bull-programme, proved to increase the returns from a breeding programme in dairy cattle, particularly when the incidence of dystocia or the calf price is high. Within such a scheme sire evaluation for birth weight and gestation length in addition to the evaluation for a score for calving ease contributes only marginally to the accuracy of low-risk-bull identification, at least when the latter is based on about 200 progeny per <b>sire.</b> Selection <b>indices</b> for direct genetic or maternal-grandsire effects on calving traits reduced the incidence of dystocia only at low calf prices (upto about Dfl 5. 00 per kg). In the normal calf price range in the Netherlands (Dfl 7. 50 - Dfl 15. 00 per kg) either type of selection, if advisable at all, should be for an increase in birth weight in spite of a corresponding rise in incidence of dystocia. This is due to the highly positive genetic correlation between dystocia and birth weight. Because of a reduced intensity of selection for dairy traits, the impact of additional selection for birth weight on the total returns from the selection of breeding bulls in dairy cattle is either negative, or only marginally positive however. Consequently, the heifer-bull-programme is the most attractive breeding strategy to reduce dystocia...|$|R
