50|$|Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has {{primarily}} substituted the psychoanalytic {{and dynamic}} {{approach in the}} treatment of kleptomania. Numerous behavioural approaches have been recommended as helpful according to several cases stated in the literature. They include: hidden sensitisation by unpleasant images of nausea and vomiting, aversion therapy (for example, aversive holding of breath to achieve a slightly painful feeling every time a desire to steal or the act is imagined), and systematic desensitisation. In certain instances, the use of combining <b>several</b> <b>methods</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> hidden sensitisation along with exposure and response prevention were applied. Even though the approaches used in CBT need more research and investigation in kleptomania, success in combining these methods with medication was illustrated over the use of drug treatment as the single method of treatment.|$|E

In the third attempt, which involves setting fire to his uncle's car garage, Phillip accidentally causes the death of Leah's father.

When attempting to confess, Phillip sees the ghost of Leah's father, who attempts to pressure Phillip and make him feel guilty for his acts. Phillip then attempts to confess to Leah's brother Dane, who pulls a knife on Phillip but does not hurt him and instead tells Phillip not to tell Leah about the arson.|$|E

50|$|Physical {{objects that}} people imagine {{rotating}} {{in everyday life}} have many properties, such as textures, shapes, and colors. A study at the University of California Santa Barbara was conducted to specifically test {{the extent to which}} visual information, such as color, is represented during mental rotation. This study used <b>several</b> <b>methods</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> reaction time studies, verbal protocol analysis, and eye tracking. In the initial reaction time experiments, those with poor rotational ability were affected by the colors of the image, whereas those with good rotational ability were not. Overall, those with poor ability were faster and more accurate identifying images that were consistently colored. The verbal protocol analysis showed that the subjects with low spatial ability mentioned color in their mental rotation tasks more often than participants with high spatial ability. One thing that can be shown through this experiment is that those with higher rotational ability will be less likely to represent color in their mental rotation. Poor rotators {{will be more likely to}} represent color in their mental rotation using piecemeal strategies (Khooshabeh & Hegarty, 2008).|$|E

As this millennium is in progress, only its first decade, the 2000s (decade), can {{be the subject of}} the conventional historian's attention. The remaining part of the 21st century and longer-term trends are researched by futures studies, an approach that uses various models and <b>several</b> <b>methods</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> [...] "forecasting" [...] and [...] "backcasting").

A famous quote by George Santayana has it that [...] "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." [...] Arnold J. Toynbee, in his monumental Study of History, sought regularities in {{the rise and fall of}} civilizations. In a more popular vein, Will and Ariel Durant devoted a 1968 book, The Lessons of History, to a discussion of [...] "events and comments that might illuminate present affairs, future possibilities... and the conduct of states."

5000|$|The {{collective}} {{originated in}} 1969 with University of Chicago student Heather Booth, who helped her friend's sister find an abortion provider. The founders of Jane initially focused {{their attention on}} providing women access to competent physicians willing to provide abortion services. They found a physician they called [...] "Mike" [...] {{who was willing to}} work with them. After creating a close relationship with Mike they found out that he actually wasn't really a physician and some Jane activists have characterized him as a [...] "con man." [...] However, many of the techniques he used were safe and effective. The women of Jane then decided to cut out the middleman and perform the abortions themselves. Mike taught the women his technique, and from then on the women performed the abortions themselves. The women were taught <b>several</b> <b>methods,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the cannula method for early stage abortions, and the super coil method used in later stage abortions which caused the women to miscarry, but the most widely used was the D&C (dilation and curettage) method. The D&C method involved the opening of the cervix and the insertion of a curette that was used to scrape the walls of the uterus to extract the fetus and placenta.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of Gods in Ar Ciel: one is the [...] "Wills of the Planet" [...] that created the {{entirety}} of Ar Ciel from the Planetary Core where they reside, and the second are the [...] "Reyvateil Origins" [...] that are mentioned later on the article.The term [...] "Wills of the Planet" [...] refers to the souls that compose Planet Ar Ciel, {{as well as the}} agglomeration of said souls. The first Wills are called the [...] "Wills of Origin", as they are the three original Wills that created Ar Ciel: [...] "Juklizda", [...] "Clyuue" [...] and [...] "Horus", and the other Wills were derived from them as they were needed for the structuring of the Planet. A countless number of Wills of the Planet exist in Ar Ciel, but at the current point in time in which the games take place: the Third Era, several of them have faded away, but their number is roughly equal to that of the humans that still live on it.The Wills of the Planet are also called the [...] "Children of the Planet", and while normally they don't have a physical form, in extremely rare occasions they can manifest themselves in a physical form through <b>several</b> <b>methods</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> [...] "materialization", [...] "possession" [...] and [...] "reincarnation". It is due to these appearances and the great power they wield that the humans and Teru have come to recognize them as [...] "Gods".While the way the humans regard the Wills of the Planet varies from a region to other, the typical way in which they view them is as [...] "beings that should feared and revered due to their great power", which is especially true in the region of Sol Cluster due to how strongly they revered the Gods. On the other hand, the Teru regard the Wills of the Planet as [...] "friends from a nearby world" [...] due to their higher sensibility and the multiple times {{they have been able to}} establish contact with them; especially in the region of [...] "Syestine", which is considered as the holy ground of the Teru and the place where the Third Tower of Ar tonelico was built many years later. This region was a treasure trove of Songstones, as well as the point where it was the easiest to contact the Wills of the Planet, which led to it being called the [...] "place where the truth of the world is gathered".Furthermore, the twelve major Wills of the Planet receive the name of [...] "The Twelve Gods of Starcircling" [...] in Ar Ciel's mythology. And while it may be a bit out of the topic at hand, the Wills that give form to the star cluster and solar system to which Ar Ciel belongs are beings of a much higher order, of which the Wills of the Planet recognize Sol (the Will of Ar Ciel's Sun) as their main God.|$|E
