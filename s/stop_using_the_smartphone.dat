40|$|Fruit tree canker (Neonectria ditissima syn. Nectria galligena Bres.) is an {{important}} fungal disease in apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.). Leaf fall is the predominant infection period for this disease. However, in The Netherlands and Belgium, no historical data on leaf fall of apple are available. In practice, collecting leaf fall data is a problem. An innovative approach was chosen to collect leaf fall data and introduce the Nectria model, according to Latorre, to fruit tree growers at the same time. An Android 2. 2 Nectria application was developed. During leaf fall, growers received advice twice a week and <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> application to send data and pictures, directly from the field. The general response of the first fruit tree growers who <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> was very positive...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smartphone</b> Video Guidance Sensor (SVGS) is a miniature, {{self-contained}} autonomous rendezvous and docking sensor developed using {{a commercial}} off <b>the</b> shelf Android-based <b>smartphone.</b> SVGS enables proximity operations and formation flying capabilities for small satellite platforms. SVGS determines the relative position and orientation between two cubesats or other small satellites. The sensor performs pose estimation by illuminating and capturing {{an image of}} retroreflective targets mounted in a known pattern on <b>the</b> target spacecraft <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> camera and flash. The resulting image is then processed using a modification of algorithms originally developed at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center for the Advanced Video Guidance Sensor (AVGS), which successfully flew on the Demonstration for Autonomous Rendezvous Technology (DART) and Orbital Express missions. These algorithms use simple geometric photogrammetry techniques to determine the six-degree of freedom state of one spacecraft relative to the other. All image processing and computational requirements are performed <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>smartphone’s</b> processing capabilities, and the resulting calculated relative state is then provided to the host spacecraft’s other guidance, navigation, and control subsystems...|$|R
