50|$|Landing {{platforms}} {{are the two}} platforms(at the two ends) {{that house}} the curved sections of the tracks, {{as well as the}} gears and motors that drive the stairs. The top platform usually contains the motor assembly and the main drive gear, while the bottom holds the <b>step</b> <b>return</b> idler <b>sprockets.</b> These sections also anchor the ends of the escalator truss. Each platform also has a floor and a comb plate. The floor plate provides a place for the passengers to stand before they step onto the moving stairs, flush {{with the rest of the}} floor and usually hinged to allow easy maintenance access, while the comb plate lies between the stationary floor plate and the moving step, so named for the cleats on its edge which mesh with the matching cleats on each step (and resemble a comb). The interlocking cleats help to minimize the gap between the stairs and landing, preventing objects or persons from becoming caught in it.|$|R
