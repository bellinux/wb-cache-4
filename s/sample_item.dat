25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but as {{you get to the}} second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “The connection between you and a wild animal (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of the}} nature connectedness construct.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers {{typically}} measure ambivalent sexism at {{the individual}} level. The primary method used to measure an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), created by Glick and Fiske in 1996. The ASI is a 22-item self-report measure of sexism on which respondents indicate their level of agreement with various statements, which are placed on a 6-point Likert scale. It is composed of two sub-scales that may be independently calculated for sub-scale scores or may be averaged for an overall composite sexism score. The first sub-scale is the hostile sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items designed to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility, as previously defined. A <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> from the hostile sexism sub-scale is [...] "Women are too easily offended." [...] The second sub-scale is the benevolent sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items that aim to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy, as previously defined. A <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> from the benevolent sexism sub-scale is [...] "Women should be cherished and protected by men." ...|$|E

The most widely used objective test of personality is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) which was originally designed to distinguish individuals with different psychological problems. Since then, it has become popular as a means of attempting to identify personality characteristics of people in many every-day settings. [...] In addition to self-report inventories, there are many other methods for assessing personality, including observational measures, peer-report studies, and projective tests (e.g. the TAT and Ink Blots).|$|E

5000|$|Job embeddedness is {{primarily}} assessed {{using one of}} two measures, a composite scale developed by the scholars who introduced the concept, and a global measure of job embeddedness. [...] The developers of the composite scale designed the measure to quantify the six dimensions of job embeddedness: fit, sacrifice, and links, both on-the-job and off-the-job. Test administrators report results with an overall score that is {{the average of the}} scores for each of six dimensions. The initial composite measure consisted of 48 items thought to represent predictors of an individual's embeddedness on and off the job. The more items endorsed by the examinee, the more embedded the individual is in the job, and higher levels of embeddedness imply a lower likelihood of quitting. A shorter, 21-item composite scale has been used (e.g.,) that similarly predicts voluntary quitting. Most of the items are likert-type items such that the responses indicate the level of agreement or disagreement with the statement. Several fill in the blank and yes/no items are also included. [...] The following table gives a <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> for each of the six dimensions.|$|E
50|$|A {{first article}} {{inspection}} (FAI) is a design verification and design history file and a formal method of providing a reported measurement for a given manufacturing process. Both the supplier and purchaser perform the First Article on the ordered product. The evaluation method consists of comparing supplier and purchasers results from measuring the properties and geometry of an initial <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> against given specifications, for example a drawing. Items to be checked by the supplier and purchaser FAI are wide and varied and may include distances between edges, positions of holes, diameters and shapes of holes, weight, density, stiffness, color or surface finish. Despite the name, the inspected article {{may not necessarily be}} the 'first' produced, but a random sample of 3 parts from the first lot provided to the purchaser. First article inspection is typically called for in a purchase order contract between the producer and buyer of some manufactured article, both perform the First Article inspection to ensure that the production process reliably produces what is intended, design verification of the print, and is part of the purchasing, and design control requirements.|$|E

40|$|Classic {{studies of}} visual {{short-term}} memory (VSTM) found that presenting memory items either sequentially or simultaneously {{does not affect}} recognition accuracy of the remembered items. Other studies also suggest that capacity of VSTM benefits from formation of bound object-based representations leading to no cost of remembering multi-feature items. According to these ideas, we aimed to examine the role of temporal and featural separation of memory items in VSTM change detection, (1) if <b>sample</b> <b>items</b> are separated across different temporal moments and (2) if across different feature dimensions. In a series of change detection experiments, we asked participants to report a change between a sample and a test display with a brief delay in between. In experiment 1, the <b>sample</b> <b>items</b> were split into two sets with a different onset time. In experiment 2, the <b>sample</b> <b>items</b> were split across two different feature dimensions (e. g., half color and half orientation). The change detection accuracy in Experiment 1 showed no substantial drop when the memory items were separated into two onset groups compared to simultaneous onset. The accuracy did not drop either when the features of <b>sample</b> <b>items</b> were split across two different feature groups compared to when were not split. The results indicate that temporal and featural separation of VWM items does not {{play a significant role}} for VSTM-based change detection...|$|R

3000|$|The 21 -item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21; Lovibond and Lovibond, [1995]) {{was used}} to measure the {{presence}} of negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The depression subscale measures hopelessness, anhedonia, lack of interest, and a <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “I felt that life was meaningless”. The anxiety subscale is an indication of one’s subjective experience of autonomic arousal and anxious affect, and a <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “I felt I was close to panic”. The stress subscale assesses levels of chronic non-specific arousal such as being easily agitated or irritable, and having difficulty relaxing, and a <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “I found it difficult to relax”. For each item, participants were asked to indicate {{the degree to which the}} statement applied to them over the past week, on a scale of 0 (Did not apply to me at all) to 3 (Applied to me very much, or most of the time). Scores of each of the subscales were calculated by summing the scores of the seven items in each subscale and multiplied by two to obtain comparable scores to the published norms for the DASS. The DASS has been shown to have high internal consistency and temporal reliability (Lovibond and Lovibond, [1995]), as well as good convergent and discriminant validity (Antony et al., [1998]). In the current study, alpha coefficients for the depression, anxiety and stress subscales were [...]. 88, [...]. 80, and [...]. 84, respectively.|$|E
