25|$|Most <b>strains</b> <b>used</b> by {{molecular}} biologists are derivatives of E. coli K-12, and possess both Dam and Dcm, {{but there}} are commercially available strains that are dam-/dcm- (lack of activity of either methylase). In fact, {{it is possible to}} unmethylate the DNA extracted from dam+/dcm+ strains by transforming it into dam-/dcm- strains. This would help digest sequences that are not being recognized by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} {{efficacy of}} probiotic AAD prevention {{is dependent on}} the probiotic <b>strain(s)</b> <b>used</b> and on the dosage. The Cochrane review (2015) recommends for children Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day, given the modest number need to treat and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. The same review states that probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events, for example severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children.|$|E

25|$|Like many {{varieties}} (such as Pinot noir) with ancient pedigree, the Nebbiolo vine is genetically unstable {{and prone to}} mutation. As of 2001, there were around 40 different clones of Nebbiolo identified. The three main <b>strains</b> <b>used</b> for winemaking are Lampia, Michet and Rosé Nebbiolo (which is distinct from the grape variety called Nebbiolo Rosé). Rosé Nebbiolo has fallen out of favor in recent years due to its wine's light coloring. The Lampia strain adapts best to different soil types. Perhaps due to inbreeding in Nebbiolo's lineage, the vine is very prone to grape diseases caused by viruses. Viral infection of the Lampia strain causes the cane of the vine to fork, or split, giving rise to the Michet type, which adapts poorly to different soil types. Its smaller bunches and lower yields cause it to produce highly concentrated wines. In many vineyards, producers will maintain a variety of Nebbiolo clones {{in order to maximize}} their wines' complexity.|$|E

Aside {{from the common}} American or English stock, the two main outbred strains in laboratory use are the Hartley and Dunkin-Hartley; these English strains are albino, although pigmented strains are also available. Inbred strains are less common and are usually used for very specific research, such as immune system molecular biology. Of the inbred strains that have been created, the two still used with any frequency are, following Sewall Wright's designations, [...] "Strain 2" [...] and [...] "Strain 13".|$|E
