50|$|Pyromorpha dimidiata, the orange-patched <b>smoky</b> <b>moth,</b> is {{a species}} of leaf skeletonizer moth of the Zygaenidae family found in eastern North America.|$|E
50|$|Neoprocris floridana, the laurelcherry <b>smoky</b> <b>moth,</b> is {{a species}} of moth {{belonging}} to the Zygaenidae family. It {{has been found in}} the southeastern United States, where all recordings have occurred in Florida {{with the exception of one}} in Lee County, Alabama. As its name suggests it is thought to feed primarily on laurelcherry trees (Prunus caroliniana). Because p. caroliniana is found throughout the southeast, it is reasonable to suspect these species migrate through and inhabit multiple, if not all, southeastern states.|$|E
40|$|Members in {{the family}} Zygaenidae are {{variously}} referred to as burnet <b>moths</b> (Barlow, 1982), <b>smoky</b> <b>moths</b> (Evans, 2007), or foresters (Zborowski & Edwards, 2007). There are approximately 1, 200 species in this family, which has a worldwide distribution, with the highest diversity in tropical and subtropical Asia and the Palaearctic region (Niehuis e...|$|R
50|$|The Zygaenidae moths are {{a family}} of Lepidoptera. The {{majority}} of zygaenids are tropical, but they are nevertheless quite well represented in temperate regions. Some of the 1000 or so species {{are commonly known as}} burnet or forester moths, often qualified by the number of spots, although other families also have 'foresters'. They are also sometimes called <b>smoky</b> <b>moths.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Zygaenidae (burnets and <b>smoky</b> <b>moths)</b> are {{a charismatic}} and {{widespread}} family of Microlepidoptera with unusual adult and larval biologies. Many lineages are well studied, especially the Zygaeninae {{of the western}} Palaearctic. Adult <b>smoky</b> <b>moths</b> of North America, all of the subfamily Procridinae, are often poorly represented in collections and are in many cases need of taxonomic study. Zygaenid diversity in North America north of Mexico amounts to about 23 described native species (with potentially 3 - 4 undescribed) and one established exotic species, with the majority found in the deserts and adjacent mountain ranges of Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. For most Nearctic species, little is known of their life history, larval morphology, or ecology. This paper details many of the anatomical features and biological aspects of procridine caterpillars north of Mexico based on wild-caught and lab-reared specimens. Larvae share a “mouth-like” gland associated with the spiracles on A 2 and A 7 and an eversible gland {{at the base of}} the first thoracic leg, both of unknown function. Microscopically barbed setae likely play a role in the ability of larvae to cause adverse dermatological reactions (erucism). Larvae of twenty species representing all eight native genera are described in detail and a preliminary larval species key is presented. Hostplant and other life history data for many species are provided here for the first time. All described Nearctic Zygaenidae north of Mexico can be positively identified by their larvae so far as known, although species concepts in Acoloithus, Harrisina, and perhaps other genera are still in need of further study. Both of these genera and Triprocris appear to have cryptic undescribed species in North America. Based on larval morphology and life history data, I propose moving Neofelderia rata into the genus Neoilliberis and thus refer to this species as Neoilliberis rata new comb. throughout...|$|R
50|$|Animals {{that live}} on Mount Bogong have all found {{some way to}} adapt to the {{environment}} which is very harsh. Animals that live on Mount Bogong include pygmy possum, bogong <b>moth,</b> <b>smoky</b> mouse, broad toothed rat, powerful owl, spotted tree frog and she-oak skink.|$|R
50|$|Luzula {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the <b>Smoky</b> Wainscot. Several <b>moths</b> of the genus Coleophora have been observed on the plants. Coleophora biforis and C. otidipennella feed exclusively on Luzula. C. antennariella is limited to Luzula pilosa, and C. sylvaticella feeds only on L. sylvatica.|$|R
