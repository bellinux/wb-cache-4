40|$|Solar {{heat pump}} systems (SHPs) are systems that combine solar energy and heat pumps. SHPs have been {{investigated}} for several decades and have been proven to increase the share of renewable energy and reduce electric energy demand in residential <b>heating</b> applications. Many <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>heat</b> pump systems have become market-available in recent years; however these systems are still not widely employed in the residential sector. This is due mainly to the high initial costs (investment and installation costs) of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>heat</b> pump systems, which limits their cost-effectiveness. Enhancing cost-effectiveness of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>heat</b> pump systems is necessary for a more effective and broader market penetration. In this thesis, <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> and photovoltaic systems combined with heat pumps for heating applications are treated. The overall aims of the thesis are to: 1) investigate techno-economics of SHPs and 2) investigate possible solutions for improving system performance of a reference <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> and <b>heat</b> pump system for residential heating applications. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the influence of climatic boundary conditions on economic performance of SHPs has been investigated by means of: a) an economic comparison of SHPs found in the relevant literature and b) system simulations of the reference <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>heat</b> pump system. In the second part of the thesis, potential solutions for improving system performance of the reference <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>heat</b> pump system with limited change in system’ costs are investigated. A systematic approach was used for investigating cost-effectiveness of the system improvements in the reference system. Based on results of the cost-effectiveness analysis, some of the investigated system improvements were chosen for being included in the design of a novel <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> and air source heat pump system concept. The novel system was designed for a house standard with relatively high operating temperatures (55 °C/ 45 °C) in the space heating distribution system and for high space heating demand (123 kWh/m 2 ·year). Finally, the thesis ends with a cost-effectiveness analysis of the novel system. QC 20170918 MacSheepiNSPiR...|$|R

In {{order to determine the}} suitability of currently developed methods for testing or assessing such systems for present-day solutions, a thorough review and analysis of market-available systems are essential. The basis of the presented analysis is formed by 135 combined <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>heat</b> pump systems that were researched and documented from October 2011 till September 2012. They were provided by 88 companies from 11 countries. The characteristics of solar collectors and heat pumps are broken down at the component level. At the system level, the characterisation is centred on the interaction between solar collectors and heat pump. Here, numerous reviewed systems follow concepts using <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> energy as a low-temperature energy source for the heat pump, either additionally or exclusively. It is shown by cross analysis that this feature applies especially to systems incorporating unglazed collectors or photovoltaic-thermal collectors. More findings specific to the combination between collectors and heat pump, to climates or countries are presented as well.

40|$|Buildings {{account for}} up to 40 % of the total energy use in the world. Directives from the European Union have pointed out the {{significance}} of increasing the energy efficiency in buildings. New regulation in countries like Sweden has established that new buildings should fulfil regulations of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB), providing the opportunity for renewable energy technologies to achieve these goals.

The present work studied the characteristics of several renewable energy technologies and their applications for a single-family home in Sweden, including biomass, <b>solar</b> photovoltaics, <b>solar</b> <b>thermal,</b> <b>heat</b> pump, and small-scale wind turbine.

The dynamic {{performance of the}} storage tank in USTHE is modelled using the finite difference method accounting thermal stratification of water into three nodes (three isothermal segments). Analysis of NHX incorporated <b>thermal</b> <b>heat</b> transfer between water in the load loop of a storage tank and cross flowing air in the heat exchanger. Savings were incorporated in the building code in Matlab using a one-dimensional heat conduction equation. A wide range of experimental data was collected for validating the modelling results.

The effect of these simulations was predicted in terms of useful energy supplied by USTHE, thermal energy retaining period, collector temperature and averaged stratified temperature. Performance of USTHE is evaluated to give maximum heating potential. Effect of averaged isothermal segment temperature, stratification level and day and night flow rate combinations on heating potential is studied in great depth. USTHE supplied a peak heating potential of 5 KWh with a collector water flow rate of 252 Kg/h and load water flow rate of 60 Kg/h and obtained a maximum averaged temperature of stratified tank of 37. 1 Â°C.
