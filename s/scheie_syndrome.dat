Clinically, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is classified into two forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and <b>Scheie</b> <b>syndromes),</b> which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated Mucopolysaccharidosis type I consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant α-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme).

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} long-term {{outcomes of}} laronidase enzyme replacement therapy {{in patients with}} attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I. Study designRetrospective analyses of case notes, laboratory results, and data from clinical trials were used to evaluate urinary glycosaminoglycans, forced vital capacity (FVC), 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT), height-for-age Z score, cardiac valve function, corneal clouding, and visual acuity in 35 patients with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler-Scheie and <b>Scheie</b> <b>syndromes)</b> for up to 10 years following the initiation of laronidase therapy. ResultsStatistically significant (P[*]<[*]. 001) reductions in mean urinary glycosaminoglycan levels relative to baseline were observed 6 months after treatment initiation and were sustained throughout follow-up. Disease remained stable after treatment initiation with no statistically significant changes in mean FVC, 6 MWT, or height-for-age Z score. At last assessments, mitral and aortic valve function remained stable in 65 % (22 / 34) of patients; corneal clouding remained stable in 78 % (18 / 23); visual acuity remained stable in 33 % (8 / 24) and improved in 42 % (10 / 24) of patients.

We used data from 891 patients in the MPS I Registry, an international observational database, to analyze ages at symptom onset, diagnosis, treatment initiation, and treatment allocation (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase, both, or neither) over time for all disease phenotypes (Hurler, Hurler–Scheie, and <b>Scheie</b> <b>syndromes).</b> The interval between diagnosis and treatment has become shorter since laronidase became available in 2003 (gap during 2006 – 2009 : Hurler— 0. 2  year, Hurler–Scheie— 0. 5  year, Scheie— 1. 4  years). However, the age at diagnosis has not decreased for any MPS I phenotype over time, and the interval between symptom onset and treatment initiation remains substantial for both Hurler–Scheie and Scheie patients (gap during 2006 – 2009, 2. 42 and 6. 71  years, respectively). Among transplanted patients, an increasing proportion received hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood (34 out of 64 patients by 2009) and was also treated with laronidase (42 out of 45 patients by 2009). Conclusions: Despite the availability of laronidase since 2003, the diagnosis of MPS I is still substantially delayed for patients with Hurler–Scheie and Scheie phenotypes, which can lead to a sub-optimal treatment outcome.

The α-l-iduronidase missense mutations R 89 Q and R 89 W were investigated and altered an important arginine residue proposed to be a nucleophile activator in the catalytic mechanism of α-l-iduronidase. The R 89 Q α-l-iduronidase mutation was shown to result in a reduced level of α-l-iduronidase protein (≤ 10 % of normal control) compared to a normal control level of α-l-iduronidase protein that was detected for the R 89 W α-l-iduronidase mutation. When taking into account α-l-iduronidase specific activity, the R 89 W mutation had a greater effect on α-l-iduronidase activity than the R 89 Q mutation. However, overall the R 89 W mutation produced more residual α-l-iduronidase activity than the R 89 Q mutation. This was consistent with MPS I patients, with an R 89 W allele, having a less severe clinical presentation compared to MPS I patients with either a double or single allelic R 89 Q mutation. The effects of the R 89 Q and R 89 W mutations on enzyme activity supported the proposed role of R 89 as a nucleophile activator in the catalytic mechanism of α-l-iduronidase...|$|E
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS’s) {{represent}} a subgroup of lysosomal storage diseases {{related to a}} deficiency of enzymes that catalyze glycosaminoglycans degradation. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of α-l-iduronidase encoded by the IDUA gene. Partially degraded heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate accumulate progressively and lead to multiorgan dysfunction and damage. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the clinical, biochemical, and molecular characteristics of 13 Algerian patients from 11 distinct families. MPS I diagnosis was confirmed by molecular study of the patients’ IDUA gene. Clinical features at the diagnosis and during the follow-up are reported. Eighty-four percent of the studied patients presented with a mild clinical phenotype. Molecular study of the IDUA gene allowed the characterization of four pathological variations at the homozygous or compound heterozygote status: IDUA NM_ 00203. 4 :c. 1598 C>G-p. (Pro 533 Arg) in 21 / 26 alleles, IDUA NM_ 00203. 4 :c. 532 G>A-p. (Glu 178 Lys) in 2 / 26 alleles, IDUA NM_ 00203. 4 :c. 501 C>G-p. (Tyr 167 *) in 2 / 26 alleles, and IDUA NM_ 00203. 4 : c. 1743 C>G-p. (Tyr 581 *) in 1 / 26 alleles. This molecular study unveils the predominance of p. (Pro 533 Arg) variation in our MPS I patients. In this series, the occurrence of some clinical features linked to the <b>Scheie</b> <b>syndrome</b> is consistent with the literature, such as systematic valvulopathies, corneal opacity, and umbilical hernia; however, storage signs, facial dysmorphic features, and hepatomegaly were more frequent in our series. Screening measures for these debilitating diseases in highly consanguineous at-risk populations must be considered a priority health problem...|$|E
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (i. e., Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and <b>Scheie</b> <b>syndromes)</b> {{and type}} II (i. e., Hunter syndrome) are {{lysosomal}} storage disorders resulting from alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency and iduronate- 2 -sulfatase (IDS) deficiency, respectively. The {{a priori probability}} that both disorders would occur in a single individual is approximately 1 in 5 billion. Nevertheless, such a proband was referred for whom clinical findings (i. e., a male with characteristic facies, dysostosis multiplex, and mental retardation) and biochemical tests indicated these concomitant diagnoses. In repeated studies, leukocyte 4 methylumbelliferyl-alpha-L-iduronidase activities in this kindred were as follows: 4) -D-O- 2, 5 -anhydro[1 - 3 H]mannitol- 6 - sulfate activities were as follows: 0. 0 U/mg protein/h in the proband; 5. 7 in his sister; 4. 9 in mother; and 15. 0 in father (normal range 11. 0 - 18. 4). Multiple techniques, including automated sequencing of the entire IDS and IDUA coding regions, were employed to unravel the molecular genetic basis of these intriguing observations. The common IDS mutation R 468 W was identified in the proband, his mother, and his sister, thus explaining their biochemical phenotypes. Additionally, the proband, his sister, and his father {{were found to be}} heterozygous for a common IDUA mutation, W 402 X. Notably, a new IDUA mutation A 300 T was also identified in the proband, his sister, and his mother, accounting for reduced IDUA activity in these individuals; the asymptomatic sister, whose cells demonstrated normal glycosaminoglycan metabolism, is thus a compound heterozygote for W 402 X and the new allele. This A 300 T mutation is the first IDUA pseudodeficiency gene to be elucidated at the molecular level...|$|R

Methods Using data from the MPS I Registry (as of September 2009), we evaluated patients from Latin America (n= 118) compared with patients {{from the rest of the}} world [ROW (n= 727) ]. Results Phenotype distribution differed among patients in Latin America compared to ROW(Hurler 31 vs. 62 %, Hurler- Scheie 36 vs. 21 %, Scheie 10 vs. 11 %, and unknown 22 vs. 6 %). The frequency of certain symptoms, such as cardiac valve abnormalities, sleep impairment, and joint contractures, also differed between Latin America and ROW for some phenotypes. Median age at MPS I diagnosis was earlier in the ROW than Latin America for all phenotypes, and age at first treatment for Hurler and Hurler-Scheie patients was also earlier in the ROW. Hurler patients in Latin America showed a gap of 3. 1 years between median ages of diagnosis and first treatment compared to only 0. 5 years in the ROW. Treatment allocation in Latin America compared to ROW was as follows: enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) only, 80 vs. 45 %; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) only, 0. 9 vs. 27 %; both ERT and HSCT, 0 vs. 16 %; and neither treatment, 19 vs. 13 %.
