Holder suggests they inform the Larsens. They find Terry in the Larsen garage and tell her they found Rosie's killer, but do not say who it is. After Terry goes upstairs, Linden notices the tail light on Terry's car is broken, recalling Jasper describing the car that dropped his father off on the night of Rosie's murder as having a broken tail light. In Rosie's room, they confront Terry about being at the lake when Rosie died. As Stan and Mitch enter the room, Terry apologizes, asking them to not be mad at her.|$|E
25|$|When Megan Reeves was kidnapped, Don {{pushed his}} ethics {{to the limit}} to get her back. While he did not {{personally}} beat a suspect, he had Special Agent Ian Edgerton interrogate the teenager for information on where Megan was being held. It is never shown or <b>said</b> <b>what</b> Edgerton did during the interrogation, but it is heavily implied {{that he may have}} used physical force, up to and including applying pressure to the gunshot wound through the teen's wrist; Don expressed concern to his father over being willing to go that far, even if he wasn't doing it himself. After this discussion, he convinced his father that it is good to have someone to come home to, and that is why he comes around the Craftsman house so often rather than staying at his apartment.|$|E

25|$|The Marshall's film, now {{considered}} by many to be among the top ten baseball-themed films ever made, prompted the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum to host in 2003 a 15th Anniversary Reunion of the AAGPBL induction, in order to honor the actual women who played the game and inspired it. English attended to the event, between many others. She described her career to a very attentive audience of nearly 200 people, and <b>said</b> <b>what</b> it was like for the Belles to win two AAGPBL championship series in 1943 and 1946. She fondly recalled her whopping salaries that were considered good money in those days. Finally, she recalled the impact that the women had on the national pastime and the nation as a whole during those perilous times. The same year, the town of Everett dedicated her the Madeline English School, a pre-kindergarten to eighth grade school.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for help by a physician, Dr Charles Oldfield, who has a {{practice}} in Market Loughborough, a small village in Berkshire. His wife died {{just over a year}} ago and the malicious talk in the village is that he poisoned her. People are avoiding him and several poison pen letters have been sent to him but he can do nothing to stem this tide of ill-intentioned gossip – like the heads of the Lernaean Hydra, when one source of the gossip is cut off, another grows in its place. So, his ultimate aim was to cut the main source of the gossip, just like the hydra had been slain by cutting its vulnerable head. Mrs Oldfield was a difficult invalid whose death was put down to a gastric ulcer, whose symptoms are similar to that of arsenic poisoning. She left her husband a not-inconsiderable sum of money and, under pressure, Oldfield admits {{that a lot of the}} talk revolves around Jean Moncrieffe, his young dispenser, who he wants to marry but dare not because of the talk. Poirot travels to Market Loughborough and meets Jean. She is frank about her relationship with Oldfield and her dislike of his wife but opposes Poirot's idea of an exhumation and autopsy on the body. Poirot makes the rounds of the village, insinuating that he is connected with the Home Office and thereby generating much hypocritical murmurs of sympathy for the doctor and, more importantly, names of who <b>said</b> <b>what</b> and when. From this he learns of the present whereabouts of two servants of the Oldfields who left their employ after Mrs Oldfield died; Nurse Harrison, who tended to the patient, and Beatrice, the family maid. Nurse Harrison tells a story of overhearing Jean and the Doctor talking about the imminent death of his wife in which it was clear that this was an event that both of them were impatiently waiting for. The nurse is certain that Beatrice must have overheard the talk as well. Poirot tells her of the supposed plans of exhumation and the nurse considers this news and then tells him she agrees that such a thing should be done. While being interviewed, Beatrice slyly denies overhearing any conversation but tells him of several suspicious stories of Jean making medicines or pots of tea for Mrs Oldfield which the nurse poured away or changed before the patient could take them.|$|E

500|$|Horton Hatches the Egg is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and published in 1940 by Random House. The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who is tricked into sitting on a bird's egg while its mother, Mayzie, takes a permanent vacation to Palm Beach. Horton endures a number of hardships but persists, often stating, [...] "I meant what I said, and I <b>said</b> <b>what</b> I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred percent!" [...] Ultimately, the egg hatches, revealing an elephant-bird, a creature with a blend of Mayzie's and Horton's features.|$|E

She continued, [...] "She {{is a bit of}} a rebel and they probably relate to that, and while she has her problems she will always come out on top." [...] Minogue shared some similarities with her character, but thought Charlene was far more outspoken and tomboyish than she was. Minogue liked that Charlene often <b>said</b> <b>what</b> she thought, but joked that if she were in trouble and tried to punch someone like Charlene did, she would probably get [...] "flattened". Minogue also said Charlene was sensitive, but she was unlikely to show it and would [...] "rather die than be caught crying." ...|$|E

The eventual concept came after the writer spoke with his ophthalmologist brother, who told about blind spots regarding malfunctioning retinal spots or optic nerves, which do not impair humans due to a brain compensation. Gordon noted, [...] "these stories come from scientific research... So I <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> if someone could actually create a field of vision where none actually exists?" [...] Gordon decided to use a Vietnam War veteran given [...] "they are getting old, and like the Holocaust survivor of 'Kaddish', starting to die", and the opportunity would allow a larger role for Skinner.

500|$|Ornstein soon {{moved in}} a very {{different}} direction. He began imagining and then writing works with new sounds, dissonant and startling. Ornstein himself was unsettled by the earliest of these compositions: [...] "I really doubted my sanity at first. I simply <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> is that? It was so completely removed from any experience I ever had." [...] On March 27, 1914, in London, he gave his first public performance of works then called [...] "futurist", now known as modernist. In addition to a Busoni arrangement of three Bach choral preludes and several pieces by Schoenberg, Ornstein played a number of his own compositions. The concert caused a major stir. One newspaper described Ornstein's work as [...] "the sum of Schoenberg and Scriabine [...] squared." [...] Others were less analytical: [...] "We have never suffered from such insufferable hideousness, expressed in terms of so-called music." ...|$|E
500|$|Mateiu Caragiale's {{personal}} life has for long attracted {{interest for the}} traces it left in his literary work. This is enhanced by his reputation for being a secretive man. In a late interview, Cella Delavrancea described him as [...] "made up of [...] small patches, so well sewn together that one never knew what he had <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> he had meant to say, what he is thinking." [...] While Ionel Gherea suspected that Caragiale was merely acting, Eugen Lovinescu, who described Caragiale's personality as [...] "bizarre", also referred to him as [...] "colorful and sterile." [...] Despite his hectic lifestyle, Caragiale feared poverty and lashed out at Bohemianism, stressing that [...] "it kills, and many times not just figuratively". In tandem, fragments of his writings and private records are thought by cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu to show intimate familiarity with substance abuse and the drug subculture of his age, {{in addition to his}} self admitted binge drinking. During his final years of life, he was harvesting an unspecified wild herb from the hills of Cotroceni neighborhood, and using it as a sedative. By then, essayist Ion Vartic notes, Caragiale's obsession with death had developed into [...] "neurosis".|$|E

He scored twice more a week later against former club Sporting Gijón in a 2–2 draw at the Mestalla, where he also performed duties as the team's captain. After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right. We relaxed and ended up with the same result as last year. What has happened, has happened, but their goalkeeper was good, unlike our approach, which was not good," [...] however a day later he denied being critical of Emery, pointing out that, [...] "When I talked about the approach, I was referring to the whole team, I spoke {{in the heat of the}} moment, I was annoyed at the way we lost two points and I <b>said</b> <b>what</b> I thought, but I have clarified everything that needed to be cleared up." ...|$|E

500|$|Paleoconservative {{activist and}} former presidential {{candidate}} Pat Buchanan has appeared twice as of 2011.

During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation [...] "has been blackened because of a single speech he gave {{and a couple of}} paragraphs in it where he said that... the Jewish community is beating the drums for warbut frankly, no one has <b>said</b> <b>what</b> he said was palpably untrue." [...] At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, [...] "Mr. Buchanan, {{thank you so much for}} coming back on our program, for fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico...

[...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon <b>said</b> <b>What</b> Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says".

You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He <b>said</b> <b>what</b> he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E
