The {{following}} week the game dropped to the third place with further sales of over 32,000 units, contributing to a general decline in game sales during that period. Within two weeks of its release, the game had sold nearly 219,000 units in Japan. According to Namco's fiscal report in February 2005, the game had sold 280,000 units in Japan by that time.

40|$|We {{consider}} a game between two capacity providers that compete for customers through a broker who earns commissions on sales and sells to both loyal and nonloyal customers.

We show that in equilibrium, contracts require positive <b>sales</b> <b>targets</b> that can be best described as a mechanism for the larger provider to profit {{at the expense of}} the smaller provider. The effect of <b>sales</b> <b>targets</b> is different when commission margins are exogenous and the providers compete by setting targets.

The suspension is part of the decision of several Japanese manufacturers to suspend their joint development projects and contracts with several European partners. By early August 2012, PSA had sold a total of 6,575 Peugeot iOns and Citroën C-Zeros since their launch in Europe in 2010, while Mitsubishi had assembled almost 11,000 electric cars destined to PSA, leaving the French carmaker with more than 4,400 electric cars in unsold inventory.

The Avalon was offered as a larger, more upmarket car than the Toyota Camry, which it was built alongside. The original sales predictions were not met, with the Avalon failing to challenge rivals such as the Holden Commodore and the Ford Falcon. The reasoning behind this has been widely attributed to the Avalon's older design and styling, which has been widely described as [...] "bland", {{as well as the}} front-wheel drive configuration and smaller engine displacement.
