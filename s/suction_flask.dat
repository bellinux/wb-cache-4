50|$|Büchner flask or Sidearm flask or <b>Suction</b> <b>flask</b> - {{they are}} a {{flat-bottomed}} flask, but made of very thick and resistant glass. They are usually a cone shape - similar {{to the shape of}} an Erlenmeyer flask, but also have side neck, usually affixed to the side, 2 / 3 up from the bottom. The flasks are used to cooperate with vacuum aspirator or vacuum pumps in the vacuum filtration, or as additional security during the distillation and other processes carried out under reduced pressure.|$|E
50|$|A Büchner flask, {{also known}} as a vacuum flask, filter flask, <b>suction</b> <b>flask,</b> {{side-arm}} flask or Kitasato flask, is a thick-walled Erlenmeyer flask with a short glass tube and hose barb protruding about an inch from its neck. The short tube and hose barb effectively act as an adapter over which the end of a thick-walled flexible hose (tubing) can be fitted to form a connection to the flask. The other end of the hose can be connected to source of vacuum such as an aspirator, vacuum pump, or house vacuum. Preferably this is done through a trap (see below), which is designed to prevent the sucking back of water from the aspirator into the Büchner flask.|$|E
40|$|In the {{laboratories}} of the Geological Survey of Sweden {{we have for}} many years used an acid-resistant, stainless steel filtering funnel to prepare 'oriented ' clay mounts for X-ray diffractometry. The funnel consists of three parts (left and centre foreground of Fig. 1). The circular plate is porous and made of sintered stainless teel {{and serves as a}} support for a 47 mm diameter membrane filter. The cylinder is manufactured in two different sizes, 250 ml and 600 ml. The funnel is generally mounted on a <b>suction</b> <b>flask</b> but when the filtrate has to be analysed a suction cloche is preferable. Fro. 1. The disassembled funnel and transition tube; the filter manifold is in the background. FIG. 2. The manifoM filtering device with <b>suction</b> <b>flask</b> and pump; the 600 l funnel is on the extreme l ft. 264 Note When many mounts have to be prepared the use of a manifold is practical and time saving. We have adapted the Sartorius ix-branch manifold and added a transition tube of stainless teel (right foreground of Fig. 1), threaded to fit the manifold outlet and tightened through a gasket. The funnel itself is mounted on the tube through a rubber stopper. Suction is by a small pump (25 l/min, 0. 15 kW). A <b>suction</b> <b>flask</b> is placed between the filter stand and the pump to collect he combined filtrates (Fig. 2). The filtered clay cake has a diameter of 37 mm; the amount of material generally collected is 100 - 150 mg. The clay cake is transferred to a glass slide 42 x 42 x 2 mm by the technique described by Drever (1973). The great advantage of the funnel is that it rests on the support just by its own weight. This permits easy removal and minimum disturbance of the filter cake. Furthermore, it is easy to clean and unbreakable. The funnel was originally developed for pharmaceutical purpose in Denmark by Sten Sregersleve. It is now made in Sweden by Chemoferm AB and sold by Interlab AB, Bo...|$|E

The left <b>suction</b> <b>flask</b> (A) is used to collect the contaminated fluids into a suitable decontamination solution; the right flask serves as a fluid overflow collection vessel.

30|$|A 500 -mL <b>suction</b> <b>flask</b> {{charged with}} 2.5 g Na+-montmorillonite (Southern Clay Products Inc., Gonzales, TX, USA) and 10 mL CHCl 3 was {{equipped}} with a constant pressure dropping funnel containing chlorosulfonic acid (0.50 g, 9 mmol) and a gas inlet tube for conducting HCl gas into water as adsorbing solution. Chlorosulfonic acid was added dropwise {{over a period of}} 30 min, while the reaction mixture was stirred slowly in an ice bath (0 °C). After the addition was completed, the mixture was stirred for additional 30 min to remove all HCl. Then the mixture was filtered, and the solid residue washed with methanol (20 mL) and dried at room temperature to obtain SANM as white powder (2.58 g).|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} solvent casting/particulate leaching (SC/PL) {{method was}} developed to fabricate thick three-dimensional poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffolds with controlled pore size and porosity, and much shorter processing time. The pasty mixture of PLA/CHCl 3 /NaCl was sealed in a Buchner funnel by a piston with a <b>suction</b> <b>flask</b> connected. A vacuum pump was used to facilitate the volatilization of solvent. The scaffolds were obtained by subsequent removal of NaCl in deionized water. The pore size within the scaffold was in good accordance with the particle size of NaCl (< 210, 210 ∼ 310, 310 ∼ 420 and 420 ∼ 500 μm), all of which had more than 89 % of porosity, 1. 95 ± 0. 2 MPa of compressive modulus and non-cytotoxic to L 929 cells. To demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} SC/VV/PL method, thick cylindrical and tubular porous scaffolds have been produced in this study. Compared with the traditional SC/PL without vacuum volatilization, the modified method, namely, solvent casting/vacuum volatilization/particulate leaching (SC/VV/PL) method, provide a more efficient way to fabricate thick scaffolds. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
