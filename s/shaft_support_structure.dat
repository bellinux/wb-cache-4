40|$|This thesis {{presents}} further {{experimentation and}} modeling for bump-type gas foil bearings used in oil-free turbomachinery. The effect of shaft temperature on the measured structural force response of foil bearings is {{of importance for}} reliable high temperature applications. During actual operation with shaft rotation, the bearing structural parameters are coupled {{to the effects of}} a hydrodynamic gas film layer, thus determining the overall bearing load performance. A 38. 17 mm inner diameter foil bearing, Generation II, is mounted on an affixed non-rotating hollow shaft with an outer diameter of 38. 125 mm. A cartridge heater inserted into the shaft provides a controllable heat source. The clearance between the shaft and the foil bearing increases with increasing shaft temperatures (up to 188 ?C). A static load (ranging from 0 N to 133 N) is applied to the bearing housing, while measuring the resulting bearing displacement, which represents the compliant structure deflection. Static load versus displacement tests render the bearing static structural stiffness. As the shaft temperature increases, the static test results indicate that the bearing structural stiffness decreases by as much as 70 % depending on the bearing orientation. A dynamic load test setup includes a rigid <b>shaft</b> <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> and a suspended electromagnetic shaker. Dynamic load (from 13 N to 31 N) test results show that the test foil bearing stiffness increases by as much as 50 % with amplitude of dynamic load above a lightly loaded region, nearly doubles with frequency up to 200 Hz, and decreases by a third as shaft temperature increases. A stick slip phenomenon increases the bearing stiffness at higher frequencies for all the amplitudes of dynamic load tested. The test derived equivalent viscous damping is inversely proportional to amplitude of dynamic load, excitation frequency, and shaft temperature. Further, the estimated bearing dry friction coefficient decreases from 0. 52 to 0. 36 with amplitude of dynamic load and stays nearly constant as shaft temperature increases. Test results identify static and dynamic bearing parameters for increasing shaft temperature. These experimental results provide a benchmark for predictions from analytical models in current development and are essential to establish sound design practices of the compliant bearing structure...|$|E

A new simplified model of FIS/MMS/Fuselage with 5 -Degree of Freedom (DOF) is proposed, where elasticity of the rotor <b>shaft</b> and the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> of MMS are taken into account.

A 39 % decrease in 1 st longitudinal frequency is noticed for FIS when the mass of MMS is 80 kg, which is only 12 % of the mass to be isolated.

50|$|The Orpheus {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} novel developments to give this thrust of 5,000 lbf from a lightweight engine of 800 lb. The first of these innovations was the central spindle. Rather than linking the turbine and compressor with a narrow <b>shaft</b> <b>supported</b> by multiple bearings, the Orpheus used a large diameter thin-walled tube, more than 8 inches in diameter. This was so stiff in resisting any whirling vibration {{that it could be}} supported by only two bearings, rather than the usual three. Two bearings gave a further advantage: previous engines had also needed a coupling in the shaft to allow for any misalignment between the static parts of the three bearings. With two bearings, the shaft simply followed the straight line between them. This allowed the removal of a bearing, a coupling, the engine's <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> for that bearing together with its lubrication system and cooling air supply.|$|R

40|$|A {{representative}} {{model of}} aero-engine test rig has been built, comprising the following basic components: rotor, <b>shaft,</b> casing, flexible <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> and bearing housings. One of the bearing housings is designed {{in such a}} way that the stiffness along one radial direction is adjustable, and can be set between linear and strongly nonlinear. In the latter case, it has the characteristic of snap-through springs, which is somewhat analogous to some magnetic bearing configurations. The adjustability of the bearing support stiffness makes it possible to study the dynamic properties of an engine rig with different boundary conditions. A notable aspect of this test rig is that all the major flexibilities in an operating aero-engine have been included, e. g. flexible <b>support</b> <b>structure,</b> casing etc. In the field of structural dynamics, mathematical models are widely used, especially at the design stage of a product when the effect of physical modifications on the total dynamic response of the structure is required before the real fabrication is carried out. In addition, highly accurate and efficient structural mathematical models are required for the emerging SMART machine concept, in which real-time machine diagnosis and prognosis methods demand fast and accurate decision-making based on the results of data processed using those models. The problem we are facing now is that, as the structure becomes more complicated, and consists of more segments and joints, many of which can be strongly nonlinear, the accuracy and efficiency of the mathematical model deteriorates rapidly due to the difficulties in modelling the joints and the nonlinearities existing in those joints. In this paper, a Frequency Response Function (FRF) coupling scheme, together with the Multi-Harmonic Balance Method (MHBM), is used to model the assembled test rig. The basic FRF coupling method has been well documented and its accuracy and efficiency in linear structure assemblies has been recognised in many papers and books. MHBM is widely used to solve nonlinear problems in the frequency domain. The advantage of this combined methodology is shown in the comparison between test and simulation result...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{functional}} automotive part, reaction <b>shaft</b> <b>support,</b> was fabricated {{by local}} squeeze and vacuum Diecasting (LSVD) with light-weight Al- 15 %Si hypereutectic alloy which has good fluidity and excellent wear resistance. The effects of local squeezing pressure and time-lag of LSVD process on the microstructure {{of the product}} were investigated. Measurement of specific gravity with the change of local squeeze pressure and time-lag showed that the local squeezing effect can be increased by increasing squeeze pressure and decreasing time-lag. However, too high a squeeze pressure and too a low time-lag brought about insufficient squeezing effect due to instant movement to the squeeze plunger stroke end point. Through the combination of vacuum suction before melt injection and local squeezing after melt injection in LSVD process, light-weight Al- 15 %Si alloy reaction <b>shaft</b> <b>support</b> was successfully developed, resulting in excellent microstructural and mechanical propertie...|$|R
