5|$|After a {{month of}} preparation, just before he was to assault the Confederate works at Yorktown, McClellan learned that Johnston had {{withdrawn}} up the Peninsula towards Williamsburg. McClellan was thus required to give chase without any benefit of the heavy artillery <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> amassed in front of Yorktown. The Battle of Williamsburg on May 5 is considered a Union victory—McClellan's first—but the Confederate army was not destroyed and a bulk of their troops were successfully moved past Williamsburg to Richmond's outer defenses while the battle was waged and for several days thereafter.|$|E
5|$|On 5 November 1827 Antoinette von Leykam became Metternich's second wife. She {{was only}} twenty, and their marriage, a small affair at Hetzendorf (a village just outside Vienna), drew {{considerable}} criticism. Antoinette's grace and charm soon won over Viennese society. The same day British, Russian and French forces destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino. Metternich worried that further intervention would topple the Ottoman Empire, upsetting the balance <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> created in 1815. To his relief the new British Prime Minister Wellington and his cabinet were equally fearful of giving Russia {{the upper hand}} in the Balkans. After another round of his proposals for congresses was rejected, Metternich stood back from the Eastern Question, watching as the Treaty of Adrianople was signed in September 1829. Though he publicly criticised it for being too harsh on Turkey, privately he was satisfied with its leniency and promise of Greek autonomy, making it a buffer against Russian expansion rather than a Russian satellite state. Metternich's private life was filled with grief. In November 1828 his mother died, and in January 1829 Antoinette died, five days after giving birth to their son, Richard von Metternich. After fighting tuberculosis for many months, Metternich's son Viktor, then a junior diplomat, died on 30 November 1829. Consequently, he spent Christmas alone and depressed, worried by the draconian methods of some of his fellow conservatives and by the renewed march of liberalism.|$|E

25|$|The {{format of}} the race has changed little through Formula One's history. The main changes have {{revolved}} around what is allowed at pit stops. In {{the early days of}} Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in his teammate's car should his develop a problem—in the modern era, cars are <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations. From the 2010 season, refuelling—which was reintroduced in 1994—has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.|$|E

25|$|Just how {{significant}} the strike's implications were becomes apparent {{when considering the}} miner's place in Communist myth-making: he represented an “archetypal proletarian”, a “new man” whose symbolic aura was conferred by his Stakhanovite determination. The idea of the new man particularly caught on in areas dominated by a single industry, like the Jiu Valley, where the working masses could easily be controlled by the party. The uneducated miners, drawn largely from poor rural or socially disadvantaged layers of society, believed in the Communist ideology and discourse, which rang true to them, and awaited {{the arrival of a}} classless society. The miserable conditions in which they actually lived did not match the propaganda, and the disillusioned miners responded forcefully. After the strike, Ceaușescu took to posing as an “honorary miner” or as a national leader flanked by Securitate members dressed up as miners. He had been genuinely shocked that the representatives par excellence of the new man had unexpectedly revolted against the system that had <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> crafted them. The image of the model miner had come crashing down, and for that reason the strikers were terrorized—they had destroyed a myth that had served not only them and other “new men”, but also Ceaușescu himself.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 1799, several {{thousand}} insurgents, reinforced with French deserters, recruits {{from some of}} the minor cantons, some Austrian battalions, and emboldened with the news of approaching Russian forces, emerged from the wood at Finge and attacked a French encampment. The French, under command of Charles Antoine Xaintrailles, beat them off and they withdrew to their own entrenchments. Before daybreak on the following morning (25 May), Xaintrailles attacked in two columns. The first, Column Barbier (three battalions and one squadron), drove the insurgents out of the woods and chased them to the Leuk. The second, the left column, including two battalions of the 89th and 110th {{as well as some of}} the grenadiers of those two demi-brigades, were under the personal command of Xaintrailles, and attacked the insurgent position at Leuk, defended by seven guns <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> placed as to deliver enfilade fire on the passage of the valley; furthermore, the insurgents had placed sharpshooters on the approaches to the gorge. Xaintrailles sent two flanking detachments to the crest of the mountains, well out of artillery range, while the main body in the valley attacked the position in front of them. It received such a storm of musketry and canister fire at the foot of the entrenchments that it began to waver; at this point, a well-sustained fusilade from the crest of the mountains showered the insurgents' flanks. The men in the gorge redoubled their efforts and entered the Valais entrenchments, slaying some of the gunners at their positions. The survivors fled to Raron, abandoning their guns and magazines.|$|E

500|$|James {{was widely}} mourned. For all his flaws, he had largely {{retained}} the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era. [...] "As {{he lived in}} peace," [...] remarked the Earl of Kellie, [...] "so did he die in peace, and I pray God our king [...] may follow him". The earl prayed in vain: once in power, Charles and Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure. James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; and his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> constructed by Elizabeth.|$|E

According to Boyle's Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited, as in all TVTV tapes, everyone in the documentary comes across as foolish, describing the production's sarcasm as the [...] "ultimate leveler" [...] using equal irony [...] "both with the mighty and the lowly".|$|E
500|$|Today, between 36 and 40million people {{depend on}} the Colorado River's water for agricultural, {{industrial}} and domestic needs. Southern Nevada Water Authority called the Colorado River one of the [...] "most controlled, controversial and litigated rivers in the world". Over 29 major dams and {{hundreds of miles of}} canals serve to supply thirsty cities, provide irrigation water to some 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares), and meet peaking power demands in the Southwest, generating more than 12billion kWh of hydroelectricity each year.

500|$|His {{talent for}} public {{speaking}} required systematic self-discipline and practice. A later critic noted the sharp contrast between his hesitant conversations and his fluent speaking styles, adding that Calhoun [...] "had <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> cultivated his naturally poor voice {{as to make}} his utterance clear, full, and distinct in speaking and while not at all musical it yet fell pleasantly on the ear". Calhoun was [...] "a high-strung man of ultra intellectual cast". As such, Calhoun was not known for charisma. He was often seen as harsh and aggressive with other representatives. [...] But he was a brilliant intellectual orator and strong organizer. Historian Russell Kirk says, [...] "That zeal which flared like Greek fire in Randolph burned in Calhoun, too; but it was contained in the Cast-iron Man as in a furnace, and Calhoun's passion glowed out only through his eyes. No man was more stately, more reserved." ...|$|E

[...] He continued: [...] "The visual look of the show, which has been <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> controlled by its producers, becomes a giddy and unrestrained playground for graphic play, and the balance of creative authority is shifted from the writers' room to the animators in one fell swoop." [...] When comparing the segment to Banksy's, Amidi concluded that it is [...] "in fact, far more subversive because he focuses almost exclusively on making a pictorial statement, relegating the show's dominant literary elements to the back seat." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Katey Rich wrote that she appreciates [...] "The Simpsons always being willing {{to push the envelope}} in different ways", but admitted that it would take her [...] "some time to get the gangly-legged Marge Simpson and the leering Homer Simpson out of [...] brain." ...|$|E
500|$|Other artists {{employed}} symbolism {{in a more}} prosaic manner, despite van Eyck's {{great influence}} on both his contemporaries and later artists. Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms; unlike van Eyck, he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism. Campin's symbols do not alter {{the sense of the}} real; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography, but one the viewer would recognise and understand. Van der Weyden's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin's but not as dense as van Eyck's. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols <b>so</b> <b>carefully,</b> and in such an exquisite manner, that [...] "Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed." [...] His treatment of architectural details, niches, colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that [...] "the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly, jarringly, become symbols with religious truth".|$|E

Of this film, Wong told Hollywood Magazine, [...] "I like my part in this picture better than any I've had before... because this picture gives Chinese a break– we have sympathetic parts for a change!

500|$|In The Observer, Tim Adams complimented {{the opening}} {{sections}} as [...] "nicely layered with the pretensions {{of a particular}} precocious kind of student" [...] but criticised the [...] "predictability" [...] of Mountstuart's [...] "walk-on part in literary history" [...] and ultimately the suspension of disbelief, particularly the Baader-Meinhoff passages, concluding [...] "For all the incident, for all the change he witnesses, Mountstuart never really feels like a credible witness either to history or emotion." [...] Tom Cox in The Daily Telegraph disagreed: he praised the characterisation, calling Mountstuart [...] "a man whose fragile egotism and loose-fitting story has you frequently forgetting you're reading fiction, and even more frequently forgetting you're reading at all." [...] Giles Foden, in The Guardian, found the New York art-scene sections weakest, saying they [...] "puncture the realism Boyd has <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> built up {{in the rest of}} the novel." [...] Michiko Kakutani agreed that Mountstuart's youth was well evoked, but that the description of his retirement and poverty was [...] "as carefully observed and emotionally resonant". While in the early part of the book [...] "the characters' marionette strings [...] carefully hidden", later Boyd tried to play God, resulting in [...] "an increasingly contrived narrative that begins to strain our credulity." ...|$|E
500|$|Although ex-Confederates were {{generally}} a safe voting bloc for Democrats, Goebel could not heavily rely on {{them because of}} his father's ties to the Union. Also, in 1895, Goebel had killed John Sanford, an ex-Confederate, in a duel stemming from a personal dispute between the two men. This made him particularly odious to Brown supporter Theodore Hallum, a friend of Sanford's, who said of Goebel at a campaign rally in Bowling Green [...] "hen the Democratic Party of Kentucky, in convention assembled, sees fit in its wisdom to nominate a yellow dog for the governorship of this great state, I will support him — but lower than that you shall not drag me." [...] Goebel tried to mitigate his lukewarm support from ex-Confederates by courting the black vote, long given to the Republicans, though {{he had to do}} <b>so</b> <b>carefully</b> to avoid further alienating his own party base. Unlike other Democrats, Goebel had not voted on the Separate Coach Bill, a law that required blacks and whites to use segregated railroad facilities. Most blacks opposed the bill, and Goebel tried to remain silent on the issue, but when pressed, he admitted in a campaign event in Cloverport that he supported the bill and would oppose its repeal. Likewise, Taylor had tried to dodge the issue of the Separate Coach Bill to avoid upsetting the [...] "lily white" [...] branch of his party, but a week after Goebel took a position in favor of the bill, Taylor came out against it.
