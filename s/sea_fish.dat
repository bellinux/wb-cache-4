5|$|As {{fish stocks}} dwindle {{in the upper}} ocean, deep-sea {{fisheries}} are increasingly being targeted for exploitation. Because deep <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> are long-lived and slow growing, these deep-sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable {{in the long term}} given current management practices. Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E
5|$|Villages {{were usually}} {{concentrated}} around irrigation reservoirs to enable {{easy access to}} water for agriculture. Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment, between {{the water and the}} paddy fields below. This facilitated easy control of the water supply to the fields and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production. A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing ground, shift crop reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a perennial watercourse often took the place of the reservoir. Inland fishing was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs. Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> to cities which were located far inland.|$|E

25|$|Many deep <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> are at risk, such as orange roughy, Patagonian toothfish, and sablefish. The {{deep sea}} is almost {{completely}} dark, near freezing and has little food. Deep <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many don't reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years. A fillet of orange roughy {{at the store}} is probably at least 50 years old. Most deep <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> are in international waters, {{where there are no}} legal protections. Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate because of food. Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work for days at a time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.|$|E

25|$|The swimbladders of deep <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> {{are either}} absent or {{scarcely}} operational, and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations. Filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs. Some deep sea fishes have swimbladders which function {{while they are}} young and inhabit the upper epipelagic zone, but they wither or fill with fat when the fish move down to their adult habitat.|$|E
25|$|Ray finned species, with spiny fins, {{are rare}} among deep sea fishes, which {{suggests}} that deep <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful. The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the Beryciformes and Lampriformes, which are also ancient forms. Most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments. In contrast, deep water benthic species, are in orders that include many related shallow water fishes.|$|E
25|$|Sampling via deep {{trawling}} {{indicates that}} lanternfish account {{for as much}} as 65% of all deep <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550–660 million metric tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world's oceans. Sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladders, giving the appearance of a false bottom.|$|E

25|$|Marine {{life can}} be {{susceptible}} to noise or the sound pollution from sources such as passing ships, oil exploration seismic surveys, and naval low-frequency active sonar. Sound travels more rapidly and over larger distances in the sea than in the atmosphere. Marine animals, such as cetaceans, often have weak eyesight, and {{live in a world}} largely defined by acoustic information. This applies also to many deeper <b>sea</b> <b>fish,</b> who {{live in a world of}} darkness. Between 1950 and 1975, ambient noise at one location in the Pacific Ocean increased by about ten decibels (that is a tenfold increase in intensity).|$|E
25|$|The cuisine of Lakshadweep {{prominently}} features {{seafood and}} coconut. Local food consists of spicy nonvegetarian and vegetarian dishes. The culinary influence of Kerala is quite {{evident in the}} cuisines of Lakshadweep, since the island lies {{in close proximity to}} Kerala. Coconut and <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> serve as the foundations of most of the meals. The people of Lakshadweep drink large amounts of coconut water, which is the most abundant aerated drink on the island. Coconut milk is the base for most of the curries. All the sweet or savory dishes have a touch of famous Malabar spices. Local people also prefer to have dosa, idlis, and various rice dishes.|$|E
25|$|The {{food items}} found allow to {{reconstruct}} {{a sequence of}} food intakes: first a four to five centimetres long fish; secondly a smaller fish of two to three centimetres; next a ten to twelve centimetres long lizard; then a fifteen to forty, depending on the identification, centimetres long lepidosaurian lizard; and finally some indeterminate vertebrate(s). Together they represent a varied diet showing that Scipionyx was an opportunistic generalist. That swift lizards had been caught and <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> washed ashore had been gathered necessitating a prolonged patrolling of the flood line, both indicate a good mobility. If the prey animal in the stomach really was forty centimetres long, {{it is highly unlikely}} that the equally-sized hatchling had been able to subdue it, indicating parental care.|$|E
50|$|Offshore {{wind farms}} may affect <b>sea</b> <b>fishing.</b> Certain areas may be closed to {{commercial}} fishing, {{as a result}} of which the total area that can be fished is reduced, but new habitats may also be created as a result.

25|$|The diet at Haughmond {{seems to}} have been {{relatively}} varied and less austere than in most monastic institutions. In 1280 147 sheep and a calf were supplied to the abbey. Tithes of <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> were exacted at Nefyn and the abbey had fisheries on the Dee and Severn, but it seems unlikely that fish were supplied fresh from the further fisheries. Ranulf of Chester's grant allowed the canons to purchase annually 6000 salted herrings. These were bought at Chester on special terms. In the 12th century the abbey was granted half a swarm of bees in the woods at Hardwick: it may be that mead was made, although honey had a symbolic connection with the austere life because of its association with John the Baptist, to whom the abbey was dedicated.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} the disaster, in April 2012, <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> caught near the Fukushima power plant still contain as much {{radioactive}} 134Cs and 137Cs compared to fish caught {{in the days after}} the disaster. At the end of October 2012 TEPCO admitted that it could not exclude radioactivity releases into the ocean, although the radiation levels were stabilised. Undetected leaks into the ocean from the reactors, could not be ruled out, because their basements remain flooded with cooling water, and the 2,400-foot-long steel and concrete wall between the site’s reactors and the ocean, that should reach 100feet underground, was still under construction, and would not be finished before mid-2014. Around August 2012 two greenling were caught close to the Fukushima shore, they contained more than 25,000 becquerels a kilogram of cesium, the highest cesium levels found in fish since the disaster and 250 times the government’s safety limit.|$|E
500|$|Evidence {{for this}} {{etymology}} {{came from the}} Oxford English Dictionary, which notes shark first came into use after Sir John Hawkins' sailors exhibited one in London in 1569 and posted [...] "sharke" [...] {{to refer to the}} large sharks of the Caribbean Sea. However, the Middle English Dictionary records an isolated occurrence of the word shark (referring to a <b>sea</b> <b>fish)</b> in a letter written by Thomas Beckington in 1442, which rules out a New World etymology.|$|E

500|$|Chapter 23 {{looks at}} fish, admitting frankly {{that the authors}} [...] "know next to nothing about fishes from the {{standpoint}} of systematic science", but saying that they have gathered a [...] "trustworthy general estimate" [...] of their [...] "disguising coloration" [...] from market stalls, museums and books. Many fish are countershaded. The bioluminescence of some deep <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> and other animals is seen as a problem as it is not [...] "obliterative"; the possibility of counterillumination camouflage is not considered.|$|E
500|$|The English {{zoologist}} Edward Bagnall Poulton studied animal coloration, especially camouflage. In his 1890 book The Colours of Animals, he classified {{different types}} such as [...] "special protective resemblance" [...] (where an animal looks like another object), or [...] "general aggressive resemblance" [...] (where a predator blends {{in with the}} background, enabling it to approach prey). His experiments showed that swallowtailed moth pupae were camouflaged to match the backgrounds on which they were reared as larvae. Poulton's [...] "general protective resemblance" [...] {{was at that time}} considered to be the main method of camouflage, as when Frank Evers Beddard wrote in 1892 that [...] "tree-frequenting animals are often green in colour. Among vertebrates numerous species of parrots, iguanas, tree-frogs, and the green tree-snake are examples". Beddard did however briefly mention other methods, including the [...] "alluring coloration" [...] of the flower mantis and the possibility of a different mechanism in the orange tip butterfly. He wrote that [...] "the scattered green spots upon the under surface of the wings might have been intended for a rough sketch of the small flowerets of the plant , so close is their mutual resemblance." [...] He also explained the coloration of <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> such as the mackerel: [...] "Among pelagic fish it is common to find the upper surface dark-coloured and the lower surface white, so that the animal is inconspicuous when seen either from above or below." ...|$|E

The most gorgeous of all the Pixar films— which include Toy Story 1 and 2, A Bug's Life and Monsters, Inc.—Nemo treats family audiences to a sweet, resonant story and breathtaking visuals. It may lack Monsters, Inc.s clever humor, but kids will identify with the spunky <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> Nemo, and adults will relate to Marlin, Nemo's devoted dad." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle gave the film an A-, saying [...] "Finding Nemo lives up to Pixar's high standards for wildly creative visuals, clever comedy, solid characters and an involving story." [...] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film an A-, saying [...] "A simple test of humanity: If you don't laugh aloud while watching it, you've got a battery not a heart." ...|$|E
