5|$|Rock bands {{have largely}} {{influenced}} the band like the Deftones, Sepultura, <b>Sick</b> <b>of</b> <b>It</b> All, and Snapcase. At an early age, Schwab listened to Slayer, S.O.D., and Metallica. He later discovered East Coast hip hop. During {{the recording of}} Rival Factions, the band took heavy influence from post-punk groups like Depeche Mode, Joy Division, Psychedelic Furs, and The Sisters of Mercy. Some of their favorite bands are The Cure, Portishead, Quicksand, Shiner, and Sunny Day Real Estate.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

Preceding their first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal's contributions {{to collaborate with}} him better on stage. In addition to touring with Primus and Deftones, Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band's fanbase, which was largely male, by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band's female fanbase.|$|E
5|$|Rise Against {{was formed}} in 1999, by bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Dan Wleklinski. Before Rise Against, Principe and Wleklinski {{were members of the}} Chicago punk rock band 88 Fingers Louie.

Principe met McIlrath in Indianapolis while attending a <b>Sick</b> <b>of</b> <b>It</b> All concert, and recalled seeing him perform with his previous band Baxter. Impressed with McIlrath's gritty vocals, Principe gave him a seven track demo he had recorded, and invited him to join the nascent band. McIlrath accepted the invitation, and dropped out of Northeastern Illinois University.|$|E

Do you really think, Arthur, {{that it is}} {{weakness}} that yields to temptation? I {{tell you that there}} are terrible temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to. To stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not—there is no weakness in that. There is a horrible, a terrible courage. I had that courage. I sat down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim the letter this woman now holds. He made three-quarters of a million over the transaction.|$|R

60|$|In {{real truth}} Frank was {{becoming}} very <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> her. <b>It</b> {{seemed to him}} now to have been almost impossible that he should ever soberly have thought of making her his wife.

She had been travelling all day, and perhaps the scrutiny was not fair. But he thought that even after the longest day's journey Lucy {{would not have been}} soiled, haggard, dishevelled, and unclean, as was this woman.|$|R

He wanted me to go to the circus that was touring over at the cross roads, but it was the old Flanigin's circus, you know, the one Gussie Riggs used to ride in, with its old clown and its old ringmaster and the old 'wheezes,' and I chucked it." ...|$|R

He spoke with the peremptory fierceness that had of late almost obscured his natural good-humour and kindliness; and when he entered the refectory and threw himself into a chair by the fire, he looked wearied out in body and mind, shivered and coughed, and said with unwonted depression that the sullen fellows would make a quagmire of their camp after all, since a French reinforcement had come up, and the vigilance that would be needed would occupy the whole army. At supper he ate little and spoke less; and when James would have related his encounter within the Scots, he cut him short, saying, 'Let that rest till morning; I am <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> hearing <b>of</b> <b>it!</b> An air upon thy harp would be more to the purpose.' ...|$|R
