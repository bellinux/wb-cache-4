40|$|Background: We {{report the}} {{development}} of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like single-tube assay for the detection of infectious agents in a microtiter tray format. Methods and Results: The method, sequential nucleic acid amplification and capture (SNAAC), combines amplification with hybridization of the product to a surface/matrix-bound oligonucleotide probe. After amplification of the target sequence using species-specific primers, one of which contains a <b>detection</b> <b>tag</b> such as fluorescein or biotin, a denaturation and hybridization cycle is performed. This allows capture by an oligonucleotide that is covalently bound to the surface of a microtiter tray well or other support. After washing to remove unincorporated solution-phase oligonucleotide bearing the <b>detection</b> <b>tag,</b> the level of captured product is determined through a colorimetric reaction using an automated plate reader. We show the value and utility of the SNAAC detection method using cloned sequences of the important human respiratory pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae. Conclusions: SNAAC is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method for the detection of low levels of infectious agents that is readily adaptable to current clinical laboratory equipment, thus avoiding the need to develop or purchase new instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|RFID tag is {{detected}} by an RFID antenna and information is {{read from the}} tag detected, by an RFID reader. RFID <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> by an RFID reader is very important at the deployment stage. <b>Tag</b> <b>detection</b> is influenced by factors such as tag direction on a target object, speed of a conveyer moving the object, and the contents of an object. The water content of the object absorbs radio waves at high frequencies, typically approximately 900 MHz, resulting in unstable tag signal power. Currently, finding the best conditions for factors influencing the <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> requires very time consuming work at deployment.

In this application, promptly finding out the missing event is of paramount importance.

To deal with the problem of detecting missing tags in the presence of unexpected tags, this paper introduces a two-phase Bloom filter-based missing <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> protocol (BMTD). The proposed BMTD exploits Bloom filter in sequence to first deactivate the unexpected tags and then test the membership of the expected tags, thus dampening the interference from the unexpected tags and considerably reducing the detection time. Moreover, the theoretical analysis of the protocol parameters is performed to minimize the detection time of the proposed BMTD and achieve the required reliability simultaneously. Extensive experiments are then conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed BMTD. The results demonstrate that the proposed BMTD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions...|$|R

Popular methods that process unstructured textual material to automatically detect sentiment based on tagged dictionaries are not capable of fulfilling this task, even when coupled with part-ofspeech tagging, a standard component of most text processing toolkits that distinguishes grammatical categories such as article, noun, verb, and adverb. Small corpus size, ambiguity and subtle incremental change of tonal expressions between different versions of a document complicate sentiment detection. Parsing grammatical structures, by contrast, outperforms dictionary-based approaches in terms of reliability, but usually suffers from poor scalability due to its computational complexity. This work {{provides an overview of}} different dictionary- and machine-learning-based sentiment detection methods and evaluates them on several Web corpora.

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a {{wireless}} technology used to automatically identify objects attached to its tags. Its applications span {{in different areas}} such as inventory control, logistics, security and item tracking. Vast majority of commercially available RFID tags use Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to encode and transmit data. This micro-chip in the RFID tag makes the tag manufacturing process complicated and expensive compared to optical barcode printing. Researchers have brought the idea of removing the micro-chip and using chipless techniques to encode data into tags, allowing them to be passive, printable and low cost. However, chipless RFID technologies have still {{not been able to}} replace relatively expensive chipped RFID tags mainly due to less tag bit capacity. Over the last decade, researchers have mainly focused on improving the chipless RFID tag design and the RFID reader architecture. However, they were mostly using primitive signal processing techniques such as moving average or threshold based detection. The few advanced signal processing techniques reported so far have high computation complexity, hence not feasible for commercial implementation. This thesis presents smart <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> techniques that are computationally feasible and allowing high tag data encoding capacity. Firstly, four different maximum likelihood (ML) based <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> techniques have been developed based on the reader architecture and channel knowledge. In addition, all of them are able to operate based on both the time and frequency domain data samples of any frequency domain tag. One of the detection techniques jointly detects the channel as well as the tag type without having any prior channel knowledge or a calibration tag. A fifth <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> technique was developed for an existing frequency domain tag reader using the magnitude of the tag response. However, these single input single output (SISO) based <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> techniques suffer from high computation complexity. Two new detection methods have been developed using the likelihood expressions derived in above techniques to reduce the computation complexity from exponential to linear order. The first method was a suboptimal bit by bit detection technique (serial reading) and the second method is a fully optimal Trellis tree based Viterbi decoding technique. Then a novel, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) based chipless RFID system was introduced and a <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> technique for the proposed system was developed. Finally a MIMO chipless tag was designed which includes a broadband equal power divider, monopole antennas and spiral resonators. It was found that, the proposed <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> techniques for SISO systems provides significantly higher tag reading accuracy over the existing threshold based detector. In addition, they are capable of operating without a guard-band which makes the tag data bit capacity to be doubled without compromising the reading accuracy. Moreover, the effective SNR gain provided by the proposed techniques can be represented as increasing the tag reading range. All these benefits were achieved without compromising the low computation complexity. The MIMO tag with 2 branches is capable of encoding up to 4 times the total bits stored in existing SISO tags. These smart <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> techniques are expected to increase the data bit capacity in chipless RFID tags hence produce commercialized chipless RFID systems in future...|$|R

There are, however, many unsolved challenges in designing an effective and efficient RFID system for anti-counterfeiting purpose. The first challenge lies in designing a system which is suitable for standard passive RFID tags, especially EPC C 1 G 2 tags, which are widely used in real-world supply chains. These tags cannot afford strong security primitives due to very limited storage and computational capability. The second challenge lies in designing a system which can efficiently handle a increasing number of RFID products. Existing approaches for clone <b>tag</b> <b>detection</b> suffer from performance bottlenecks because a centralized detection server is required in these approaches to record and analyze the traces of all individual products.

Since a live bacterial vaccine based on surface display of antigens has many advantages over traditional vaccines, we have studied the surface display of the SE antigenic proteins, H:gm and SefA in Escherichia coli by the b-autotransporter system, AIDA. This procedure was compared to protein translocation in Staphylococcus carnosus, using a staphylococci hybrid vector earlier developed for surface display of other vaccine epitopes. Results: Both SefA and H:gm were translocated to the outer membrane in Escherichia coli. SefA was expressed to full length but H:gm was shorter than expected, probably due to a proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal during passage either through the periplasm or over the membrane. FACS analysis confirmed that SefA was facing the extracellular environment, but this could not be conclusively established for H:gm since the N-terminal <b>detection</b> <b>tag</b> (His 6) was cleaved off.

We implement a proof-of-concept system for C-Share based on Mininet, and test the scalability of C-Share by using an event driven simulation.
