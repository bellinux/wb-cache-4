40|$|Realizing {{a quantum}} theory for gravity based on Asymptotic <b>Safety</b> <b>hinges</b> on the {{existence}} of a non-Gaussian fixed point of the theory’s renormalization group flow. In this work, we use the functional renormalization group equation for the effective average action to study the fixed point underlying Quantum Einstein Gravity at the functional level including an infinite number of scale-dependent coupling constants. We formulate a list of guiding principles underlying the construction of a partial differential equation encoding the scale-dependence of f (R) -gravity. We show that this equation admits a unique, globally well-defined fixed functional describing the non-Gaussian fixed point at the level of functions of the scalar curvature. This solution is constructed explicitly via a numerical double-shooting method. In the UV, this solution is in good agreement with results from polynomial expansions including a finite number of coupling constants, while it scales proportional to R 2, dressed up with non-analytic terms, in the IR. We demonstrate that its structure is mainly governed by the conformal sector of the flow equation. The relation of our work to previous, partial constructions of similar scaling solutions is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aims of {{this study}} were to 1) examine {{individual}} professionals’ perceptions of staffing risks and safe staffing in intensive care and 2) identify and examine the cognitive processes that underlie these perceptions. Design: Qualitative case study methodology with nurses, doctors, and physiotherapists. Setting: Three mixed medical and surgical adult ICUs, each on a separate hospital site within a 1, 200 -bed academic, tertiary London hospital group. Subjects: Forty-four ICU team members of diverse professional backgrounds and seniority. Interventions: None. Main Results: Four themes (individual, team, unit, and organizational) were identified. Individual care provision was influenced by the pragmatist versus perfectionist stance of individuals and team dynamics by the concept of an “A” team and interdisciplinary tensions. Perceptions of <b>safety</b> <b>hinged</b> around the importance of achieving a “dynamic balance” influenced by the burden of prevailing circumstances and the clinical status of patients. Organizationally, professionals’ risk perceptions affected their willingness to take personal responsibility for interactions beyond the unit. Conclusions: This study drew on cognitive research, specifically theories of cognitive dissonance, psychological safety, and situational awareness to explain how professionals’ cognitive processes impacted on ICU behaviors. Our results may have implications for relationships, management, and leadership in ICU. First, patient care delivery may be affected by professionals’ perfectionist or pragmatic approach. Perfectionists’ team role may be compromised and they may experience cognitive dissonance and subsequent isolation/stress. Second, psychological safety in a team may be improved within the confines of a perceived “A” team but diminished by interdisciplinary tensions. Third, counter intuitively, higher “situational” awareness for some individuals increased their stress and anxiety. Finally, our results suggest that professionals have varying concepts of where their personal responsibility to minimize risk begins and ends, which we have termed “risk horizons” and that these horizons may affect their behavior both within and beyond the unit...|$|R
2500|$|The weapon's only <b>safety</b> was the <b>hinged</b> {{ejection}} port dust cover. [...] This cover had {{a projection}} {{on the underside}} that engaged a notch on the bolt, locking it in either its forward or rearmost positions. The M3 had no mechanical means of disabling the trigger, and the insertion of a loaded magazine would load the gun. [...] With receiver walls made of relatively thin-gauge sheet metal, the M3/M3A1 were subject to disabling damage if dropped on an open dust cover - the covers bent easily, negating the safety feature. [...] Dropping the gun on a sharp or hard surface could dent the receiver enough to bind the bolt.|$|R
40|$|For years, safety {{improvements}} {{have been}} made by evaluating incident reports and analyzing errors and violations. Current developments in safety science, however, challenge the idea that safety can meaning-fully be be seen as the absence of errors or other negatives. Instead, the question becomes whether a company is aware of positive ways in which people, at all level of the organisation, contribute to the management and containment of the risks it actually faces. The question, too, is whether the organization has the adaptive capacity necessary to respond to the changing nature of risk as operations shift and evolve. This article presents the results of a resilience engineering safety audit conducted on a chemical company site. An interdisciplinary team of seven researchers carried out 4 days of field studies and interviews in several plants on this site. This company enjoyed an almost incident-free recent history but turned out to be ill-equiped to handle future risks and many well-known daily problems. Safety was often borrowed from to meet acute production goals. Organizational learning from incidents was fragmented into small organization or production units without a company-wide learning. We conclude that improving <b>safety</b> performance <b>hinges</b> on an organization's dynamic capacity to reflect on and modify its models of risk as operations and insight into them evolve, for example, as they are embodied in safety procedures and policies.

40|$|Abstract Food safety {{concerns}} have had dramatic impacts {{on food and}} livestock markets in recent years. Here we examine consumer preferences for various beef food safety assurances. In particular, we evaluate {{the extent to which}} such preferences are heterogeneous within and across country-of-residence defined groups and examine the distributional nature of these preferences with respect to marginal improvements in food safety. We collected data from over 4, 000 U. S., Canada, Japan, and Mexican consumers. Using mixed logit models we find that Japanese and Mexican consumers have WTP preferences that are nonlinear in the level of food safety risk reduction. Conversely, U. S. and Canadian consumers appear to possess linear preferences. These results suggest that optimal food <b>safety</b> investment strategies <b>hinge</b> critically upon consumer perception of actual food safety improvements, the distributional relationship describing the targeted consumer segment¿s tradeoff function between WTP premiums and risk reduction levels, and the cost structure of these investments.

The VPA is a heavy duty machine {{with a number of}} plates, developed for filtration of minerals. The plates must be replaced or removed immediately once the wear has reached a given value or an error has been detected. The new lifting system differs to a great extent from conventional system in which a fiber strap was used; the designed lifting equipment comprises of a variety of parts resulting in a higher capacity to be used ín different situations safer and satisfies the vital requirements such as being a secure and cost-effective method, issued by the customers. Several solution proposals have been developed to offer better proposals before the final candidate has been selected and theoretically motivated with FEM analysis as well as analytical calculations.

50|$|A {{swing check}} valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although {{swing check valve}}s can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life <b>safety</b> systems. A <b>hinged</b> gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|R
40|$|Founded on the {{wreckage}} {{wrought by the}} explosion of the 2008 / 2009 financial crisis, Directive 2014 / 49 (DGS Directive) was expected to revolutionise the EU/EEA depositors' protection scheme. The reason for such optimism was attributed to the long-awaited introduction of a more effective system of financial assistance among the different national schemes and, therefore, the achievement of a fully integrated system of depositors' protection. This paper, in focusing on the legal provisions of the DGS Directive relating to the way the national schemes financially prop up one another, attempts to demonstrate that the new legal framework is far from being satisfactory. The new <b>safety</b> net, still <b>hinged</b> on depositors' protections schemes which operate at national level, is fettered by the quantitative limits and legal constraints of mutual borrowing which, ultimately, still leave the EU/EEA depositor facing an element of uncertainty. Moreover, in addition to the food for thought generated by these concerns of a doctrinal nature, this contribution seeks to illustrate that the recent Greek mass withdrawal from the bank deposits (June/July 2015) has proved to be an unsuccessful test case for the new legislation, ironically already in force at the time the crisis unfolded. This case study, coupled with the Landslaki dictum which is deservedly afforded equal attention in this paper, give significant credence to the view that the Directive, seemingly not totally conscious of the lessons of the 2011 Eurozone crisis, has been rendered obsolete and thus should be amended as soon as possible. Prospectively, it is advocated that the ultimate goal of the depositors' protection should be a fully unified scheme, forged at the Eurozone level, with an opt-in clause for the other EU/EEA countries. With a considerable measure of boldness, it is also suggested that the level of protection should be reduced to a lower amount, from the current Euro 100. 000. This caveat would ensure that, on the one hand, the new fully integrated Eurozone scheme does not become too expensive for the contributing banks and, on the other, the inevitable moral hazard risk is kept at bay...|$|R
