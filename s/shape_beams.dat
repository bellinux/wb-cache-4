40|$|Abstract — A four column Smart {{antenna array}} fed by a 4 x 4 Butler matrix {{augmented}} by a variable <b>beam</b> <b>shaping</b> network {{has been designed}} and simulated. It is demonstrated that using only three phase shifters within the <b>beam</b> <b>shaping</b> network provides dynamic beam flexibility including: four narrow switched <b>beams,</b> a right <b>shaped</b> <b>beam,</b> a left <b>shaped</b> <b>beam</b> and a broad broadcast channel <b>beam.</b> The <b>shaped</b> <b>beams</b> concentrate coverage at high capacity in either the right or left half of a sector while maintaining coverage at lower capacity over the reminder of the sector. The resultant antenna system represents an improvement in performance over a single multiple switched beam smart antenna without the cost and complexity of a fully adaptive smart antenna. Simulated radiation patterns over the full 3 G frequency band show that useful dynamic coverage & capacity enhancement can be implemented with the proposed antenna system.

Imran Kabir Lateral Torsional Buckling (LTB) can {{be defined}} as a {{combination}} of lateral displacement and twisting due to an application of load on an unsupported beam. Design specifications of Canada CSA S 16 - 14 provides solutions for LTB of welded and rolled beams that were derived for constant moment situation. Same equations have been used over the years for design of rolled and welded <b>shape</b> <b>beams.</b> A recent study has shown that the current code equations might overestimate the capacity of the welded wide <b>shape</b> <b>beams,</b> which make them unsafe to use. Thus a detailed study is required to evaluate the existing LTB equations for welded wide flange (WWF) shapes.

40|$|Lateral Torsional Buckling (LTB) is {{a mode of}} {{buckling}} {{that occurs}} when a flexural member undergoes both lateral deflection and twisting. LTB {{can be considered as}} a critical condition for laterally unsupported beams. Current design specifications in North America (AISC 2010 and CSA S 16 - 14) for LTB of wide flange (W-shape) and welded wide flange (WWF-shape) beams were derived from study of beams subjected to uniform bending moment distributions along beams’ lengths. Past studies on laterally unsupported I-beams indicated that geometric imperfection could significantly affect the LTB capacity of the laterally unsupported beams. Thus, research on effect of geometric imperfections for rolled and welded <b>shape</b> <b>beams</b> under uniform bending moment distribution is required. This paper presents results of detailed sensitivity analysis of initial imperfection on LTB capacity of laterally unsupported beams. A nonlinear finite element model is developed using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS.

However, since the antenna elements manipulation can be done both at base station and device terminal, it gives rise to an important method of using several antennas to put and obtain signals to and from space with increased capacity.

40|$|New {{technologies}} (like 3 D printing) and {{the increasing}} use of no conventional materials (like Fiber Reinforcement Polymer - FRP) are changing the construction industry. More effective and efficient structures are needed in order to achieve sustainable projects. Steel construction industry is not outside this modifications and advances. To keep steel construction competitive in the market, the industry needs to adapt to these changes by optimizing its manufacturing and erection processes. In a steel structure, joints determine almost 50 % of the total costs (Bijlaard, 2006). This percentage can drastically decrease if some details are avoided, like stiffeners. Nevertheless, the only way to eliminate these components is through a deepest analysis of the joint. This kind of analysis can be slow and expensive hindering the design process. In this context new numerical tools are appearing in the market in order to improve productivity and facilitate the work of structural engineers. These new powerful tools that come from the hands of the world technological advances, must be taken with care and their results must be validated to be able to realize their efficient, but above all, their safety. In this project, the improvement of the design of steel joints is addressed. This goal was achieved through two major tasks. First, an experiment was performed in order to deepen in the knowledge of simple joints when they are used between “I” <b>shape</b> <b>beams</b> and a flexible element like a hollow section face. The use of high strength welds and its implications were tested in the experiments {{and at the same time}} the real behavior of the joint was addressed. The new Eurocode 1993 1 - 8 (2020) contemplates the use of high strength steel and welds in steel practice. Hybrid welds can lead to a more efficient production process. Secondly, numerical analysis, hand calculations following the Eurocode Rules and previous documented experiments (SERICM II) were compared to validate the use of a finite element tool for daily practice structural engineering. The comparison was made in terms of strength and resistance of the joints and it proved that specialized finite element tools can be used in a safe and efficient way. These tools are able to predict in an accurate manner the joint’s resistance according to the Eurocode Rules. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For a {{long time}} power pattern {{synthesis}} has been considered to produce <b>shaped</b> <b>beam</b> patterns due {{to the number of}} degrees of freedom when compared with field pattern synthesis. However, severaladvantages exist if synthesis techniques are based on field patterns, since the relationship between the array factor and the source distribution is a Fourier transform. In this case, quicker and efficient algorithms are obtained with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to perform the calculations. Therefore, this work presents a new technique that synthesizes <b>shaped</b> <b>beam</b> patterns through the control of non-uniformly samples of the array factor, both in amplitude and phase. The sample phases increase the number of degrees of freedom. To produce complex patterns, the sample phases of the <b>shaped</b> <b>beam</b> region are used to create more oscillations in the ripple structure than the ones produced with the realpatterns. Not only this procedure yields a narrower transition region between the beam zone and the sidelobe zone but also smaller dynamic range ratios are obtained. Furthermore, it is described how to impose nulls in prescribed directions of the complex patterns. Some examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the synthesis technique. 1...|$|R
