5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial <b>stacking</b> between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial <b>stacking</b> is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible <b>stacking</b> conformers: an unstacked form and two stacked forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged backbones of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the electrostatic repulsion is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of site-specific binding of cations to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stacks</b> are the {{underlying}} structure of algebraic <b>stacks</b> (also called Artin <b>stacks)</b> and Deligne-Mumford <b>stacks,</b> which generalize schemes and algebraic spaces {{and which are}} particularly useful in studying moduli spaces.

50|$|<b>Stack</b> {{pointers}} may {{point to}} the origin of a <b>stack</b> or to a limited range of addresses either above or below the origin (depending on {{the direction in which}} the <b>stack</b> grows); however, the <b>stack</b> pointer cannot cross the origin of the <b>stack.</b> In other words, if the origin of the <b>stack</b> is at address 1000 and the <b>stack</b> grows downwards (towards addresses 999, 998, and so on), the <b>stack</b> pointer must never be incremented beyond 1000 (to 1001, 1002, etc.). If a pop operation on the <b>stack</b> causes the <b>stack</b> pointer to move past the origin of the <b>stack,</b> a <b>stack</b> underflow occurs. If a push operation causes the <b>stack</b> pointer to increment or decrement beyond the maximum extent of the <b>stack,</b> a <b>stack</b> overflow occurs.|$|R
50|$|The {{notion is}} of {{fundamental}} {{importance in the}} study of stacks: a <b>stack</b> that arises in nature is often either a quotient <b>stack</b> itself or admits a stratification by quotient <b>stacks</b> (e.g., a Deligne-Mumford <b>stack.)</b> A quotient <b>stack</b> is also used to construct other <b>stacks</b> like classifying <b>stacks</b> or toric <b>stacks.</b>|$|R

5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base <b>stacking</b> interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
5|$|Kerst {{returned}} to the University of Illinois after the war.

His team devised and analysed beam <b>stacking,</b> a process of radio frequency acceleration in fixed field machines that led to the development of the colliding beam accelerators.|$|E
50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of the current <b>stack</b> and generates the next state, the <b>stacks</b> to be pushed and popped onto the embedded <b>stack,</b> the pushing and popping of the current <b>stack,</b> and the <b>stacks</b> to be considered the current <b>stacks</b> in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded <b>stack</b> is pushed and popped, the current <b>stack</b> is optionally pushed back onto the embedded <b>stack,</b> and any other <b>stacks</b> one would like are pushed on top of that, with the last <b>stack</b> being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, <b>stacks</b> can be pushed both {{above and below the}} current <b>stack.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, a call <b>stack</b> is a <b>stack</b> {{data structure}} that stores {{information about the}} active subroutines of a computer program.

5|$|Randall left {{no doubt}} about his sympathies when he {{assigned}} members to the committee, <b>stacking</b> it with Hayes's enemies from both parties. The committee's investigation had {{the opposite of the}} Democrats' intended effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The Pelton telegrams were in code, which the committee was able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but the committee was unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stacking</b> or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{techniques have}} traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins, as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base <b>stacking.</b> Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be especially difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E
5000|$|In automata theory, a nested <b>stack</b> {{automaton}} is {{a finite}} automaton {{that can make}} use of a <b>stack</b> containing data which can be additional <b>stacks.</b> [...] Like a <b>stack</b> automaton, a nested <b>stack</b> automaton may step up or down in the <b>stack,</b> and read the current symbol; in addition, it may at any place create a new <b>stack,</b> operate on that one, eventually destroy it, and continue operating on the old <b>stack.</b> This way, <b>stacks</b> can be nested recursively to an arbitrary depth; however, the automaton always operates on the innermost <b>stack</b> only.|$|R

5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were <b>stacking</b> up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} meltdown {{was accompanied by}} increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in Situbondo (1996), Tasikmalaya (1996), Banjarmasin (1997), and Makassar (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the Dayak and Madurese settlers in Central Kalimantan in 1997. Golkar won the rigged 1997 MPR elections and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He appointed his protégé BJ Habibie as vice-president while <b>stacking</b> the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter Tutut became Minister of Social Affairs). The appointments and the government's unrealistic 1998 budget created further currency instability, rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices. The Government increased the fuel prices further by 70% on May 1998, which triggered another wave of riots in Medan.|$|E
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed <b>stacking</b> conformations.|$|E
25|$|Coaxial <b>stacking,</b> {{otherwise}} known as helical <b>stacking,</b> is {{a major determinant of}} higher order RNA tertiary structure.

Coaxial <b>stacking</b> was noted in the crystal structure of tRNAPhe. More recently, coaxial <b>stacking</b> has been observed in higher order structures of many ribozymes, including many forms of the self-splicing group I and group II introns.
