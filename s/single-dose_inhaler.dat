40|$|BACKGROUND: With {{a growing}} {{availability}} of different devices {{and types of}} medication, additional evidence is required to assist clinicians in prescribing the optimal medication in relation to {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients' persistence with long-acting beta 2 -agonists (LABAs). AIMS: To assess the impact of the type of inhaler device (multiple-dose versus single-dose inhalers) on 1 -year persistence and switching patterns with LABAs. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was performed comparing a cohort of patients initiating multiple-dose inhalers and a cohort initiating single-dose inhalers. The study population consisted of long-acting bronchodilator naive COPD patients, initiating inhalation therapy with mono-LABAs (formoterol, indacaterol or salmeterol). Analyses were performed using pharmacy dispensing data from 1994 to 2012, obtained from the IADB. nl database. Study outcomes were 1 -year persistence and switching patterns. RESULTS were adjusted for initial prescriber, initial medication, dosing regimen and relevant comorbidities. RESULTS: In all, 575 patients initiating LABAs were included in the final study cohort. Among them, 475 (83 %) initiated a multiple-dose inhaler and 100 (17 %) a <b>single-dose</b> <b>inhaler.</b> Further, 269 (47 %) initiated formoterol, 9 (2 %) indacaterol and 297 (52 %) salmeterol. There {{was no significant difference in}} persistence between users of multiple-dose or single-dose inhalers (hazard ratio: 0. 98, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 76 - 1. 26, P= 0. 99). Over 80 % re-started or switched medication. CONCLUSIONS: There seems no impact of inhaler device (multiple-dose versus single-dose inhalers) on COPD patients' persistence with LABAs. Over 80 % of patients who initially seemed to discontinue LABAs, re-started their initial medication or switched inhalers or medication within 1 year...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{specific}} {{attributes of}} inhaler devices can influence patient use, satisfaction and treatment compliance, and may ultimately impact on clinical outcomes {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). AIMS: To assess patient preference, satisfaction and critical inhaler technique errors with Genuair (a multidose inhaler) and Breezhaler (a <b>single-dose</b> <b>inhaler)</b> after 2 weeks of daily use. METHODS: Patients with COPD and moderate to severe airflow obstruction were randomised in a cross-over, open-label, multicentre study to consecutive once-daily inhalations of placebo via Genuair and Breezhaler, in addition to current COPD medication. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who preferred Genuair versus Breezhaler after 2 weeks (Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire). Other end points included overall satisfaction and correct use of the inhalers after 2 weeks, and willingness to continue with each device. RESULTS: Of the 128 patients enrolled, 127 were included in the safety population (male n= 91; mean age 67. 6 years). Of the 110 of the 123 patients in the intent-to-treat population who indicated an inhaler preference, statistically significantly more patients preferred Genuair than Breezhaler (72. 7 vs. 27. 3 %; P< 0. 001). Mean overall satisfaction scores were also greater for Genuair than for Breezhaler (5. 9 vs. 5. 3, respectively; P< 0. 001). After 2 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients who made ⩾ 1 critical inhaler technique error with Breezhaler than with Genuair (7. 3 vs. 3. 3 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patient overall preference and satisfaction was significantly higher with Genuair compared with Breezhaler. The proportion of patients making critical inhaler technique errors was low with Genuair and Breezhaler. The study was funded by Almirall S.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Indacaterol is a novel, once-daily beta(2) -agonist in {{development}} {{for the treatment of}} asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Studies were required to determine optimal dose(s) for continuing investigation. OBJECTIVE: A dose-ranging study was undertaken to evaluate efficacy and safety of indacaterol. METHODS: A total of 436 patients with persistent asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroids were randomized to 7 days treatment with once-daily indacaterol 50, 100, 200, or 400 microg via multi-dose dry-powder inhaler (MDDPI; Certihaler), indacaterol 400 microg via <b>single-dose</b> dry-powder <b>inhaler</b> (SDDPI), or placebo. Serial 24 -h spirometry was performed on days 1 and 7. Vital signs, laboratory evaluations, and adverse events were monitored. RESULTS: All doses of indacaterol increased the mean time-standardized area under the curve of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) from 22 to 24 h postdose (P <or= 0. 001 vs placebo) on days 1 and 7, with clinically relevant treatment-placebo differences of 240, 260, 350, 300, and 380 ml on day 1 and 230, 220, 320, 250, and 270 ml on day 7 for indacaterol 50, 100, 200, and 400 microg via MDDPI and 400 microg via SDDPI, respectively. All doses increased mean FEV(1) (P < 0. 05 vs placebo) from 5 min to 24 h postdose on days 1 and 7. All doses were well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild-to-moderate in severity: most frequently reported were respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.

This study evaluated the 24 -h bronchodilatory efficacy and safety of indacaterol in Japanese patients with COPD. MethodsThis Phase-II, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study comprised four double-blind, single-dose treatment periods (washout between periods: 14 - 28 days). Japanese patients aged 40 - 75 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomised to receive single doses of indacaterol (150, 300, or 600 μg) or placebo via a <b>single-dose</b> dry-powder <b>inhaler.</b> Efficacy (primary endpoint: standardised FEV 1 AUC 22 - 24 h) and safety were assessed for 24 h post-dose in each treatment period. ResultsOf the 50 patients randomised (92 % male; mean age, 67. 2 years), 45 completed the study. Standardised FEV 1 AUC 22 - 24 h was significantly higher for all indacaterol doses as compared with placebo, with clinically relevant differences of 130, 160, and 170 mL for 150, 300, and 600 μg, respectively (P < 0. 001). The improvement in FEV 1 was seen as early as 5 min post-dose with indacaterol and sustained for 24 h (P < 0. 001 vs placebo at all time points). All indacaterol doses were well tolerated and showed no clinically meaningful effect on pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, and laboratory parameters when compared with placebo. ConclusionsIn the Japanese COPD population studied, single doses of indacaterol (150, 300, and 600 μg) provided sustained 24 -h bronchodilation, with onset of action within 5 min post-dose. All doses were well tolerated. These results are consistent with data from Caucasian populations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe bronchodilating {{properties}} of formoterol from a novel multi-dose inhaler, Airmax® 6 μg {{and from a}} <b>single-dose</b> dry powder <b>inhaler</b> Foradil® Aeroliser® 12 μg were investigated in 31 adult asthmatics with FEV 1 ≥ 60 % predicted and a reversibility ≥ 12 %. Patients received on a single day four doses of formoterol: cumulative dose 6, 12, 24 and 48 μg from Airmax, or 12, 24, 48 and 96 μg from Aeroliser®. The mean FEV 1 (SD) from baseline to 1 h after the final cumulative dose increased by 0. 81 l from 2. 62 (0. 58) to 3. 43 l (0. 70) with Airmax® and by 0. 85 l from 2. 65 (0. 60) to 3. 5 l (0. 68) with Aeroliser®. All 90 % CIs for all four dose comparisons were within the equivalence range ± 0. 1 l. There was {{a higher incidence of}} hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia at highest doses during treatment with the Aeroliser® than with Airmax®. In conclusion, formoterol delivered from Airmax® provides a dose-dependent bronchodilating effect which is similar to that obtained by Aeroliser® at double the dose...|$|R
40|$|For optimal efficacy, an inhaler should deliver doses {{consistently}} and {{be easy for}} patients to use with minimal instruction. The delivery characteristics, patients’ correct use, and preference of two <b>single-dose</b> dry powder <b>inhalers</b> (Breezhaler and HandiHaler) were evaluated in two complementary studies. The first study examined aerodynamic particle size distribution, using inhalation profiles of seven patients with moderate to very severe {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The second was an open-label, two-period, 7 -day crossover study, evaluating use of the inhalers with placebo capsules by 82 patients with mild to severe COPD. Patients’ correct use of the inhalers was assessed after reading written instructions on Day 1, and after training and 7 days of daily use. Patients’ preference was assessed after completion of both study periods. Patient inhalation profiles showed average peak inspiratory flows of 72 L/minute through Breezhaler and 36 L/minute through HandiHaler.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} of this randomised, cross-over study was to compare a new <b>single-dose</b> dry powder <b>inhaler</b> (Elpenhaler (EH)), with a widely used, multi-dose dry powder inhaler (Diskus (DK)) on critical errors, patient preference, and satisfaction with the inhalers. Methods: First, patients read the instructions of one device, followed by a first inhalation attempt. Inhalation errors were assessed and if mistakes were made, correct inhaler use was demonstrated. Then patients had to demonstrate again and mistakes were registered. This was repeated up to four times. After completing the first device, the same procedure was started with the second inhaler. Primary outcome was the percentage of patients making at least one critical error after reading the insert. Secondary outcomes were inhaler preference and satisfaction with the inhalers. Results: After reading the insert, 19 of 113 patients (17 %) made at least one critical error with DK and 40 (35 %) with EH (p = 0. 001); 73 % preferred the DK and 27 % the EH (p < 0. 001). The mean overall satisfaction score (1 = very satisfied; 5 = very dissatisfied) for DK was 1. 59 and for EH 2. 48 (p < 0. 001).

MethodsPatients with FEV 1 ≤ 70 % predicted, FEV 1 /FVC≤ 70 % and a smoking history of > 10 pack-years received tiotropium once daily via Respimat® (5 μg) and HandiHaler® (18 μg) for 4 weeks each in a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two-way crossover study. Lung function, adverse events, pharmacokinetics and safety were assessed. ResultsOf 184 patients screened, 134 were evaluable. The trough FEV 1 response on Day 29 showed Respimat® to be non-inferior to HandiHaler® (mean treatment difference, 0. 008 L; 95 % CI, − 0. 009 to + 0. 024 L; p< 0. 001). Peak and average FEV 1 and FVC responses on Day 1 and Day 29 were very similar for the two treatments. Tiotropium plasma levels and excretion kinetics showed a similar profile of systemic exposure for the two formulations of tiotropium. Adverse events were reported by similar numbers of patients on each treatment, i. e. 27. 9 and 30. 6 % in the Respimat® and HandiHaler® groups, respectively.

40|$|Background: Limited {{data are}} {{available}} for the efficacy of triple therapy with two long-acting bronchodilators and an inhaled corticosteroid in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). We compared treatment with extrafine beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium bromide (BDP/FF/GB; fixed triple) with tiotropium, and BDP/FF plus tiotropium (open triple). Methods: For this double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial, eligible patients had COPD, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) of less than 50 %, at least one moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months, and a COPD Assessment Test total score of at least 10. After a 2 -week run-in period receiving one inhalation per day via <b>single-dose</b> dry-powder <b>inhaler</b> of open-label 18 μg tiotropium, patients were randomised (2 : 2 : 1) using a interactive response technology system to 52 weeks treatment with tiotropium, fixed triple, or open triple. Randomisation was stratified by country and severity of airflow limitation. The primary endpoint was moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation rate. The key secondary endpoint was change from baseline in pre-dose FEV 1 at week 52. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01911364. Findings: Between Jan 21, 2014, and March 18, 2016, 2691 patients received fixed triple (n= 1078), tiotropium (n= 1075), or open triple (n= 538). Moderate-to-severe exacerbation rates were 0 · 46 (95 % CI 0 · 41 - 0 · 51) for fixed triple, 0 · 57 (0 · 52 - 0 · 63) for tiotropium, and 0 · 45 (0 · 39 - 0 · 52) for open triple; fixed triple was superior to tiotropium (rate ratio 0 · 80 [95 % CI 0 · 69 - 0 · 92]; p= 0 · 0025). For week 52 pre-dose FEV 1, fixed triple was superior to tiotropium (mean difference 0 · 061 L [0 · 037 to 0 · 086]; p< 0 · 0001) and non-inferior to open triple (- 0 · 003 L [- 0 · 033 to 0 · 027]; p= 0 · 85). Adverse events were reported by 594 (55 %) patients with fixed triple, 622 (58 %) with tiotropium, and 309 (58 %) with open triple.

40|$|Background: Inadequate {{technique}} {{reduces the}} effects of inhalation medication. Errors in inhalation technique {{have been reported to}} range up to 85 %. Not only various patients' characteristics but also the device has an effect on correct inhalation technique. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of patients' characteristics and type of inhaler device on inhalation technique in patient with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A validated scoring method was used that consisted of triple viewing of video-recorded inhalations, using device-specific checklists. The following patient characteristics were investigated: gender, age, education level, diagnosis, treatment by a pulmonary physician, previously received inhalation instruction, exacerbation frequency, knowledge, self-management competence, pulmonary function, and use of multiple inhaler devices. Chi-square statistics were used for univariate associations between potential determinants and correctness of inhalation technique. Relevant determinants were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Moreover, inhalation technique errors were examined for six inhaler devices: three prefilled dry powder <b>inhalers,</b> one <b>single-dose</b> dry powder <b>inhaler,</b> a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) and a pMDI with a spacer. Results: Overall, 40 % of the patients made at least one essential mistake in their inhalation technique. Patients who never received inhalation instruction and patients who used more than one inhaler device made significantly more errors (odds ratio both 2. 2). Comparison between devices showed that a correct inhalation technique most likely occurred with the use of prefilled dry powder devices. Conclusion: Incorrect inhalation technique is common among asthma and COPD patients in a pulmonary outpatient clinic. Our study suggests that the use of prefilled dry powder inhalers as well as inhalation instruction increases correct inhalation technique. Simultaneous use of different types of inhalation devices has to be discourage...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThis {{dose-ranging study}} {{assessed}} the bronchodilator efficacy and tolerability of indacaterol, a novel once-daily inhaled β 2 -agonist, in subjects clinically diagnosed with COPD. Comparative data with tiotropium were collected. In the double-blind, core {{period of the}} study, 635 subjects with COPD (prebronchodilator FEV 1 ⩾ 40 % of predicted and ⩾ 1. 0 L; FEV 1 /FVC < 70 %) were randomized to receive indacaterol 50, 100, 200 or 400 μg or placebo via multi-dose dry powder inhaler, or indacaterol 400 μg via <b>single-dose</b> dry powder <b>inhaler,</b> once daily for 7 days. After completing double-blind treatment and washout, a subset of subjects from each treatment group entered an open-label extension and received tiotropium 18 μg once daily for 8 days. The primary efficacy variable was the trough bronchodilator effect: standardized area under the FEV 1 curve between 22 and 24 h post-dose (FEV 1 AUC 22 – 24 h) on Day 1. Clinically relevant improvements versus placebo in FEV 1 AUC 22 – 24 h were seen for 400 and 200 μg doses on Day 1 and all doses on Day 7. All indacaterol doses significantly (P< 0. 05) increased FEV 1 from 5 min to 24 h post-dose; the 400 and 200 μg doses were most effective. All doses were well tolerated. Indacaterol trough FEV 1 levels compared favorably with the improvement seen by Day 8 in subjects treated with tiotropium in the open-label extension. The results confirm that indacaterol has a 24 -h duration of bronchodilator effect and a fast onset of action in COPD and suggest that indacaterol could be an effective once-daily inhaled β 2 -agonist bronchodilator.
