40|$|This paper {{mentions}} {{first the}} requirement of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) for storage rings with colliding beams, and then describes how, in the mid- 1950 's, the fast development of UHV technology made {{the construction of the}} Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) possible with their 2 km of vacuum pipes at 10 /sup - 11 / Torr. The performance features are discussed with special emphasis on the problem of stimulated gas desorption from chamber walls. The placing of contracts for sputter-ion pumps and the need for developing <b>sector</b> <b>valves</b> at CERN is mentioned to illustrate that there was some feedback from these constructions to the general development of UHV. Finally, some problems and solutions are listed which are common to other fields where UHV is used: namely in thermonuclear fusion, space research, and manufacturing of integrated circuits...|$|R
40|$|In the LHC beam {{pipes and}} cryostats, the {{pressure}} measurement covers a wide range, from 1500 mbar down to 10 ⁻¹¹ mbar and even lower. If vacuum deteriorates, alarm signals are generated {{and sent to}} other systems, e. g. cryogenics, accelerating cavities, kicker magnets, and beam interlock. In addition, an unacceptable pressure rise in beam pipes generates interlocks to close the adjacent <b>sector</b> <b>valves,</b> thus isolating the sector, so that the pressure rise does not propagate. This paper describes the measurement chains, the alarms and interlocks logic used in the vacuum control system of the LHC. We analyze the possible signal degradation caused by ionizing radiation or due to cable length, shielding and grounding. The weaknesses of the existing vacuum measurement system are pointed out, and a prospective for improvement of the conditioning electronics is proposed. During the first LHC long shut down, several corrections were applied; {{the results of the}} tests after commissioning are also presented...|$|R

40|$|The LHC vacuum <b>sector</b> <b>valves</b> {{are located}} in the {{straight}} sections of the LHC ring, and designed to sectorize the LHC vacuum. The valves are interlocked and should trigger a beam dump request if they close on a circulating beam. This report studies the impact on the machine if this request is not made and the valve scrapes the LHC beam halo. Cascade calculations are made using a model of IR 7, with several different valve locations, to calculate the downstream energy deposition in superconducting magnet coils and the corresponding signal in beam loss monitors at the quench level. The calculations are done at 7, 5, and 3. 5 TeV. It is found that when a downstream magnet reaches the quench level, the neighbouring BLMs see a signal well above the detection threshold. Furthermore, the BLM signal is consistent with the BLM applied threshold settings and a signal is seen in the time domain before the quench level is reached. Therefore the report concludes that the BLMs can see the closing valve and trigger a beam dump before the quench (or damage) level is reached...|$|R

40|$|The RF {{impedance}} of the <b>sector</b> isolation <b>valve</b> of the APS {{storage ring}} system {{was measured by}} the wire method with a synthetic pulse technique. The coupling impedance as well as the energy loss of the isolation valve with and without an RF liner or screen, and the flange gap of the various sizes was calculated from the measurements. There appear to be resonances at certain frequencies {{in the absence of an}} RF liner that might cause an unacceptably large coupling impedance. Data with various sizes of the flange gap show that a good RF contact around any flange is necessary. The results also are compared with computer simulation from MAFIA. The measured impedance due to the RF liner alone is within 0. 2 % of the total APS impedance budget...|$|R

Live-live and live-dead {{interactions in}} marine death assemblages: The case of the Patagonian clam Venus antiqua. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 59 (2) : 429 – 442. In this work we studied bioerosion and encrustation on dead shells of the shallow benthic clam Venus antiqua from Patagonia Argentina {{with the aim of}} understanding biotic interactions (live/live interaction) and postmortem encrus-tation (live/dead interaction). In this regard, drill hole analysis and epibiont distribution in shells from modern death assemblages were performed. Additionally, we analyzed crushing traces in the shells of the drilling gastropod Trophon geversianus, which were caused by another predator. The analysis of drill hole placement and epibiont distribution on V. antiqua shells show drill holes (75 %) and the epibiont Crepidula spp. (70. 91 %) more concentrated in the upper <b>sector</b> of the <b>valve,</b> which might be explained by the vertical position and a semi-infaunal mode of life in this clam. Nevertheless, the presence of drill holes in the lower <b>sector</b> of the <b>valve</b> indicates that clams spent part of the time reclining on the sediment. There is also evidence that clams with Crepidula spp. as commensals are less frequently attacked by drillin...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{installation}} of a second superconducting wiggler in the SRS in 1992 [1] was the second major upgrade to the light source, the first having been a lattice upgrade to achieve higher brightness in 1986 / 87. The insertion of the 1 m wiggler vessel into straight 16 had a large impact {{on the rest of}} the ring, including the rearrangement of the 4 D-sextupole magnets; the design of 3 new ultra-short kickers and a new septum; as well as the relocation of components such as the dump collimator and the betatron tune driver vessel. The vacuum system of the ring is divided into 4 main sectors, isolatable by <b>sector</b> vacuum <b>valves.</b> These could not be rearranged in the ring, so a special valve was specified for the wiggler straight, with an elliptic section to match the wiggler beam tube shape. The upstream (D-Quadrupole) and downstream (F-Quadrupole) straight assemblies were already being modified with elliptic flare sections to match to the wiggler tube. Wigg ler Beam Tub e D-Qua...|$|R
40|$|A major {{perturbation}} to the SRS vacuum envelope {{was required}} to install a second superconducting wiggler in 1992. As part of this, {{all of the new}} wiggler straight (straight 16) vacuum vessels were re-designed to give a good match to the small elliptical chamber of the wiggler, including the <b>sector</b> vacuum isolation <b>valve.</b> Because of engineering problems this valve was not fitted and a standard circular aperture valve of much larger diameter had to be installed. This caused a localised impedance, which manifested itself by gross overheating due to the energy dissipated in it from the beam. A study of the effect of this valve has been conducted and is summarised. All data from the period of installation in the ring is collated, including beam heating and instability data. On removal from the ring a bench measurement of the effective broad-band impedance has been made, using time-domain measurement techniques. I...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{the study of the}} wear {{behaviour}} of the superalloys Inconel and Incoloy, when sliding against each other within the oil and gas <b>sector.</b> Within riser <b>valves,</b> (which are used to pump oil from the seabed to the surface) {{there are a number of}} different valves which are made from superalloys. When these valves are required to open and close, they operate under high pressure and are subjected to extremely high loads. The resultant sliding of superalloys causes rapid wear and surface damage to occur, which ultimately leads to the premature failure of the components. The wear and behaviour characteristics of superalloys, is to date relatively unknown. The following work looks to not only further understand the wear behaviour, but also seeks to provide a solution to reduce wear and early failure. In order to understand the features observed on components that have failed, it is necessary to replicate the operating conditions by conducting testing. It is also necessary to simulate the moving geometry of components using FEA analysis due to the practical limitations of conducting tests. Upon observation and comparison to original wear features, a solution was formulated based upon a thorough literature review. In the form of surface coatings, and specifically new Diamond-Like-Carbon coatings (DLC) these were applied to the materials in question and the results of testing compared. A predominant wear mechanism became a common observation galling and again it was evident that there was little work in understanding how galling develops over time. The behaviour of galling is also studied, and a criteria to define this phenomenon is also established...|$|R
