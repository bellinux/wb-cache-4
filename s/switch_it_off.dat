5000|$|Another {{style of}} {{protection}} is {{to measure the}} temperature of the outside of the transistor, as an estimate of junction temperature, and reduce drive to the device or <b>switch</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> if the temperature is too high. If multiple transistors are used in parallel, only a few need to be monitored for case temperature to protect all parallel devices.|$|E

50|$|With the {{accumulated}} failures, an alarm siren went off immediately after takeoff, with sound and volume {{similar to that}} of a civil defence warning. The crew could not figure a way to <b>switch</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> so the siren stayed on throughout the remaining 75 minutes of the flight. Eventually, the captain ordered the navigator to borrow a pillow from the passengers and stuff it inside the siren's horn. After all the suspense, all landing gear was extended and the aircraft was able to land.|$|E

50|$|The Slvr has {{an almost}} {{identical}} software user interface (UI) to the RAZR which {{is regarded as}} clumsy and ill-designed. Other criticisms are when the battery is low: The Slvr emits a loud beep every few minutes, causing problems when people are sleeping or in business meetings. The beeping can only be disabled by putting the phone in silent mode, vibrate, <b>switching</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> or plugging <b>it</b> in for battery recharging.|$|R

Again, {{at any point in}} time, the set of active nodes is an independent set.|$|R
5000|$|The {{automatic}} transmission automatically shifts from OD to direct drive when more load is present. When less load is present, it shifts back to OD. Under certain conditions, for example driving uphill, or towing a trailer, the transmission may [...] "hunt" [...] between OD {{and the next}} highest gear, shifting back and forth. In this case, switching it off can help the transmission to [...] "decide". It may also be advantageous to <b>switch</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> if engine braking is desired, for example when driving downhill. The vehicle's owner's manual will often contain information and suitable procedures regarding such situations, for each given vehicle.|$|E

50|$|At 8 am on 17 September 2008, to the {{surprise}} of John Humphrys, the day's main presenter on the Today programme, and Johnnie Walker, who was standing in for Terry Wogan on Radio 2, the pips went adrift by 6 seconds, and broadcast seven pips rather than six. This was traced to a problem with the pip generator, which was 'repaired' by <b>switching</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and on again. Part of Humphrys' surprise was probably because of his deliberate avoidance of crashing the pips {{with the help of an}} accurate clock in the studio.|$|R
40|$|Jet lag is a {{syndrome}} {{associated with}} rapid long-haul flights across several time zones, characterised by sleep disturbances, daytime fatigue, reduced performance, gastrointestinal problems, and generalised malaise. It {{is caused by}} a disruption of the "body clock", which gradually adapts under the influence of light and dark, mediated by melatonin secreted by the pineal gland: darkness switches on melatonin secretion; exposure to strong light <b>switches</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> The incidence and severity of jet lag increase with the number of time zones crossed; it tends to be worse on eastward than on westward flights...|$|R
5000|$|Suppose {{we have an}} AI {{whose only}} {{goal is to make}} as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to <b>switch</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which {{there were a lot of}} paper clips but no humans. [...] Bostrom has {{emphasised}} that he does not believe the paperclip maximiser scenario will actually occur.

5000|$|The new tramway in Bordeaux (France) uses a novel {{system with}} a third rail {{in the center of}} the track. The third rail is {{separated}} into 10 m long conducting and 3 m long isolation segments. Each conducting segment is attached to an electronic circuit which will make the segment live once it lies fully beneath the tram (activated by a coded signal sent by the train) and <b>switch</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> before it becomes exposed again. This system (called [...] "Alimentation par Sol" [...] (APS), meaning [...] "current supply via ground") is used in various locations around the city but especially in the historic centre: elsewhere the trams use the conventional overhead lines, see also ground-level power supply. In summer 2006 it was announced that two new French tram systems would be using APS over part of their networks. These will be Angers and Reims, with both systems expected to open around 2009-2010.|$|E

50|$|The controller's main {{function}} is to switch the circulating pump on or off. The pump is usually switched on when the solar panel is hotter than {{the water in the}} store's heat exchanger and off when the panel is colder. Switching the pump on transfers the heat in the panel to the store. <b>Switching</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> when the panels cool prevents a reversal of the process and loss of heat from the store. The controller measures and compares the temperatures in the panel and the heat exchanger every few seconds.|$|R
25|$|Arrestin linking: The {{phosphorylated}} receptor can {{be linked}} to arrestin molecules that prevent it from binding (and activating) G proteins, in effect <b>switching</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> {{for a short period of}} time. This mechanism is used, for example, with rhodopsin in retina cells to compensate for exposure to bright light. In many cases, arrestin's binding to the receptor is a prerequisite for translocation. For example, beta-arrestin bound to β2-adrenoreceptors acts as an adaptor for binding with clathrin, and with the beta-subunit of AP2 (clathrin adaptor molecules); thus, the arrestin here acts as a scaffold assembling the components needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of β2-adrenoreceptors.|$|R
50|$|Since {{most modern}} desktop {{computers}} have a full-size keyboard {{with both a}} numeric pad and separate arrow keys, Num Lock is rarely used (always on) for its original purpose, and ends up confusing the user if it has for some reason been turned off without the user being aware of this. This can be more of an issue on most laptop computers, since activating the Num Lock function typically requires use of the Fn key and if a user accidentally switches it on they may {{have no idea how}} to <b>switch</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> If a full-size keyboard is plugged into a laptop, then the Num Lock function is normally on (as expected) for the external keyboard, and the user would not have to activate the Num Lock function to use the numeric keypad for numeric entry. Since Apple keyboards never had a combination of arrow keys and numeric keypad (but some lacked arrow keys, function keys and a numeric keypad altogether), Apple has keyboards with a separate numeric keypad but no functional Num Lock key. Instead, these keyboards include a Clear key.|$|E
50|$|Zarodnix greets his Lord Emperor, but his welcome is {{dismissed}} by the weary Morbius who demands they bring up their prisoner from the dungeon. Zarodnix had predicted this and had prepared the gene-infuser {{the moment he}} heard Morbius was returning. Morbius admits that he’s fatigued by battle, but {{says it was a}} good fight and his empire continues to grow…and the more it grows, the more fear itself becomes their greatest weapon. Whole star systems are now surrendering at the mere sight of his fleets, but there are still occasional challenges to enjoy. In the dungeons, Lucie assumes the Doctor’s silence means he’s coming up with a plan, but she tells him to be quick as someone’s going to come through the door any minute now and drag poor Straxus off to have the life drained out of him. The Doctor asks if Morbius is still wearing the Stellar Manipulator remote control around his neck and Straxus says it’s always there as a symbol of his power. The Doctor thinks it’s more than just a symbol and says it’s holding the Eye of Harmony at bay and denying it to the Time Lords. Lucie says if they can <b>switch</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> Gallifrey will get its power back and they can travel back in time to put everything right. The Doctor sarcastically points out that it’s not going to be that easy, but essentially she’s right.|$|E
5000|$|Saccostrea informs Crassostrea {{that the}} Keltans are {{beginning}} to gather on the shore as requested. The leader laughs and summons more clam-ships {{to land on the}} beach and begin the processing. The Doctor tries to revive Lucie and is surprised when the Headhunter says she’s been shot with a time bullet. It’s currently burrowing its way into Lucie’s chest at a rate of one millimetre every second, but she can speed it up, slow it down or even remove it entirely as she wishes. The Headhunter tells the Doctor she’s reverse the damage and even return his TARDIS to him if he agrees to leave Orbis. However, he must also agree to switch off a device she’s extracted from the seabed. It’s encrusted in coral after resting {{at the bottom of the}} ocean for 600 years, but the Doctor recognises it as the remote activator for the Stellar Manipulator, which he took from Morbius and was holding when he fell into the canyon on Karn all those years ago. It was to protect this device that the Sisterhood transported him here in the first place. The technology can only be activated by a Time Lord, which is why the Headhunter arranged for Lucie to be brought here. She orders the Doctor to <b>switch</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> or else she’ll allow Lucie to die. He refuses to co-operate and accuses Lucie and the Headhunter of plotting this together. Until they reveal what their plan is, he intends to keep the activator safe in his pocket. Convinced that the Headhunter won’t let her ally die, he leaves them to their ‘act’ while he attends to those who genuinely need his help. Lucie cries out to him to help, but he isn’t listening… ...|$|E
40|$|A 2 MVA 50 â 8 ̆ 69 ̆ 260 Hz high {{performance}} parallelable frequency converter for harbor application was designed, fabricated, and tested.

5000|$|Lucie {{makes an}} impassioned plea {{for the lives}} of the Keltans and the Doctor seems to come to his senses, finally remembering who she is and {{realising}} how much she must have suffered when she thought he was dead. He also takes the opportunity to remind Selta that he’s not really that old, considering how long-lived his race is. He admits that he long ago stopped counting the years and now tends to round his age up or down depending on which part of the Universe he’s visiting. He places the Stellar Manipulator activator in his hand and orders the Headhunter to [...] "un-shoot" [...] Lucie. She agrees and Lucie is returned to normal, but then the Doctor tricks the Headhunter and instead of switching the activator off, he actually increases its power. At first nothing happens, but then suddenly there’s a huge clap of thunder and then the entire sky goes completely white. The Keltans start to scream in panic, believing it’s the end of their world, and they watch as the entire moon starts crashing towards Orbis. The Headhunter explains that the moon first appeared in tweenspace a few centuries ago when it was tiny. Since then it had been getting bigger and bigger as it was drawn to a spot 50 miles out to sea - where its controller was located. It’s not a moon at all, but the Stellar Manipulator engineered by Morbius! It’s been dormant for centuries until the Headhunter dragged its activator from the seabed and then the Doctor turned up the power. He tries to <b>switch</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> but the controls are jammed and he can’t reverse the effect. As the oceans start boiling, the Doctor orders Crassostrea to evacuate everyone aboard the clam-ships, but it’s too late - thanks to the increase in the ambient temperature, the Molluscari leader is starting to spawn! The rest of the oyster race go into a feeding frenzy and the Headhunter congratulates the Doctor on messing things up so well.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for sawteeth control in tokamak plasmas using ion-cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) {{has been developed}} in the JET-ILW tokamak [2]. Unlike previous ICRH methods, which explored the destabilization of the internal kink mode when the radiofrequency (RF) wave absorption was placed near the q= 1 surface, the technique presented here consists of stabilizing the sawteeth {{as fast as possible}} by applying the ICRH power centrally and inducing a sawtooth crash by <b>switching</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> at the appropriate instant.
