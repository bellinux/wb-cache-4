He was boiling with rage, as though he had been grossly insulted. He walked as if blind, following instinctively the shore of the diminutive harbour along the quay, through a pretty, dull garden, where dull people sat on chairs under the trees, till, his fury abandoning him, he discovered himself in the middle of a long, broad bridge.

40|$|The {{buildings}} {{situated in}} hilly areas {{are much more}} prone to seismic environment {{in comparison to the}} buildings that are located in flat regions. Structures on slopes differ from other buildings since they are irregular both vertically and horizontally hence torsionally coupled and are susceptible to severe damage when subjected to seismic action. The columns of ground storey have varying height of columns due to sloping ground. In this study, behaviour of two storied <b>sloped</b> <b>frame</b> having step back configuration is analyzed for sinusoidal ground motion with different slope angles i. e., 15 °, 20 ° and 25 ° with an experimental set up and are validated by developing a Finite Element code executed in MATLAB platform and using structural analysis tool STAAD Pro. by performing a linear time history analysis. From the above analysis, it has been observed that as the slope angle increases, stiffness of the model increases due to decrease in height of short column and that results in increase of earthquake forces on short column which is about 75 % of total base shear and chances of damage is increased considerably due to the formation of plastic hinges therefore proper analysis is required to quantify the effects of various ground slopes...|$|R

[...] Several months were spent experimenting with and demonstrating the capabilities of LED video. [...] The screen designed for the show was ten times larger than all 36 Zoo TV screens put together, with a total size that ranged between 150–170feet (46–52metres) wide and 50–56feet (15–17metres) tall, approximately the same size as the backdrop used during the band's Lovetown Tour in 1989. [...] The screen was created with the help of three separate companies, each of whom manufactured different components. [...] The screen contained 150,000 pixels, each of which contained eight separate LEDs of various colors. [...] The pixels were manufactured by SACO Technologies, a Montreal-based company, which specialized in manufacturing control systems and panels for nuclear and hydrogen power stations. [...] U2 was SACO's first client, and prior to the PopMart Tour, the company had no experience with video technology.

40|$|Original data {{obtained}} by bathymetric and seismic observations on the Eastern Sakhalin <b>slope</b> in <b>frames</b> of two international projects have been presented. Investigation based on these data has revealed that landslides origin may be controlled by active tectonics. Active tectonics is manifested on the slope as a system of NE and NS striking faults. Vertical displacements along the faults result in subsidence of sediments and form closed depressions in the slope relief. Failure of the depressions' steep walls may initiate sliding process. One of such landslides with volume of about 4 km 3 has been mapped by the geophysical survey. Landslides of such size are capable to generate tsunami waves with height up to 10 – 12 m. They constitute a real threat for infrastructure of petroleum industry...|$|R

40|$|This short note {{focuses on}} the review of some {{selected}} large slope instabilities, such as massive rock slope failures, that occurred in slopes well representative of widespread morpho-structural settings in the central Apennines (Italy). The analyses of such case histories highlights i) the role of inherited geological and morpho-structural features on failure mechanisms and ii) the interplay between such processes and the Quaternary morpho-structural evolution of the mountain chain. Some of the here described rock <b>slope</b> failures are <b>framed</b> within wider <b>slope</b> sections showing evidence of slope-scale gravitational deformation processes. Some cases demonstrate that the activation of the latter is strongly controlled by stress variations induced on the slopes by the combination of erosional processes and tectonic offset, i. e. topographic stress increase, that typically accompanied the Quaternary morpho-structural evolution of the orogen. Furthermore, some case studies confirm also for central Apennine that the occurrence of large-sized rock slope failures actively contributed to morpho-genesis, as {{the effect of the}} deposition of the related debris on the valley bottom can result in long-term impacts of environmental conditions, such as topographic, hydrologic and hydrogeological variations...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} the optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude relation in an homogeneous sample of massive clusters from z = 1 to the present epoch. By comparing deep Hubble Space Telescope ACS imaging of X-ray selected MACS survey clusters at z = 0. 5 to the similarly selected LARCS sample at z = 0. 1 we find that the rest-frame d(U -V) /dV slope of the colour-magnitude relation evolves with redshift which we attribute to the build up of the red sequence over time. This rest <b>frame</b> <b>slope</b> evolution is not adequately reproduced by that predicted from semi-analytic models based on the Millennium Simulation despite a prescription for the build up of the red sequence by in-falling galaxies, 'strangulation'. We observe no strong correlation between this slope and the cluster environment at a given redshift demonstrating that the observed evolution is not due to a secondary correlation.

40|$|Rocks of the Upper Silurian Wristen Group {{display a}} range in facies and depositional style that {{contrasts}} markedly {{with the more}} homogeneous character of the underlying Middle to Lower Silurian Fusselman Formation. The Wristen contains distinct (1) shallow-water platform (Fasken Formation) and (2) deeper water, outer platform to <b>slope</b> carbonate facies (<b>Frame</b> and Wink Formations) that document crustal downwarping of the southern margin of the Laurentian paleocontinent during the Middle Silurian. Deeper water facies of the Frame and Wink Formations dominate the more southerly areas of the Wristen subcrop in the Permian Basin and consist of nodular mudstones and wackestones (Wink) and carbonate debris flows and shales (Frame). Wristen platform facies are assigned to the Fasken Formation and include platform-margin carbonate buildup successions and a complex variety of middle to inner platform facies ranging from small carbonate buildup facies to skeletal wackestones and packstones to tidal-flat complexes. Hydrocarbon reservoirs are restricted to the Fasken Formation; more than 1. 2 billion barrels of oil has been produced. A large volume of oil (more than 1. 8 billion barrels) remains as a target for improved characterization of reservoir facies and architecture. The models and data presented here provide an important basis for better understanding of this complex depositional system. ...|$|R
3000|$|Strong {{earthquakes}} strike frequently {{at different}} parts of the world causing destruction to life and all kind of structures. All kind of structure is vulnerable to earthquake loading, but the structures with irregularities are proved to be the most vulnerable. The insufficiency of plain ground in hilly region compels for construction activity on hilly slopes. Formation of plain area by earth excavation for construction is very costly and time consuming; on the other hand, it destroys the natural beauty of the landscapes. Financial development and quick urbanisation in these sloping areas have been quickened because of the land improvement. As a result, population density has increased enormously and unbalanced ratio of land availability to land requirement is observed in the hilly regions. Therefore, the construction of multi-storeyed building on hill slopes has gained popularity. While designing, it must be noticed that structures on inclines are not the same as those in plain land, i.e. they are exceptionally unpredictable and unsymmetrical in flat and vertical planes. Such buildings [...] have mass and stiffness varying along the vertical and horizontal planes; as a result, the centre of mass and centre of rigidity do not coincide on various floors and twisting of structures takes place. Considering the scenario, it is very important to investigate the responses of such buildings to make them earthquake resistant and prevent their collapse to save the loss of life and property. Hilly slopes are inconsistent, so the effect of slope variation on the structures must be studied under earthquake load. Most of the time, bases of the structures are considered as fixed, i.e. bases are assumed to be infinitely rigid. This concept is not true as the soil under the structure is flexible; so, SSI must be considered to get the realistic response of the structure. Prashant and Kori (2013) performed a study on the building situated on hill slope (27 ° with horizontal) to bring out the effect of soft storey on the response of structure. Birajdar and Nalawade (2004) contemplated the seismic reaction of three diverse arrangement of structures arranged on slopping ground and found that stepback–setback structures were more appropriate on inclining ground. Halkude et al. (2013) performed reaction range investigation on two sort of building outlines specifically stepback frames and stepback–setback building outlines on inclining ground. Stepback and setback building frames observed to be more reasonable on slanting ground, contrasted with stepback frames. Kalsulkar and Rathod (2015) examined the stepback frames and stepback–setback frames on the inclining ground by RSM, with differing number of bays. Stepback–setback frames were less vulnerable than stepback frames and more noteworthy number of bays was better under seismic conditions. Arjun and Arathi (2016) contemplated the conduct of four-storied, <b>sloped</b> <b>frame</b> building having stepback–setback design for sinusoidal ground movement with various slope angles by performing RSM. Short column was damaged more during the quake. Thombre and Makarande (2016) made comparison between sloping ground, with different slope and plain ground buildings in response spectrum method. The displacement of building showed the same behaviour as of regular building but displacement’s value reduced with the increment of slopes, due to curtailment of column on sloping ground. Nagarjuna and Patil (2015) observed that short columns were affected more during the earthquake, and for construction of the building on sloping ground, the stepback–setback building configuration was suitable, along with shear walls at the corner of the building. Kumar et al. (2014) performed seismic analysis of a five-storey RCC building on varying slope angles and compared with the same on the flat ground using linear static method. The footing columns of shorter height attracted more forces, because of a considerable increase in their stiffness, which in turn increased the shear and bending moment significantly. Khadiranaikar and Masali (2014) reviewed number of studies and found that most of the studies agree that the buildings resting on sloping ground has higher displacement and base shear compared to buildings resting on plain ground, and the shorter column attracts more forces and undergo damage when subjected to earthquake. Stepback building proved more vulnerable to seismic excitation. Ghosh and Debbarma (2017) investigated the performance of setback buildings with open ground storey on plane and sloping ground and proposed techniques to overcome the risk of their failure.|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{indicated}} that damping rates of upstream whistlers strongly {{depend on the}} details of the electron distribution function. Moreover, detailed analysis of Doppler-shift and whistler dispersion relation {{indicated that}} upstream whistlers propagate obliquely in a broad band. In this paper we present results of a kinetic calculation of damping lengths of wide-band whistlers using the sum of 7 -drifting bi-Maxwellian electron distributions as a best fit to the International Sun Earth Explorer (ISEE) 1 electron data. For 2 cases, when upstream whistlers are observed, convective damping lengths derived from ISEE magnetic field and ephemeris data are compared with theoretical results. We find that the calculated convective damping lengths are consistent with the data and that upstream whistlers remain marginally stable. We also show that the <b>slope</b> of plasma <b>frame</b> spectra of upstream whistlers, obtained by direct fitting of the observed spectra is between 5 and 7 with a sharp lower frequency cutoff corresponding to a wavelength of about one ion inertial length. When the solar wind velocity is directed largely along the wave normal of the upstream whistlers the polariztion of the right hand waves becomes reversed and low frequencies are switched to high resulting in a peaked spectrum with a strong high frequency cutoff. The overall spectral, wave and particle characteristics, proximity to the shock as well as propagation and damping properties indicate that these waves cannot be generated locally. Instead the observed upstream whistlers arise in the shock ramp most likely by a variety of cross-field drift and/or anisotropy driven instabilities...|$|R
50|$|The forward {{fuselage}} frame consisted of two, parallel horizontal members, one above the other. They were {{connected by a}} vertical pair of members and two diagonal ones, attached at two points on the lower frame and three on the upper. The rear vertical member was lighter than the forward three uprights, which formed a distorted N; together with the parallel horizontals, this core frame formed a cross braced trapezium. The forward vertical supported the wing at its front spar and the two diagonals met on the rear one. The lower frame extended forwards, with the pilot's seat projecting either side of it immediately ahead of the forward vertical frame. Underneath it, a curved skid was mounted and faired in, forming a long, deep, narrow box, reaching aft to the rear vertical frame. From the trailing edge rearwards the upper frame member was split into two, running {{parallel to each other}} and cross braced in the horizontal plane. This provided extra stiffness against sideways flexing and further reduced the wire bracing. Aft of the second vertical member the lower <b>frame</b> <b>sloped</b> upwards, meeting the upper member at the tail. Here, the triangular tailplane was mounted on the upper frame with a trapezoidal fin below. Parallel chord elevators projected behind with a cut-out for the movement of the tall rudder, which was hinged on the extreme frame and was rectangular apart from a cropped under edge. The BS.16 sat with its tail well clear of the ground, so no tail bumper was required, though there was a short aft horizontal extension of the main skid.|$|R
