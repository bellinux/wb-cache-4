The inflammatory infiltrate was {{characterized by}} immunohistochemistry using antibodies against macrophages (CD 68), Langerhans'cells (S 100), lymphocytes (CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 45 RO, CD 20 and CD 56) and neutrophils (CD 15). The expression of MIP- 1 alpha (Macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 alpha), chemokine receptors (CXCR 3 and CCR 1) and enzymes (superoxide dismutase-SOD and nitric oxide synthase-iNOS) was also evaluated by the same method. We observed an increase in all populations evaluated when compared with the controls. Numbers of CD 15 + and CD 56 + were significantly lower than CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 20 + and CD 68 + cells. Statistical analysis revealed an association of fungi numbers with CD 3, CD 45 RO and iNOS-positive cells. Furthermore, MIP- 1 alpha expression was associated with CD 45 RO, CD 68, iNOS and CXCR 3.

40|$|Abstract Background Sporothrix schenckii is a pathogenic, dimorphic fungus, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} sporotrichosis, a <b>subcutaneous</b> lymphatic <b>mycosis.</b> Dimorphism in S. schenckii responds to second messengers such as cAMP and calcium, suggesting the possible involvement of a calcium/calmodulin kinase in its regulation. In {{this study we}} describe a novel calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in S. schenckii, sscmk 1, {{and the effects of}} inhibitors of calmodulin and calcium/calmodulin kinases on the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle. Results Using the PCR homology approach a new member of the calcium/calmodulin kinase family, SSCMK 1, was identified in this fungus. The cDNA sequence of sscmk 1 revealed an open reading frame of 1, 221 nucleotides encoding a 407 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 45. 6 kDa. The genomic sequence of sscmk 1 revealed the same ORF interrupted by five introns. Bioinformatic analyses of SSCMK 1 showed that this protein had the distinctive features that characterize a calcium/calmodulin protein kinase: a serine/threonine protein kinase domain and a calmodulin-binding domain. When compared to homologues from seven species of filamentous fungi, SSCMK 1 showed substantial similarities, except for a large and highly variable region that encompasses positions 330 – 380 of the multiple sequence alignment. Inhibition studies using calmodulin inhibitor W- 7, and calcium/calmodulin kinase inhibitors, KN- 62 and lavendustin C, were found to inhibit budding by cells induced to re-enter the yeast cell cycle and to favor the yeast to mycelium transition. Conclusion This study constitutes the first evidence of the presence of a calcium/calmodulin kinase-encoding gene in S. schenckii and its possible involvement as an effector of dimorphism in this fungus. These results suggest that a calcium/calmodulin dependent signaling pathway could be involved in the regulation of dimorphism in this fungus. The results suggest that the calcium/calmodulin kinases of yeasts are evolutionarily distinct from those in filamentous fungi. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sporotrichosis is {{a chronic}} <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>mycosis</b> that affects both {{humans and animals}} worldwide. This <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>mycosis</b> had been {{attributed}} to a single etiological agent, Sporothrix schenckii. S. schenckii exhibits considerable genetic variability, and recently, {{it was suggested that}} this taxon consists of a complex of species. Sporotrichosis is caused by traumatic inoculation of the fungus, which is a ubiquitous environmental saprophyte that can be isolated from soil and plant debris. The infection is limited to cutaneous forms, but recently, more severe clinical forms of this mycosis have been described, especially among immunocompromised individuals. The immunological mechanisms involved in the prevention and control of sporotrichosis are not well understood. Some studies suggest that cell-mediated immunity {{plays an important role in}} protecting the host against S. schenckii. In contrast, the role of the humoral immune response in protection against this fungus has not been studied in detail. In a previous study, we showed that antigens secreted by S. schenckii induced a specific humoral response in infected animals, primarily against a 70 -kDamolecule, indicating a possible role of specific antibodies against this molecule in infection control.

40|$|Sporotrichosis is {{the most}} {{frequent}} <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>mycosis</b> {{in the world and}} its increasing incidence has led to the search for new therapeutic options for its treatment. In this study, we demonstrated that three structural analogues of miltefosine (TCAN 26, TC 19, and TC 70) showed inhibitory activity against Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto and that TCAN 26 was more active in vitro than miltefosine against several isolates. Scanning electron microscopy showed that S. schenckii exposure to TCAN 26 resulted in cells that were slightly more elongated than untreated cells. Transmission electron microscopy showed that TCAN 26 treatment induced loss of the regular cytoplasmic electron-density and altered the cell envelope (disruption of the cell membrane and cell wall, and increased cell wall thickness). Additionally, TCAN 26 concentrations required to kill S. schenckii cells were lower than concentrations that were cytotoxic in mammalian cells, and TCAN 26 was more selective than miltefosine. Thus, the adamantylidene-substituted alkylphosphocholine TCAN 26 is a promising molecule for the development of novel antifungal compounds, although further investigations are required to elucidate the mode of action of TCAN 26 in S. schenckii cells...|$|E

Methodology: A retrospective and descriptive study was performed at a third-level hospital in Cali, Colombia, from January 2000 to June 2011. Records from patients having positive cultures for S. schenckii and/or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) -diastase stain showing blastoconidia were included in the analysis. Results: The group was made up of 20 men and three women. Eight patients (34. 8 %) were farmers and four (17. 4 %) worked in construction activities. Six (26. 1 %) were children aged under 15 years. Sporothrix sckenckii was isolated from cultures in 22 patients (95 %) and in 15 out of 21 (71. 4 %) blastoconidia were observed by direct examination. Fourteen patients (60. 9 %) had the lymphangitic form of the disease. Upper limbs were most frequently affected (16 cases; 69. 6 %). Twenty two patients were treated with potassium iodine. Conclusions: Lymphangitic sporotrichosis was the most common clinical form of the disease in this study. PAS-diastase stain seems to be a useful diagnostic tool for sporotrichosi...|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemic}} of sporotrichosis, a <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>mycosis</b> {{caused by the}} fungus Sporothrix schenckii, is ongoing in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in which cases of human infection are related to exposure to cats. In an attempt to demonstrate the zoonotic character of this epidemic using molecular methodology, we characterised by DNA-based typing methods 19 human and 25 animal S. schenckii isolates from the epidemic, {{as well as two}} control strains. To analyse the isolates, the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was performed using three different primers, together with DNA fingerprinting using the minisatellite derived from the wild-type phage M 13 core-sequence. The analyses generated amplicons with considerable polymorphism. Although isolates exhibited high levels of genetic relatedness, they could be clustered into 5 - 10 genotypes. The RAPD profiles of epidemic S. schenckii isolates could be distinguished from that of the United States isolate, displaying 20 % similarity to each primer and 60 % when amplified with the M 13 primer. DNA fingerprinting of S. schenckii isolated from the nails (42. 8 %) and the oral cavities (66 %) of cats were identical to related human samples, suggesting that there is a common infection source for animals and humans in this epidemic. It is clear that cats act as a vehicle for dissemination of S. schenckii...|$|E
