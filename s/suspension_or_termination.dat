This article critically analyses the decision of the trial judge, which is now on appeal to the full federal court, pointing out that key aspects of the reasoning are contrary to established law on authorisation liability, {{as well as to the}} text of the Copyright Act. As the article explains, while there are good grounds for an appeal, the outcome in the appeal court is far from certain. The article also examines the extent to which an ISP should be held liable for the infringing activities of its subscribers, concluding that this is a complex issue best dealt with by the legislature. If ISPs are to be given greater responsibility for the infringing activities of their subscribers, there may be a need for procedural safeguards to protect against unjust <b>suspensions</b> <b>or</b> <b>terminations</b> of subscriber accounts.

5000|$|A layoff is the {{temporary}} <b>suspension</b> <b>or</b> permanent <b>termination</b> of employment {{of an employee}} or, more commonly, a group of employees (collective layoff) for business reasons, such as personnel management or downsizing an organization. Originally, layoff referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work, or employment but this has evolved to a permanent elimination of a position in both British and US English, requiring the addition of [...] "temporary" [...] to specify the original meaning of the word. A layoff {{is not to be}} confused with wrongful termination. Laid off workers or displaced workers are workers who have lost or left their jobs because their employer has closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or shift was abolished (Borbely, 2011). Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce. Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Indeed, recent research on downsizing in the U.S., UK, and Japan suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance. [...] Usually a layoff occurs as a cost-cutting measure.|$|R
5000|$|CRI uses title 5 of the United States Code (5 U.S.C.) as the {{standard}} for its intelligence and counter-intelligence whistleblower reprisal investigations. Under section 2302 of title 5, a negative action such as a <b>suspension,</b> a demotion <b>or</b> <b>termination</b> {{is defined as a}} personnel action. [...] If a CRI investigation finds causation between a disclosure and a personnel action taken against the disclosure’s source, the case is substantiated. [...] But if the employee’s Agency has clear and convincing evidence that a personnel action would have been taken against a civilian employee absent their disclosure of alleged wrongdoing, the Inspector General “non-substantiates” the case. The Defense Intelligence Community reprisal complaints prompting DoDIG investigation may come to CRI and MRI through several channels. An employee may file through the Defense Hotline, or one of the DoD component hotlines oversighted by the DoDIG. In addition, complainants may contact a member of Congress to report the whistleblower retaliation and then be sent to the Inspector General, or the case may be referred to the DoDIG by the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Oversight (ATSD-IO), if it is forwarded through that office. The ATSD-IO administers DoD Regulation 5240.1-R, but very few of the complaints filed by DoD employees involved in intelligence and counterintelligence activities have included allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing activities.|$|R

30|$|In this article, {{we present}} {{results from a}} {{rigorous}} new analysis {{of the impact of}} the introduction of the original TTW program, incorporating multiple innovations relative to earlier efforts. The analysis exploits a feature of the initial TTW rollout in each phase: just before the start of the rollout, SSA selected the month in which it intended to mail each eligible beneficiary’s Ticket in an essentially random fashion. We use variation in the intended mail month to rigorously estimate how the timing of Ticket mailing affects beneficiary outcomes over the following 48 months, then use the estimates to draw inferences about impacts of TTW (versus no TTW) over the same period. The new analysis also takes advantage of improvements in the measurement of work related outcomes from administrative data, namely a monthly indicator of benefit <b>suspension</b> <b>or</b> <b>termination</b> for work (STW) and a count of months in nonpayment status after STW (NSTW months) and before returning to current-pay status, attainment of the full retirement age (FRA), or death (NSTW months) 5.
