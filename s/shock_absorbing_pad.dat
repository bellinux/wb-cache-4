40|$|In this paper, <b>shock</b> <b>absorbing</b> {{performance}} of a 3 -layered cushion system using RC core slab reinforced with Aramid Fiber Reinforced Plastic (AFRP) rods is discussed {{on the basis of}} experimental results. This system consists of RC core slab, sand (top) and Expanded poly-Styrol (bottom). In order to study the influence of the properties of RC slad on the <b>shock</b> <b>absorbing</b> performance, both material and reinforcement ratio of reinforcing bar and thickness of RC slad were changed. Furthermore, these results were compared with the results when single sand layer was used as cushion material. The experiments were conducted by a free drop of 3 tf heavy from a height of 30 m on the center of a cushion system. The results achieved from these experiments are: (1) The transmitted stress of a 3 -layered cushion system is distributed more effectively than that of single sand layer. (2) <b>Shock</b> <b>absorbing</b> performances of a 3 -layered cushion system would be influenced by the properties of RC slad.
