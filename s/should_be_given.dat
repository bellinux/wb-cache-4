He thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women. He was keen that women should realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up {{a status}} survey and {{conservation}} action plan for dragonflies. This proposes the establishment of protected areas {{around the world and}} the management of these areas to provide suitable habitat for dragonflies. Outside these areas, encouragement <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to modify forestry, agricultural, and industrial practices to enhance conservation. At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs to be done, consideration <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to pollution control and the public should be educated about the importance of biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|President John F. Kennedy {{solicited}} MacArthur's {{counsel in}} 1961. The {{first of two}} meetings was held shortly after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. MacArthur was extremely critical of the military advice given to Kennedy, and cautioned the young President to avoid a U.S. military build-up in Vietnam, pointing out that domestic problems <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> a much greater priority. Shortly before his death, MacArthur gave similar advice to President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E

That night, Catherine wakes up, experiencing symptoms of the disease. She quietly leaves the cabin and walks into the forest. The next morning, Black wakes up, and finding blood on Catherine's pillow, realizes she has gone.

5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy {{lay in his}} influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at {{the receiving end of}} an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} inaugural speech in August 1816, Jennings called {{attention}} to the need for an educational plan. In his 1817 annual message to the state legislature, he encouraged the establishment of a free, state-funded education system, as called for in the state constitution, but few of the state's citizens were willing to impose taxes to fund public schools. The state legislature believed priority <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to creating government infrastructure. Lack of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray's administration in 1826.|$|E

5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to promoting exports.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E
5|$|The 1880s was {{a decade}} of growing {{national}} prosperity, and increasing numbers of families from the expanding middle classes were sending their sons to boarding schools. The B.O.P. editor, George Hutchison, felt that such schools would provide the ideal setting for stories in which a boy hero (or heroes) could display Christian principles and strength of character {{in the face of}} temptations, and planned to run a long serial story. Reed, who had not himself attended a boarding school, was not the obvious choice as the writer. However, the skill and imagination he had displayed in his short school stories convinced Hutchison that Reed <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> the assignment.|$|E

5|$|The River Weaver is a river, navigable in {{its lower}} reaches, {{running in a}} curving route {{anti-clockwise}} across west Cheshire, northern England. Improvements to the river to make it navigable were authorised in 1720 and the work, which included eleven locks, was completed in 1732. An unusual clause in the enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that profits <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to the County of Cheshire {{for the improvement of}} roads and bridges, but the navigation was not initially profitable, and it was 1775 before the first payments were made. Trade continued to rise, and by 1845, over £500,000 had been given to the county.|$|E
