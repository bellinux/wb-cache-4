5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{analysis}} the music scholar Jane Glover has divided Monteverdi's list of instruments into three main groups: strings, brass and continuo, with a few further items not easily classifiable. The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family (viole da brazzo), two double basses (contrabassi de viola), and two small violins (violini piccoli alla francese). The viole da brazzo are in two five-part ensembles, each comprising two violins, two violas and a cello. The brass group contains four or five trombones (sackbuts), three trumpets and two cornetts. The continuo forces include two harpsichords (duoi gravicembani), a double harp (arpa doppia), two or three chitarroni, two pipe organs (organi di legno), three bass viola da gamba, and a regal or <b>small</b> <b>reed</b> organ. Outside of these groupings are two recorders (flautini alla vigesima secunda), and possibly one or more citterns—unlisted by Monteverdi, but included in instructions relating {{to the end of}} act 4.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} possible myth is {{the myth}} of the fire in the waters, a myth which centers around the possible deity *H2epom Nepōts, a fiery deity who dwells in water. In the Rigveda, the god Apám Nápát is envisioned as a form of fire residing in the waters. In Celtic mythology, a well belonging to the god Nechtain is said to blind all those who gaze into it. In an old Armenian poem, a <b>small</b> <b>reed</b> {{in the middle of the}} sea spontaneously catches fire and the hero Vahagn springs forth from it with fiery hair and a fiery beard and eyes that blaze as suns. In a ninth-century Norwegian poem by the poet Thiodolf, the name sǣvar niþr, meaning [...] "grandson of the sea," [...] is used as a kenning for fire. Even the Greek tradition contains possible allusions to {{the myth of}} a fire-god dwelling deep beneath the sea. The phrase [...] "νέποδες καλῆς Ἁλοσύδνης," [...] meaning [...] "descendants of the beautiful seas," [...] is used in The Odyssey 4.404 as an epithet for the seals of Proteus.|$|E

50|$|One {{important}} {{quality of}} the switch is its sensitivity, the amount of magnetic field necessary to actuate it. Sensitivity is measured in units of Ampere-turns (AT), corresponding to the current in a test coil multiplied {{by the number of}} turns in the test coil. Typical pull-in sensitivities for commercial devices are in the 10 to 60 AT range. The lower the AT, the more sensitive the <b>reed</b> switch. Also, <b>smaller</b> <b>reed</b> switches, which have smaller parts, are more sensitive to magnetic fields, so the <b>smaller</b> the <b>reed</b> switch's glass envelope is, the more sensitive it is.|$|R

40|$|The study {{deals with}} {{characteristics}} of behaviour, individual roost sites selections used by Eurasian Marsh Harrier (Circus aeruginosus) during autumnal migrations {{on the first}} known communal roost in Poland over the years 2003 - 2005. Eurasian Marsh Harriers communal roosts contained from 1 to 23 individuals which were spend nights in: Reed beds (Phragmites australis), Purple moor grasses Molinia cearulea, <b>Small</b> <b>reeds</b> (Calamagrostis sp.), Sedges (Carex sp.) thistles (Cirsium sp.). Adult birds were found to prefer centrally located individual roost sites, while juveniles rather the ones distributed regularly over {{the area of the}} roost. It was observed that Eurasian Marsh harriers competes for the centrally located individual roost sites. During pre-roost activities unsuccessful day foragers tend to hunt {{in the vicinity of the}} roost area. Some individual roost sites of Eurasian marsh harrier were also adopted by other vertebrates. The collected data indicate the informative and defence function of the roost...|$|R

50|$|St. John's was {{designated}} a pro-cathedral in 1924 while Saskatoon remained {{part of the}} Anglican Diocese of Saskatchewan with its cathedral in Prince Albert. In 1932 the Diocese of Saskatoon was created and St. John's became its cathedral. The cathedral had only a <b>small</b> <b>reed</b> organ and piano by way of musical instruments until 1956 when a three-manual Hill, Norman and Beard organ was built; it {{was replaced by a}} two-manual Casavant Frères organ in 1981-1982.|$|E
50|$|Their {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} freshwater marshes across from southeast Europe to central Asia. They usually nest either on floating vegetation in a marsh {{or on the}} ground very close to water, laying 2-4 eggs in a nest built of <b>small</b> <b>reed</b> stems and other vegetation. In winter, they migrate to Africa, southern Asia and Australia. It is a scarce vagrant in North America, mainly on the Atlantic coast, but a few records on the Pacific coast and inland in the Great Lakes area.|$|E
50|$|The western {{boundary}} of the bodden with the Koppelstrom forms the so-called Borner Bülten (Bulte i.e. small swampy, islands of reed). The Koppelstrom is the transition to another lagoon, the Saaler Bodden. To the east the Bodstedter Bodden is sepatated from the Barther Bodden and Zingster Strom by the Meiningen Narrows. To {{the south of the}} bodden is the lake of Redensee and the village of Fuhlendorf. To the northeast, the Prerower Strom, a former estuary, empties into the bodden. The deepest point of the bodden (10 metres in depth) lies {{just in front of the}} Meininger Bülten, the <b>small</b> <b>reed</b> islands by Meiningen. The rest of the bodden is only rarely deeper than 3 metres.|$|E
50|$|The suona {{as used in}} China has a conical wooden body, {{similar to}} that of the gyaling horn used by the Tibetan ethnic group, both of which uses a metal, usually a tubular brass or copper bocal to which a <b>small</b> double <b>reed</b> is affixed, and {{possesses}} a detachable metal bell at its end. The double-reed gives the instrument a sound {{similar to that of}} the modern oboe.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} has a conical hardwood {{body with}} seven finger holes. Unlike its Chinese and Korean counterparts, the kèn bầu has a detachable bell made of jackfruit wood, {{carved in the}} shape of a gourd (originally it was probably made out of an actual dried gourd, but wood is more durable). Into the playing end is fitted a small brass tube onto which a <b>small</b> double <b>reed</b> is placed.|$|R
50|$|The stripe-backed bittern makes <b>small</b> nests of <b>reeds</b> and stems, {{which are}} found above water level, among reeds. The clutch {{consists}} of three eggs. Incubation period for eggs is unknown, and breeding seasons appear to vary based on location.|$|R
5000|$|Scottish {{immigrant}} Jim Dunlop {{founded the}} Jim Dunlop Company in 1965 {{as a part-time}} business {{while working as a}} processing and chemical engineer at Barr and Stroud in Glasgow. He was an apprentice of creator of the first hip replacement, William [...] "Bill" [...] Wallace. His first product was the Vibra-Tuner, a small device that attached to a guitar with a suction cup and displayed whether the guitar was in tune with the vibration of a <b>small</b> <b>reed.</b> While visiting music stores to sell his new product, someone told him that musicians needed a good capo—remarking that anyone who made a good capo that could handle a 12-string guitar would make a lot of money.|$|E
50|$|Famous in this {{tower is}} also a {{so-called}} 'ruiterspel'. Riders on horseback perform during the striking of the hour a battle game while a wooden trumpeter blows his trumpet above it. Several times a day he plays an automatic melody after the full hour strike. The trumpet sound comes automatically from a small drum playing on a <b>small</b> <b>reed</b> organ directed from the clock and installed behind the riders on horse back. Because of changing in temperature the little organ must be regularly tuned by the city carillonneur of Alkmaar. For this the organ has double pipes for every tone. Labial and reed pipes. The melody played by the organ for the trumpet player comes from a little drum and can get a new melody {{in the same way}} as the big carillon drum.|$|E
50|$|The Kafwe Twa have a dark-hut {{method of}} fishing unique in Africa. The {{sides of the}} river are covered with a thick mat of vegetation. The Twa raise a <b>small</b> <b>reed</b> {{platform}} about 3 square at {{the margin of the}} vegetation, with a tube in the center down to the water. They cover themselves and the tube with blankets, blocking out light as the adjacent vegetation does and enabling them to see the fish in the river clearly. They then spear the fish with bident and trident spears up to 6 m long, and occasionally longer, depending on the depth of the water. In the 1950s there were several hundred of these platforms raised in the Twa fishing grounds, and catches were reported to be over 100 kg per person per day when the fish were running.|$|E
50|$|This bird is <b>smaller</b> than a <b>reed</b> bunting, but is {{relatively}} large-headed. The upper parts are brown and heavily streaked, and the underparts are white with an orange hue on the flanks and some fine dark streaks. Their stout beaks are pink.|$|R
50|$|Loans {{village was}} {{once part of}} the Fullarton Estate. Old maps show that a <b>small</b> loch, the <b>Reed</b> Loch, was located on the estate near Lochgreen House.
