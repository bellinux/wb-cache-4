50|$|The {{requirements}} for double seam examinations are specified in 21 CFR Part 113.60(a)(1). The regulation states that teardown examinations shall {{be performed by}} a trained closure technician at intervals of sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure. The teardown examinations shall {{be made on the}} packer's end double seams on at least one can from each <b>seaming</b> <b>head</b> to ensure maintenance of seam integrity. Sufficient frequency is defined in the regulation as intervals not to exceed 4 hours (operational time).|$|E
5000|$|Once brought {{together}} in the seamer, the <b>seaming</b> <b>head</b> presses a first operation roller against the end curl. The end curl is pressed against the flange curling it in toward the body and under the flange. The flange is also bent downward, and the end and body are now loosely joined together. The first operation roller is then retracted. At this point five thicknesses of steel exist in the seam. From the outside in they are: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>seaming</b> <b>head</b> then {{engages the}} second {{operation}} roller against the partly formed seam. The second operation presses all five steel components together tightly {{to form the}} final seal. The five layers in the final seam are then called; a) End, b) Body Hook, c) Cover Hook, d) Body, e) Countersink. All sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a hermetic seal. In most cases, a rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical seal between the end and the body.|$|E
50|$|Initially, Kermit was a lizard-like creature. He {{subsequently}} made {{a number}} of television appearances before his status as a frog was established. His collar was added at the time to make him seem more frog-like and to conceal the <b>seam</b> between his <b>head</b> and body.|$|R
40|$|Ventilation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{presented}} problems during the driving of dog headings. During driving such heading has only one connection with air stream routes, which significantly make difficult the process of its ventilation. In a case of its driving in coal in the methane <b>seam,</b> this <b>heading</b> is endangered also to methane emission. In such case process of its ventilation is much more difficult. In the paper there are presented results of numerical analysis of ventila-tion of blind dog headings using air-duct forcing the air into its mine face. The analysis was performed for four different velocities of the air at the outlet from air-duct. The calculations were made for the excavation of heading with heading machine and conveyor belt...|$|R
5000|$|These values {{should be}} taken with some caveats. Rain room tests show that some fabrics with less than 1,000 mm of water {{resistance}} keep water out sufficiently for practical purposes [...] Garments made from these fabrics tested in the Leeds University Rain Room show no signs of leakage after 4 hours of simulated rain five times heavier than heavy rain. However, some garments made from fabrics that exceed 20 000 mm have leaked through zips, hoods, and <b>seams.</b> Fabric <b>head</b> ratings do not totally specify water resistance of a garment, as it does not test closures such as zips. In addition, the breathability of nearly all waterproof/breathable fabrics is very dependent upon weather conditions, especially temperature, humidity and wind [...]|$|R
50|$|Cans {{are filled}} before {{the top is}} crimped on. The filling and sealing {{operations}} need to be extremely fast and precise. The filling head centers the can using gas pressure, purges the air, and lets the beverage flow {{down the sides of}} the can. The lid is placed on the can, and then crimped in two operations. A <b>seaming</b> <b>head</b> engages the lid from above while a seaming roller to the side curls the edge of the lid {{around the edge of the}} can body. The head and roller spin the can in a complete circle to seal all the way around. Then a pressure roller with a different profile drives the two edges together under pressure to make a gas-tight seal. Filled cans usually have pressurized gas inside, which makes them stiff enough for easy handling.|$|E
5000|$|The FDA {{regulations}} specifies {{the frequency}} and requirements of non-destructive testing: [...] "21 CFR Part 113.60(a) requires a visual examination of at least 1 can per <b>seaming</b> <b>head</b> by a qualified container closure inspector at intervals of sufficient frequency. The regulation requires that double seamed containers be visually inspected for gross closure defects such as sharp seams, cut-overs, deadheads, false seams, droops and broken chuck. The frequency of the visual examination should be made at intervals not to exceed 30 minutes (of operational time); and additional visual examinations must be performed immediately following a jam in a closing machine, after closing machine adjustment, or after startup of a machine following a prolonged shut-down. An example of a prolonged shut down may be when the plant ceases production at 6:00 PM and restarts production at 8:00 AM the next day." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{double seam}} is made using a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or seaming stations. The double seam is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the can body. Each <b>seaming</b> <b>head</b> typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some seaming machines have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, the can end is lowered on to the filled can body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the can body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some seaming machines, this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other seaming machines, the can is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the double seam into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and end material. In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and end material in a double seam without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a sealing compound.|$|E

While some might {{believe that there are}} actually two separate distinctive unit insignia (DUI), one for the 1st Battalion wolfhound unit crest which has the wolfhound facing to the left and 2nd Battalion wolfhound crest has the wolfhound facing to the right on the crest, the wolfhound crests are issued in pairs. While in a Class A uniform a coordinated pair of the two different crests is worn, one on each shoulder with the motto toward the shoulder <b>seam</b> and the <b>head</b> of the wolfhound facing forward.|$|R
5000|$|An Ankh-Morpork {{businessman}} who runs Hobson's Livery Stable, a multi-storey construction which sells and hires horses, {{as well as}} stabling other people's horses. For some reason it is a popular location for circumspect meetings. According to rumour, Hobson employs an Igor with a talent for taking body parts of different horses, and stitching them together into a [...] "new" [...] animal (see chop shop). Moist von Lipwig refers to a rumour {{that there is a}} horse in Ankh-Morpork with a longitudinal <b>seam</b> from <b>head</b> to tail. These rumours are rarely uttered in the presence of Hobson, who is a large man with a direct sense of humour when it comes to putting people with smart mouths on unbroken horses. He appears in Going Postal, although the stable had previously appeared in The Truth. His name is a reference to the real stable-owner Thomas Hobson, best known as the name behind the expression Hobson's choice. Hobson is a large man, described as looking similar to the result of shaving a bear.|$|R
40|$|Most coal seams, {{currently}} mined in the Karaganda Coal Basin, {{are prone}} to outburst. The main thick D 6 coal seam is considered as most prone to outburst risk. Trials of advance degassing from the surface have not given positive results because of low permeability. 100 mm diameter inseam holes are subsequently drilled in almost all longwall blocks to facilitate preliminary degassing of the coal seams. Gas extraction quantities are however low, even the holes are placed on suction To facilitate the gas release during longwall block development, of the main seam, a method of development below the seam was used. This gave rise to increase in permeability of overlying thick seam with high gas content, achieving a local degasification of the overlying seam by up to 90 %. The initial development roadway was driven under the seam, in rock, {{at a distance of}} between 8 - 12 m from seam floor in the same contour of the future development roadway in the coal seam. A relief area was created as a result of stress redistribution above the roadway. Degassing holes were drilled from the rock development, into the seam area of the future coal <b>seam</b> development <b>heading.</b> During traditional in seam development, outburst preventive measures were taken, which increased the labour intensiveness of development working, sharply decreasing the development rate. Application of these new techniques allowed increased development rates in seams to be realised, from 25 - 40 m per month to 120 - 150 m in the outburst prone areas...|$|R
50|$|The olive {{to brown}} {{carapace}} is oval to elliptical (to 22.9 cm) and widest behind the middle {{with a slightly}} serrated posterior rim. It is somewhat flattened dorsally, and the lateral marginals are upturned. A poorly developed vertebral keel may be present in juveniles and some adults. The flared 1st vertebral is the largest and broader than long, as is also the flared 5th. The 2nd and 3rd vertebrals are also usually broader than long, but the 4th, {{the smallest of the}} series, may be slightly longer or as long as broad. The cervical scute is normally longer than broad. The well-developed plastron is notched posteriorly. Its forelobe is longer and broader than the hindlobe; the narrowness of the posterior lobe is particularly noticeable in males, and its breadth is only 36-38% of the plastral length. The bridge is relatively broad. We have seen few specimens of Mesoclemmys dahli, but in those measured the plastral formula was: intergul > fem > abd > pect > an > hum >< gul. The intergular completely separates the gulars. Plastron, bridge, and undersides of the marginals are cream to yellow with gray pigment outlining the <b>seams.</b> The <b>head</b> is large and broad with a slightly projecting snout and slightly notched upper jaw. There are twochin barbels, and the dorsal surface of the head is covered with small to large, irregularly shaped scales. Dorsally, the head is gray to olive brown, but the upper jaw, tympanum, and sides are cream to yellow. Lower jaw, chin, and barbels are yellow. The neck is gray dorsally but lighter ventrally. No horny tubercles are present on the neck. Limbs and tail are gray to olive brown on the outside but lighter beneath.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe tapered sensory rays of {{the male}} Caenorhabditis elegans are {{important}} for successful male/hermaphrodite copulation. A group of ram (ray morphology abnormal) genes encoding modifying enzymes and transmembrane protein have been reported as key regulators controlling ray morphogenesis. Here we report the characterization of another component essential for this morphogenetic process encoded by mab- 7. This gene is active in the hypodermis, structural cells, the body <b>seam</b> and several <b>head</b> neurons. It encodes a novel protein with a hydrophobic region at the N-terminus, an EGF-like motif, an ShKT motif and a long C-terminal tail. All these domains are shown to be critical to MAB- 7 activity except the EGF-like domain, {{which appears to be}} regulatory and dispensable. MAB- 7 is shown to be a type II membrane protein, tethered on the cell surface by the N-terminal transmembrane domain with the remainder of the protein exposed to the extracellular matrix. Since ectopic mab- 7 expression in any ray cell or even in touch neurons of non-ray lineage can rescue the mutant phenotype, mab- 7 is probably acting non-autonomously. It may facilitate intercellular communication among ray cells to augment normal ray morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} feature of social insects is the division of labor. However the complete genetic base of these behaviors isn’t cleared out yet. Because {{it is such a}} complex mechanism, it presumably has a multigenic origin. One of the genes found {{to be involved in the}} division of labor, is the foraging (for) gene. This gene was first discovered in Drosophila melanogaster. In the honey bee Apis mellifera the foraging gene (amfor) is a single copy gene without allelic variants. Foraging workers have a higher expression than the in hive working nurses. In the social wasp Vespula vulgaris though, the opposite is found with a higher expression in nurses. Another gene involved in the division of labor in A. mellifera is malvolio. Also this gene was first discovered in D. melanogaster where a mutation in the gene caused a reduced responsiveness to sucrose. MVL probably functions as a Mn 2 +/Fe 2 + transporter. Because manganese affects sucrose responsiveness in D. melanogaster, and sucrose responsiveness is related to division of labor in honey bee colonies, they studied mvl in A. mellifera. The levels of mvl mRNA in the brain and manganese in the <b>head</b> <b>seamed</b> to be higher in pollen foragers compared with nurses, with nectar foragers intermediate. So mvl is involved in the honey bee division of labor. Similar to the for gene we wanted to test the V. vulgaris expression pattern of mvl and compare it with the honey bee. Apparently there isn’t a specific expression pattern of malvolio in the wasp. status: publishe...|$|R
