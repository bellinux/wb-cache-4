5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant <b>storage</b> <b>battery.</b> With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Recently, {{several types}} of Distributed Generators (DGs) have been {{connected}} {{together to form a}} small power system called a micro grid (MG). MG usually operates in normal connecting mode and is connected to the main grid. If a fault occurs in the main grid, MG will transfer immediately to the islanding mode. This paper developed a complete model which can simulate, in detail, the dynamic performance of the MG during and subsequent to islanding occurrence. The developed model is used to investigate the effect of using <b>storage</b> <b>batteries</b> for enhancing MG dynamic performance during all modes. Two cases are studied, the first case discusses the effect of the islanding process on the frequency, voltages and active powers of all micro sources when there are no <b>storage</b> <b>batteries</b> installed inside the MG. The second studied case investigates the effect of islanding occurrence on the MG performance when MG is equipped with two <b>storage</b> <b>batteries.</b> In the two studied cases, wind speed and irradiance vary continuously. Results proved that the existence of <b>storage</b> <b>batteries</b> led to dramatic improvement in the dynamic performance of the MG during subsequent islanding occurrence. Also, MG performance, when exposed to a severe disturbance, led to an unacceptable frequency drop is studied and load shedding strategy activation during this situation is also highlighted...|$|R

2500|$|Early cabooses {{were nothing}} more than flat cars with small cabins erected on them, or {{modified}} box cars. The standard form of the American caboose had a platform at either end with curved grab rails to facilitate train crew members' ascent onto a moving train. A caboose was fitted with red lights called markers to enable the rear of the train to be seen at night. This has led to the phrase [...] "bringing up the markers" [...] to describe the last car on a train (these lights were officially what made a train a [...] "train"). Originally lit with oil lamps, with the advent of electricity, later caboose versions incorporated an electrical generator driven by belts coupled to one of the axles, which charged a lead-acid <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> when the train was in motion. The addition of the cupola, a lookout post atop the car, was introduced in 1863.|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, {{the panic}} of 1907 caused Stickney {{to lose control}} of the railroad, and {{ownership}} passed to financier J. P. Morgan.

In the same year, the railroad also purchased ten large 2-6-6-2s from the Baldwin Locomotive Works. [...] Two years later, the railroad acquired an experimental battery powered motorcar from the Federal <b>Storage</b> <b>Battery</b> Car Company. In 1916, the railroad began standardizing on 2-8-2 steam locomotives, which served through the 1920. During the 1920s, as ownership changed again to the Bremo Corporation, {{a group of investors}} led by Patrick Joyce, an executive at the Standard Steel Car Company, the railroad expanded its use of self-propelled vehicles. At the end of the decade, 36 2-10-4 steam locomotives were purchased from Baldwin and the Lima Locomotive Works.|$|E
