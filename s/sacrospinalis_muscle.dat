40|$|Background: The {{concept of}} {{minimally}} invasive techniques {{is to make}} every effort to reduce tissue damage. Certainly, reducing skin incision {{is an important part of}} these techniques. This study aimed to investigate the clinical feasibility of Mast Quadrant-assisted modified transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) with a small single posterior median incision. Methods: During the period of March 2011 to March 2012, 34 patients with single-segment degenerative lumbar disease underwent the minimally invasive modified TLIF assisted by Mast Quadrant with a small single posterior median incision (single incision group). The cases in this group were compared to 37 patients with single-segment degenerative lumbar disease in the double incision group. The perioperative conditions of patients in these two groups were statistically analyzed and compared. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, and <b>sacrospinalis</b> <b>muscle</b> damage evaluation indicators before operation and 3, 12 months postoperation were compared. Results: A total of 31 and 35 cases in the single incision and double incision groups, respectively, completed at least 12 months of systemic follow-up. The differences in perioperative conditions between the two groups were not statistically significant. The incision length of the single incision group was significantly shorter than that of the double incision group (P < 0. 01). The ODI and VAS scores of patients in both groups improved significantly at 3 and 12 months postoperation. However, these two indicators at 3 and 12 months postoperation and the <b>sacrospinalis</b> <b>muscle</b> damage evaluation indicators at 3 months postoperation did not differ significantly between the two groups (P ≥ 0. 05). Conclusions: Mast Quadrant-assisted modified TLIF with a small single posterior median incision has excellent clinical feasibility compared to minimally invasive TLIF with a double paramedian incision...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} tendon {{transference}} is employed {{to relieve the}} poliomyelitic gluteus limp. We believe {{that in order to}} remedy the gluteus limp, opposite <b>sacrospinalis</b> <b>muscle</b> is the best choice as a power source because it works synergistic with the affected glutei. On this belief, we have operated on twenty poliomyelitic patients with affected glutei since 1958. The short term results of this experiment {{have been found to be}} satisfactory. There remains, however, much problems to be studied in order to find techniques for building up muscle bulk and its size as a power source. The poliomyelitic gluteus limp is so peculiar that most orthopedic surgeons are able to make a correct diagnosis at a glance. Its awkwa-rdness is caused mainly by pelvic sagging to opposite side and swaying trunk toward disabled side. Furthermore pelvic back thrust simultaneously accompanied by increased lumbar lordosis makes the limp more awkward (Inman). To the orthopedic surgeon it presents a serious problem and it is reporte...|$|E
40|$|Albino rats {{weighing}} 160 to 175 gm. {{were fed}} a complete synthetic diet containing 0. 003 per cent potassium and 0. 7 per cent sodium for 40 days. Controls {{were given the}} same diet plus adequate added potassium. 1. Data from analyses of serum and skeletal muscle showed (a) a fall in serum chloride concentration {{and an increase in}} serum carbon dioxide concentration and pH in the potassium-deficient rats; (b) increases of sodium, magnesium, and calcium and a decrease of potassium in the muscle of the potassium-deficient rats; (c) no change of muscle chloride or carbon dioxide concentrations in the potassium-deficient rats. (2) Application of the Wallace-Hastings calculations to these data revealed (a) intracellular pH of the skeletal muscle of the normal rat to be 6. 98 ± 0. 08; (b) an increase in serum partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) in potassium deficiency, together with increases in concentrations of [H 2 CO 2] and [HCO 3 -] per kg. extracellular water and [H 2 CO 3] per kg. cell water; (c) a decrease in values for [CO 2] and [HCO 3 -] per kg. intracellular water; (d) a fall of intracellular pH in potassium deficiency to 6. 42 ± 0. 05. (3) Analyses of <b>sacrospinalis</b> <b>muscle</b> from five men undergoing operation for ruptured intervertebral disc showed a mean value of 9. 46 ± 1. 31 mM carbon dioxide per kg. blood-free tissue. Some problems of interpretation of data are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, various {{commercial}} abdominal exercise machines {{have been}} heavily promoted and advertised through frequently aired infomercials on television; however, the effectiveness {{and safety of}} those devices are questionable. The present independent {{study was designed to}} evaluate if there were any differences in myoelectric activities assessed by means of surface electromyography between abdominal exercises as per-formed on a commercially available machine, the AbRoller, and a traditionally performed crunch. A total of 31 non-obese participants (age: 21. 6 ± 4. 5 years; mass: 66. 4 ± 6. 8 kg; height: 161. 9 ± 8. 4 cm) volunteered to par-ticipate in the study. Each participant performed four repetitions of abdominal exercises with ankles stabilized and four repetitions of equivalent exercises without ankles stabilized on both the AbRoller and the traditional crunches. During the executions of the four forms of abdominal exercises, the relative peak and mean myo-electric activities of the rectus abdominis, rectus femoris, <b>sacrospinalis,</b> and sternocleidomastoid <b>muscles</b> were measured. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA and paired t tests were employed to determine if differences in the relative peak and mean myoelectric data existed between the AbRoller and the traditional abdominal exercises. With respect to the rectus abdominis, rectus femoris, and <b>sacrospinalis</b> <b>muscles,</b> no significant dif-ferences (p> 0. 05) in the relative peak and mean myoelectric activities between the AbRoller-performed and the traditionally performed abdominal exercises were found. Abdominal exercises performed using th...|$|R
5000|$|The WFEs {{were for}} many years the {{standard}} for non-surgical low back pain treatment.These exercises were performed in the supine position on a floor or other flat surface. There were variations, but the primary maneuver is to grab the legs and pull the knees up to the chest and hold them there for several seconds. The patient then relaxes, drops the legs down and repeats the exercise again. The primary benefit {{is supposed to be}} the opening of the intervertebral foramen, the stretching of ligmentous structures, and the distraction of the apophyseal joints. The goals of performing these exercises were to reduce pain and provide lower trunk stability by actively developing the [...] "abdominal, gluteus maximus, and hamstring muscles as well as..." [...] passively stretching the hip flexors and lower back (<b>sacrospinalis)</b> <b>muscles.</b> Williams said: [...] "The exercises outlined will accomplish a proper balance between the flexor and the extensor groups of postural muscles...". Williams suggested that a posterior pelvic-tilt position was necessary to obtain best results. This flexion has been shown to help mitigate back pain and has been demonstrated to accomplish the following: a) significantly increase the canal area, b) increase the midsagittal diameter, c) increase the subarticular sagittal diameter, and d) increase all the foraminal dimensions significantly ...|$|R
