5|$|The <b>stave</b> churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of <b>stave</b> church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new <b>stave</b> churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old <b>stave</b> churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{more than}} 1000 <b>stave</b> churches {{were built in}} Norway during the Middle Ages, most of them during the 12th and 13th centuries. Until the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, as many as 150 <b>stave</b> churches still existed. Many were destroyed as part of a religious movement that favored simple, puritan lines, and today only 28 remain, though a large number were documented and recorded by measured drawings before they were demolished.|$|E
5|$|Chain-sword {{dance is}} a group dance in which the dancers first use a sword or other {{implement}} (stick, <b>stave,</b> etc.) to link themselves in a chain. In the Hungarian tradition, the Erdőbénye cooper dance represents this form of dance.|$|E

5|$|Not {{counting}} the 28 remaining <b>stave</b> churches, at least 250 wooden houses predating the Black Death in 1350 are preserved {{more or less}} intact in Norway. Most of these are log houses, some with added stave-built galleries or porches.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinctive}} timber building traditions {{found their}} confluence in Norwegian architecture. One was {{the practice of}} log building with horizontal logs notched at the corners, a technique {{thought to have been}} imported from the peoples to the east of Scandinavia. The other was the <b>stave</b> building tradition (typically found in <b>stave</b> churches), possibly based on improvements on the prehistoric long houses that had roof-bearing posts dug into the ground. Although there is scant archaeological evidence of actual buildings from the earliest permanent structures, finds of Viking ships (e.g., the Oseberg ship) suggest significant mastery of woodworking and engineering. In the Lofoten archipelago in Northern Norway, a Viking chieftain's holding has been reconstructed at the Lofotr Viking Museum.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 39 in {{the first}} innings in the Second Test at Lord's, Macartney took 1/90, {{removing}} centurion Jack Hobbs as England took a 92-run first innings lead. He then scored 133 not out in the second innings, to help to <b>stave</b> off defeat. Australia were 5/194 when the match ended, and {{were it not for}} Macartney's effort could have been bowled out.|$|E

5|$|Despite Daniel's injury {{late in the}} season, the Canucks {{won their}} second {{consecutive}} Presidents' Trophy. He remained out of the lineup {{for the first three}} games of the 2012 playoffs, all of which the Canucks lost against the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings. Returning for Game 4, Daniel helped the Canucks <b>stave</b> off elimination before they were defeated the following contest. In his two games played in the series, he recorded two assists.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{continued}} to crop up. Many Chinese Malayan youths {{drafted into the}} army to <b>stave</b> off communist attacks fled the country; most participants were English- and not Chinese-educated. To the Malays, this indicated that the Chinese had no particular loyalty towards Malaya and justified ketuanan Melayu, heightening similar perceptions caused by the apparent racial dichotomy between those in fierce opposition to the communists and those supporting the MCP.|$|E
5|$|After their {{win over}} Manchester City, the team then went a club-record 19 games without a victory, {{eventually}} finishing the 1999–2000 season 17th, with two late wins helping <b>stave</b> off relegation. The 2000–01 season saw them again narrowly avoid relegation, finishing 19th overall. The 2001–02 season {{turned out to}} be the club's worst ever season at the time. With Stockport already bottom of the league, a 4–0 home defeat to Millwall saw manager Kilner sacked. Former England international Carlton Palmer was appointed in November 2001. Palmer subsequently failed to stop Stockport being relegated in 2001–02 or to build a team capable of challenging for a return the next season.|$|E

50|$|Potions and oils, {{in these}} editions, {{generally}} reproduce {{the effects of}} low level spells. Likewise, wands and <b>staves</b> also reproduce standard spell effects; wands contain charges of a single spell (which will cost only one charge), while <b>staves</b> contain multiple spells, some of which can cost more than one charge to activate. A few types of <b>staves,</b> such as the staff of power, have additional properties.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1998–99 season, Kartik took 23 wickets for Vijay Cricket Club in the Chennai League. He played more {{regularly}} in the 1998–99 Ranji Trophy, taking 29 wickets in seven matches at 19.3 to be the 13th highest wicket-taker. This included a 3/8 and 4/62 in an innings win over Rajasthan, and 5/84 and 5/55 in the last two matches of the campaign against Tamil Nadu and Delhi. He also added 29 and 53 with the bat against Tamil Nadu to help <b>stave</b> off a defeat after his team had trailed by over 200 on the first innings.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to <b>stave</b> off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|However, {{soon after}} the {{encounter}} with Cardinal Draclau, Ramza discovers that an elaborate plot was set by the Murond Glabados Church. In their desire to control Ivalice, the Church, particularly the High Priest, Marge Funeral, uses {{the legend of the}} so-called holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones, and fuels the Lion War between Larg and Goltana. To <b>stave</b> off Ramza's interference, Draclau uses the stone to transform into a legendary Lucavi demon, and Ramza {{has no choice but to}} slay him/it. As a result, Ramza is regarded a heretic of the Church, and he is approached by the Heretic Examiner Zalmo at Lesalia Imperial Capital.|$|E

5|$|In the 1988–89 season, Dozzell {{finished}} as the club's joint top-scorer (with John Wark and Dalian Atkinson), scoring 13 goals from 37 appearances. The {{following two}} seasons saw Dozzell {{as a regular}} starter for the team, with 18 goals from 88 appearances. His 16 goals in the 1991–92 season helped John Lyall's Ipswich win the league title and secure promotion to the newly formed Premier League. He featured regularly the following season, scoring nine goals in 52 games and helping the club <b>stave</b> off relegation in their first season back in the top tier of English football.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden <b>stave</b> at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden <b>stave,</b> and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier had been his roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to <b>stave</b> off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E

50|$|Historically, a {{musician}} {{was required to}} draw his own staff lines (<b>staves)</b> onto blank paper. Eventually, staff paper was manufactured pre-printed with <b>staves</b> as a labor-saving technique. The musician could then write music directly onto the lines in pencil or ink.|$|R
50|$|A single {{vertical}} line {{drawn to the}} left of multiple <b>staves</b> creates a system, indicating that the music on all the <b>staves</b> is to be played simultaneously. A bracket is an additional {{vertical line}} joining <b>staves,</b> to show groupings of instruments that function as a unit, such as the string section of an orchestra. A brace is used to join multiple <b>staves</b> that represent a single instrument, such as a piano, organ, harp, or marimba. Sometimes, a second bracket is used to show instruments grouped in pairs, such as the first and second oboes, or the first and second violins in an orchestra. In some cases, a brace is used for this purpose instead of a bracket.|$|R
5|$|Morehead was a {{delegate}} to the Peace Conference of 1861 and the Border States Convention that attempted to <b>stave</b> off the Civil War. Although he favored Kentucky's neutrality, Morehead sympathized with the South and was an open critic of the Lincoln administration. He was imprisoned for disloyalty in September 1861, although no formal charges were ever brought against him. He {{was released from prison}} in January 1862, and afterward fled to Canada, Europe, and Mexico. After the war, he returned to the United States and settled on his plantation in Greenville, Mississippi, where he died on December 21, 1868.|$|E
5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} to <b>stave</b> off the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight {{as to whether}} or not he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers' trip to Norway {{provided}} essential {{knowledge for}} the animators {{to come up}} with the design aesthetic for the film in terms of color, light, and atmosphere. According to Giaimo, there were three important factors that they had acquired from the Norway research trip: the fjords, which are the massive vertical rock formations, and serve as the setting for the secluded kingdom of Arendelle; the medieval <b>stave</b> churches, whose rustic triangular rooflines and shingles inspired the castle compound; and the rosemaling folk art, whose distinctive paneling and grid patterns informed the architecture, decor, and costumes.|$|E
40|$|Wijk bij Duurstede {{is built}} {{on top of the}} Early Medieval {{settlement}} Dorestad. In 2008 ‘Veilingterrein’, an area adjoining the former port area, was excavated. Among the finds were 50 water wells. For this study two of these wells were investigated at the Cultural Heritage Agency (lab Stichting RING/RCE). One water well was made of a discarded cask made of 23 oak <b>staves</b> and a piece of beech. Samples were taken from the <b>staves</b> and the tree rings measured. The <b>staves</b> were found to originate from one single tree. Synchronising the data from all <b>staves</b> created a series of 111 tree rings, including 11 sapwood rings. This series did not match reliably with the reference chronologies. Cross-dating individual <b>staves</b> with the chronologies was not successful either. The piece of beech could not be dated dendrochronologically. The second water-well, a hollowed-out oak, was sampled, the synchronised measurements totalled 92 rings, no sapwood was present. The wood did not match with the reference chronologies...|$|R
5000|$|Finale 2011 was {{released}} in June 2010 with additional Garritan Sounds, Alpha Notes (notation with note names inside), a new lyric entry window and other lyric enhancements, and, most notably, a reworking of staff, system, and page layout handling. In Finale versions before 2011, systems could be optimized to remove empty <b>staves</b> from them and also permit <b>staves</b> in a system to be positioned independently from other systems. Eliminating empty <b>staves</b> from systems with many <b>staves</b> (sometimes called French scoring) is a common notation practice used to economize (or optimize) {{the use of the}} page. Users needed to take caution while optimizing, because if measures with notes were moved into an optimized system, or notes were added to <b>staves</b> while viewing the score in Scroll View that had been optimized out, they could be omitted in the printed score. The recommended solution was to always optimize as the last step in the score editing process, immediately before printing.|$|R
50|$|Mole Man has {{a series}} of similar-looking <b>staves</b> (6 feet long, made of wood or aluminum), {{designed}} by the Mad Thinker, which contain built-in weapon(s) and additional features. Among such weaponry are an electrical blaster, a flame-thrower, a vibro-charge blaster, and a laser cannon. All the staffs {{appear to have a}} low-energy radar. All <b>staves</b> are booby-trapped with a galvanic response meter that is tuned solely to the Mole Man's skin conductivity; this prevents anyone else from activating his <b>staves.</b>|$|R
