For standard IVP, 20 ml of contrast medium has been used, but contrast effect has been often insufficient in those patients with impaired renal function or obesity. This often invited difficulties in diagnosis, requiring more improvement for distinct pyelograms. In view of this, we have, <b>since</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> practiced double dose technique in routine in which twice the amount of contrast medium was administered, and have obtained satisfactory contrast effect.

In the face of declining enrolments in the enabling sciences, the program seeks to foster a culture of academic generosity by bringing our current and future scientists together to participate in authentic scientific research. Developed jointly with a local, non-selective but high performing secondary school, the SSEP aims to draw talented students into university science degree programs, particularly in the enabling science disciplines. The SSEP provides secondary school students with an insight into university campus life and how research is conducted via their participation in a research project, under the mentorship of science PhD students. <b>Since</b> its inception <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> the program has obtained consistently positive feedback from the participants. However, in order to better understand the benefits of such a program, this paper investigates the program’s perceived educational benefits for these students through pre- and post-program surveys.

Haftar and his campaign against Islamist militias and also in support of Haftar's calls to suspend parliament. In Benghazi, thousands of pro-Haftar demonstrators gathered outside Tibesti Hotel and in the city's Tahreer Square, as well as others in the city of Bayda further east. [...] "No to militias, Libya will not become another Afghanistan" [...] and [...] "Yes to the army, yes to the police", their banners read. Meanwhile, crowds in Tripoli's Martyr's Square chanted against the parliament and in support of a national army and police force to replace the militias that run rampant in the country. They sang the national anthem as they waved the flag and carried banners that read [...] "Yes to Dignity". They called for an official response to the militias. [...] "Libya is in trouble, we want police, we want army", they chanted. While some Libyans don't back Haftar and don't want military rule, they support what he is doing.

30|$|Although the {{government}} had previously experimented with the provision of a 1 -year pre-primary class within primary schools between the late 70 s and early 90 s, 2014 was the watershed year as it marked a prominent milestone in the evolutionary journey of the Singapore preschool landscape {{with the establishment of}} the first five MOE-run kindergartens. Set up in response to a growing demand for high-quality kindergarten education, the former Education Minister, Heng Swee Keat, who was also the co-Chair for the inter-ministerial MOE–MSF Implementation Committee for Enhancing PSE outlined plans for the establishment of 15 MOE kindergartens between 2014 and 2016. The sites of these 15 public kindergartens appeared to be carefully selected within community spaces and primary schools located in the suburban towns where most families live in public flats in order to better reach out to children from middle and lower income families. The MOE kindergartens are intended to (1) provide quality PSE that is affordable to Singaporeans, (2) pilot teaching and learning resources developed by MOE specialists for sharing with the preschool sector, and (3) work with other preschool operators to distill and share good practices that are scalable, suitable, and sustainable for the Singaporean context (Heng 2013). MOE reported that as of April 2016, there is a total enrollment of about 1700 children in the 15 government kindergartens (Puthucheary 2016). MOE is tracking the inaugural batch of 267 K 2 children who have moved on to P 1 in January 2016. The development and learning of the children from MOE kindergartens is also being assessed and monitored under an ongoing large-scale longitudinal research study of the impact of PSE on children’s learning outcomes (Teng 2015). <b>Since</b> its inception <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> a growth in demand and enrollment in the MOE kindergartens has been reported (Davie 2017) and MOE has received positive feedback from parents that their children enjoyed learning at the MOE kindergartens and were more independent, expressive, and confident with good social skills that helped them to adapt well in primary schools (Ng 2016; Puthucheary 2016). Other than adding a new PSE option to the parents, there has been no great observable impact created by the nation’s nascent public preschool industry since the sector remains primarily privatized with the preservation of a variegated curricular and pedagogical landscape. MOE has made no indication thus far on the future and long-term development plans for these public kindergartens, except for the recent announcement that an additional three centers would be set up in 2018 in neighborhoods with young families. It is postulated that until more conclusive evidence is gathered from a proper evaluation of the impact and experience of the MOE kindergartens, it seems too early to predict how {{the government}}’s direct involvement in running kindergartens will eventually transform the overall quality of children’s preschool experiences and Singapore’s preschool ecology.|$|R
