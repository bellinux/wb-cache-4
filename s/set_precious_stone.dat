50|$|Trained at {{the height}} of the Art Deco movement, Belperron {{softened}} its linear aesthetic, using materials and designs other jewellers hadn't explored yet. She pioneered the technique of <b>setting</b> <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> in semiprecious materials. In addition to adapting these motifs in a unique way, she also opted for 22 karat gold, a softer karat level than commonly used, purely for its color.|$|R
60|$|So {{she led the}} way {{and they}} {{followed}} her to a beautiful apartment, large and grand, with high ceilings <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones.</b> In {{the middle of the}} room stood the Queen's magnificent throne.|$|R
50|$|Fensterstock’s {{training}} in Metalsmithing + Jewelry dominated her early work that centered on conversations about adornment, beauty, preciousness, and ephemerality. In her series Precarious Heirlooms, Fensterstock utilized such materials as potatoes, bananas, and soap, <b>setting</b> <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> and pearls in the materials. The temporary {{nature of these}} base materials changed the pieces over time; the soap dried and cracked, the potatoes shriveled and grew tendril like sprouts, and the banana rotted turning black and deflated. Fensterstock documented these changes, referring to them as What Happens.|$|R

50|$|In Nuremberg, Germany, between 1531 and 1572, {{apprentices}} {{who wished}} to become master goldsmith were required to produce columbine cups, dice for a steel seal, and gold rings <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> before they could be admitted to the goldsmiths' guild. If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves.

But {{it was clear that he}} would merely try the effect of a conference on the defenders of the walls, since by the advice of Antoninus he was in haste to go elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|The belt {{was quickly}} removed {{and the body}} released, when it sank with a heavy plunge, but ere long reappeared on the surface. The {{fishermen}} rowed a considerable distance away from it, and then shipped their oars and examined the belt, which was made of linen.

5000|$|In 1998, Camille Berthet, {{who also}} {{came from a}} watchmaking family, took over the Charles Oudin brand. Today the firm {{produces}} mostly jewellery watches. The [...] "Retro" [...] and [...] "Deco" [...] collections were inspired by Art Deco watches from the early 20th century. The [...] "Historique" [...] collection, with gold and platinum complication watches, is evocative {{of the history of}} the firm, when Charles Oudin was Horologist to the French Navy. The [...] "Curvex" [...] collection, launched in 1999, comprises watches that are entirely <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones,</b> like a ring. The [...] "Full Amazone" [...] watch, now an emblem of the firm, was created in 2000.|$|R
60|$|What {{was that}} which clicked against his breastplate? He felt, {{and found a}} metal bauble linked to a mesh of his steel armor by a strand of silken hair. He carried the little thing to the window, and in the waning light made {{it out to be}} a golden hair {{ornament}} <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones,</b> but he could not tell if the little strand of silken hair were black or brown. Carefully he detached the little thing, and, winding the filmy tress about it, placed it within the breast of his tunic. He was vaguely troubled by it, yet why he could scarcely have told, himself.|$|R
5000|$|The Crown's {{frame is}} made of quality 18 karat gold. Its circlet base {{supports}} eight imperial semi-arches, connected at the top by a golden monde, {{which in turn is}} surmounted by a jeweled cross, forming a globus cruciger. Inside the half-arches lies a dark-green velvet cap (matching the dark green colour of the top surface of the Emperor's robe). The Crown is <b>set</b> with 639 <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> (all diamonds), and 77 pearls of 8 millimeters each.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the waters}} had {{subsided}} the defenders then launched a counterattack, poured {{over the walls}} and secured an immense amount of plunder. The Spanish retreated in complete disorder throwing away everything they had. The English were for first into the fray; Spanish pistols, priests cassocks, swords, gold chains, pendants and enamelled shields were all taken from the dead and dying. There were heaps of Spanish and Italian dead under the [...] "Sandhill" [...] and along {{the wall of the}} old town, amidst broken siege equipment. Among the dead and wounded was the discovery of a young Spanish girl in male attire, who had fallen in the assault and under her dress was a chain of gold <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones,</b> along with other jewels and silver.|$|R
60|$|And {{by and by}} {{arrived a}} {{succession}} of merchants bringing horned hoods, transparent veils, like wings, supported on wire projections, long trained dresses of silk and sendal, costly stomachers, bands of velvet, buckles <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones,</b> chains of gold and silver--all the fashions, in fact, enough to turn the head of any young lady, and in which the staid Lady Prioress seemed to take quite as much interest {{as if she had}} been to wear them herself--indeed, she asked leave to send Sister Mabel to fetch a selection of the older nuns given to needlework and embroidery to enjoy the exhibition, though it was to be carefully kept out of sight of the younger ones, and especially of the novices.|$|R
60|$|Disappointed, I {{closed the}} drawer and tried another, with no better fortune. Here were under-vestments of fine linen, newly washed and {{fragrant}} with rosemary. I abandoned the drawer and gave {{my attention to}} the cupboard above. It was locked, but the key was there. It opened, and my candle reflected a blaze on gold and silver vessels, consecrated chalices; a dazzling monstra, and several richly-carved ciboria of solid gold, <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones.</b> But in a corner I espied a dark-brown, gourd-shaped object. It was a skin of wine, and, with a half-suppressed cry of joy, I seized it. In that instant a piercing scream rang through {{the stillness of the}} church, and startled me so that I stood there for some seconds, frozen in horror, a hundred wild conjectures leaping to my mind.|$|R
5000|$|A collar is {{an ornate}} chain, often made {{of gold and}} enamel, and <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones,</b> which is worn about the neck {{as a symbol of}} {{membership}} in various chivalric orders. It is a particular form of the livery collar, the grandest form of the widespread phenomenon of livery in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period. Orders which have several grades often reserve the collar for the highest grade (usually called the Grand Cross). The links of the chain are usually composed of symbols of the order, and the badge (also called [...] "decoration", [...] "cross" [...] or [...] "jewel") of the order normally hangs down in front. Sometimes the badge is referred to by what is depicted on it; for instance, the badge that hangs from the chain of the Order of the Garter is referred to as [...] "the George".|$|R
60|$|The King {{was fond}} of ornamenting his palaces with curious {{tapestry}} and jewelry, worthy of the wedding-gift his wife had received from her sister, Queen Marguerite, namely, a silver ewer for perfumes, {{in the shape of}} a peacock, the tail <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones.</b> He adorned the walls with paintings; there were Scripture subjects in his palace at Westminster; and at Winchester, his birthplace, were pictures of the Saxon kings, a map of the world, and King Arthur's round table, inscribed with the names of the knights, and Arthur's full-length figure in his own place. It has survived all changes; it was admired by a Spanish attendant at the marriage of Philip II. and Queen Mary; it was riddled by the balls of the Roundheads, and now, duly refreshed with paint, hangs in its old place, over the Judge's head in the County Hall.|$|R
6000|$|In fact, on {{the very}} first {{interview}} which Astyages had with Cyrus, an instance of the boy's readiness and tact occurred, which impressed his grandfather very much in his favor. The Persians, as has been already remarked, were accustomed to dress very plainly, while, on the other hand, at the Median court the superior officers, and especially the king, were always very splendidly adorned. Accordingly, when Cyrus was introduced into his grandfather's presence, he was quite dazzled with the display. The king wore a purple robe, very richly adorned, with a belt and collars, which were embroidered highly, and <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones.</b> He had bracelets, too, upon his wrists, of the most costly character. He wore flowing locks of artificial hair, {{and his face was}} painted, after the Median manner. Cyrus gazed upon this gay spectacle for a few moments in silence, and then exclaimed, [...] "Why, mother! what a handsome man my grandfather is!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{crown of}} the Malagasy {{sovereign}} {{was made in}} France for Ranavalona I. It is a large crown made from locally mined gold in c. 1890 and is very heavy. In its essential form it followed the pattern of crown associated with a sovereign in European heraldry and had four arches which intersected {{at the top of}} the crown, while the circlet was made of openwork and <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> and from the circlet between the arches were triangular leaf-like ornaments which also were <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> (pearls?). One of the two most distinctive features of the crown was a large fan-like ornament generally described as a representation of seven spearheads of the traditional Malagasy warrior's spear joined together at the base, but in photographs and paintings it looks more like seven large feathers. The second distinctive feature is the representation of a falcon at the very top of the crown in the position a cross would occupy on the top of an orb in the traditional crown of a Christian sovereign. The falcon is a traditional symbol of the Malagasy sovereign. The inside of the crown was filled with a large red velvet cap — red being the color traditionally associated with royalty in Malagasy tradition. This crown (termed [...] "the massive gold state crown") and many other royal artifacts were saved when the Rova of Antananarivo (the royal palace and royal tomb complex) burned on November 6, 1995 and are now kept in the Andafiavaratra Palace museum nearby. Many of the rescued items have only recently been put on display. There is a painting of Radama II standing next to the state crown, and another of Queen Ranavalona III — the last monarch — wearing it. A recent picture of the massive gold state crown as it is today in the museum can be seen here: The smaller queen's crown last worn by Ranavalona III was taken with her into exile, first to Réunion and then later to Algiers, where she eventually died in 1917. The queen's crown can now be seen in the Musée de l'Armée in Paris.|$|R
5000|$|Quite densely {{inhabited}} from prehistoric times (as many {{archaeological sites}} attest), though its present population is of modest size, the glen has {{been home to}} many families, including MacGregors, Lyons, Menzies, Stewarts, Macnaughtans, MacGibbons and the Campbells of Glen Lyon. At {{the end of the}} eleventh century the de Leons (later shortened to [...] "Lyon") had come north with Edgar, son of Malcolm III of Scotland to fight against his uncle, Donald Bane. Edgar was victorious and the de Leons received lands that were later called Glen Lyon in Perthshire. Glen Lyon is a corruption from the Gaelic [...] "lithe" [...] meaning [...] "flood", a frequent state of the River Lyon. Robert Campbell of Glenlyon (1630-1696), led the detachment of government troops responsible for the infamous Glencoe Massacre, of the MacDonalds of Glencoe in 1691. A magnificent silver-gilt brooch <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> belonging to the Campbells of Glen Lyon (that has been dated to the early 16th century) is currently {{in the collection of the}} British Museum.|$|R
60|$|The second brigade {{passed the}} night in Magdala, and still remain there; the first brigade {{returned}} to camp, which they did not reach until a very late hour. The aspect of the hill of Salamgi, and of the plains below it, was very striking, as I rode through it at night. The great emigrant population had encamped there, and their innumerable fires had a very pretty effect. During the night a very scandalous act of theft and sacrilege took place. The coffin of the late Abuna, a high priest, was broken open; his body was torn almost to pieces, and a cross, <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> {{of the value of}} some thousands of pounds, was stolen. It is quite certain that this act was not perpetrated by our soldiers, as they of course knew nothing either of the Abuna or his cross. Suspicion generally points to some of the late prisoners, who knew, what was, it appears, a matter of notoriety, that the Abuna had purchased this extremely valuable ornament to be buried with it.|$|R
60|$|When he {{was quite}} ready--and I {{can assure you that}} he looked very {{different}} from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the rain, and pulled the deer's foot--the hands led him to a splendid room, upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots {{and a number of other}} famous cats. The table was laid for supper with two golden plates, and golden spoons and forks, and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones.</b> The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for, when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music, who took their places at one end of the room, and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key, and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars, making the strangest kind of music that could be heard. The Prince hastily stopped up his ears, but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him into fits of laughter.|$|R
60|$|The {{chief of}} the State {{annually}} paid a number of festive visits, which were made the occasion of as many holidays. To the convent of San Zaccaria he went in commemoration of the visit paid to that retreat by Pope Benedict III., in 855, when the pontiff was so charmed by the piety and goodness of the fair nuns, that, after his return to Rome, he sent them great store of relics and indulgences. It thus {{became one of the}} most popular of the holidays, and the people repaired in great multitude with their Doge to the convent, on each recurrence of the day, that they might see the relics and buy the indulgences. The nuns were of the richest and noblest families of the city, and on the Doge's first visit, they presented him with that bonnet which became the symbol of his sovereignty. It was wrought of pure gold, and <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> of marvelous great beauty and value; and in order that the State might never seem forgetful of the munificence which bestowed the gift, the bonnet was annually taken from the treasury and shown by the Doge himself to the Sisters of San Zaccaria. The Doge Pietro Tradonico, to whom the bonnet was given, was killed in a popular tumult on this holiday, while going to the convent.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{interpreted}} the words, [...] "A light ( [...] , tzohar) shall you {{make to the}} Ark," [...] in [...] to teach that God instructed Noah to <b>set</b> therein luminous <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> and jewels, {{so that they might}} give light as bright as noon ( [...] , tzaharayim). Similarly, Rav Achava bar Zeira taught that when Noah entered the Ark, he brought <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> and jewels with him to keep track of day and night. When the jewels shone dimly, he knew that it was daytime, and when they shone brightly, he knew that it was night. The Gemara noted that it was important for Noah {{to be able to tell}} day from night, for some animals eat only during the day, and others east only during the night, and thus Noah could determine the proper feeding times for the animals under his care. The Gemara noted that if in [...] God told Noah, [...] "A window shall you make to the ark," [...] then Noah should have been able to tell day from night. The Gemara explained that Noah needed the jewels because the account of Noah bringing jewels into the Ark followed the view that the celestial bodies — including the sun — did not serve during the year of the Flood. (Thus, no sunlight entered the Ark, and [...] must refer to jewels rather than a window.). Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2011[...]|$|R
60|$|He was a gay man, {{who could}} dance and jest, and sing and drink; {{and those were}} the roads to so much, or rather so little, of a heart as King Henry had. He was wonderfully fond of pomp and glitter, {{and so was the}} King. He knew {{a good deal of the}} Church {{learning}} of that time; much of which consisted in finding artful excuses and pretences for almost any wrong thing, and in arguing that black was white, or any other colour. This kind of learning pleased the King too. For many such reasons, the Cardinal was high in estimation with the King; and, being a man of far greater ability, knew as well how to manage him, as a clever keeper may know how to manage a wolf or a tiger, or any other cruel and uncertain beast, that may turn upon him and tear him any day. Never had there been seen in England such state as my Lord Cardinal kept. His wealth was enormous; equal, it was reckoned, to the riches of the Crown. His palaces were as splendid as the King's, and his retinue was eight hundred strong. He held his Court, dressed out from top to toe in flaming scarlet; and his very shoes were golden, <b>set</b> with <b>precious</b> <b>stones.</b> His followers rode on blood horses; while he, with a wonderful affectation of humility in the midst of his great splendour, ambled on a mule with a red velvet saddle and bridle and golden stirrups.|$|R
