40|$|It is {{widespread}} practice during citrate anticoagulated renal replacement therapy to monitor circuit ionised calcium (iCa 2 +) {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of anticoagulation. Whether the optimal site to sample the blood path is before or after the haemofilter is a common question. Using a prospectively collected observational dataset from intensive care patients receiving pre-dilution continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration (CVVHD-F) with integrated citrate anticoagulation we compared paired samples of pre and post filter iCa 2 + where the target range was 0. 3 - 0. 5 mmol. L- 1 as well as concurrently collected arterial iCa 2 +. Two nested mixed methods linear models were fitted to the data describing post vs pre filter iCa 2 +, and the relationship of pre, post and arterial samples. An 11 bed general intensive care unit. 450 grouped samples from 152 time periods in seven patients on CRRT with citrate anticoagulation. The relationship of post to pre-filter iCa 2 + was not 1 : 1 with post = 0. 082 + 0. 751 x pre-filter iCa 2 + (95 % CI intercept: 0. 015 - 0. 152, slope 0. 558 - 0. 942). Variation was greatest between patients rather than between circuits within the same patient or citrate dose. Compared to arterial iCa 2 + there was no significant difference between pre and post-filter sampling sites (F-value 0. 047, p = 0. 827). These results demonstrate that there is minimal difference between pre and post filter samples for iCa 2 + monitoring of circuit anticoagulation in citrate patients relative to the arterial iCa 2 + in CVVHD-F however compared to pre-filter <b>sampling,</b> <b>post</b> filter sampling has a flatter response and greater variation...|$|E
40|$|Swath {{bathymetry}} and seismic reflection profiles {{collected by}} the Italian Antarctic Program (PNRA WEGA and MOGAM projects), combined with Australian (CSIRO) oceanographic measures (Williams et al., 2010) and benthic fauna <b>sampling</b> (<b>Post</b> et al., 2010), in the offshore of the George Vth Land, document evidence of bottom water cascading currents and turbidity currents inside continental slope canyons. The continental slope is incised by canyons heading to shelf edge sills and bounding sedimentary ridges of Miocene age. Dense shelf water forms in coastal polynya and is exported off the shelf break to form the Adélie Land branch of the Antarctic Bottom Water (ALBW, Rintoul et al., 2008). This bottom water is detected by CTD and mooring measurements up to about 3200 m of depth, in the Jussieu canyon and further to the west. The speed of the ALBW is enough to transport fine sand and silt from shallow to deep water as documented by sea bed sediments. Similar bottom currents activity is recorded also during Quaternary glacial and interglacials (Caburlotto et al., 2009, Macrì et al., 2005) with source in the George V Land rocks and in the continental shelf (Damiani et al., 2006). The meandering charater of the Jussieu canyon and the sediment wave field on its eastern ridge, would suggest that they likely formed under the action of downslope, continous, bottom current, since the early Pliocene (Escutia et al., 2010).

40|$|Emerging {{infectious}} diseases (EIDs) affecting biodiversity (hereafter 'biodiversity diseases') have tremendous and increasing social, environmental, {{economic and political}} impacts worldwide. The devastating amphibian skin disease, chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (hereafter Bd), {{is an example of}} such a disease, and has been an important driver of species declines and extinctions since its recent emergence. Bd is now considered endemic throughout most of its climatically suitable range. However this does not imply that the disease is now benign. The aims of my research were to 1) investigate and characterize population- and individual-level impacts of endemic chytridiomycosis, 2) investigate the amphibian host immune response to Bd infection to determine the practical utility of immunization, and investigate the potential for evolution of resistance, and 3) evaluate strategies to mitigate endemic chytridiomycosis and minimize the impact of future emerging biodiversity diseases. I performed Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Pradel analysis of an intensive two-year mark-recapture data set from two populations of the common mistfrog (Litoria rheocola) in the lowland wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. I found that endemic chytridiomycosis continues to have substantial seasonally fluctuating population-level effects on amphibian survival which necessitates increased recruitment for population persistence. Populations at both sites exhibited very low annual survival probabilities but high recruitment. My results suggest that similarly endemically infected amphibian populations may thus be under continued threat from chytridiomycosis, which may render them vulnerable to other threatening processes, particularly those affecting recruitment success. Multistate Mark Recapture analysis of L. rheocola from the Tully population, and examination of abundance, distribution and transmission of Bd between hosts, allowed me to identify and characterize pathogen aggregation as a key feature of endemic chytridiomycosis, and evaluate its implications for study, modeling and management of the disease. Examination of transition probabilities revealed that more infections occurred in cooler months, that recoveries were frequent throughout the year, and that survival probabilities were dependent on infection intensity. In order to account for the effects of over-dispersed pathogen distributions in future studies, I recommend the quantification of individual infection burdens as well as prevalence where possible. I performed a controlled exposure experiment of individually-housed captive-bred Bd-naïve Booroolong's frogs (Litoria booroolongensis) involving prior exposure and treatment with the antifungal itraconazole as a form of immunization. I compared survival and infection intensities between immunized and infection-naïve frogs, and was unable to demonstrate differences indicative of clinically protective host adaptive immunity. My results are consistent with other studies suggesting Bd-induced suppression of the host adaptive immune system, and indicate that immunization for reintroduced frogs is unlikely to be an effective management strategy in the near future. I performed a second controlled exposure experiment instead with alpine tree frogs (Litoria verreauxii alpina) from multiple populations with differing long-term Bd-exposure histories. I demonstrated population, clutch and individual-level differences in susceptibility to chytridiomycosis (measured as survival and infection intensities). I found that frogs from one long-exposed population survived significantly longer when compared with frogs from two other long-exposed populations and the naïve population. My results demonstrate differences in survival and infection dynamics between populations and clutches associated with infection exposure history that are consistent with selection for disease resistance. Features of the natural history of this species, such as lack of Bd-exposure and high survival until after breeding at two years of age, may limit opportunities for natural selection of disease resistance. My finding of a more resistant population, however, holds promise for the future management of species threatened by chytridiomycosis. I analysed skin, liver and spleen tissue samples from a subset of the frogs from this latter experiment using a systems biology approach in order to examine underlying mechanisms contributing to observed differences in population susceptibility to chytridiomycosis. Via total RNA extraction, next-generation sequencing, de novo transcriptome assembly, functional annotation and differential gene expression analysis, I found marked evidence for activation of gene pathways associated with immune responses in Bd-infected frogs, that differed among populations and times of <b>sampling</b> <b>post</b> exposure. I demonstrated a link between a chytridiomycosis-resistant phenotype from a long-exposed population, and evidence for a more robust early immune response at the level of gene expression compared with other populations. These differences in gene expression may putatively explain a large component of population-level differences observed in survival in the larger experiment. In addition to gene expression analysis, via metabolite extraction, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and both univariate and multivariate analyses, I identified a number of key metabolites in the skin and liver tissues that predominantly differentiate moribund frogs with chytridiomycosis from both unexposed control and subclinical frogs. I also identified metabolites related to differences in population of origin, which may be associated with variation in phenotypic resistance between populations. These findings help build our understanding of the key mechanisms and pathways involved in pathogenesis. In a review of current and upcoming techniques, I contributed substantially to developing a conceptual framework for management of endemic chytridiomycosis. This framework consisted of interventions to guide experimental management and applied research, and involved two main approaches, 1) reducing Bd in the environment or on amphibians, and 2) increasing the capacity of populations to persist despite increased mortality from disease. In this review I recommended trialling several promising management actions including habitat manipulation, antifungal treatments, animal translocation, bioaugmentation, head starting and selection for resistance. Finally, to help improve timely mitigation of future emerging biodiversity diseases, I reviewed and evaluated the efficacy of current surveillance approaches for these diseases. Barriers to effective surveillance include a relative lack of social and political will, and the inherent complexity and cost of implementing surveillance for multiple and diverse free-ranging populations. I synthesized recommendations to address these challenges by 1) extending global animal disease surveillance systems to emphasize diseases that could predominantly affect biodiversity, and 2) utilizing a systematic, population-based and self-evaluative approach to improve timely disease recognition and management, with the aim of reducing species loss. In summary, I found that endemic chytridiomycosis impacts amphibian population dynamics in Australia and is characterized by high mortality rate and turnover. I found that immunization is currently an ineffective strategy. However, from clinical and systems biology data, the evolution of innate immunity is possible and hence assisted selection may be a viable management strategy among other approaches...|$|E

30|$|To {{characterize}} the emotion {{content of a}} document we use the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) lexicon, which consists of 1034 words that were assigned numerical scores with respect to three emotional “axes” – happiness, arousal, and dominance – by human subjects [45]. Previous work had identified this set of words to bear meaningful emotional content [45]. Positive or negative sentiment is quantified by employing the “IBM lexicon”, a collection of 2968 words that were assigned {positive, negative} sentiment labels by human subjects [46].

The two starting materials were sintered under vacuum (approximately 10 - 5 mbar) at 1000 ⁰C (6 hrs), 1100 ⁰C (2, 4, 6 hrs), 1200 ⁰C (1, 2, 4 hrs) and 1300 ⁰C (1, 2 hrs). Relative density, microstructure analysis and mechanical property measurements characterized on the as-sintered material before specimens were hot deformed at 800 ⁰C to 0. 69 strain and subsequently annealed at 870 ⁰C for 1 hr. Similar measurements and analyses were conducted on the <b>samples</b> <b>post</b> deformation and annealing...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{tribological}} properties of plasma nitrided tool steels which are also post-oxidised to form an oxide layer {{on top of the}} nitrided layer. The experimental work has been carried out by using pin on disc machine at room temperature and at 400 ºC. The experimental materials were tool steels of three compositions. All tool steel samples were plasma nitrided and post oxidised at 500 ºC. One of the tool steels was also post oxidised at 480 ºC and 520 ºC. The mating disc specimen was made from hardened high strength boron steel. The specimens have been analysed by using SEM/EDS, XRD and 3 D optical surface profiler. The results have shown that both friction and wear of tool steel and high strength boron steel pairs are temperature dependent. Increase in temperature results in increasing of friction and wear. The tool steel wear is higher at elevated temperature when compared to wear at room temperature. The tool steel <b>samples</b> <b>post</b> oxidised at 500 ºC has better friction and wear performance not only at room temperature but also at higher temperature. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The {{currently}} accepted {{gold standard}} tuberculosis (TB) detection method for veterinary applications {{is that of}} culturing from a tissue <b>sample</b> <b>post</b> mortem. The test is accurate, but growing Mycobacterium bovis is difficult and the process {{can take up to}} 12 weeks to return a diagnosis. In this paper we evaluate a much faster screening approach based on serum headspace analysis using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). SIFT-MS is a rapid, quantitative gas analysis technique, with sample analysis times of as little as a few seconds. Headspace from above serum samples from wild badgers, captured as part of a randomised trial, was analysed. Multivariate classification algorithms were then employed to extract a simple TB diagnosis from the complex multivariate response provided by the SIFT-MS instrument. This {{is the first time that}} such multivariate analysis has been applied to SIFT-MS data. An accuracy of TB discrimination of approximately 88 % true positive was achieved which shows promise, but the corresponding false positive rate of 38 % indicates that there is more work to do before this approach could replace the culture test. Recommendations for future work that could increase the performance are therefore proposed...|$|R
