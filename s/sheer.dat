5|$|The North Koreans {{eventually}} {{were able}} to overwhelm the US forces with <b>sheer</b> numbers, capturing Hwanggan and pushing the American units further south.

5|$|The <b>sheer</b> {{number of}} guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective {{range of the}} guns was {{as little as a}} few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E

5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its <b>sheer</b> length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's <b>sheer</b> bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E

From the third album, <b>Sheer</b> Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which became hits. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar and keyboards on Queen's studio work, but was the only member never to sing on their records.|$|E
5|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} {{that there is}} serious competition for food between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the <b>sheer</b> amount of biomass carp now take up, and {{the large numbers of}} larvae carp produce, causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite (Lernaea cyprincea) and serious vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi).|$|E

5|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937) and The Enchanted Wood (1939), Blyton {{went on to}} build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year {{in addition to her}} prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. The <b>sheer</b> volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt found <b>sheer</b> {{delight in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found everywhere in Shakespeare. As elsewhere, he crosses the boundaries of plays and enumerates subtle differences between even the fairy characters, in this case in an extensive comparison of Puck in this play and Ariel in The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{there were}} nearly 25,000 filling {{stations}} in the UK, of which 10,000 were independents (typically, privately owned and supplied by a major or jobber while using a brand under license).
