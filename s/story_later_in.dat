5|$|Smith invented Sartorias-deles as {{a fantasy}} world that {{gradually}} became populated by humans {{over a number}} of centuries; these new arrivals were influenced by the world's indigenous beings enough to better themselves, largely eradicating societal problems like disease and overpopulation. She originally wrote Crown Duel as a twenty-year-old, and when she returned to rewrite the <b>story</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> life, she sought to maintain the story from Mel's young perspective. As a result, the novel's intended audience are young adults. As Smith's most popular YA novel, both parts of Crown Duel received generally positive reviews. Reviews of the 1997 publication of Crown Duel highlight the character of Mel and Smith's worldbuilding as positive elements. Critics assessed Court Duel as generally the lesser of the two.|$|E

60|$|One night a young American got {{access to}} Stoddard at the Concert Rooms {{and told him}} a moving tale. He said he was living on the Surrey side, and for some strange reason his {{remittances}} had failed to arrive from home; he had no money, {{he was out of}} employment, and friendless; his girl-wife and his new baby were actually suffering for food; for the love of heaven could he lend him a sovereign until his remittances should resume? Stoddard was deeply touched, and gave him a sovereign on my account. Dolby scoffed, but Stoddard stood his ground. Each told me his <b>story</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> the evening, and I backed Stoddard's judgment. Dolby said we were women in disguise, and not a sane kind of women, either.|$|E

50|$|According to King, {{the idea}} for the novel first came to him in 1971, before the release of his first novel, Carrie (1974). He was going to title it Split Track. However, he felt a {{historical}} novel required more research than he was willing to do at the time and greater literary talent than he possessed. Like his novel Under the Dome (2009), he abandoned the project, returning to the <b>story</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> life.|$|E

50|$|The first {{publication}} of the angel tale was apparently in the late 18th century by Thomas Hutchinson in his History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in which he describes the tale as having originated with John Leverett's family. Subsequent historians picked up and elaborated on the <b>story.</b> <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> the 19th-century historians began to examine the story more critically, with George Sheldon specifically debunking it in 1874. Because of the inconsistencies raised by Sheldon, many 20th-century historians have accepted that the tale does not describe an event that actually happened, {{and it has been}} widely propagated as not having occurred. Douglas Wilson carefully reassessed the available evidence, concluding in his 1987 paper on the matter that it might have taken place, and that the event, and Goffe's involvement in it, were covered up by Goffe's protectors.|$|E

There are also many similar versions told in China (where it is known as [...] ), Japan, Korea and Vietnam, including the Chinese story of the Princess and the Cowherd. In these stories, seven women who can fly descended to earth to take a bath, the youngest and prettiest of whom was captured by a human, and subsequently became a wife of a male human (either her captor or the prince-hero of the <b>story).</b> <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> the stories, the heroine put on some magical thing that enabled her to fly or transform into a bird, and flew away; prompting the quest by the hero in pursuit of his flying wife.|$|E
