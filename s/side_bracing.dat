2500|$|The sports-oriented model, {{known as}} the [...] "SE" [...] in North America and [...] "Sportivo" [...] in Australasia, was {{developed}} by Toyota Australia. It features a black [...] "honeycomb" [...] grille, black-tinted head and fog lamps, rear lip spoiler, body kit appendages, and a lower ride height coupled with wider and larger 17-inch diameter wheels. To increase rear-end downforce, the SE/Sportivo includes additional rear floor and fuel tank undercovers.

5000|$|As {{part of the}} USRA, {{two common}} boxcar designs were developed: a single {{sheathed}} car and a double sheathed car. When the USRA boxcars were being designed there wasn't an industry consensus on which was better, so both were built. Freight car design was still in flux {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. As John White points out in The American Freight Car, most cars were really composites, not completely wood or steel, and even after steel cars had become the norm, wood had its uses and advantages. Still, steel underframes had come to replace wood underframes, but as metallurgy improved, there were new designs developed that took advantage of the improved technology. USRA double sheathed boxcars had a fishbelly underframe while the USRA single sheathed cars did not. In general, double sheathed boxcars are like girder bridges, so all the support needs to come from the frame. Those cars need a stronger frame, hence the fishbelly underframe. Single sheathed cars are like truss bridges, with the metal <b>side</b> <b>bracing</b> acting as the main structural support for the “bridge.” While some engineers did not trust the steel bracing to support a single sheathed car and ordered fishbelly frames for strength, others valued the savings in weight and ordered cars with simpler frames like the USRA SS design.|$|E

At the rear, fixed and almost square horizontal tailplanes stretched between the upper and the lower pairs of booms.

5000|$|The B-117 was {{powered by}} a pair of [...] {{water-cooled}} Lorraine-Dietrich 12D V12 engines cooled with Vincent André radiators mounted on the undercarriage legs. Its engine mountings and square-sided nacelles were constructed from spruce and plywood. Under the wings, a pair of near-parallel struts on each <b>side</b> <b>braced</b> the bottom corner of the nacelle to the lower fuselage. The nacelles extended rearwards just beyond the wing trailing edge, where each housed a gunner with a flexibly-mounted machine gun. A corridor within the wing allowed access from the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The flat sided pod {{fuselage}} {{is attached}} to the underside of the boom, with a glazed, single seat cabin forming the blunt nose. An inset rudder at the rear provides roll control. A single lift strut on each <b>side</b> <b>braces</b> the wing to the mid-lower fuselage. The underside of the pod is formed into a single step hull, equipped with a water rudder. The Laté 225 has an unusual tricycle undercarriage; the nosewheel retracts conventionally but the mainwheels, housed in fairings and fuselage mounted on cantilever legs, hinge upwards for landings on water, when they act as lateral stabilisers.|$|R

50|$|The Moazagottl {{was a high}} {{gull wing}} glider. The inner third of the span carried a {{dihedral}} of about 8° and was rectangular in plan. Single, broad-chord faired lift struts on each <b>side</b> <b>braced</b> these sections from about 20% of the span to the lower fuselage. Outboard the wing had no dihedral and was strongly swept on the leading edge, resulting in marked taper. Long ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge of each outer panels; these were slightly tapered and projected behind {{the trailing edge of}} the inner sections. The wing was built around a single, swept main spar which was straight in plan, simplifying its change in direction between the inner and outer panels. Diagonal sub-spars ran inwards and rearwards from it between the lift strut attachment points and the fuselage. Plywood skinning forward of these spars around the leading edge formed a D-box; aft, the wing, including the aileron, was fabric covered.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: It {{has been}} shown that muscle fatigue has a {{negative}} influence on proprioception. Several studies already have demonstrated improvement of proprioception by using knee sleeves. Hypothesis: Neoprene knee sleeves have different effects on the joint position sense in locally fatigued subjects with good or poor proprioceptive acuity. Design: A true experimental design with random assignment to intervention and control limbs. Setting: Military hospital, department of physical medicine and rehabilitation. Participants: Sixty-four healthy subjects. Interventions: All subjects underwent four consecutive assessments of the same active joint-repositioning test under different conditions (braced, nonbraced, fatigued, and nonfatigued). Main Outcome Measurements: A three-way analysis of variance with repeated-measures design was conducted to investigate the effects of <b>side</b> (<b>braced</b> versus control <b>side),</b> assessment sequence (one to four), and proprioceptive acuity ("good" versus "poor"), and their interactive effect on the joint position sense. Results: Post hoe analysis revealed that only subjects with "poor" proprioceptive acuity benefit from the braced condition before the isokinetic fatigue protocol (P < 0. 001). In contrast, all subjects benefit from the braced condition after the fatigue test. Conclusions: Bracing is helpful in individuals with a poor baseline proprioceptive acuity in both fatigued and nonfatigued states. Subjects with a good joint position sense benefit from bracing only when in a fatigued state. The present findings suggest a rationale for using neoprene knee sleeves as a preventative measure or treatment in subjects and patients to enhance proprioceptive acuity in a fatigued state. Classification into "poor" and "good" proprioceptive acuity is only relevant in the nonfatigued condition...|$|R
