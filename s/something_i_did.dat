500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important to me that this world feel real, and anytime I could build <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> So I hired guys that I went to architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully people who watch the film feel like there’s a certain physicality to this world that hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects actually put this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy. Post-production wrapped on November 25, 2010.|$|E

60|$|I {{looked at}} the other {{portrait}} critically. It {{was that of a}} young man of about twenty-five; he was undeniably handsome, but there was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not like in his face and I said so.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{a glimmer}} of malice in Damer's face. [...] "Well," [...] he said, and the {{strained}} voice grew clearer, [...] "it was Hallam of the Tyee. There was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that gave him a pull on me, and that man has no mercy for anybody." ...|$|E

60|$|Once more I {{interpreted}} for {{the benefit}} of Anscombe, for Heda understood Zulu well enough, although she had pretended not to do so, after which the two shook hands, to Anscombe's amusement and my wonder. For I felt this scene to be strained and one that hid, or presaged, <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not comprehend.|$|E
60|$|I {{dare not}} say that the Professor is right, but to my eyes it seemed he spoke sooth. As the {{knowledge}} {{of good and evil}} sets its mark upon the face of a grown man of Our people, so <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand had marked the faces of the Chinamen. They had no kinship with the crowd beyond that which a man has to children.|$|E
60|$|But {{the coachman}} was startled, {{when he saw}} me again. He said <b>something,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know what it was; and he {{produced}} a pocket-flask, containing some spirits, I suppose. Perhaps he thought I was going to faint. He little knew me. I told him to drive back to the place at which I had hired the cab, and earn his money. He earned it.|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{is with me}} always," [...] I answered, [...] "in my thoughts." [...] She {{looked at}} me with her clear grey eyes. I found myself blinking. Something seemed to be {{slipping}} from me, <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want to lose. I remember a similar sensation once at the moment of waking from a strange, delicious dream to find the sunlight pouring in upon me through an open window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Horrified by this conviction, {{my first}} {{impulse was to}} save the man; and, without knowing what I was going to do, I stepped quickly toward him, but {{stumbling}} over <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see I fell sprawling. Before I could regain my feet I saw Kaldhein fall backward to the ground, where a scene took place, so terrible that I shall not attempt to describe it. When, with trembling steps, I approached, the man was dead. The invisible dog had almost torn him to pieces.|$|E
60|$|At {{an abrupt}} {{angle of the}} slopes that lead down from what is called (with no little humour) Salisbury Plain, I saw suddenly, as by accident, {{something}} I was looking for--that is, <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not expect to see. We are all supposed {{to be trying to}} walk into heaven; but we should be uncommonly astonished if we suddenly walked into it. As I was leaving Salisbury Plain (to put it roughly) I lifted up my eyes and saw the White Horse of Britain.|$|E

[...] "There must be <b>something</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do.</b> If {{it will help you}} there is my arm--its blood is yours." [...] He stammered a little. [...] "It isn't right that one so young and beautiful should die. We won't let you die. There must be <b>something</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do.</b> This wind and sun--and the good water will work with us to do you good." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{man made}} a painful effort, but Ormsgill had now some little {{difficulty}} in hearing him. [...] "None," [...] he said. [...] "They have forgotten me yonder, and, perhaps, it's just as well. Our folks--my mother was Cape Dutch, you know--believe in everything {{as it used}} to be, but I'm like my father; there was always a kick in me. One of your Colonial vacillations cost him his farm, for, though he said he was ashamed of his country, he wouldn't recognize the Boers as his rulers. I, however, got on with them until I vexed the authorities by <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in resentment of the--arrogance of certain mine-grabbing Englishmen. I believe I might have made terms if I'd truckled to them a little, but that was a thing I wouldn't do, and so I came out here. There are probably more of us with the same nonsensical notions." ...|$|E
60|$|After we {{had seen}} the king, who did not stay long in the gardens, we walked up the broad terrace, and {{crossing}} the hall towards the great staircase, I had a sight which confounded me at once, as I doubt not it would have done to any woman in the world. The horse guards, or what they call there the gens d'armes, had, upon some occasion, been either upon duty or been reviewed, or <b>something</b> (<b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand that part) was the matter that occasioned their being there, I know not what; but, walking in the guard-chamber, and with his jack-boots on, and the whole habit of the troop, as it is worn when our horse guards are upon duty, as they call it, at St. James's Park; I say, there, to my inexpressible confusion, I saw Mr. ----, my first husband, the brewer.|$|E
60|$|The head of {{the island}} swept by, and we shot into {{smoother}} water with a spit of shingle ahead, on which I ran the craft ashore, and it was with sincere relief I felt the shock of her keel upon the bottom. Lucille Haldane said <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hear while she lay limp and wet and silent in my arms, as, floundering nearly waist-deep, I carried her ashore and then towards a path {{which led to the}} house. The night was black, the way uneven, but perhaps because I was partly dazed I did not set down my burden. She had helped me bravely, and it was only now, when the peril had passed, I knew how very fearful I had been for her safety. Indeed, it was hard to realize she was yet free from danger, and in obedience to some unreasoning instinct I still held her fast, until she slipped from my grasp. A few minutes later a light twinkled among the trees, voices reached us, and Haldane, followed by several others, came up with a lantern.|$|E
