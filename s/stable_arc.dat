40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of electrical power in today's automobile {{has led to}} the research and development of a new 42 V standard. One danger at this new voltage is stable electrical arcing. At the higher voltage, <b>stable</b> electric <b>arcs</b> do not self extinguish and can cause damage to the arcing conductors and cause a fire. This work evaluates possible methods to use to detect and stop electrical arcing before any major damage can occur to the vehicle and more importantly to the passengers. Electronic detection is proposed as the best approach. Arcing current of <b>stable</b> and unstable <b>arcs</b> at- 42 V and- 14 V are produced by the rebuilt apparatus of a previous MIT experiment that used a motor controlled mechanical switch to periodically energize a conductor to produce <b>stable</b> and unstable <b>arcs.</b> Fourier analysis is performed on the measured current waveforms to look for arc signatures in the frequency domain.

5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a <b>stable</b> <b>arc</b> and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} and melt sources for crustal growth at active continental margins are analyzed {{by using a}} 2 D coupled petrological–thermomechanical numerical model of an oceanic-continental subduction zone. This model includes spontaneous slab retreat and bending, dehydration of subducted crust, aqueous fluid transport, partial melting, melt extraction and melt emplacement in form of extrusive volcanics and intrusive plutons. We could identify the following three geodynamic regimes of crustal growth: (i) <b>stable</b> <b>arcs,</b> (ii) compressional arcs with plume development, and (iii) extensional arcs. Crustal growth in a stable subduction setting results in the emplacement of flattened intrusions in the lower crust. At first dacitic melts, extracted from partially molten rocks located atop the slab (gabbros and basalts), intrude into the lower crust followed by mantle-derived (wet peridotite) basaltic melts from the mantle wedge. Thus extending plutons form in the lower crust, characterized by a successively increasing mantle component and low magmatic addition rates (10 km 3 /km/Myrs). Compressional arcs are accomplished by the formation and emplacement of hybrid plumes. In the course of subduction localization and partial melting of basalts and sediments along the slab induces Rayleigh Taylor instabilities. Hence, buoyant plumes are formed, composed of partially molten sediments and basalts of the oceanic crust. Subsequently, these plumes ascend, crosscutting the lithosphere before they finally crystallize within the upper crust in form of silicic intrusions. Additionally, intrusions are formed in the lower crust derived by partial melting of rocks located atop the slab (basalts, gabbros, wet peridotite) and inside the plume (basalts, sediments). Magmatic addition rates are somewhat higher compared to <b>stable</b> <b>arcs</b> (40 – 70 km 3 /km/Myrs). Subduction in an extensional arc setting results in decompression melting of dry peridotite. The backward motion of the subduction zone relative to {{the motion of the}} plate leads to thinning of the overriding plate. Thus, hot and dry asthenosphere rises into the neck as the slab retreats, triggering decompression melting of dry peridotite. Consequently large volumes of mafic (oceanic) crust are formed in the backarc region with total magmatic addition rates being as high as 90 – 170 km 3 /km/Myrs...|$|R

We obtain the statistical distribution of Ei as a function of altitude, magnetic local time (MLT), Kp index and the footpoint solar illumination condition. Surprisingly, we find two classes of electric field structures. The first class consists of the low-altitude potential structures that are presumably associated with inverted-V regions and discrete auroral arcs and their set of associated phenomena. We show that the first class exists only below ~ 3 RE radial distance, and it occurs in all nightside MLT sectors (RE=Earth radius). The second class exists only above radial distance R= 4 RE and almost only in the midnight MLT sector, with a preference for high Kp values. Interestingly, in the middle altitudes (R= 3 – 4 RE) the number of potential minima is small, suggesting that the low and high altitude classes are not simple field-aligned extensions of each other.
