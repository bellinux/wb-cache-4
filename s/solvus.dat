50|$|Paragonite, {{also known}} as Natron-Glimmer, is a mineral, related to muscovite. Its {{empirical}} formula is NaAl2(OH)2|AlSi3O10. A wide <b>solvus</b> separates muscovite from paragonite, such {{that there is little}} solid solution along the vector Na+K+ and apparent micas of intermediate composition is most commonly a microscopic (or even sub-microscopic) intergrowth of two distinct micas, one rich in K, and the other in Na. Paragonite is a common mineral in rocks metamorphosed under blueschist facies conditions along with other sodic minerals such as albite, jadeite and glaucophane. During the transition from blueschist to greenschist facies, paragonite and glaucophane are transformed into chlorite and albite.|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{data for}} 139 natural paragonite-muscovite (Pg-Ms) pairs {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} ferromagnesian components on the P-T-X topology of the Pg-Ms <b>solvus.</b> The pairs were {{selected on the basis}} of: reasonably accurate knowledge of the P-T conditions of formation; evidence for close approach to equilibrium at peak metamorphic conditions; exclusion of pairs in which paragonite contains more than 5 mol% margarite; and exclusion of pairs from polymetamorphic rocks that contain more than one set of cogenetic Pg-Ms pairs. Graphical analysis reveals considerable scatter in the data; nevertheless, it is evident that the muscovite limb of the <b>solvus</b> shifts markedly toward end-member muscovite with increasing pressure from approximately 7 kbar to 21 kbar. This shift is attributed to a pressure-induced increase of the ferromagnesian content of muscovite, which increases the size of the XII alkali site - to the effect that K is more readily accommodated than Na. The data also suggest that the paragonite limb of the <b>solvus</b> migrates slightly toward end-member paragonite with increasing pressure. Broadening of the Pg-Ms <b>solvus</b> with increasing pressure reflects increasingly nonideal Na-K mixing as the phengite content of muscovite increases.

The {{compositions}} of feldspar pairs crystallized from stoichiometric alkali feldspar gels {{with water}} at Pg~o ~ I kbar in runs {{of up to}} 3 ooo hours ' duration vary with Na: K in the starting material. This is because, for most bulk compositions, rapid nucleation i the gel leads to growth of one feldspar phase outside the <b>solvus.</b> The composition of this initial feldspar phase {{can be thought of}} as reflecting the configuration of the liquidus-solidus curves in the system Ab-Or. In general, the attainment of the stable quilibrium <b>solvus</b> (binodal) requires that one phase approach the binodal from outside; for compositions with 30 mole % Or, more sodic. Homogeneous gels of bulk composition AbToOr 30 initially crystal-lize feldspar pairs inside the binodal, which rapidly (< I 7 hours) unmix to define a solvus-like curve (probably the spinodal, with an apparent critical point at 6 o 2 ~ and 3 t mole % Or) and then unmix slowly, giving a <b>solvus</b> after 3 ooo hours with a critical point at 657 ~ and 36 mole % Or.

40|$|An {{asymmetric}} binary Margules formulation for excess Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy {{is adequate}} {{to describe the}} 1 bar halite-sylvite <b>solvus</b> in NaCl-KCl (Thompson and Waldbaum 1969). However, a binary Margules formulation is not adequate to describe excess volumes of single-phase chlorides in P-V-T-X from ambient P-T to ∼ 20 kbar and 700 °C. Excess volumes across NaCl-KCl increase with temperature, decrease with pressure, and show systematic deficits in the consolute region. These patterns {{can be explained by}} the importance of a third component - vacancy defects that relieve the lattice stresses of K-Na size mismatch. New, two-phase observations in P-V-T-X allow delineation of the excess Gibbs energies to high pressures where the excess enthalpies and entropies do not depend on T at each P, but show significant variation between 1 bar and ∼ 20 kbar. The volume, entropy, and enthalpy of K-Na mixing become more ideal at high pressure.

Magnesium contents of eight and ten weight percent and the alloying effects of copper and manganese were studied. Microstructures and mechanical properties at six warm rolling temperatures located above and below the <b>solvus</b> line of these alloys were examined. Ultimate tensile strengths in excess of 680 MPa (99 KSI) were obtained. Microstructural evidence indicated that the precipitation of the "beta" intermetallic phase {{was one of the most}} important mechanisms in controlling the strength of the alloy. Furthermore, precipitation is so rapid at higher temperatures that it becomes the strongest force within the microstructure and its presence prevents any possible recrystallization of the alloy. However, when the temperature exceeds the <b>solvus</b> temperature for the alloy, recrystallization does occur with large losses in both yield and ultimate tensile strength.
