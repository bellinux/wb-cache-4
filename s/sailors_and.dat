5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at {{a fairly}} low level after about 300 BC, {{but it was}} massively upgraded about forty years later, during the First Punic War.

Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 <b>sailors</b> <b>and</b> embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{artillery}} officer Anders Gyllenspak, only 40 men, including himself, survived the sinking: Major Johan Klerk, 2 trumpeters, 14 <b>sailors</b> <b>and</b> 22 soldiers, {{which means that}} more than 800 had perished. Among them were half a dozen navy and army officers {{as well as the}} chief physician of the Admiralty and the fleet apothecary. Altogether around 1,400 men died when Kronan and Svärdet were lost, and in the days following the battle, hundreds of corpses were washed up on the east coast of Öland. According to the vicar of Långlöt parish, 183 men were taken from the beaches and buried at Hulterstad and Stenåsa graveyards. Lorentz Creutz's body was identified and shipped to his estate in Savolaks, Finland, where it was buried. The losses were even worse since Kronan was the flagship and was manned with the best <b>sailors</b> <b>and</b> gunners in the fleet. When Kronan and Svärdet went down, they took with them the navy's entire stock of 30- and 36-pounder guns. Altogether over 300tonnes of bronze guns worth nearly 250,000 silver dalers went down with the ships, a sum that was slightly higher than the value of the ships themselves.|$|E
5|$|Adams joined Franklin and Arthur Lee in 1778 as a {{commissioner}} to France, replacing Silas Deane. He sailed for France {{with his}} 10-year-old son John Quincy aboard the frigate Boston early that year.

Near {{the coast of}} Spain, Adams himself took up arms to help capture a heavily armed British merchantman ship, the Martha. Later, a cannon malfunction killed one and injured five more of the crew before the ship arrived in France.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Charles I, the gentry took an {{increased}} interest as patrons and occasionally as players. A big attraction for them was the opportunity that the game offered for gambling and this escalated {{in the years following}} the Restoration when cricket in London and the south-eastern counties of England evolved into a popular social activity. Its patrons staged lucrative eleven-a-side matches featuring the earliest professional players. Meanwhile, English colonists had introduced cricket to North America and the West Indies, and the <b>sailors</b> <b>and</b> traders of the East India Company had taken it to the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
