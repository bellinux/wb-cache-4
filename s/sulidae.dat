5000|$|Sulids {{are related}} {{to a number of}} other aquatic birds which all lack {{external}} nostrils and a brood patch, but have all four toes webbed and a gular sac. The closest living relatives of the <b>Sulidae</b> are the Phalacrocoracidae (cormorants and shags) and the Anhingidae (darters). The latter are somewhat intermediate between sulids and cormorants, but (like many cormorants) they are freshwater birds in a clade containing otherwise seabirds, and also symplesiomorphic with sulids but synapomorphic with cormorants in some other respects. Thus, the <b>Sulidae</b> seem to be the oldest and most distinct lineage of those three, which are united in a suborder Sulae. Therein, the <b>Sulidae</b> are typically placed simply as a family; sometimes a superfamily Suloidea is recognized, wherein some of the primitive prehistoric forms (e.g. Empheresula, Eostega and Masillastega) are placed as basal lineages distinct from the living <b>Sulidae.</b> However, the proposed family Pseudosulidae (or Enkurosulidae) is almost certainly invalid.|$|E

50|$|The red-footed booby (Sula sula) {{is a large}} seabird of the booby family, <b>Sulidae.</b> As {{suggested}} by the name, adults always have red feet, but the colour of the plumage varies. They are powerful and agile fliers, but they are clumsy in takeoffs and landings. They are found widely in the tropics, and breed colonially in coastal regions, especially islands.|$|E
50|$|The {{masked booby}} (Sula dactylatra) {{is a large}} seabird of the booby family, <b>Sulidae.</b> This species breeds on islands in {{tropical}} oceans, except in the eastern Atlantic; in the eastern Pacific it is replaced by the Nazca booby, Sula granti, which was formerly regarded as a subspecies of masked booby. It is also called the masked gannet or the blue-faced booby.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, the {{behavioral}} traits of gannets and boobies differ considerably, but the <b>Sulidae</b> {{as a whole}} are characterized by several behavioral synapomorphies: Before taking off, they will point the bill upwards (gannets) or forward (boobies).

50|$|The bird family <b>Sulidae</b> {{comprises}} the gannets and boobies. Collectively called sulids, they are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish and similar prey. The ten species {{in this family}} are often considered congeneric in older sources, placing all in the genus Sula. However, Sula (true boobies) and Morus (gannets) can be readily distinguished by morphological and behavioral and DNA sequence characters. Abbott's booby (Papasula) is given its own genus as it stands apart from both in these respects. It {{appears to be a}} distinct and ancient lineage, maybe closer to the gannets than to the true boobies.|$|E
50|$|This {{family is}} very {{closely related to}} the other {{families}} in the suborder Sulae, i.e. the Phalacrocoracidae (cormorants and shags) and the <b>Sulidae</b> (gannets and boobies). Cormorants and anhingas are extremely similar as regards their body and leg skeletons and may be sister taxa. In fact, several anhinga fossils were initially believed to be cormorants or shags (see below). Some earlier authors included the darters in the Phalacrocoracidae as subfamily Anhinginae, but this is nowadays generally considered overlumping. However, as this agrees quite well with the fossil evidence some unite the Anhingidae and Phalacrocoracidae in a superfamily Phalacrocoracoidea.|$|E

50|$|Protopelicanus cuvierii is a {{putative}} fossil waterbird of uncertain affinities. It {{was briefly}} described and figured by Georges Cuvier in 1822 from Late Eocene material from Montmartre, France, though not formally described and named until 1852 by German botanist and ornithologist Ludwig Reichenbach {{as an early}} pelecanid. The original material comprised the cranial part of a left scapula and a nearly complete left femur. The lectotype femur was thought by Michel Brunet in 1970 to be typical of a pelican. However, Colin Harrison in 1979 considered that it belonged to the <b>Sulidae,</b> and Storrs Olson in 1995 {{thought it might be}} a pelagornithid. The femur is held by the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris (No.7978); the location of the scapular fragment is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|One {{species of}} Odontopteryx has been {{formally}} described, but several other named taxa of pseudotooth birds might belong here too. The type species Odontopteryx toliapica is {{known from the}} Ypresian (Early Eocene) London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey (England) and slightly older rocks of the Ouled Abdoun Basin (Morocco). Its tarsometatarsus (e.g. specimen BMNH A4962) was for {{some time in the}} late 20th century believed to be from a giant procellariiform and called Neptuniavis minor, but specimen BMNH A44096 [...] - [...] the holotype skull described by Richard Owen in 1873 [...] - [...] was the first pelagornithid recognized as such, and not assigned to some other seabird lineage.

5000|$|Bimbisula ("dawn booby") is an extinct genus of sulid bird {{known from}} fossils {{discovered}} in Pliocene rocks of South Carolina, United States. The type and only named species is B. melanodactylus. The genus {{name is a}} combination of the Gullah name [...] "Bimbi", meaning dawn, with [...] "sula", an Icelandic word for [...] "fool" [...] that has been used to describe boobies (<b>Sulidae,</b> Sula) in general. The species name is Greek for [...] "black-fingered", referring to the iron staining that darkened the bones of the type specimen. Bimbisula melanodactylus is based on Charleston Museum PV2818, a partial skeleton including fragments of the skull, shoulder girdle, left upper arm, right hand, and fused hip vertebrae, and much of the right leg. It was collected in 1980 by James Malcolm from a locality along the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in Charleston County {{in the vicinity of the}} Dorchester Road overpass. A second specimen assigned to the species, Science Museum of Minnesota P90.38.8, consists of a cranium discovered in October 1990 by Bruce Erickson near the Wando Terminal. Both specimens were found in the Goose Creek Limestone, of middle Pliocene age. The type specimen comes from the upper part of the formation, which is approximately 3.6 to 3.5 million years old. The exact stratigraphy of the second specimen is uncertain, and it may be anywhere from 3.9 to 3.5 million years old. Bimbisula was a large sulid, comparable in size to smaller species of gannets, and its skeleton shows a combination of booby-like and gannet-like characteristics.|$|E
40|$|The melanocortin- 1 {{receptor}} (MC 1 R) {{has been}} linked to intraspecific variation of melanin-based plumage color in several unrelated bird species. However, its involvement in interspecific variation has far less evidence. The <b>Sulidae</b> is a family in the Suliformes composed of 10 species of pelagic seabirds, distributed in 3 genera. There is significant variation in the amount and distribution of melanin pigments among species in the family <b>Sulidae,</b> and 2 species, the brown booby (Sula leucogaster) and the red-footed booby (S. sula), present plumage polymorphisms, with the latter being {{considered one of the most}} plumage polymorphic birds. We performed a survey of the MC 1 R evolution in 68 individuals representing all 9 species in the <b>Sulidae,</b> except the Abbott’s booby, to determine the role played by this locus in explaining the melanic variation observed in the <b>Sulidae.</b> We found the amino acid substitution R 112 H to be in full concordance with the plumage color observed in the brown booby, which shows a unique phaeomelanin-dominant coloration. Furthermore, all amino acid residues known to be important for function at the MC 1 R were completely conserved in the <b>Sulidae,</b> except for the previously described V 85 M and H 207 R substitutions among the 2 red-footed booby’s color morphs. A total of 14 substitutions were inferred from estimated ancestral nodes throughout the <b>Sulidae</b> phylogeny. Finally, we found evidence that the MC 1 R is under strong purifying selection in all Sulid species. This study provides additional evidence of th...|$|E
40|$|A {{skull of}} a new pelecaniform bird is {{described}} from the Middle Eocene of Messel (Germany). Masillastega rectirostris gen. et sp. nov. is tentatively referred to the <b>Sulidae</b> (boobies and gannets). If this assignment is correct, the new taxon would represent the earliest fossil record of the family, preceding Sula ronzoni Milne−Edwards, 1867 from the lowermost Oligocene of France by about 15 million years. Masillastega rectirostris most distinctly differs from extant <b>Sulidae</b> in the proportionally longer beak which indicates that the Eocene taxon was not adapted to plunge−diving.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the morphology {{of the skull}} of the Peruvian booby Sula variegata (Tschudi, 1845), considering its ontogeny, and compared with other species of the family <b>Sulidae</b> and, similarly, with other families of the traditional order Pelecaniformes: Phalacrocoracidae, Anhingidae, Fregatidae, Phaetonthidae and Pelecanidae. In the comparisons could be found characteristics which the Peruvian booby shares {{with other members of}} <b>Sulidae,</b> and others that, taken together, distinguish it from other species of the genus Sula. Among the former are: (1) during ontogenetic development, they change the proportions between the rostrum and thebraincase, stretching the first and reducing the height of the second. (2) The skulls have a nasal opening in their early stages of development, which is completely closed with the growth of the bird. The respiratory function moves to a space that is below the pre-orbital fenestra and the jugal, which is protected by ranfoteca. (3) Adult individuals present a trabecular space in the inner part of the upper jaw and frontals that confers resistance to the skull. All these features allow the <b>Sulidae</b> to prevent the rupture or buckling of the skull under the force {{of the impact of the}} plunge. In the second case there are: (1) cranial roof slightly vaulted over the orbits; (2) Sagittal crest generally narrow, although wide in some individuals; (3) Short temporal region; (4) Straight proximal rostrum in front of the naso-frontal suture...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} well-preserved {{remains of}} the Pelagornithidae (bony-toothed birds) from the middle Eocene of Belgium, including a sternum, pectoral girdle bones and humeri of a single individual. The specimens are tentatively assigned to Macrodontopteryx oweni Harrison and Walker, 1976, which has so far only been known from the holotype skull and a referred proximal ulna. Another species, about two times larger, is represented by an incomplete humerus and tentatively identified as Dasornis emuinus (Bowerbank, 1854). The fossils provide critical new data on the osteology of the pectoral girdle of bony-toothed birds. For the first time, the sternum {{of one of the}} smaller species is preserved, and this bone exhibits a more plesiomorphic morphology than the recently described sternum of the giant Miocene taxon Pelagornis. The coracoid resembles that of the Diomedeidae (albatrosses) in overall morphology, but because bony-toothed birds lack apomorphies of the Procellariiformes, the similarities are almost certainly owing to convergence. Bony-toothed birds were often compared with the ‘Pelecaniformes’ by previous authors, who especially made comparisons with the <b>Sulidae</b> (gannets and boobies). However, the coracoid distinctly differs from that of extant ‘pelecaniform’ birds, and the plesiomorphic presence of a foramen nervi supracoracoidei as well as the absence of a well-delimited articulation facet for the furcula supports a position outside the Suloidea, the clade to which the <b>Sulidae</b> belong...|$|E
40|$|Boobies and gannets (family <b>Sulidae)</b> are {{the most}} {{specialized}} plunge divers among seabirds. Their fossil record along the Pacific coast of South America extends to the early Middle Miocene. Here we describe three new species of sulids: Sula brandi sp. nov., Sula figueroae sp. nov., and Ramphastosula aguirrei sp. nov., from the early Late Miocene of the Pisco Formation (Peru). Two of them are relatives of the living genus Sula, which represents medium and large-sized boobies. A new species of the extinct genus Ramphastosula is also described, adding to the discussion of possible alternative feeding strategies among sulids. The fossil record suggests that sympatric sulids exhibit different body sizes {{at least since the}} Oligocene epoch, a strategy related with resource partitioning. Furthermore, we find current analysis and knowledge of the fossil record unsuitable to evaluate properly seabird diversity changes through time...|$|E
