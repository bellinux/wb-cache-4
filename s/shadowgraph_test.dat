40|$|A {{total of}} 142 {{shadowgraph}} photographs were taken on 43 different plumes that were distributed over the six nozzle configurations using the 9. 5 inch diameter collimated light beam of the shadowgraph setup. Aerodynamic flow {{conditions of the}} <b>shadowgraph</b> <b>test</b> points, the location and identification {{of each of the}} photographs, and copies of the pictures are presented...|$|E
40|$|A large {{field of}} view {{shadowgraph}} flow visualization system for the Langley 16 ft. Transonic Tunnel (16 ft. TT) has been developed to provide fast, low cost, aerodynamic design concept evaluation capability to support {{the development of the}} next generation of commercial and military aircraft and space launch vehicles. Key features of the 16 ft. TT shadowgraph system are: (1) high resolution (1280 X 1024) digital snap shots and sequences; (2) video recording of shadowgraph at 30 frames per second; (3) pan, tilt, & zoom to find and observe flow features; (4) one microsecond flash for freeze frame images; (5) large {{field of view}} approximately 12 X 6 ft; and (6) a low maintenance, high signal/noise ratio, retro-reflective screen to allow <b>shadowgraph</b> imaging while <b>test</b> section lights are on...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{techniques and}} results from NASA Ames {{research into the}} aerodynamics of blunt shapes are described. Two facilities are used: the Hypersonic Free Flight Aerodynamic Facility (HFFAF) and the Pressurized Ballistic Range (PBR). The HFFAF features a 23 m test section through which projectiles can be fired by light-gas guns to achieve velocities up to 9 km/sec in pressures from 1 atm down to 20 microns Mg. Aerodynamic flight data are recorded with shadowgraphs. The 62 m long PBR, with 24 orthogonal spark <b>shadowgraph</b> stations, allows <b>testing</b> in up to 6 atm pressures but with only half the velocity of the HFFAF. Tests have been performed on the Galileo probe to be dropped into the Jovian atmosphere. The Galileo data for a 45 deg cone probe have been similar to Pioneer Venus probe data. Ballistic data are presently being obtained for the probe at Re below 1000, when the drag coefficients are expected to increase dramatically as the probe enters the Jovian atmosphere and begins braking from 4700 m/s speed. Sample test data from an OTV which can change orbits through aerodynamic maneuvers and for several asymmetric configurations ae also provided...|$|R
