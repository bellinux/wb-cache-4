40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{algorithms}} for modelling dynamic reconfiguration of ad-hoc wireless networks with movable base stations in presence of obstacles are proposed. This problem is considerably {{harder than the}} one treated in [1] where base stations were organized in a <b>starred</b> <b>network</b> and no obstacles were present. In these models nodes communicate through a clusterehead gateway switching routing protocol. In [1] both host clustering and base stations repositioning computations were performed by {{the center of the}} star. Here movable base stations are organized in an Ad-Hoc Network. Clustering, center computation and repositioning are performed in a distributed fashion among the base stations. The amount of transmitted information is proportional to the number of base stations. Obstacles which may interfere with hosts clustering and base stations motion are present. Repositioning is performed by a fast motion planning algorithm based on an extension of the bottleneck matching computational geometry technique to visibility graphs. I...|$|E

40|$|<b>Star</b> <b>networks</b> were {{proposed}} {{recently as}} an attractive {{alternative to the}} well-known hypercube models for interconnection networks. Extensive research has been performed that shows that <b>star</b> <b>networks</b> are as versatile as hypercubes. This paper is an effort in the same direction. Based on the well-known paradigms, we study the one-to-many parallel routing problem on <b>star</b> <b>networks</b> and develop an improved routing algorithm that finds n, 1 node-disjoint paths between one node {{and a set of}} other n, 1 nodes in the n-star network. These parallel paths are proven of minimum length within a small additive constant, and our algorithm has an optimal time complexity. This result significantly improves the previous known algorithms for the problem. Moreover, the algorithm well illustrates an application of the orthogonal partition of <b>star</b> <b>networks,</b> which was observed by the original inventors of the <b>star</b> <b>networks</b> but seems generally overlooked in the subsequent study. We should also point out that similar problems are already studied for hypercubes and have proven useful in designing efficient and fault tolerant routing algorithms on hypercube networks. 1...|$|R

In this paper, adopting the conditional fault model in which each node is assumed to be incident with two or more fault-free links, we show that an n-dimensional <b>star</b> <b>network</b> can tolerate up to 2 n− 7 link faults, and be strongly (fault-free) Hamiltonian laceable, where n≥ 4. In other words, we can embed a fault-free linear array of length n!− 1 (n!− 2) in an n-dimensional <b>star</b> <b>network</b> with up to 2 n− 7 link faults, if the two end nodes belong to different partite sets (the same partite set). The result is optimal with respect to the number of link faults tolerated.

We evaluate mean aggregate throughput, relative packet loss, and mean delay by means of simulation for Bernoulli and self-similar traffic models for unicast traffic with uniform and hot-spot traffic matrices, as well as for multicast traffic.
