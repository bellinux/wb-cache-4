5|$|In September 1944, {{the brigade}} formed {{part of the}} second day's {{parachute}} landings at the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden. Problems reaching the bridges in Arnhem forced the divisional commander, Major-General Roy Urquhart, to divert one of the brigade's battalions to assist the 1st Parachute Brigade. After a <b>short</b> <b>delay</b> the brigade headed out for its objective. When only halfway there, however, the remaining two battalions were confronted by prepared German defences. The brigade, having suffered heavy losses, was eventually forced to withdraw. The next day, weakened by fighting at close quarters and now numbering around 150 men, the brigade eventually reached the divisional position at Oosterbeek.|$|E

40|$|The {{blocking}} problem naturally {{arises in}} transportation systems as multiple vehicles with different itineraries share available resources. In this paper, we investigate {{the impact of}} the blocking problem to the waiting time at the intersections of transportation systems. We assume that different vehicles, depending on their Internet connection capabilities, may communicate their intentions (e. g., whether they will turn left or right or continue straight) to intersections (specifically to devices attached to traffic lights). We consider that information collected by these devices are transmitted to and processed in a cloud-based traffic control system. Thus, a cloud-based system, based on the intention information, can calculate average waiting times at intersections. We consider this problem as a queuing model, and we characterize average waiting times by taking into account (i) blocking probability, and (ii) vehicles' ability to communicate their intentions. Then, by using average waiting times at intersection, we develop a <b>shortest</b> <b>delay</b> algorithm that calculates the routes with <b>shortest</b> <b>delays</b> between two points in a transportation network. Our simulation results confirm our analysis, and demonstrate that our <b>shortest</b> <b>delay</b> algorithm significantly improves over baselines that are unaware of the blocking problem...|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} techniques, most notably narrow {{correlator}} spacing, {{have been developed}} to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address shorter delay multipath from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a choke ring antenna) may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. <b>Short</b> <b>delay</b> reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the GL/EL display, the Mk. II used {{a single}} {{receiver}} for {{each pair of}} antennas. The switch rapidly alternated {{one or the other}} signal into the receiver. It also sent one of the signals through a <b>short</b> <b>delay</b> line. It did not, however, move the Y-axis baseline. The result was a single trace along the center of the display, with two slightly separated blips, one from each antenna. By comparing the relative lengths of the two blips, the operator could determine which antenna was more closely aligned with the target, and continue to rotate it until the blips were equal length.|$|E
25|$|Together {{these studies}} suggest that infants are able to extract a {{substantial}} amount of syntactic knowledge even from limited exposure to a language. Children apparently detected grammatical anomalies whether the grammatical violation in the test sentences occurred at the end or {{in the middle of the}} sentence. Additionally, even when the individual words of the grammar were changed, infants were still able to discriminate between grammatical and ungrammatical strings during the test phase. This generalization indicates that infants were not learning vocabulary-specific grammatical structures, but abstracting the general rules of that grammar and applying those rules to novel vocabulary. Furthermore, in all four experiments, the test of grammatical structures occurred five minutes after the initial exposure to the artificial grammar had ended, suggesting that the infants were able to maintain the grammatical abstractions they had learned even after a <b>short</b> <b>delay.</b>|$|E

40|$|Preference for mixed versus {{constant}} delays {{of reinforcement}} was studied with a concurrent-chain procedure.

A constant delay of reinforcement (either 15 seconds or 30 seconds) composed one terminal link and mixed delays (. 2 second and twice {{the value of}} the constant delay) were arranged in the other terminal link. The proportion of. 2 -second delays in the mixed-delay terminal link took on values of 0,. 1,. 25,. 5,. 75,. 9, and 1. 0 over experimental conditions. Based on relative rates of responding in the initial links, preference for the mixed delays was a negatively accelerated function of the proportion of <b>short,</b> mixed <b>delays.</b> Three of five rats preferred the mixed delays to the constant delays when the proportion of <b>short,</b> mixed <b>delays</b> was. 1 or higher, and all five rats preferred the mixed delays when the proportion of <b>short,</b> mixed <b>delays</b> was. 25 or higher. Neither Squires and Fantino's (1971) delay-reduction model of choice nor a model based on the harmonic mean reinforcement delay provided a close estimate of choice proportions over the range of short-delay proportions studied.

25|$|Once {{the hijackers}} noticed the airstars moving towards them, they {{recognised}} the imminent assault. As the first airstair reached the front starboard (right) door, {{it became apparent}} that it was elevated too much higher than the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which the suspension system of the plane was not as compressed, leading to the an overestimation of the necessary height of the airstairs. After a <b>short</b> <b>delay</b> in re positioning the airstairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets. The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft. Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin. The GIGN's concussion grenades temporarily blinded and deafened occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers' homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage. The snipers on the tower could not get a clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their view. Through a window, Borderie jumped out of the cockpit and staggered away. With the view unobstructed, the snipers began firing into the cockpit, while the GIGN evacuated passengers {{in the rear of the}} aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Ulyett {{also played}} in the first-ever Test match, staged at the MCG, during that tour. His first real action in Test cricket came when he held onto a catch off the bowling of James Southerton to dismiss Billy Midwinter for five. With the bat, however, Ulyett failed in the first innings, lasting just {{a quarter of an}} hour before Nat Thomson had him trapped in front; in the second innings, however, with England in dire straits, he fought hard with John Selby for about 45 minutes—but then the rampant Tom Kendall got one through his defences and {{effectively}} brought an end to England's resistance, the match being lost by 45 runs. In bowling, Ulyett took three for 39 in the second innings, his first wicket being that of Charles Bannerman, who famously managed an incredible 165 out of Australia's first innings total of 245 (or 67.3 per cent of it, still a Test-Match record). This amazing effort finally came to an end when the toiling Ulyett let loose a sharp, rising bouncer that found its way through Bannerman's primitive gloving and struck him a blow on the index finger, splitting it open rather badly. A <b>short</b> <b>delay</b> revealed the fact that Bannerman could no longer grip his bat properly and that, therefore, he would have to retire. The Australian opener walked off, wincing from the pain in his bloodied right hand. George Ulyett, although never regarded as a truly-quick bowler, could nevertheless do real damage on occasion. Bannerman was unable to field, and, in the second innings, when Ulyett dismissed him again (this time in orthodox fashion—bowled), he faced just nine deliveries.|$|E

500|$|To {{test for}} this theory, {{they gave the}} same test while varying the time between the {{opportunities}} to choose a reward. They found that as the interval increased, {{the number of times}} that the monkeys chose the more risky reward decreased. While this occurred in macaque monkeys, the varying interval time did not affect pigeons' choices in another study. This suggests that research looking into varying risk sensitivity of different species is needed. [...] When provided a choice between a small, <b>short</b> <b>delay</b> reward, and a large, long delay reward, there is an impulsive preference for the former. Additionally, as the delay time for the small/short and large/long reward increases, there is a shift in preference toward the larger, delayed reward.
