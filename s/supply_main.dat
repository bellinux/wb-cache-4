25|$|Bailout supply {{pressure}} options: If the interstage pressure for the bailout regulator {{is lower than}} the <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> pressure, the <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> will override the bailout gas, and continue to flow. This can be a problem if the diver switches to bailout because <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> is contaminated. If on the other hand, bailout pressure is higher than <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> pressure, the bailout gas will override the <b>main</b> gas <b>supply</b> if the valve is opened. This will result in the bailout gas being used up if the valve leaks. The diver should periodically check that bailout pressure is still sufficient {{for the rest of the}} dive, and abort the dive if it is not. For this reason the bailout regulator must be fitted with a submersible pressure gauge to which the diver can refer to check the pressure. This is usually clipped off or tucked into the harness on the left side, where it can be easily reached to read, but is unlikely to snag on anything.|$|R

The first step is to determine the maximum pressure drop between the most remote cold water plumbing fixture and the main distribution supply. The developed length of pipe from the supply to the fixture is then determined from the plumbing drawings. The maximum pressure drop is then divided by the developed length which results in the friction loss per 100 feet of pipe. Equivalent fixture units are assigned from the UPC based on the actual fixture count which when totaled determines the water flow rate. The water flow rate and pressure drop are used to determine the pipe size based on a given velocity of flow...|$|E
