500|$|As each {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} new characters, the writers {{were able to}} attract actors {{who might have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. [...] "Nana's Party" [...] featured Claire Skinner as Angela, who is hosting a party. Pemberton and Shearsmith lived close to Skinner, but they had not properly met. She was one of several members of the cast of the film Life Is <b>Sweet</b> (others being <b>Alison</b> Steadman and Jane Horrocks) who have starred in Inside No. 9. Skinner enjoyed the [...] "funny" [...] script and her [...] "nice" [...] character. Eve Gordon (trained at the Nottingham Television Workshop) starred as Angela's daughter Katie, and Pemberton starred as Angela's husband Jim. Pemberton and Shearsmith suggested that Pemberton's costume made him look like Mr Chow Mein, a Benny Hill character.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{partnership}} between a primary health service and a university whose shared goal was to prepare students and graduates for interprofessional practice (IPP). This collaborative process {{led to the development of}} consensus on an interprofessional capability framework. An action research methodology was adopted to study the development and progress of the partnership between university and health service providers. The initial aim was to understand their perceptions of IPP. Following this, the findings and draft capabilities were presented back to the groups. Finalisation of the capabilities took place with shared discussion and debate on how to implement them in the primary care setting. Several ideas and strategies were generated as to how to prepare effective interprofessional learning experiences for students in both environments (university and primary health care setting). Extensive stakeholder consultation from healthcare providers and educators has produced a framework, which incorporates the shared views and understandings, and can therefore be widely used in both settings. Development of a framework of capabilities for IPP, through a collaborative process, is a useful strategy for achieving agreement. Such a framework can guide curriculum for use in university and health service settings to assist incorporation of interprofessional capabilities into studentsâ€™ learning and practice.
