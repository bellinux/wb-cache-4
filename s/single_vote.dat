5|$|Kansas {{began its}} 2007football season unregarded and without much {{consideration}} {{from the national}} media. In the opening Associated Press football poll of the 2007season, Kansas did not receive a <b>single</b> <b>vote.</b> From their opening game of the year, however, the Jayhawks began to impress voters with their offensive efficiency. Against Mid-American Conference Champion Central Michigan University, Kansas scored 52points while only allowing a single touchdown.|$|E
5|$|After being urged into {{politics}} by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927. As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a <b>single</b> <b>vote.</b> Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.|$|E
5|$|An electoral {{division}} {{which is a}} GRC returns the number of MPs designated for the constituency by the President to serve in Parliament. A group of individuals standing together in a GRC is voted for as a team, and not as individual candidates. In other words, a successful voter's <b>single</b> <b>vote</b> in an SMC sends to Parliament one MP, and a GRC sends a group of MPs depending on how many have been designated for that GRC. All elected MPs are selected on a simple plurality voting ("first past the post") basis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} Republic, {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} aristocracy to limit the increasing level of chaos associated with the obstructive tendencies and democratic impulses of some of the senators. Laws were enacted to prevent the inclusion of extraneous material in bills before the Senate. Other laws were enacted to outlaw the so-called omnibus bills, which are bills, usually enacted by a <b>single</b> <b>vote,</b> that contain a large volume of often unrelated material.|$|E
5|$|More broadly, Jefferson removed 146 of 316 (46%) incumbent, second-level, {{appointed}} federal officials, including 13 U.S. Attorneys and 18 U.S. Marshals. Jefferson also displaced two district judgesRay Greene and Jacob Readciting technical {{flaws in}} their appointments. Further, District Judge John Pickering was impeached and {{removed from office}} on a party-line vote. The following day, the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase, but six Democratic-Republicans crossed party lines in the Senate to prevent his conviction by a <b>single</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after their}} election, {{the divide between}} Chandler and Laffoon widened {{over the issue of}} {{implementing}} a state sales tax. Laffoon favored the tax; Chandler opposed it. As presiding officer of the state senate, Chandler worked with Speaker of the House John Y. Brown, Sr. to block passage of the tax. In retaliation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped Chandler of some of his statutory power as lieutenant governor, after which they were able to pass the tax by a <b>single</b> <b>vote</b> in each house of the legislature.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{results for}} the race showed MacDowall won big {{in most of the}} polls, winning four out of five. Porter's support was concentrated in The Ridge where he won his only poll. MacDowall swept {{the south end of the}} district winning a shut out in the Métis communities of Duck Lake and St. Laurent de Grandin. Along with the shut out he held strong support in the rest of the riding, with his biggest <b>single</b> <b>vote</b> tally of votes coming form within the town of Prince Albert.|$|E
5|$|A new Royal Commission {{into the}} defense of the Netherlands and NEI was held during 1920 and 1921. This Commission did not {{recommend}} that any battleships be constructed; instead it proposed that all ships under construction as at 31 December be completed along with a further two cruisers, 12 destroyers and 16 submarines. This plan was considered unaffordable, however, especially given the strength of the disarmament movement internationally. A Navy Bill to fund a reduced version of the Royal Commission's proposal was introduced to parliament in November 1921, but was eventually defeated by a <b>single</b> <b>vote</b> in October 1923. Renewed Dutch concerns over Japanese aggression in the late 1930s led to a proposal to build three Design 1047 battlecruisers for service in the NEI, but construction of these ships had not begun when the Netherlands was overrun by German forces in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a <b>single</b> <b>vote,</b> as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E

5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader by a <b>single</b> <b>vote,</b> {{was a strong}} supporter of President Roosevelt and the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{operate as}} a {{community}} benefit society. Membership is obtained by paying an annual fee of £12 to the club (£3 for children) but each member receives only one share in the club and is entitled to a <b>single</b> <b>vote</b> at meetings, regardless of the amount donated. The board consists of up to 11 members who are elected {{by the members of}} the club. Day-to-day operations of the club are overseen by a Chief Executive Officer; Andy Walsh, a founding member of F.C. United, was appointed to the position in 2005. He stepped down from the role at the end of June 2016. Damian Chadwick, another founding member of the club, took up the position in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's {{administration}} {{the apex}} of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. The most significant legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state antitrust law and a ban on railroads offering free passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade public service corporations from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first workman's compensation law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive measure that did not pass, a bill granting women's suffrage, failed in the House by a <b>single</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1914, {{the court}} {{moved into the}} new Oregon Supreme Court Building, and McNary filed to run for a full six-year term on the bench. At that time the office was partisan, and McNary lost the Republican primary, by a <b>single</b> <b>vote,</b> to Henry L. Benson, after several recounts and the {{discovery}} of uncounted ballots. After his defeat, he served {{the remainder of his}} partial term and left the court in 1915. On July 8, 1916, after a close, multiballot contest, with several contenders, the Republican State Committee elected McNary to be the chair. He was seen as someone who could unify the progressive and conservative wings of the party in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Reed's {{leadership}} in dealmaking with Senate Republicans kept the 1956 {{version of the}} flag off Perdue's statewide referendum on the flag in 2003. The referendum was originally a two-part referendum pitting the 2001 version of the flag against the proposed version and conditional on failed ratification of a new flag considering other flags including the 1956 version. Under this format if the legislators did not approve the newly designed flag over the existing one they could have pursued other designs including {{the one with the}} controversial 1956 version of the flag. Reed and a contingent of black legislators from Atlanta limited the referendum to a <b>single</b> <b>vote</b> of preference between the 2003 version and the 2001 version.|$|E
5|$|The {{dispute over}} who had {{actually}} discovered the object delayed {{the acceptance of}} any name, or of formal classification of the object as a dwarf planet. On 17 September 2008, the IAU announced that the two bodies in charge of naming dwarf planets, the Committee on Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN) and the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), had decided on the Caltech proposal of Haumea. At the CSBN, {{the outcome of the}} voting was very close, eventually being decided by a <b>single</b> <b>vote.</b> However, the date of the discovery was listed on the announcement as March 7, 2003, the location of discovery as the Sierra Nevada Observatory, {{and the name of the}} discoverer was left blank.|$|E

5|$|The {{impetus for}} {{federation}} {{did not extend}} to the administration of cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and {{at a meeting of}} the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from the ACC. Although the proposal was defeated by a <b>single</b> <b>vote,</b> Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation. Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the New South Wales Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a <b>single</b> <b>vote</b> in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state was}} allowed to cast a <b>single</b> <b>vote</b> either for or against a {{proposal}} during the debates {{in accordance with the}} majority opinion of the state's delegates. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly come and go, with only 30–40 being present on a typical day. Consequently, if a state's delegates were equally divided in their views on a given proposal, or if too few of the state's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal, that state's delegation had essentially no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal. Thus, for example, after two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates.|$|E
