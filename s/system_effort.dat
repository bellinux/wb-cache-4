50|$|Triple system {{enumeration}} {{has been}} proposed as an improvement as it would allow evaluation of the statistical dependence of pairs of sources.

The DSE approach has another weakness in that it assumes there is no person counted twice (over count).

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} essentially {{occurs in}} a broadcast medium with concurrent receptions. Recent works [34, 41] have shown clear evidence that wireless links are not independent and that trans-missions from a transmitter to multiple receivers are correlated, a phenomenon that has profound implications {{for the performance of}} network protocols such as broadcast, multi-cast, opportunistic forwarding and network coding. In this paper, we show how link correlation can significantly impact broadcast. We present the de-sign and implementation of CorLayer, a general supporting layer for energy efficient reliable broadcast that carefully blacklists cer-tain poorly correlated wireless links. This method uses only one-hop information, which makes it work in a fully distributed manner and introduces minimal communication overhead. The highlight of our work is CorLayer’s broad applicability and effectiveness. Our <b>system</b> <b>effort</b> is indeed significant.
