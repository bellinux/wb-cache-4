40|$|This study set out {{to compare}} plant {{function}} and performance of <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> to that of white clover. To test this, the two species were exposed to drought for 4 weeks under controlled environmental conditions. Water stress reduced the size and dry matter of white clover leaves by more than 50 %, whereas <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> leaves remained unaffected. White clover photosynthesis decreased by nearly 50 % under drought, accompanied by a reduction in leaf water status (water potential) {{by more than one}} third. In contrast, <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> maintained a higher water status, photosynthesis and transpiration rate under drought than white clover. In addition, we observed drought-induced reductions in white clover leaf quality, including lower nitrogen levels. We conclude that <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> displays drought resistance in a number of key leaf parameters.

40|$|Strawberry is a {{fruit crop}} grown worldwide. There {{are two main}} {{strawberry}} production systems: open fields and protected cultures (greenhouses or high tunnels). Growing strawberries under high tunnels has many advantages such as protection from different weather conditions, but also disadvantages such as lack of pollinators.

Field experiment was performed to collect and analyze bumble bee corbicular pollen from hives located under high tunnels and open fields. We found that bumble bees under high tunnels gathered more pollen from plant species (<b>strawberry</b> and white <b>clover)</b> present there. By bringing additional pollinators under high tunnels attention should be paid, what kind of other plant species and how abundantly they are flowering there besides strawberry.

40|$|A soil {{population}} of 16 Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii isolates {{was characterized by}} using three Sym (for symbiotic) plasmid-specific DNA hybridization probes: (i) an R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii-specific, repeated-sequence probe; (ii) a nifHDK gene probe, and (iii) a nod gene probe. A predominant Sym plasmid family was identified among the isolates. Three other unrelated Sym plasmid families were also identified. The isolates were also classified either by using a chromosomal DNA hybridization probe or by serological relatedness to 25 different R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii antisera. With either method, {{it was possible to}} group the 16 soil isolates into identical or related families. However, the correlation between the two techniques was not high. Irrespective of the means used to classify the bacterial host strain, it was possible to identify the same Sym plasmids in unrelated strains, as well as unrelated Sym plasmids in identical host strains. These data indicate that, within this soil population, there has been genetic exchange of Sym plasmids, and in one instance the hybridization pattern indicates that in vivo recombination of two different Sym plasmids may have occurred. Symbiotic effectiveness tests on red, <b>strawberry,</b> and subterranean <b>clovers</b> clearly differentiated the isolates. In general, the pattern of response was similar within groupings on the basis of Sym plasmid and chromosomal profiles but different between such groups...|$|R

40|$|Pasture {{production}} and composition and liveweight gain of sheep grazing tall fescue-clover and perennial ryegrass-clover dryland pastures at Lincoln, Canterbury was examined in four experiments from May 2008 to December 2010. Four objectives were identified to (i) quantify the pasture production, growth, persistence, composition, (ii) pasture nutritive value and liveweight gain of sheep grazed cultivars of tall fescue, white, strawberry and subterranean clover at {{high and low}} P and S fertility, to determine the (iii) effect of time of grazing in autumn on subterranean clover growth was determined, and (iv) effect of spring defoliation management on tall fescue cultivars and perennial ryegrass pastures grown with white and <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover.</b> Experiment 1 examined {{the interactive effects of}} tall fescue cultivar (Continental, cultivar Advance, versus Mediterranean, cultivar Flecha), sown clover species (subterranean clover versus a combination of white and <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover)</b> and soil fertility (high P and S fertilizer versus low fertilizer P and S) on annual and seasonal DM production, botanical composition, plant density and morphology. Annual DM production was greater in Advance (7790 kg DM/ha) than Flecha (6871 kg DM/ha) in year 1 and Flecha (8367 kg DM/ha) than CA (7547 kg DM/ha) in year 2. Annual DM production of the legume component was greater in subterranean clover pastures than perennial clover pastures in both year 1 (945 kg DM/ha v 539 kg DM/ha) and year 2 (1457 kg DM/ha v 1042 kg DM/ha). Survival of <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> in perennial clover pastures was poor with a low percentage (< 1 % DM) in pasture after 2 years. The percentage of clover in pastures was generally greater in Flecha than Advance. Annual DM production was greater at high than low fertility in both year 1 (8734 kg DM/ha v 7828 kg DM/ha) and year 2 (7134 kg DM/ha v 6834 kg DM/ha). This primarily reflected greater grass growth at high fertility as legume growth was unaffected by soil fertility. Experiment 2 examined the interactive effects of tall fescue cultivar (Advance versus Flecha) and soil fertility (high P and S fertilizer versus low fertilizer P and S) on pasture nutritive value and liveweight gain of ewes and lambs in spring and ewe hoggets in autumn. Liveweight gain per head of single lambs grazing with lactating ewes (22 ewes/ha) was 284 g/head/day over a 27 day period in spring of year 1. Liveweight gain per head of twin lambs grazing with lactating ewes (25 ewes/ha) was 258 g/head/day over a 60 day period in spring of year 2. Over the total spring period in each year, there was no effect of soil fertility or tall fescue cultivar on liveweight per head or ha of lambs. This occurred despite pasture growth and feed availability being on occasions greater in Flecha than Advance, and at high than low soil fertility. Liveweight gain per head of ewe hoggets (22 ewes/ha) was greater in Flecha (52 g/head/day) than Advance (14 g/head/day) over a 51 day period in autumn of year 1 but greater in Advance (282 g/head/day) than Flecha (197 g/head/day) over a period of 18 days in autumn of year 2. The different cultivar effects between years reflected the availability of feed in response to summer rainfall {{at the start of the}} grazing period as well as pasture growth during the grazing period. The clover percentage was average 20 % and 31. 2 % in spring 2008 and 2009, respectively. Experiment 3 examined the effects of grazing subterranean clover at the spade leaf, three trifoliate and six trifoliate leaf stages in autumn on seedling populations, seedling survival and DM production of subterranean clover when grown with Advance and Flecha tall fescue cultivars. Seedling death during grazing was greater at the spade leaf (43 %) than the three leaf or six leaf (14 %) stage. However, because seedling populations were initially high (1326 plants m 2), this high death with early grazing simply killed seedlings that would have died for other reasons; and seedling numbers at the start of winter were similar among treatments (619 plants m 2). Spring clover DM production was greater at the spade leaf (2834 kg DM/ha) than three leaf (2573 kg DM/ha) or six leaf stage (2648 kg DM/ha), reflecting greater plant size than any difference in plant population. Delaying grazing until after the three leaf stage will enhance seedling survival when seedling populations are low. Experiment 4 examined DM production, botanical composition, and plant morphology of perennial ryegrass, Advance and Flecha tall fescue pastures grown with <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> and white clover under continuous stocking and rotational grazing in spring. DM production in the establishment phase was greater in perennial ryegrass (1098 kg DM/ha) than Advance (563 kg DM/ha) or Flecha (503 kg DM/ha). In the first full year, DM production was greater in perennial ryegrass (9417 kg DM/ha) and Advance (9928 kg DM/ha) than Flecha (7559 kg DM/ha). Annual DM production of legume was greater in white clover (1638 kg DM/ha) than <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> (670 kg DM/ha). Persistence of <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> was poor with the plant population declining from 145 plants/mÂ² at start to 9 plants/mÂ² after 20 months. Although taproots were larger and lasted longer in <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> than white clover plants, <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> plants had fewer nodal roots, which appeared to limit persistence under grazing. There was no effect of continuous stocking versus rotational grazing on DM production or persistence of white and <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover.</b> The study showed that pastures based on either Continental or Mediterranean tall fescue cultivars are capable of high DM production in dryland pastures in Canterbury, particularly when grown with subterranean clover. These pastures gave high liveweight gain, which would enable lambs to be finished in spring before the onset of summer dry conditions. Under the conditions of this study, there was little detectable effect of tall fescue cultivar on livestock performance, indicating a role of both types of tall fescue for dryland pastures in Canterbury. <b>Strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> persisted poorly under all grazing management, and without breeding for improved nodal root development or revised grazing management guidelines, will not be a suitable legume for dryland pastures...|$|E

40|$|Grass and wildflower {{mixtures}} can be aesthetically appealing, water-conserving, low-maintenance {{alternatives to}} conventional turfgrass. One problem with these mixtures is {{loss of species}} diversity over time. We {{examined the effects of}} irrigation and mowing on the species diversity of 3 grass and wild-flower mixtures. The nonirrigated and non-mowed treatment combination maintained diversity most effectively whereas the irrigated and mowed treatment combination was least effective. Generally, when the irrigation treatment was significant (P 3 Ìc 0. 05), irrigated plots contained more wildflowers. When the mowing treatment was significant (P 3 Ìc 0. 05), mowed plots contained more common yarrow (Achillea millefolium L. [Asteraceae]) and <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium fragiferum L.

40|$|Several orchard floor {{management}} strategies were evaluated {{beginning in the}} fall of 1993 in experiments on the Yuma Mesa in a 'Limoneira 8 A Lisbon' lemon grove and in a 'Valencia' orange grove at the University of Arizona Citrus Agricultural Center (CAC) in Waddell, Arizona. On the Yuma Mesa, disking provided satisfactory weed control except underneath the tree canopies where bermudagrass, purple nutsedge, and other weed species survived. Mowing the orchard floor suppressed broadleaf weed species allowing the spread of grasses, primarily bermudagrass. Pre-emergence (Solicam and Surffan) and post-emergence (Roundup and Torpedo) herbicides were used to control weeds in the clean culture treatment in Yuma. After three harvest seasons (1994 - 95 through 1996 - 97), the clean culture treatment resulted in greater yield than the other treatments. At the CAC, clean culture (in this location no pre -emergence herbicides were used,) mowed resident weeds, and Salina <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> orchard {{floor management}} schemes were compared. Again the clean culture treatment yielded more than the mowed resident weeds. The yield of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> treatment was somewhat less than the clean culture yield but not significantly less. The presence of cover crops or weeds on the orchard floor were found to have beneficial effects on soil nitrogen and soil organic matter content, but no effect on citrus leaf nutrient content. The decrease in yield in the mowed resident weed treatments compared to the clean culture treatment in both locations was attributed to competition for water...|$|E
40|$|Two orchard floor {{management}} strategies were evaluated {{beginning in the}} fall of 1997 in a 'Valencia' orange (Citrus sinensis) grove at the University of Arizona Citrus Agricultural Center (CAC) in Waddell, Arizona. The clean culture or bare ground treatment produced more yield than the âSalinaâ <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> treatment when harvested on March 10, 1999 and the tree canopy volume of the clean culture treatment was also greater than that of the clover treatment. Yield efficiency (lbs of fruit per cubic meter of canopy) was similar in the two treatments. The clean culture treatment produced more large size fruit (size 88 and larger) and less small size fruit (size 113 and smaller) than the <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> treatment. Although the yield efficiency parameter suggests that {{it may be possible to}} produce as much fruit in the clover treatment as the clean culture treatment, the total yield and fruit size distribution of the clover treatment compared to the clean culture treatment were characteristic of the negative effects of competition from vegetation on the orchard floor found in other studies. Based on previous studies, competition for water was the most likely cause of the negative competitive effect. Installation of additional tensiometers to measure soil moisture at greater depths and leaf water potential measurements to assess the degree of water stress in both treatments prior to irrigation will hopefully allow further improvement in irrigation scheduling to eliminate the negative affect of having vegetation on the orchard floor in the clover plots...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ability of neonatal larvae of the root-feeding weevil, Sitona lepidus Gyllenhal, to locate white clover Trifolium repens L.

Choice experiments used a combination of invasive techniques and the novel technique of high resolution X-ray microtomography to non-invasively track larval movement in the soil towards plant roots. Burrowing distances towards roots of different plant species were also examined. Newly hatched S. lepidus recognized T. repens roots and moved preferentially towards them when given a choice of roots of subterranean clover, Trifolium subterraneum L.

40|$|In 1990 and 1991, {{populations of}} the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, were {{monitored}} on broccoli interplanted with three leguminous cover crops (the living mulches) and compared with broccoli without cover crop (clean cultivation). The cover crops used were white clover (Trifolium repens L.), <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium fragiferum L.) and a mixture of birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) and red clover (Trifolium praetense L.). Fertilizer was applied as compost or synthetic fertilizer crossed with cropping system regime. Brevicoryne brassicae can reach pest status in Brassica cropping systems, whereas M. persicae is generally innocuous. Both aphids are attacked by the parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae. Seasonal aphid abundance, parasitism and population growth rates were analyzed. No significant effect of fertilizer was found {{for any of the}} parameters analyzed. The living mulches had lower aphid populations overall, although differences with clean cultivation were greatest early in the season for M. persicae and diminished over time. No effect of cropping system on population growth rate was seen for Brevicoryne brassicae, but for M. persicae growth rates were higher in living mulches compared with clean cultivation. Parasitism was highest on clean cultivated broccoli for both aphid species in 1990 and for M. persicae in 1991, but no differences were found for Brevicoryne brassicae in 1991. This suggests that differential population growth rates and parasitism seen for M. persicae are a result of inhibition of D. rapae in the living mulches. Possible reasons for differences in parasitism between the two aphid species in living mulches and clean cultivation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study a pasture according to variations in the availability of dry matter and the nutritive value (macro mineral, nitrogen, NDF and ADF fractions) of the different species over the year. In vitro (RUSITEC) and in vivo studies with milk producing ewes were carried out to evaluate: 1) the main species of the pasture (Medicago sativa, Trifolium repens, Trifolium fragiferum; festuca arundinacea and Lolium multiflorum) in the vegetative stage and, early prebloom or early bloom or mild bloom for grass and legumes, respectively; 2) the fresh pasture and 3) the pasture hay. The greater availability of plant biomass was observed in June, December and in Spring; the greater contribution for that biomass was given by lucerne and fescue. The nutritive value of the pasture varied according to the botanical species {{and the time of}} year. The in vitro disappearances of DM, OM and N, were related to the cell wall constituents of the different species and within them, the effect of cellulose and hemicelluloses was greater than that of lignin. The variation of macro mineral solubilities was in agreement with what is normally presented (K>Mg>Na>Ca>P). The production of VFA was related to the organic matter disappearance and to the fermented organic matter of the different species. Grass produced less C_ 2 and more C_ 3, although C_ 2 increased as maturation proceeded which is also observed in lucerne and <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover.</b> The pasture was evaluated in vivo at an intake level below the ad libitum level which, in the case of fresh pasture, reduced the supply of nutrients to about 50 % of the nutrient requirements for lactating ewes.

40|$|Legumes are a {{valuable}} component of pastures since {{they tend to}} have higher feed quality than grasses and can also fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. The technology for oversowing legumes has had many improvements but the success rate is poor and the legume contribution to hill country pasture production remains low. It was concluded that unpredictable weather and plant factors were the major factors causing poor pasture legume establishment from oversowing. To determine the environmental and plant factors responsible for poor pasture legume establishment from oversowing, a series of seven trials were carried out at AgResearch, Poukawa near Hastings. The five annual and seven perennial legume species oversown in order of establishment success were; subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum), barrel medic (Medicago trunculata), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), white clover (T. repens), <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> (T. fragiferum), murex medic (M. murex), arrow leaf clover (T. vesiculosum), lucerne (M. sativa), alsike clover (T. hybridium), persian clover (T. resupinatum), Maku lotus (L. pedunculatus) and caucasian clover (T. ambiguum). Seeds of each species were oversown in autumn, winter and spring, following defoliation with glyphosate and trodden with sheep. The greatest loss of potential seedlings after oversowing was non-appearance of seedlings, which accounted for about 80 % of viable seed. Overall, the contribution of sown legume species to total herbage mass was less than 12 % and seedling establishment success was typically between 5 and 30 %. The relationships between eight environmental factors and seedling establishment were explored and the main influences on establishment were found to be gravimetric soil water content, soil temperature, minimum air temperature and daily wind run. A simple model based on these four factors was developed from the field trial data and extrapolated to 10 years of Lawn Road, Hastings and 5 years of Poukawa climate data and the best time, on average, for oversowing was predicted. To test the effect of high, medium and low soil surface moisture and also to find out the fate of oversown seed two experiments were carried out in a glasshouse using caucasian, strawberry and subterranean clovers. A simple and cheap technique based on CoCl 2 saturated paper strips was developed to measure the changes in soil surface moisture. The soil moisture at depth was a poor indicator of seed germination compared with the surface soil moisture. The low soil surface moisture gave lowest seedling survival. The main cause of low soil surface was wind run. The percentage of ungerminated seed was significantly higher for oversowning than to the standard seed germination test. Two trials were carried out at AgResearch, Ballantrae, to test the effect of seed rate and seed size. It was observed that sowing rates greater than those usually recommended would increase the seedling density and legume contribution to the total herbage mass and might produce more seed for re-establishment of annual legumes in the subsequent years. Seed size did not significantly affect establishment. The effect of seed coating and seed dressing was also monitored in a trial at Poukawa. The seed of subterranean and white clovers dressed with fungicide, insecticide and two commercial seed coatings were compared with bare seed. The commercial seed coating increased the early seed germination by 30 % but not the final seedling density compared with bare seed. Apron fungicide seed dressing had a deleterious effect on seed germination. The effect of glyphosate residue and litter phytotoxicity was tested in a glasshouse experiment with birdsfoot trefoil and subterranean and white clovers. The species were oversown onto sods sprayed with glyphosate 20 days earlier and onto ordinary sand. The glyphosate residue and dead material did not have any major effect on seed germination and seedling survival. Overall, environmental factors were found to be the key determinants of successful establishment for pasture legumes by oversowing. Both, the likely environmental conditions at the time of oversowing, and during {{the first few months of}} seedling growth need to be considered. The establishment of legume species suited to oversowing can be improved by using high sowing rates and seed coating but ultimately it is the moisture level and temperature at the soil surface that determines germination, and wind run and minimum air temperature that determines seedling survival in drought-prone hill swards...|$|E
40|$|The {{educational}} program of agricultural extension {{was conducted in}} Cherry County during 1940 by the Cherry County Extension Service. 329 families and business firms subscribed 1529. 15 for support of the work. The county commissioners provided office quarters {{at a cost of}} 258. 00 for the year. Other income provided 80. 00 additional funds making a total operating fund of 1867. 15. Expenditures for the year were 255. 00 for office quarters, heat and light, 89. 60 finance committee expense, and 1824. 14 for conducting the general program. The program of work directed special emphasis to F-F-L, Beef Cattle, 4 -H and Project club work. Test plats of sorghum varieties showed Leoti as superior to other varieties with a green weight yield of 9. 5 tons. This compares with 8 tons for black amber, 7. 2 tons for early sumac with other varieties scaling considerably lower. Grain sorghums were again unsuccessful because of early freezing weather. Results obtained by the Valentine Experiment station do not show enough superiority of hybrid corn over local varieties to justify the added expense. One good stand of Hardistan alfalfa has survived dry weather and is a profitable seed crop. Experimental seedings of <b>strawberry</b> <b>clover</b> in alkali spots; red top, timothy, red and alsike clovers, reed canary grass in wet meadows; and crested wheat grass for dry abandoned cropland areas are being conducted. Greater success with the vegetable garden has been reported by 150 farm and ranch homes due to this year 2 Ì 7 s Extension program. Timely help for all gardeners in the county has been given. Yard beautification improvements were made in not less than 400 yards at the homes of Cherry County ranchers, farmers, and townspeople, {{as a result of the}} attention given to this phase of the Extension program during 1940. Records were made of some of these improvements. 89 homes followed recommendations for planting shrubs and trees. 98 homes planted new lawns or improved existing lawns according to recommendations made. 69 homes corrected walks, drives, and fences to improve the appearance of their home yards. 80 new yard fences were constructed. 50 yard fences were changed. 88 unsightly views were screened with hedges or constructed screens. 286 homes reported a general clean-up on their yards. These records were obtained as a part of the yard beautification demonstration for project clubs. In addition it is known that many other improvements were made of which no records were taken. 52 cooperators planted 23, 700 Clarke-McNary seedlings to form windbreaks. 113 farmers planted trees as a part of their compliance with the Agricultural Conservation cropland program on 335 acres of windbreak. 81 homemakers reported planting trees for erosion control as a part of the home demonstration program for women 2 Ì 7 s project clubs. 75 homes in the town of Valentine cooperated with a plan developed by the Junior Chamber of Commerce to stimulate interest in tree planting. There is some duplication in these reports obtained through the above mentioned sources. It is conservatively estimated that 265 different plantings of trees were made during 1940. This number compares with 140 for 1939 when estimated on the same basis. 108 homes were repaired. Major repairs were made in 8 homes; 1 water system was installed; 2 light plants placed; 2 poultry houses constructed; 1 complete new barn constructed; built-in kitchen cabinets were installed in 2 homes; 1 house was remodeled; copies were made of a feature of 40 hay equipment machines; 21 chicken feeders and mail boxes were completed as 4 -H projects. 4 meadows were drained; 1 meadow and 5 garden irrigation systems were installed. These reports of accomplishments are listed as those definitely assisted by the Extension program during 1940. Help with poultry rations was extended to 68 turkey growers and a few chicken growers. Regular monthly turkey bulletins prepared at the state office in Lincoln were forwarded by this office to the turkey growers in the county. 38 farm security clients were given assistance to increase production and improve the quality of milk and cream. The county fair, a spring and fall show sponsored by the Northwest Hereford Breeders 2 Ì 7 Association, a district calf show at Mullen serving the south part of Cherry County, were exhibits for competitive quality improvement. These were the methods employed to bring to the attention of ranchers in the county the possibilities for beef cattle herd improvement. Nearly every rancher in the county was given information concerning control of Bang 2 Ì 7 s Disease, hemorrhagic, and such specific troubles as calf diptheria, foul foot, retention of urine, grass tetany, white scours, and blackleg. Office interviews, discussion meetings, and circular mailings were the methods used. Assistance to the Sandhills Feeder Cattle Producers 2 Ì 7 Association and other livestock organizations in the county was given both by the state office and the county Extension office. With over 42, 000 head of feeder cattle, and the offerings of purebred breeders, it is estimated that the total value of livestock sold by individuals participating in these organizations is in excess of 3, 500, 000. 00 for 1940. Rations and feeding practices came under discussion in office interviews, at meetings, and at farm and ranch visits. Soybean cake vs. cottonseed cake as a source of protein was given particular attention. Our recommendations were that soybean cake should be fed in preference to cottonseed cake when the latter is 4. 00 or more per ton higher in price than the former. When soybean cake is fed, phosphorus mineral should be offered ad lib. Sheep feed requirements for wintering, care of the ewe at lambing time, stomach worm control, and wool marketing information was given to 90 sheep growers in the county. 77 farmers and ranchers cooperated in the 1940 Pasture-Forage-Livestock program. Each contributed an outline of his methods. This program was conducted as a research or study of management methods as found on the ranches when visited. 243 weekly news stories concerning the Extension program in Cherry County were submitted to all or a part of 5 newspapers published in the county, and 6 published at stations outside the county borders. 55 circular letters announcing events or discussing subject matter were mailed. 1926 personal letters were written from the county office. 409 ladies enrolled in 31 project clubs for the year 1939 - 1940. Training centers for leaders were conducted at Valentine, Merriman, Gordon, Hyannis, Mullen, and Thedford. 15 clubs were represented at the Valentine Center, 7 at Merriman, 4 at Gordon, 3 at Hyannis, and 3 at Mullen. At Thedford, members from Cherry County enrolled in Thomas County clubs. The demonstrations given this year were Read for Facts and Sing for Fun, Company Dinners, Merry Christmas for the Home, Table Service, Care and Repair of Walls and Floors, and The Livable Home. 21 4 -H clubs were organized. 104 boys and 70 girls enrolled for 196 projects. In addition 29 associate members enrolled for as many projects. Of these associate members enrolled 13 were boys and 16 were girls. 62 boys and 39 girls finished their projects as achievement members.

The county Extension office was given charge of the 4 -H, handicraft, floral, project club, foods and needlework divisions of the exhibit section of the county fair. Assistance was given by the Extension leaders in the crops and poultry divisions and in a general livestock exhibit. 22 communities participated in programs of entertainment, recreation, and discussion of timely economic topics. A series of 16 such community gatherings in 14 communities was conducted during the fall. The title 2 Ì 2 Community Roundups 2 Ì 2 was coined to designate a type of these special community events. A total attendance of 3700 was recorded for the events both spring and fall. In addition 4 project club achievement days with an attendance of 727; 2 rural youth meetings with an attendance of 300, and 1 recreation meeting sponsored by the Kennedy community with an attendance of over 100, were conducted. The question of 2 Ì 2 Shall an appropriation be made annually from the general fund of the county for the support of Agricultural Extension work? 2 Ì 2 received approval at the November 5 election. The final canvass of ballots totaled 2399 for and 1655 against. This method of financing will be much simpler than the method followed heretofore of soliciting for volunteer subscriptions.

This change will also eliminate the need for constant attention to finances by the office personnel...|$|E
