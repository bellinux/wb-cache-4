However, there is limited literature reporting the use of ionic liquids in biomass saccharification, which mostly involves the addition of acid or water that conceals the true action of ionic liquid in saccharification. This article assesses the performance of molten Brӧnsted acidic 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hydrogen sulphate ([EMIM][HSO 4]) in <b>saccharifying</b> three agricultural biomasses, namely sago hampas, sugarcane bagasse, and rice husk, via saccharification kinetics. At 100 °C, [EMIM][HSO 4] saccharification of the biomasses achieved equilibrium reducing sugar yields at various durations (sago hampas, 3 h; sugarcane bagasse, 1 h; rice husk, 5 h).

40|$|Saccharification {{of various}} kinds of {{cellulose}} materials, including woods and barks of mulberry tree, cotton plant, bog-moss in the tundra of Saghalien, rice and barley straws, rice hulls etc., was carried by dilute sulphuric acid under pressure with an apparatus of Scholler's type which was planned by the author. It was found that saccharification of cellulose materials, especially of bog-moss is well achieved, if they are removed of humic acid beforehand with diluted ammonia and hydrolysed fractionally. Among various strains of yeasts, a kind of distilley yeast suitable for fermentation of <b>saccharified</b> solution was selected, and no inhibitting substance to the yeast was detected, though 0. 82 g of furfurol, 0. 021 g of hydroxymethylfurfurol and 3. 25 g of volatile acids were produced by decomposition of 100 g of mulberry tree in the <b>saccharified</b> solutions. Sugars in the solutions were investigated by the method of paper chromatograph {{and the presence of}} glucose, mannose, arabinose and xylose was verified. Thus, in decomposing 100 g of bog-moss by dilute acid at 130 ℃ and 150 ℃, about 30 g of sugars was obtained and then about 9 g of alcohol was produced by fermentation of <b>saccharified</b> solution. About 33 g of sugar and then about 10 g of alcohol were obtained by decomposition of 100 g of mulberry tree with dilute acid at 180 ℃. Production of yeast from the <b>saccharified</b> solutions was investigated, especially pentose-assimilable yeasts (isolated by the author and named Torulopsis xylinus). In <b>saccharified</b> solutions from 100 g of bog-moss or mulberry tree, about 9. 5 g or 8. 9 g of yeast was produced respectively. In order to know the availability of constituents of the spent wash, distilly waste liquor of the alcohol solution obtained from the <b>saccharified</b> solution of mulberry tree, experiments were carried out. During 120 hours ordinary culture, 1 / 3 parts of reducing sugars, including more than 2 / 3 parts of pentose, were consumed. It was pointed out that small amount of organic matters other than sugars was assimilated. No remarkable multiplication of yeasts took place with sulphite pulp waste liquor from which most of SO_ 2 was expelled by aeration and the remaining SO_ 2 was precipitated by adding calcium hydroxide to pH to 5. 6 by sulphuric acid, while noticeable crop yields of the yeasts were obtained. The chemical compositions of Torulopsis xylinus (7 - 9 % of ash, 43 - 47 % of crude protein and 0. 69 mg% of vitamin B_ 1) thus obtained were found to be very much the same with Torula utilis obtained from spent washes or pulp waste liquors. Production of fat with the <b>saccharified</b> solution of mulberry tree was carried out by the yeast (isolated by the author and named Rhodotorula mucilaginosa var.). It was found that at the first stage of fermentation (72 hours incubation) the immediate yeast population was larger in xylose or <b>saccharified</b> solutions as sources of carbon than in other sugars and at the second stage of fermentation (subsequent 24 hours incubation and the stage of fat production from glucose added) fat yield was also greater in the former.

30|$|Hydrolysis/Saccharification : The pretreated {{material}} {{with the remaining}} solid carbohydrate fraction, primarily cellulose and hemicellulose, is <b>saccharified,</b> releasing glucose and pentose sugars. This {{can be done with}} enzymes such as cellulases and hemicellulases. Depending on the process design, enzymatic hydrolysis requires from several hours to several days, after which the mixture of sugars and any unreacted cellulose is transferred to the fermented.|$|E
3000|$|In this work, an {{intelligent}} visualization method for producing trehalose via trehalose synthase {{was for the}} first time established and optimized by corresponding enzymatic hydrolysis with kudzu root starch as the initial raw material. For the first step, kudzu root starch was liquefied by α-amylase at a certain dextrose equivalent value of 19 – 21, and β-amylase and pullulanase to <b>saccharify</b> for a certain time, a four-factor nine-level experimental design with nine experiments was performed according to the uniform design table U [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{the production and}} the catalytic properties of amylolytic enzymes obtained from the fungi Lichtheimia ramosa (mesophilic) and Thermoascus aurantiacus (thermophilic). The highest amylase production in both fungi was observed in wheat bran supplemented with nutrient solution (pH 4. 0) after 96 hours of cultivation, reaching 417. 2 [*]U/g of dry substrate (or 41. 72 [*]U/mL) and 144. 5 [*]U/g of dry substrate (or 14. 45 [*]U/mL) for L. ramosa and T. aurantiacus, respectively. The enzymes showed higher catalytic activity at pH 6. 0 at 60 °C. The amylases produced by L. ramosa and T. aurantiacus were stable between pH 3. 5 – 10. 5 and pH 4. 5 – 9. 5, respectively. The amylase of L. ramosa was stable at 55 °C after 1 hour of incubation, whereas that of T. aurantiacus maintained 60 % of its original activity under the same conditions. Both enzymes were active {{in the presence of}} ethanol. The enzymes hydrolyzed starch from different sources, with the best results obtained with corn starch. The enzymatic complex produced by L. ramosa showed dextrinizing and <b>saccharifying</b> potential. The enzymatic extract produced by the fungus T. aurantiacus presented only <b>saccharifying</b> potential, releasing glucose monomers as the main hydrolysis product...|$|R
50|$|Brown rice (malt) syrup, {{also known}} as rice syrup or rice malt, is a {{sweetener}} which is rich in compounds categorized as sugars and is derived by culturing cooked rice starch with <b>saccharifying</b> enzymes {{to break down the}} starches, followed by straining off the liquid and reducing it by evaporative heating until the desired consistency is reached. The enzymes used in the saccharification step are supplied by an addition of sprouted barley grains to the rice starch (the traditional method) or by adding bacterial- or fungal-derived purified enzyme isolates (the modern, industrialized method).|$|R
