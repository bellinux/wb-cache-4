40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of a high-volume evacuation and a conventional intraoral suction system and aspirating tips for capturing aluminum oxide particles during use of an air-abrasion device. Methods: A phantom head was fixed at the dental chair head with secured a metallic device with 5 horizontal shafts, corresponding to operator's clockrelated working positions, and one vertical shaft to simulate the operator's nasal cavity. Petri plates were fixed to the shafts at distances of 20, 40 and 60 cm from the center of the oral cavity of the phantom head to collect the aluminum oxide particles spread over during air abrasion. The dust was aspirated with two types of suction tips used with both suction systems: a conventional <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector</b> and a <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector</b> customized by the adaptation of a 55 -mm-diameter funnel. Results: The amount of particles showed that the greatest abrasive particle deposition occurred at a distance of 20 cm from the center of the oral cavity of the phantom head at 9 o'clock operatory position with the conventional <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector</b> attached to high-volume evacuation system. Conclusions: The greatest deposition of aluminum oxide particles occurred at the shortest distance between the operator and the center of the oral cavity, while using the high-volume evacuation system associated to the conventional suction tip...|$|E
40|$|Background: Both {{continuous}} and intermittent aspiration of subglottic secretions {{by means of}} specially designed endotracheal tubes containing a separate dorsal lumen that opens into the subglottic region {{have been shown to}} be useful in reducing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, the high cost of these tubes restricts their use. Objective: The aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to test the effect of a low-cost device (<b>saliva</b> <b>ejector)</b> for continuous oral suctioning (COS) on the incidence of VAP in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Methods: The study was conducted in the six-bed medical-surgical ICU of a hospital with over 400 beds that provides comprehensive medical services to the public. The design of this study was a parallel-group randomized controlled trial. While both the experimental and control groups used the conventional endotracheal tube, the <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector</b> was only applied to patients assigned to the experimental group. The device was put between the patient's cheek and teeth, and then connected to 100. mmHg of suction for the continuous drainage of saliva. Results: Fourteen patients were randomized to receive COS and 13 patients were randomized to the control group. The two groups were similar in demographics, reasons for intubation, co-morbidity, and risk factors for acquiring VAP. VAP was found in 3 patients (23. 1 %; 71 episodes of VAP per 1000 ventilation days) receiving COS and in 10 patients (83. 3 %; 141 episodes of VAP per 1000 ventilation days) in the control group (relative risk, 0. 28; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 10 - 0. 77; p= 0. 003). The duration of mechanical ventilation in the experimental group was 3. 2 days (SD 1. 3), while that in the control group was 5. 9 days (SD 2. 8) (p= 0. 009); and the length of ICU stay was 4. 8 days (SD 1. 6) versus 9. 8 days (SD 6. 3) for the experimental and control groups, respectively (p= 0. 019). Conclusion: Continuous clearance of oral secretion by the <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector</b> may have an important role to play in reducing the rate of VAP, decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation, and shortening the length of stay of patients in the ICU.

40|$|Generally {{natural rubber}} latex (NRL) allergy is {{detected}} after some exposition to the material. As NRL is com- monly found in different materials used daily in dental clinic, the allergy can be {{manifested in the}} pediatric dentistry clinic. The first clinical manifestation can be smooth but also severe, therefore {{it is important to}} know different manifestations and how to prevent them. Objective: Report two clinical cases of natural rubber latex allergy in children and to present the safety measures that must be taken during clinical assistance, as using metallic <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector,</b> vinyl gloves for the treatment procedures and as an option to rubber dam. Cases Report: Case 1 - Patient presented body swellings after contact with latex. Case 2 - Patient presented skin eruptions and urticaria after contact with balloons suggesting possible NRL allergy. Conclusions: The precautions must always be taken during the dental treatment of natural rubber latex allergic patients in order to achieve satisfactory results by avoiding dermatitis or even anaphylactic shock...|$|E
40|$|WlORK in this {{laboratory}} is {{at present}} concerned with biochemical analysis N of human salivary mucin. This paper is introductory, {{in that the}} methods of obtaining mucin are critically discussed, but includes {{an investigation of the}} possibility of lipid materials being {{an integral part of the}} mucin complex, as reported by Kazakova. 1 THE PREPARATION OF HUMAN SALIVARY MUCIN The collection and pooling of overnight samples of saliva was highly unsatisfactory. Such saliva contained large masses of bacteria and debris and was usually a watery secretion of low mucin content. The ideal method is for one subject to spit directly into the appropriate precipitating solution over a long period of time. In this way the possibility of enzymic depolymerization taking place, as described by Knox and Still, 2 - 4 is avoided. In view of the large volume of saliva required, this method was considered impracticable. It was finally decided to fit traps into the circuits of the <b>saliva</b> <b>ejectors</b> in one of the clinics of the Dental Hospital. Twenty bottles, of about 250 ml...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this studywas to identify the components, composition and production rate of dental solid waste and associated management practices in dental offices in Hamadan. A total of 28 offices, including ten general dentist offices, eight specialist dentist offices, five practical dentist offices and five denture maker offices were selected in a random way. Three samples from each selected type were taken and the waste was manually separated into 74 sub-fractions and each sub-fraction was weighed. The {{results showed that the}} total annual dental waste production in dental offices was 41947. 43 kg. Domestic type, potentially infectious, chemical and pharmaceutical and toxic waste constituted 71. 15, 21. 40, 7. 26 and 0. 18 %, respectively of this amount. Only seven fractions including gypsum, latex gloves, nylon, dental impression material, used medicine ampoules, saliva-contaminated paper towels and <b>saliva</b> <b>ejectors</b> constituted about 80 % of the waste. It was also indicated that there were no effective activity for waste minimization, separation, reuse and recycling in dental offices and the management of sharps, potentially infectious waste and other hazardous waste was poor...|$|R
30|$|The subjects’ {{response}} to the taste was inconsistent (Table  3). More subjects seemed to favor the taste of placebo Vaseline®, which was tasteless, {{as opposed to the}} taste of Oraqix®, which was bitter. A few patients were confused which side tasted better as {{at the end of the}} study, they could not remember the taste after rinsing their mouths. Also, some of the subjects mentioned that the whole oral cavity felt bitter, which meant that some of the Oraqix® material might have been mixed with saliva despite the vigilant use of <b>saliva</b> <b>ejectors.</b> Despite the bitterness of Oraqix®, most subjects did favor the taste of it. Again, most patients could not remember the difference of taste by the end of the study. In this study, the bitter taste of Oraqix® coincided with a previous study that compared the effect of two lidocaine/prilocaine substances, Oraqix® and EMLA®, on pain reduction after palatal needle sticks. Both materials had the same composition, but EMLA® was a cream and Oraqix® existed as a gel. The study showed that Oraqix® was more bitter than EMLA® as reported by the subjects [20]. Hence, since Oraqix® is FDA approved and registered for intraoral use, it was essential to suggest a recommendation to the manufacturer to improve the taste of Oraqix® to be more acceptable by patients, particularly children.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} performances of a self-adhering resin composite and a conventional flowable composite with a self-etch bonding system on permanent molars. The influence of using rubber dam versus cotton roll isolation was also investigated. Materials and Methods. Patients aged between 6 and 12 years and presenting {{at least two}} permanent molars in need of small class I restorations were selected. Thirty-four pairs of restorations were randomly placed by the same operator. Fifteen patients were treated under rubber dam and nineteen using cotton rolls isolation and <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector.</b> They were evaluated according to the modified USPHS criteria at baseline, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years by two independent evaluators. Results. All patients attended the two-year recall. For all measured variables, {{there was no significant}} difference between rubber dam and cotton after 2 years of restoration with Premise Flowable or Vertise Flow (p value > 0. 05). The percentage of restorations scored alpha decreased significantly over time with Premise Flowable and Vertise Flow for marginal adaptation and surface texture as well as marginal discoloration while it did not vary significantly for color matching. After 2 years, Vertise Flow showed a similar behaviour to the Premise Flowable used with a self-adhesive resin system...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: Today, cross {{infection}} control {{is an integral}} part of dentistry and many dental health care workers no longer question its necessity. All dental equipments and instruments could be potentially considered as a source of infection. Purpose: The aim of this study was the evaluation of aerobic contaminations of four disposable materials used in routine dental practice. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, random sampling was performed and tryptone soy broth transfer culture medium was used. After 24 hours of incubation, samples were transferred to specific culture media. (Mckangy, Chocolate agar and Blood agar). Cultured bacteria were stained and studied using gram staining method. The study was carried out in a 17 weeks period. Results: All suction tips were infected with Bacillus cereus bacterium. Two cases of cotton roll samples showed contamination with Bacillus cereus, 2 cases with gram positive, coagulase negative cocci, 1 case with Streptococcus viridians and one case with Enterobacter class A. One case of anesthetic cartridges was contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis and two cases with Streptococcus viridians. Two cases of gutta-percha samples were contaminated with Bacillus cereus. Conclusion: Based of the findings of this study, the highest level of contamination was observed in <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector</b> tips. Contamination with Bacillus cereus was seen more frequently...|$|E
40|$|Improvements are {{described}} in the method of following temperature changes, and thus alterations in vasomotor tone, in exposed mucous membranes. Invention of an applicator holder, by means of which more sure and stable apposition of the thermopile terminals to the mucous surface may be effected has been the chief advance. Minor improvements have been {{the use of a}} <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector</b> and of better calibration technique. The palatine tonsils, like the palate, pharynx, and skin, react to chilling of the body surface with reflex vasoconstriction and ischemia. On rewarming the subject the tonsils quickly more than recover their former blood supply, actually becoming hyperemic; the skin returns to about its control condition; the pharynx and palate remain somewhat ischemic. The hypothesis is advanced that one factor in the beneficial hardening effect of cold bathing and outdoor living, with its incident heightened immunity to respiratory infection, may be the training of the vasomotor system in the direction of development in the pharynx of a reaction of hyperemia following chilling, similar to that observed in the tonsils of the present subjects. With inhalation of amyl nitrite, the skin temperature has always shown a sharp transient rise. The mucous membrane, if relatively ischemic, responds by a rise corresponding to the skin flush. If already hyperemic, local vasodilation in the mucous membrane with amyl nitrite is more than counterbalanced by the lowering of the general blood pressure, and the temperature falls. The flora of the pharynx and tonsils, studied by the unsatisfactory method described, showed, in several instances, after experimentation changes apparently due to proliferation of one of the microorganisms already present. In one case Streptococcus hæmolyticus, in one Micrococcus catarrhalis, and in a third Bacillus influenzæ was the organism showing a relative increase in numbers. The first two instances were associated with sore throat, the third with slight constitutional symptoms. The chilling in the experiments in no instance produced albuminuria or glycosuria, although a more dilute urine was apparently excreted during the experiments. A fall in hydrogen ion concentration, referable to the forced respiration, was noted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{compliance}} of general dental practitioners (GDPs) in the private sector in North Jordan with infection control measures. A pilot-tested questionnaire about infection control measures was distributed in March 2004 to 120 private practices. The response rate was 91. 66 percent. About 77 percent of dentists usually ask their patients about medical history, 36 percent were vaccinated against hepatitis B, 81. 8 percent wear and change gloves during treatment and between patients, and 54. 5 percent wear and change masks during treatment and between patients. Most dental practitioners (95. 4 percent) reported that they changed extraction instruments and burs between patients. All dental practitioners reported that they changed <b>saliva</b> <b>ejectors</b> between patients, but only 41. 8 percent changed handpieces between patients. Approximately 63 percent (69 / 110) used autoclaves for sterilization, 47. 3 percent (52 / 110) used plastic bags to wrap sterilized instruments, and only 18 percent (20 / 110) disinfected impressions before sending them to dental labs. Fourteen percent used rubber dams in their clinics, and only 31. 8 percent had special containers for sharps disposal. Based on these responses, approximately 14 percent of general dentists in this sample were considered to be compliant with an inventory of recommended infection control measures. In Jordan, there is a great need to provide formal and obligatory infection control courses and guidelines for private dentists by the Ministry of Health and the dental association in addition to distribution of standard infection control manuals that incorporat...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background General dental {{practitioners}} provide {{the majority of}} endodontic treatment in Jordan. The {{aim of this study}} was to gather information on the methods, materials and attitudes employed in root canal treatment by dentists in North Jordan, in order to evaluate and improve the quality of current practice. Methods A questionnaire was posted to all registered general {{dental practitioners}} working in private practice in Irbid Governate in North Jordan (n = 181). The questionnaire included information on methods, materials and techniques used in endodontic treatment. Results Reply rate was 72 % (n = 131). The results demonstrated that only five dentists used rubber dam occasionally and not routinely. The majority used cotton rolls for isolation solely or in combination with a high volume <b>saliva</b> <b>ejector</b> (n = 116). The most widely used irrigants were sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide, which were used by 32. 9 % (n = 43) and 33. 6 % (n = 44) of the respondents, respectively. Forty eight percent of the respondents (n = 61) used the cold lateral condensation technique for canal obturation, 31. 3 % (n = 41) used single cone, 9. 9 % (n = 13) used vertical condensation and 12. 2 % (n = 16) used paste or cement only for the obturation. The majority used zinc oxide eugenol as a sealer (72. 5 %). All, but one, respondents used hand instruments for canal preparation and the technique of choice was step back (52. 7 %). More than 50 % (n = 70) of the dentists took one radiograph for determining the working length, whilst 22. 9 % (n = 30) did not take any radiograph at all. Most practitioners performed treatment in three visits for teeth with two or more root canals, and in two visits for teeth with a single root canal. Conclusions This study indicates that dentists practicing in North Jordan do not comply with international quality standards and do not use recently introduced techniques. Many clinicians never take a radiograph for determining the working length and never used rubber dam or intra-canal medicaments. </p...|$|E
