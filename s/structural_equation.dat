Simultaneous equation modelling (SEM), as used in econometric modelling, may prove an effective tool for this problem. Generalized linear models were used to derive the <b>structural</b> <b>equations</b> defining the interactions between cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). These <b>structural</b> <b>equations</b> were then applied, using SEM, to Cohort 2 data (replicates 1 – 100) to estimate the phenotypic structure underlying the simulation. The goal {{was to determine if}} this empiric method of deriving <b>structural</b> <b>equations</b> for use in SEM was able to recover the simulation model better than generalized linear models. Results First, the underlying <b>structural</b> <b>equations</b> were estimated using generalized linear model techniques, which found strong a relationship between glucose, triglycerides and HDL-C. Using these <b>structural</b> <b>equations,</b> I used SEM to evaluate these relationships jointly. I found that a combination of the empiric <b>structural</b> <b>equations</b> and the SEM method was better at recovering the underlying simulated relationship between biologic measures than generalized linear modelling. Conclusion The empiric SEM procedure presented here estimated different relationships between dependent variables than generalized linear modelling. The SEM procedure using empirically developed <b>structural</b> <b>equations</b> was able to recover the underlying simulation relationship partially and thus holds promise as a technique for complex phenotype analysis. Robust methods for determining the <b>structural</b> <b>equations</b> must be developed for application of SEM to population data. </p...|$|R

PCA is popular especially in psychology, {{in the field of}} psychometrics. In Q methodology, the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix determine the Q-methodologist's judgment of practical significance (which differs from the statistical significance of hypothesis testing; cf. criteria for determining the number of factors).

25|$|Statistical methods {{commonly}} used {{in other areas of}} psychology are also used in OHP-related research. Statistical methods used include <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> modeling and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; also known as multilevel modeling). HLM can better adjust for similarities between employees and is especially well suited to evaluating the lagged impact of work stressors on health outcomes; in this research context HLM can help minimize censoring and is well-suited to experience sampling studies. Meta-analyses have been used to aggregate data (modern approaches to meta-analyses rely on HLM), and draw conclusions across multiple studies.|$|E

Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data. These include the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling.

2500|$|From the 1980 to 2010s {{other changes}} in i/o {{psychology}} took place. Researchers increasingly adopted a multi-level approach, attempting to understand behavioral phenomena {{from both the}} level of the organization and {{the level of the}} individual worker. There was also an increased interest in the needs and expectations of employees as individuals. For example, an emphasis on organizational justice and the psychological contract took root, as well as the more traditional concerns of selection and training. Methodological innovations (e.g., meta-analyses, <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> modeling) were adopted. With the passage of the American with Disabilities Act in 1990 and parallel legislation elsewhere in the world, i/o psychology saw an increased emphasis on [...] "fairness in personnel decisions."

2500|$|Three {{different}} {{models have been}} proposed to explain the structure of organizational justice perceptions including a two factor model, a three factor model, and a four factor model. [...] Many researchers have studied organizational justice {{in terms of the}} three factor model (e.g., DeConinck, 2010; Liljegren & Ekberg, 2010) while others have used a two factor model in which interpersonal justice is subsumed under procedural justice while yet some other studies suggest a four factor model best fits the data (Colquitt, 2001). [...] Greenberg (1990) proposed a two-factor model and Sweeney and McFarlin (1993) found support for a two-factor model composed of distributive and procedural justice. [...] Through the use of <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> modeling, Sweeney and McFarlin found that distributive justice was related to outcomes that are person-level (e.g., pay satisfaction) while procedural justice was related to organization-level outcomes (e.g., organizational commitment).|$|E
2500|$|Because it {{is usually}} {{impossible}} to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a sample of persons from the wider population. Social psychologists frequently use survey research when {{they are interested in}} results that are high in external validity. Surveys use various forms of random sampling to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population. This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables. However, new statistical methods like <b>structural</b> <b>equation</b> modeling are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data. Some psychologists, including Dr. David Sears, have criticized social psychological research for relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings. Over 70% of experiments in Sears' study used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that may not be representative of the population as a whole.|$|E

Therefore, each participant is interviewed at two or more time points; each period of data collection is called a [...] "wave". The method was developed by sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld in 1938 as a means of studying political campaigns. This longitudinal sampling-method allows estimates of changes in the population, for example with regard to chronic illness to job stress to weekly food expenditures.

The first vector T of the Frenet - Serret frame (T, N, B) is tangent to a curve, and all three vectors are mutually orthonormal. Similarly, the Darboux frame on a surface is an orthonormal frame whose first two vectors are tangent to the surface. Adapted frames are useful because the invariant forms (ωi,ωji) pullback along φ, and the <b>structural</b> <b>equations</b> are preserved under this pullback.
