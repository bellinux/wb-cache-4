5000|$|A <b>stall</b> <b>strip</b> {{is a small}} {{sharp-edged}} device that, when {{attached to}} {{the leading edge of}} a wing, encourages the stall to start there in preference to any other location on the wing. If attached close to the wing root, it makes the stall gentle and progressive; if attached near the wing tip, it encourages the aircraft to drop a wing when stalling.|$|E
50|$|The final 2000A {{configuration}} had tuning-fork-type noise dampers {{and improved}} insulation to reduce cabin noise and redesigned exhaust stacks for more efficient engine airflow. <b>Stall</b> <b>strips</b> {{placed on the}} front wing to enhance stall behavior were removed. Elimination of the <b>stall</b> <b>strips</b> reduced <b>stall</b> speed by up to 9 kn, which allows the 2000A to takeoff from shorter runways. The 2000 had standpipes in the fuel tanks to artificially limit fuel capacity so the aircraft would meet a target payload weight. The standpipes were removed in the 2000A, increasing fuel capacity by 31 gal. Both the maximum ramp weight and takeoff weight were increased by 500 lb and zero fuel weight was increased 400 lb.|$|R
50|$|Washout may be {{accomplished}} by other means e.g. modified aerofoil section, vortex generators, leading edge wing fences, notches, or <b>stall</b> <b>strips.</b> This {{is referred to as}} aerodynamic washout.

5000|$|A <b>stall</b> <b>strip</b> is a fixed device {{employed}} on {{the leading}} edge of fixed-wing aircraft to modify the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil. [...] Stall strips are used to initiate flow separation at chosen locations on the wing during high-angle of attack flight, so as to improve the controllability of the aircraft when it enters stall. They are typically employed in pairs, symmetrically on both wings. On aircraft where wing airflow is affected by asymmetrical propeller wash, a strip may be used on a single wing to reduce risk of entering a spin.|$|E

25|$|American's {{engineers}} reworked {{the wing}} to a non-folding design, easing FAR Part 23 certification. Other changes included adding extended wing tips to improve rate-of-climb, an anti-servo tab {{on the elevator}} along with a centering spring system to increase longitudinal stability and <b>stall</b> <b>strips</b> to improve handling during a stall. The company designated the redesigned aircraft the AA-1 Yankee Clipper.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{such as the}} American Aviation AA-1 Yankee, <b>stall</b> <b>strips</b> {{are planned}} to be used on the wing from the start. In {{the case of the}} AA-1 the left and right wings were identical, {{interchangeable}} and built on a single wing jig, thus the more traditional use of washout in the wing design was not possible.|$|R
50|$|The {{secret to}} the DR400's {{relatively}} high performance {{lies in the}} pronounced washout in the outer panels. Since they have a lower angle of attack to the airflow than the centre section, they create less drag in cruise flight. This characteristic also imbues rather benign stall behavior and the DR400 consequently does not suffer from the need to install retro-fixes like leading edge <b>stall</b> <b>strips.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the {{redesign}} process the aircraft was modified {{so that the}} wings did not fold, {{making it easier to}} achieve certification. Other changes included a longer wing to improve rate of climb, an anti-servo tab on the elevator along with an elevator centering spring system to increase longitudinal stability and <b>stall</b> <b>strips</b> to improve the stall performance. The resulting aircraft entered production in the fall of 1968 as the 1969 model American Aviation AA-1 Yankee Clipper.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stall</b> <b>strips</b> {{typically}} {{consist of}} {{a small piece of}} material, usually aluminium, triangular in cross section and often 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) in length. It is riveted or bonded on the point of the wing’s leading edge, usually at the wing root. At high angles of attack, it trips the still-laminar boundary layer, initiating flow separation earlier than at other positions along the wing. This has the effect of causing the wing root to stall before the outer portions of the wing, ensuring a progressive outward stall, minimizing the risk of spinning and giving maximum aileron control throughout the stall.|$|R
5000|$|This {{version was}} {{introduced}} in 1997 as the new standard model.

Croatia bought 17 new examples in 1997; Slovenia placed an order for nine (nicknamed Hudournik - [...] "Swift") in December of the same year; Oman ordered 12 examples in January 1999; and Ireland signed a contract for eight in January 2003. Bulgaria purchased 12 aircraft in 2004. The last order was made by Mexico, which received at least two in September 2006.|$|R

5000|$|The most {{successful}} NASA experimental results were obtained on a quite low 6:1 aspect ratio wing (Grumman Yankee AA-1), with a DLE placed at 57% of the semi-span. As the vortices (inboard cuff and wing tip) are efficient {{on a limited}} span length (about 1.5 times the local chord), a DLE alone is unable to preserve enough outboard lift to keep the roll control in case of high aspect ratio wing. Wings of more than 8 or 9 aspect ratio features other devices to complete the cuff effect, for example <b>stall</b> <b>strips</b> (as used on the Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 400), [...] "Rao slots" [...] (as used on the Questair Venture), vortex generators or segmented droop (as used on a NASA modified Cessna 210). In {{the case of the}} high aspect ratio Cessna 210 wing (AR =11:1), roll damping at stall was not as efficient.|$|R
2500|$|The wing {{features}} large fowler flaps pivoting {{on three}} scissor hinges per wing, {{with a maximum}} 30-degree deflection. The flaps are electrically powered and are controlled by a switch {{to the right of}} the radio stack. The flap indicator is a three-light system which shows when the flaps are at zero, twenty and thirty degrees. The flaps can be selected in between those settings but require visual confirmation of flap position. The wing is rectangular with a 7:1 aspect ratio, no taper and no washout. Small <b>stall</b> <b>strips</b> are installed a few feet out from the root to aid stall performance. The airfoil is a unique design, which the XL2 shares with its predecessor the Europa. This is a Don Dykins airfoil, designated as a [...] "Dykins 12%", because the wing's maximum thickness is 12% of the chord. The airfoil is a semi-symmetrical, laminar-flow design. The stall warning system is a voice annunciator that says [...] "stall, stall".|$|R
25|$|The Yankee was {{originally}} designed to minimize the number of airframe parts used, {{with the aim of}} simplifying production and saving money. As a result of this philosophy many parts were interchangeable. Due to the use of a non-tapered tubular spar, which doubled as the fuel tank, and the lack of wing washout, the wings could be exchanged left and right. The fin and horizontal stabilizers were interchangeable, as were the rudder and the elevators. The ailerons and flaps were similarly the same part. While it did succeed in making production easier, this design philosophy produced many aerodynamic compromises in the design. For instance, because the flaps were the same part as the ailerons they were too small to be effective as flaps. The lack of wing washout, necessitated by the wing interchangeability requirement, meant that <b>stall</b> <b>strips</b> had to be installed to produce acceptable stall characteristics for certification. Over time this philosophy of compromising the aerodynamics in favour of a minimized parts count was abandoned. For example, the redesign of the AA-1B into the AA-1C by Gulfstream involved wider-span elevators and horizontal stabilizers that produced better longitudinal stability, but were no longer interchangeable with the rudder and fin.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the optimum position and geometry of <b>stall</b> <b>strips</b> (SS) to control sudden fall of lift in wind turbine blades. The type of airfoil {{used in this study}} is NACA 0015 with 150 mm of chord length. Total of five positions, two geometries and three sizes of SS configurations are simulated by using Ansys Fluent software. For position configuration, SS of size 2 mm is placed on the apex (POS- 1), and on the upper and lower surfaces at distance of 0. 65 mm (POS- 4 and POS- 2 respectively), and 2. 45 mm (POS- 5 and POS- 3), respectively, from the leading edge. The shapes tested are dome and equilateral triangle. The results show that the addition of SS as a method of controlling sudden loss of lift decreases the maximum lift coefficient. Attachment of SS at the lower surface of the airfoil did not bring any significant effect to the lift and stall characteristics; while for the upper surface it reduces the sudden fall of lift but at the cost of big reduction in maximum lift coefficient. The optimum position and geometry of SS are POS- 1 and triangle shape. Increasing in size of SS shows positive effect in control stalling effect...|$|R

The mean annual incidence rate was 12. 7 quarter cases/yr per 100 cows. The modeling incidence rate of clinical mastitis at the herd level indicated that a number of risk factors were associated with a higher rate of clinical mastitis: one or more cows that were leaking milk, one or more cows with trampled teats, no disinfection of the maternity area after calving, consistent use of post-milking teat disinfection, Red and White cattle (Meuse-Rhine-Yssel) as the predominant breed, and an annual bulk milk somatic cell count < 150, 000 cells/ml.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Des Esseintes is partly based on Huysmans himself, {{and the two}} share {{many of the same}} tastes, although Huysmans, on his modest civil-service salary, was hardly able to indulge them to the same extent as his upper-class hero. The writers and dandies Charles Baudelaire and Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly also had some influence, but the most important model was the notorious aristocratic aesthete Robert de Montesquiou, who was also the basis for Baron de Charlus in Marcel Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu. Montesquiou's furnishings bear a strong resemblance to those in Des Esseintes's house:In 1883, to his eternal regret, Montesquiou admitted Stéphane Mallarmé [...] It was late at night when the poet was shown over the house, and the only illumination came from a few scattered candelabra; yet in the flickering light Mallarmé observed that the door-bell was in fact a sacring-bell, that one room was furnished as a monastery cell and another as the cabin of a yacht, and that the third contained a Louis Quinze pulpit, three or four cathedral <b>stalls</b> and a <b>strip</b> of altar railing. He was shown, too, a sled picturesquely placed on a snow-white bearskin, a library of rare books in suitably-coloured bindings and the remains of an unfortunate tortoise whose shell had been coated with gold paint. According to Montesquiou writing many years later in his memoirs, the sight of these marvels left Mallarmé speechless with amazement. 'He went away', records Montesquiou, 'in a state of silent exaltation [...] I do not doubt therefore that it was in the most admiring, sympathetic and sincere good faith that he retailed to Huysmans what he had seen during the few moments he spent in Ali Baba's cave.' ...|$|R
