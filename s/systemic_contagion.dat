40|$|We {{implement}} {{a modified version}} of DebtRank, a measure of systemic impact inspired in feedback centrality, to recursively measure the contagion effects caused by the default of a selected financial institution. In our case contagion is a liquidity issue, measured as the decrease in financial institutions’ short-term liquidity position across the Colombian interbank network. Concurrent with related literature, unless contagion dynamics are preceded by a major –but unlikely- drop in the short-term liquidity position of all participants, we consistently find that individual and <b>systemic</b> <b>contagion</b> effects are negligible. We find that negative effects resulting from contagion are concentrated in a few financial institutions. However, as most of their impact is conditional on the occurrence of unlikely major widespread illiquidity events, and due to the subsidiary contribution of the interbank market to the local money market, their overall systemic importance is still to be confirmed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe recent {{economic}} and financial crisis has had {{a tremendous impact on}} the banking system, raising key questions about liquidity risk. Its management is seen to be of paramount importance, receiving great attention from policymakers, researchers and practitioners, taking into consideration that a liquidity shortage at a single so called “too big to fail” financial institution can lead to <b>systemic</b> <b>contagion</b> and instability. In this context, the aim of the paper is to analyse a significant issue that needs to be tackled when promoting financial stability, more exactly the determinants of the liquidity risk of a sample of banks operating in a series of CEE countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania), reviewing {{at the same time the}} progresses made in certain key areas and the remaining challenges.

40|$|The post-financial crisis era {{has seen}} a {{paradigm}} shift in the regulation of the financial services industry.

Supervisors from the United States, the European Union and the Group of Twenty (G 20) are developing requirements for systemically important financial institutions to create credible living wills. These plans will include key information about the firm and set forth actions that could be taken to reduce idiosyncratic losses and to mitigate <b>systemic</b> <b>contagion</b> in the event of financial distress, up to and including the insolvency or failure of the firm.

An interbank market lets participants pool this risk but also creates the potential for one bank's crisis to propagate through the system. We study banking systems with homogeneous banks, as well as systems in which banks are heterogeneous. With homogeneous banks, an interbank market unambiguously stabilises the system.

30|$|Despite the {{enormous}} damage {{of the financial}} crisis of 2008 effective reforms in the financial system have been curbed by those with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. For example, the banking establishment is well aware that the government will guarantee bank liabilities of key credit and insurance institutions whose failure would certainly provoke a <b>systemic</b> <b>contagion</b> in the entire financial system, putting in jeopardy the payment system. Thus, the main bottleneck may not be technical but political [18, 19]. A strong political will is required to curb the control that “too big to fail banks” hold on the entire economic system. Nonetheless, political action in order to be effective and serve the common good must be informed by up to date scientific studies. For example, in 2009 one major Spanish bank was created -with a broad consensus among the parliamentary political groupings- from the conglomeration of seven small regional saving banks. Some months later the government nationalized the bank. Were those policy makers aware of network-based studies of financial contagion, this could have resulted in a much less harmful outcome for the taxpayer. As it is shown in [20], the creation of conglomerates of banks, lowers diversity across the system as whole, and increases the systemic risk of failure.|$|E
40|$|We {{create an}} {{agent-based}} banking model {{that allows the}} simulation of leverage cycles and financial contagion. Banks within our model adapt their investment strategies in an evolutionary manner according {{to the success of}} their competitors, creating an endogenous interbank loan network and a dynamic asset market as they try to maximise profit by adjusting their leverage. The system exhibits periods of slow risk growth and fast insolvency cascades, allowing us to assess both the size and frequency of those cascades over a long time-frame. We demonstrate that banks endogenise systemic risk into their leverage behaviour when the asset market is subject to either lowor high levels of volatility, but are less successful for medium volatility when the number of bank insolvencies is maximised. We also show that in a low volatility environment, banks are more susceptible to <b>systemic</b> <b>contagion.</b> While the majority of insolvencies occur through the asset side of the balance sheet due to fire sales causing a rapid depreciation in the asset price, failures through the liability side of the balance sheet tend to be correlated, acting as an amplification mechanism to create far more serious cascades.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the new architecture of the international financial system is to master the international financial instability by improving the transparency and the supervision of markets, and by arousing a greatest sense of responsibility in the prevention and management of crises, of {{both private and public}} actors. But it is very improbable for the new architecture to take the form of rules of law whose combination would open on a new system forced upon the international community, to the image of the creation of the IMF in 1944. It {{is likely to be a}} pragmatic reply to the international financial instability rather than an institutional evolution of the modes of international monetary and financial governance. The ambition to consolidate the international financial architecture marks already a real change of doctrine, close to a new neo-liberal compromise and partially nearing the postwar embedded liberalism recommended by Keynes. But this compromise appears all both ambiguous and unfinished, as much in its foundations that in its functioning. The object of this analysis is precisely to surround the political economy of this architecture. One examines first the official contours of the new architecture, by showing that this program is first a political reply, managed by the American diplomacy and piloted by the G 7, to the <b>systemic</b> <b>contagion</b> of the 90 ?s.

40|$|The {{credit default swap}} (CDS) {{market has}} grown much faster than other {{derivatives}} markets since its inception. Even though it is dwarfed by the interest rate derivatives market, which is eight times larger, its growth has affected {{the stability of the}} financial system. CDS were originally designed as a risk transfer tool to allow investors to hedge their position in the debt of a reference entity, but much of the activity in this market is also speculative (Olléon-Assouan, 2004). Risk management in the CDS market has certainly improved significantly, reflected in the fact that gross notional volumes have fallen remarkably as a result of trade compression. Nevertheless there is still no accurate indication of how much risk has actually been transferred with these instruments, and this is a major concern for financial stability. Even a rough estimate of market size ranges from USD 29 trillion to USD 38 trillion at end- 2008. Clarifying and harmonising information is vitally important, particularly since the uncertainty surrounding market participants’ risk exposure contains the seeds of <b>systemic</b> <b>contagion.</b> There is now a pressing need for better market supervision based on the active participation of regulators. The task has already been made easier by a number of public and private initiatives aimed at improving the functioning of the market and monitoring risks more effectively. The most tangible evidence of these combined efforts can be found in various plans for a clearinghouse that emerged in 2008 and 2009. Aside from its practical limitations, however, this solution cannot be extended to all CDS classes. And regulators still face the sizeable challenge of assessing overall counterparty risk on the CDS market and preventing concentration and formation of systemic exposures. ...|$|E

The initial study of payments system risk was undertaken by Humphrey (1986) who found significant risk in the U. S. Fedwire system in the mid 1980 s. Subsequent studies by Angelini, Maresca & Russo (1996), Kuussaari (1996), Northcott (2002) and Furfine (2003) have found, however, little evidence of systemic risk in the payments systems of Italy, Finland and Canada, and in the U. S. inter-bank market. Given that the implementation of real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems in many countries, including Australia, at significant cost, {{has been designed to}} reduce payments system risk, the finding that this risk is small is significant. While detailed payments system data for Australia is not available to researchers outside the Reserve Bank, this study constructs a synthetic data set based on available information and uses this data to simulate the failure of each financial institution operating in the Australian payments system. We find little evidence of systemic risk in the Australian payments system using this approach and conclude that the introduction of RTGS in the Australian system in 1996 had only a marginal effect on risk. payments system; real time gross settlement (RTGS); deferred net settlement (DNS); <b>systemic</b> risk; <b>contagion...</b>|$|R
