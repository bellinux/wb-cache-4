They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that is either {{suspended}} from branches or <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|Fleshy lobe-fins <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> bones {{rather than}} ray-stiffened fins {{seem to have}} been an ancestral trait of all bony fishes (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned {{ancestors}} of the tetrapods evolved them further, while the ancestors of the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have fleshy frontal fins.|$|E

Using two waves of data (T 1 = 637, T 2 = 390) collected from 23 New Zealand organisations we tested a structural model that predicted (1) direct effects of co-worker <b>support</b> <b>on</b> job satisfaction and strain; (2) direct effects of family <b>support</b> <b>on</b> family satisfaction and strain; and (3) indirect effects of co-worker support and family <b>support</b> <b>on</b> strain mediated through job satisfaction and family satisfaction.

5|$|A {{defensible}} barracks made of brick, {{faced in}} Kentish ragstone on the fort's exterior, closes off the gorge.

The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. Although much of the barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E

On 13October 1898 the appeal was relaunched, with the proposal that if the remaining £3,000 were raised, Watts would design and build a covered way, which in due course would be lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery of ordinary people.
