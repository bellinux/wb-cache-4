50|$|Founded in late 1994 as a sole {{proprietorship}} and incorporated in 2002, Bleeding Art Industries (BAI) originally focused on theatrical design work, with Founder Leo Wieser {{working as a}} contractor, designing costumes, sets, and lighting for theatre and performing arts companies across Canada, and touring worldwide with puppeteer Ronnie Burkett. After working for a local pyrotechnics company, where he designed and implemented pyro displays, Wieser began doing mechanical special effects for films. BAI has since specialized primarily in special effects including pyrotechnics and other atmospheric effects, and has expanded over the years into providing creature and character effects, themed exhibits, custom props, and sculptures. The company also has a sales and rentals division, selling film production supplies, <b>special</b> effects make-up, <b>and</b> selling <b>and</b> renting <b>special</b> effects equipment. It manufactures and sells its own line of bloods, gelatin <b>and</b> gelatin appliances, <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> other <b>special</b> effects make-up products. BAI has established itself as a high quality provider of <b>special</b> effects services <b>and</b> expendables for the Canadian market.Drawing on its wide-ranging experience and expertise, the company began a production division around 2010 under which it creates and produces its own content. Its first film - Skeleton Girl - is the first Canadian film shot in stereoscopic 3D and stop motion animation. It premiered in New York in April 2012 where it won Best First 3D Film and is celebrating {{a year and a}} half on the film festival circuit at the time of writing this. It also worked with Insurrection Films on the film The Hunt, designing and building two creatures for the short horror film, also currently on the festival circuit where it is garnering acclaim.|$|R
500|$|The studio also {{developed}} several new tools to generate realistic and believable shots, particularly the heavy <b>and</b> deep <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> its {{interactions with the}} characters. Disney wanted an [...] "all-encompassing" [...] and organic tool to provide snow effects but not require switching between different methods. As noted above, several Disney artists <b>and</b> <b>special</b> effects personnel traveled to Wyoming to experience walking through deep snow. Dr. Kenneth Libbrecht, a professor from the California Institute of Technology, was invited to give lectures to the effects group on how <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice form, and why snowflakes are unique. Using this knowledge, the effects group created a snowflake generator {{that allowed them to}} randomly create 2,000 unique snowflake shapes for the film.|$|R

50|$|Lantau Peak {{is located}} in central Lantau Peak, with an {{elevation}} of 934 meters above sea level (23 metres shorter than Tai Mo Shan, Hong Kong's highest peak). Under the Köppen climate classification, Lantau Peak features a subtropical highland climate. Due to its elevation, strong winds and fog occur throughout the year. Winter is cold with temperatures often dip below 0 ° C; summer is warm with temperatures reaching tops of 18-22 ° C, which {{can be considered as}} a summer resort in Hong Kong; the spring is cool to cold but very humid, while the autumn is cool and dry, but also because of its climate similar to Tai Mo Shan, winter might experiences frost <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> other winter <b>special</b> weather phenomena, even more than Tai Mo Shan and Ngong Ping also much more cold (because it is isolated from urban areas and often experiences strong winds throughout the year). Because there is no weather station at the top of Lantau Peak, the Ngong Ping Weather Station of the Hong Kong Observatory can only be used as reference for its temperature. The temperature in the vicinity of Ngong Ping is lower than that at Chek Lap Kok. It is estimated that the temperature of Lantau Peak is about 7 ℃ lower than that of Ngong Ping.|$|R

40|$|Empirical angular {{distribution}} models for estimating top-of-atmosphere shortwave irradiances from radiance measurements over permanent <b>snow,</b> fresh <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea ice are developed using CERES measurements on Terra. Permanent snow {{angular distribution}} models depend on cloud fraction, cloud optical thickness, <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> brightness. Fresh <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea ice angular distribution models depend on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sea ice fraction, cloud fraction, cloud optical thickness, <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice brightness.

The average radiance over clear-sky permanent snow is more isotropic with satellite viewing geometry than that over overcast permanent snow. On average, the albedo of clear-sky permanent snow varies from 0. 65 to 0. 68 for solar zenith angles between 60 logical and∘ and 80 deg, while the corresponding albedo of overcast scenes varies from 0. 70 to 0. 73.

40|$|The complex {{mechanical}} behaviour of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> its propensity to vary temporally and spatially makes the engineering of engineered pavements of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice challenging. Current technologies and design methods for <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice runways remain largely reliant on work {{performed in the}} 1950 s and 1960 s. This paper examines the evolution of techniques for the engineering of runways constructed using <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice. It is recommended that modern engineering approaches based on conventional rigid and flexible pavement design principles be considered for ice <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> runway design. The adoption of such methods requires the development on an analytical model for the prediction of snow strength, based on snow age, temperature history and density. The use of such a model would allow contemporary engineered pavements of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice to be efficiently sited and constructed.

40|$|We {{show the}} {{comparisons}} between ground-based measurements of spectrally integrated (300 nm to 380 nm) ultraviolet (UV) irradiance with satellite estimates from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) total ozone and reflectivity {{data for the}} whole period of TOMS measurements (1979 - 2000) over the Meteorological Observatory of Moscow State University (MO MSU), Moscow, Russia. Several aspects of the comparisons are analyzed, including effects of cloudiness, aerosol, <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> cover. <b>Special</b> emphasis {{is given to the}} effect of different spatial and temporal averaging of ground-based data when comparing with low-resolution satellite measurements (TOMS footprint area 50 - 200 sq km). The comparisons in cloudless scenes with different aerosol loading have revealed TOMS irradiance overestimates from + 5 % to + 20 %. A-posteriori correction of the TOMS data accounting for boundary layer aerosol absorption (single scattering albedo of 0. 92) eliminates the bias for cloud-free conditions. The single scattering albedo was independently verified using CIMEL sun and sky-radiance measurements at MO MSU in September 2001. The mean relative difference between TOMS UV estimates and ground UV measurements mainly lies within 1 10 % for both snow-free <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> period with a tendency to TOMS overestimation in snow-free period especially at overcast conditions when the positive bias reaches 15 - 17 %. The analysis of interannual UV variations shows quite similar behavior for both TOMS and ground measurements (correlation coefficient r= 0. 8). No long-term trend in the annual mean bias was found for both clear-sky and all-sky conditions with <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> without <b>snow.</b> Both TOMS <b>and</b> ground data show positive trend in UV irradiance between 1979 and 2000. The UV trend is attributed to decreases in both cloudiness and aerosol optical thickness during the late 1990 's over Moscow region. However, if the analyzed period is extended to include pre-TOMS era (1968 - 2000 period), no trend in ground UV irradiance is detected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In the UK, the 2009 / 10 {{winter was}} characterised by {{sustained}} low temperatures; grit stocks became depleted and surfaces left untreated. We describe {{the relationship between}} temperature and emergency hospital admissions for falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice in England, identify the age and gender of those {{most likely to be}} admitted, and estimate the inpatient costs of these admissions during the 2009 / 10 winter. Methods Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify episodes of emergency admissions for falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice during winters 2005 / 06 to 2009 / 10; these were plotted against mean winter temperature. By region, the logs of the rates of weekly emergency admissions for falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice were plotted against the mean weekly temperature for winters 2005 / 06 to 2009 / 10 and a linear regression analysis undertaken. For the 2009 / 10 winter the number of emergency hospital admissions for falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice were plotted by age and gender. The inpatient costs of admissions in the 2009 / 10 winter for falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice were calculated using Healthcare Resource Group costs and Admitted Patient Care 2009 / 10 National Tariff Information. Results The number of emergency hospital admissions due to falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice varied considerably across years; the number was 18 times greater in 2009 / 10 (N = 16, 064) than in 2007 / 08 (N = 890). There is an exponential increase [Ln(rate of admissions) = 0. 456 - 0. 463 *(mean weekly temperature) ] in the rate of emergency hospital admissions for falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice as temperature falls. The rate of admissions in 2009 / 10 was highest among the elderly and particularly men aged 80 and over. The total inpatient cost of falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice in the 2009 / 10 winter was 42 million GBP. Conclusions Emergency hospital admissions for falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice vary greatly across winters, and according to temperature, age and gender. The cost of these admissions in England in 2009 / 10 was considerable. With responsibility for health improvement moving to local councils, they will have to balance the cost of public health measures like gritting with the healthcare costs associated with falls. The economic burden of falls on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice is substantial; keeping surfaces clear of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice is a public health priority. </p...|$|R
