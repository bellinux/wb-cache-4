5|$|Beck's nine-year {{relationship}} with designer Leigh Limon and their subsequent breakup {{is said to}} have inspired his 2002 album, <b>Sea</b> <b>Change.</b> He wrote most of the songs for the album in one week after the breakup. Beck married actress Marissa Ribisi, the twin sister of actor Giovanni Ribisi, in April 2004, shortly before the birth of their son, Cosimo Henri. Ribisi gave birth to their daughter, Tuesday, in 2007. Marissa and Giovanni Ribisi were delivered by Beck's mother, Bibbe Hansen.|$|E
5|$|With a pop art {{collage of}} musical styles, oblique and ironic lyrics, and postmodern {{arrangements}} incorporating samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics {{and the public}} throughout his musical career as being among the most idiosyncratically creative musicians of 1990s and 2000s alternative rock. Two of Beck's most popular and acclaimed recordings are Odelay and <b>Sea</b> <b>Change,</b> {{both of which were}} ranked on Rolling Stone list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The four-time platinum artist has collaborated with several artists and has made several contributions to soundtracks.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Ian Wood {{has suggested}} that Mellitus' journey through Gaul probably took in the bishoprics of Vienne, Arles, Lyons, Toulon, Marseilles, Metz, Paris, and Rouen, {{as evidenced by the}} letters that Gregory addressed to those bishops soliciting their support for Mellitus' party. Gregory also wrote to the Frankish kings Chlothar II, Theuderic II, Theudebert II, along with Brunhilda of Austrasia, who was Theudebert and Theuderic's grandmother and regent. Wood feels that this wide appeal to the Frankish episcopate and royalty was an effort to secure more support for the Gregorian mission. While on his journey to England, Mellitus received a letter from Gregory allowing Augustine to convert pagan temples to Christian churches, and to convert pagan animal sacrifices into Christian feasts, to ease the transition to Christianity. Gregory's letter marked a <b>sea</b> <b>change</b> in the missionary strategy, and was later included in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. Usually known as the Epistola ad Mellitum, it conflicts with the letter sent to Æthelberht, which the historian R. A. Markus sees as a turning point in missionary history, when forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view, that the Epistola represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht, has been challenged by the historian and theologian George Demacopoulos, who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the King in spiritual matters, while the Epistola was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other.|$|E

Beck would later produce an album for, and record with, Gainsbourg's daughter Charlotte.

25|$|For the record, much of Beck's {{trademark}} recondite and ironic lyrics {{were replaced}} by simpler, more sincere lyrical content. He also eschewed the heavy sampling of his previous albums for live instrumentation. When interviewed, Beck cited the breakup with his longtime girlfriend as the major influence on the album. <b>Sea</b> <b>Change</b> peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200, later being certified gold in March 2005 by the Recording Industry Association of America.|$|E

After Birkenfeld's award, the Swiss newspaper Blick claimed, “Birkenfeld was a blessing for the Swiss financial industry,” in that his revelations helped accelerate the industry's transition away from its reliance on “dirty” money by dooming the bank secrecy laws that enabled tax evasion.|$|E

The first challenge was a dull affair in which Hussein Onn was opposed by a minor party official named Sulaiman Palestin. In fact, in the early 1950s, Tunku Abdul Rahman's presidency had also been challenged by C. M. Yusof, who later became the Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat, but Tunku was not properly considered an incumbent then, being only a care-taker president.|$|E
500|$|Retailers {{initially}} {{predicted that}} the album would not receive much radio support, but they also believed that Beck's maverick reputation and critical acclaim, {{in addition to the}} possibility of multiple Grammy nominations, might offset Sea Changes noncommercial sound. <b>Sea</b> <b>Change,</b> issued by Geffen in September 2002, was regardless a commercial hit and critical darling, with Rolling Stone revering it as [...] "the best album Beck has ever made, [...] an impeccable album of truth and light from the end of love. This is his Blood on the Tracks." [...] The album was later listed by the magazine {{as one of the best}} records of the decade and of all-time, and it also placed second on the year's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. <b>Sea</b> <b>Change</b> yielded a low-key, theater-based acoustic tour, as well as a larger tour with The Flaming Lips as Beck's opening and backing band. Beck was playful and energetic, sometimes throwing in covers of The Rolling Stones, Big Star, The Zombies and The Velvet Underground.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Beck and his fiancée, stylist Leigh Limon, {{ended their}} nine-year relationship. Beck lapsed into {{a period of}} melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks later found on <b>Sea</b> <b>Change.</b> Beck sat on the songs, not wanting {{to talk about his}} {{personal}} life; he later said that he wanted to focus on music and [...] "not really strew my baggage across the public lobby". Eventually, however, he decided the songs spoke to a common experience (a relationship breakup), and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called producer Nigel Godrich.|$|E
