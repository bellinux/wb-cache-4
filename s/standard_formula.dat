5|$|Progressive pop {{is a form}} of {{pop music}} which {{attempts}} to break with the genre's <b>standard</b> <b>formula.</b> Originally termed for early progressive rock music, some stylistic features of progressive pop include changes in key and rhythm, experiments with larger forms, and unexpected, disruptive, or ironic treatments of past conventions. Performers commonly produce their own material while opposing the influence of managers, agents, or record companies.|$|E
5|$|Maneater {{is one of}} the few {{films in}} the series to break the <b>standard</b> <b>formula</b> of Syfy natural horror films with its use of a normal, living tiger rather than a CG animal or excusing its {{behavior}} by having it be a mutant or genetically altered. Critics heavily panned the film citing substandard acting, heavy use of stereotypical characters, a hole-filled plot, unused subplots, and the use of a live tiger resulting in almost all attacks being implied rather than seen.|$|E

As with previous games, the theme songs were sung by Tsuki Amano. When released, it became the best-selling entry in the series to that date, and received mixed to positive from Japanese and Western critics.|$|E

This was not treated as literally in the pilot and [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] as it was in later episodes.

Anderson herself denied that it was possible for a woman to be made a mason, but remained non-committal or downright enigmatic when questioned as to the origin of her extensive knowledge of Freemasonry. Born in Alsace in 1818, she was raised in Paris after her parents died by her uncle, a [...] "prominent mason". She met and married Captain Andrew Anderson in the 1840s, and settled in New Orleans, accompanying her husband on his coastal voyages in their own vessel, and managing their finances. They moved to Oakland, California in 1854, where Andrew became a respected businessman and an active mason. He died in 1867, leaving Salome a wealthy widow, who turned her fortune to helping masonic charities. She became the founding treasurer of Oak Leaf Chapter No 8 of the Order of the Eastern Star, and when a Masonic Temple was built, she became the largest stock-holder. In spite of opposition, she was elected to the board of trustees. In 1892, the Trestle Board published a biography of her as a prominent citizen and implied that she had acquired some degree of masonic knowledge from the masons meeting at the house of her uncle. The San Francisco News-Letter and Advertiser then embellished the story by saying that she [...] "claimed to be a mason", having cajoled the younger members of her uncle's lodge into clandestinely conferring the three Blue Lodge degrees on her. This story was rapidly picked up by the West Coast press, and various versions of the story were passed around. While she strenuously denied that she had come by her knowledge in an improper way, in subsequent interviews she refused to be drawn on the source of her masonic knowledge.

Hence, even if [...] "new matter" [...] were being generated to create new universes, this would not violate conservation of energy. Second, conservation of energy is not violated since the energy of each branch has to be weighted by its probability, according to the <b>standard</b> <b>formula</b> {{for the conservation of}} energy in quantum theory. This results in the total energy of the multiverse being conserved.|$|E
2500|$|A simple {{printing}} error for Shakespeare's initials, [...] "W.S." [...] or [...] "W. Sh". This {{was suggested}} by Bertrand Russell in his memoirs, {{and also by}} Foster and by Jonathan Bate. Bate supports his point by reading [...] "onlie" [...] as something like [...] "peerless", [...] "singular" [...] and [...] "begetter" [...] as [...] "maker", i.e. [...] "'writer". Foster takes [...] "onlie" [...] to mean only one, which he argues eliminates any particular subject of the poems, since they are addressed {{to more than one}} person. The phrase [...] "Our Ever-Living Poet", according to Foster, refers to God, not Shakespeare. [...] "Poet" [...] comes from the Greek [...] "poetes" [...] which means [...] "maker", a fact remarked upon in various contemporary texts; also, in Elizabethan English the word [...] "maker" [...] was used to mean [...] "poet". These researchers believe the phrase [...] "our ever-living poet" [...] might easily have been taken to mean [...] "our immortal maker" [...] (God). The [...] "eternity" [...] promised us by our immortal maker would then be the eternal life that is promised us by God, and the dedication would conform with the <b>standard</b> <b>formula</b> of the time, according to which one person wished another [...] "happiness [...] and eternal bliss [...] ". Shakespeare himself, on this reading, is [...] "Mr. W. H."
