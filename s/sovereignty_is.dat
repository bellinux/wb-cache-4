5|$|Whatever Coke's meaning, {{after an}} initial period during which his {{decision}} enjoyed some support but no statutes were declared void, Bonham's Case was thrown aside, in favour of the growing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. In {{one of the most}} prominent early treatises supporting the doctrine, William Blackstone wrote that Parliament is the sovereign lawmaker, preventing the common law courts from throwing aside or reviewing statutes in the fashion that Coke had suggested. Parliamentary <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> now the accepted judicial doctrine in the legal system of England and Wales.|$|E
25|$|The Isle of Man {{and the two}} bailiwicks of the Channel Islands are Crown dependencies; that is, non-sovereign nations, self-governing {{but whose}} <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> held by the British Crown. They control their own {{internal}} affairs, but not their defence or foreign relations. They {{are not part of}} the United Kingdom or part of the European Union.|$|E
25|$|The Niue Constitution Act vests {{executive}} {{authority in}} Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand and the Governor-General of New Zealand. The Constitution specifies that in everyday practice <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> exercised by the Niue Cabinet of Ministers, {{composed of the}} premier and three other ministers. The premier and ministers {{are members of the}} Niue Legislative Assembly, the nation's parliament.|$|E

50|$|The Royal Statute {{was not a}} Constitution because, amongst other reasons, National <b>sovereignty</b> <b>was</b> not {{derived from}} it. Instead, Absolute <b>Sovereignty</b> <b>was</b> {{invested}} in the Monarch who could limit or extend their own powers at will, following {{the model of the}} Monarchy of the Bourbon Restoration in France of Louis XVIII of France.|$|R

25|$|In 1244 and 1245 the Cistercian general chapter had {{determined}} that a monastery of nuns could {{be incorporated into the}} Cistercian Order only if the competent bishop and the competent cathedral chapter exempted the community's temporalities and spiritualities from their control. However, such a wide-ranging exemption from their <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> exactly what Bremen's cathedral chapter and the prince-archbishop did not want, as is described below.|$|E
25|$|Maine {{has several}} unique {{geographical}} features. Machias Seal Island and North Rock, off its easternmost point, are claimed {{by both the}} U.S. and Canada and are within one of four areas {{between the two countries}} whose <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> still in dispute, but it {{is the only one of}} the disputed areas containing land. Also in this easternmost area in the Bay of Fundy is the Old Sow, the largest tidal whirlpool in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{parliament}} were {{also concerned about}} the timing. Some expressed disgust at the timing of the bill just before the centenary of the Gallipoli landing, some said the process was rushed, and Louisa Wall said that no significant event had occurred to warrant a flag change at this time. Nándor Tánczos noted a common perception that removing a symbol of British sovereignty from the flag before constitutionally removing British <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> tokenistic.|$|E
50|$|Hong Kong was a Dependent Territory of the UK {{until its}} <b>sovereignty</b> <b>was</b> {{handed over to}} the PRC in 1997, while Macau was a Special Territory of Portugal until its <b>sovereignty</b> <b>was</b> {{handed over to the}} PRC in 1999. Before the {{transfers}} of sovereignty back to the PRC, the Hong Kong--Guangdong and Macau-Guangdong borders were regarded as international borders.|$|R

25|$|While the Zionist {{movement}} was not founded during his lifetime, {{it is clear}} from his responses to Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer, and in several places in his commentary to the Bible and Siddur, that although he had a deep love for the Land of Israel, he opposed a movement to wrest political independence for the Land of Israel before the Messianic Era. In later works, he makes it clear that Jewish <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> dependent only on Divine Providence.|$|E
25|$|Arendt {{argues that}} the {{consistent}} mistreatment of refugees, {{most of whom were}} placed in internment camps, is evidence against the existence of human rights. If the notion of human rights as universal and inalienable is to be taken seriously, they must be realizable given the features of the modern liberal state. Arendt contends that they are not realizable because they are in tension with at least one feature of the liberal state, national sovereignty. One of the primary ways in which a nation exercises <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> through control over national borders. State governments consistently grant their citizens free movement to traverse national borders. In contrast, the movement of refugees is often restricted in the name of national interests. This presents a dilemma for liberalism in that liberal theorists are typically committed to both human rights and the existence of sovereign nations.|$|E
500|$|Japan is a {{constitutional}} monarchy. The Emperor is a ceremonial figurehead and {{is defined by}} the constitution as [...] "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people". Executive power is wielded chiefly by the Prime Minister and his cabinet. <b>Sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> vested in the Japanese people.|$|E

500|$|Lord Brockway, {{head of the}} Movement for Colonial Freedom, {{believed}} that Rhodesia was attempting to assert de facto independence {{in the eyes of}} the international community by deliberately defying Britain over the Lisbon issue. [...] "If Salisbury is permitted to claim diplomatic rights in foreign capitals, its assertion of <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> accepted," [...] he wrote in an article for the British democratic socialist weekly Tribune.|$|E
500|$|Lord Hope {{also argued}} that Parliament should {{not be able to}} pass {{legislation}} that [...] "is so absurd or so unacceptable that the populace at large refuses to recognise it as law". [...] Jeffrey Jowell suggests that these comments were influenced by Lord Hope's position as a Law Lord from Scotland, where it is unclear whether Parliamentary <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> recognised following MacCormick v Lord Advocate, in which the doctrine was seen as [...] "a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law".|$|E
500|$|Parliamentary <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> {{no longer}}, {{if it ever}} was, {{absolute}} ... It is no longer {{right to say that}} its freedom to legislate admits of no qualification whatever. Step by step, gradually but surely, the English principle of the absolute legislative sovereignty of Parliament ... is being qualified ... The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based. The fact that your Lordships have been willing to hear this appeal and to give judgment upon it is another indication that the courts have a part to play in defining the limits of Parliament's legislative sovereignty.|$|E

500|$|Whatever Coke's meaning, {{after an}} initial period of application, Bonham's Case was thrown aside in favour of the growing {{doctrine}} of Parliamentary sovereignty. Initially written down by William Blackstone, this theory makes Parliament the sovereign law-maker, preventing the common law courts from not only throwing aside but also reviewing statutes in the fashion Coke suggested. Parliamentary <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> now the universally-accepted judicial doctrine in England and Wales. Bonham's Case met a mixed reaction at the time, with the King and Lord Ellesmere both deeply unhappy with it. Nineteenth and twentieth-century academics are scarcely more favourable, calling it [...] "a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially", and an [...] "abortion".|$|E
500|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{doctrine}} of parliamentary sovereignty, Coke's theory gradually died out; William Blackstone, in the first edition of his Commentaries on the Laws of England, wrote that [...] "if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power that can control it: and the examples alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them prove, that where the main object of a statute is unreasonable the judges are at liberty to reject it; for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government". Parliamentary <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> now upheld by the English judiciary as a [...] "central principle of British constitutionalism" [...] despite with some issues by membership in the European Union. The case's modern irrelevance is such that Philip Hamburger wrote in 2008, [...] "Bonham's Case scarcely deserves mention in a history of judicial duty, except for reasons that are now largely forgotten".|$|E
500|$|The third chapter, [...] "The Argument", details James Madison's {{efforts to}} secure a strong federal {{government}} at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Madison fails to win approval for a national government that can veto state laws, and initially considers the convention a failure. Instead the Constitution creates a political system in which <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> shared and [...] "blurred", providing a framework for ongoing debate. Madison emphasizes this advantage, {{as well as the}} weakness of the prior Articles of Confederation government during the Revolutionary War, to defeat Anti-Federalist orator Patrick Henry in a debate over Virginia's ratification of the Constitution. Chapter Four, [...] "The Treaty", considers Washington's failure as president to reach an equitable settlement with Native Americans, with particular consideration to his treaty with Creek leader Alexander McGillivray. Though Washington declares the issue one of his highest priorities and successfully negotiates a treaty, it proves worthless {{in the face of the}} relentless expansion of white settlers into Creek territory, the intransigence of the Georgian legislature, and McGillivray's attempts to ally with Spain. Ellis calls the inability to make a fair peace with Native Americans [...] "the greatest failure of the revolutionary generation", second only to their failure to end slavery.|$|E

50|$|Over {{a hundred}} years after Spanish <b>Sovereignty</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1570, Caramoran was founded as a town in 1676 {{side by side with}} the Catholic Church.|$|R
500|$|In {{a meeting}} with the 1919 King–Crane Commission, sent by the United States (US) to gauge {{national}} sentiment in greater Syria, Quwatli rejected the notion of an American military presence in Syria, telling Crane that [...] "Reduction of <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> non-negotiable" [...] and instead suggesting that the US help Syrians to [...] "build their state and live in peace on their land." [...] Nevertheless, French forces had already started landing on the Syrian coast in 1919 to enforce the Sykes–Picot Agreement whereby France and the UK would divide up the former Arab territories of the Ottoman Empire between themselves. In March 1920, the League of Nations granted France a mandate over Syria and Lebanon, and in response Emir Faisal declared himself king of Syria on 8 March 1920. When King Faisal refused to accept the mandate, the French marched on Damascus. Yusuf al-'Azma, minister of defense at the time, led a small force and met the French at the Battle of Maysalun on 23 July 1920. The battle ended in a decisive victory for the French, and the next day French forces occupied Damascus. King Faisal was deported to Europe, and the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon was officially declared.|$|E
500|$|J. C. Jenkins, Second Parliamentary Counsel at the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, has {{expressed}} some approval at the decision. Firstly, {{he claims that}} it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to Pepper, draftsmanship was a [...] "time consuming" [...] and [...] "frustrating rather than enlightening" [...] business. There are risks of [...] "excessive detail, over-elaboration, verbosity, prolixity, iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that [...] "sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed {{that no one would}} take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called Pepper a [...] "long overdue" [...] decision from [...] "which there is no turning back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where parliamentary <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|Article 27 states [...] "Let {{any person}} who may usurp the {{sovereignty}} be instantly put to death by free men." [...] Though the usurpation of <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> not detailed, <b>sovereignty</b> <b>is</b> explained in article 25 as residing [...] "in the people". There {{is no doubt that}} this way of thinking deeply influenced the revolutionary government during the Terror.|$|E
25|$|The answer, he said, would largely {{depend on}} the way in which <b>sovereignty</b> <b>was</b> said to have been acquired. He {{observed}} that although the legal authorities claimed that <b>sovereignty</b> over Australia <b>was</b> acquired by occupation, the country was not vacant, but already occupied; nor had it been conquered or ceded under a treaty. Rather, Judge Willis said, <b>sovereignty</b> <b>was</b> actually acquired under the principle expounded by Vattel in his The Law of Nations, referred to by both the prosecution and the defence, that a 'civilised' people may take possession of territory occupied by 'uncivilised' people, provided they leave for them sufficient land for their sustenance.|$|R
50|$|Associated with Switzerland's independence, Wettstein's name {{first became}} {{prominent}} around 1750, and reached its zenith during World War II, when the country's <b>sovereignty</b> <b>was</b> challenged once more.|$|R
50|$|In Mindanao and Sulu, a {{continuous}} fight for <b>sovereignty</b> <b>was</b> {{sustained by the}} Moro people and their allies for the whole duration of Spanish conquest and rule.|$|R
