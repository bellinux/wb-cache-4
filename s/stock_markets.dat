5|$|In {{preparation}} for the oncoming hurricane, the weather forecast office in New Orleans began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches and advisories for the storm on August23. The first storm warnings were issued for areas of the United States Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Matagorda, Texas at 10:30 p.m CDT (0430UTC) that day, indicating an approaching system with considerable intensity. As the hurricane unexpectedly recurved to the north the next day, the previously issued storm warning was shifted eastward to include areas from Morgan City, Louisiana to Galveston, Texas, while a hurricane warning was issued by the weather forecast office for areas between Morgan City and Mobile, Alabama at 10:00p.m. CDT (0400UTC). A storm warning was also placed for areas east of Mobile to Apalachicola, Florida. After the hurricane rapidly weakened over land, warnings and advisories from the New Orleans weather office related to the storm were discontinued by 9:00p.m. (0500UTC) on August25. The warnings were communicated to potentially affected areas via mail, telegraph, {{and other forms of}} communication. During the time that the hurricane was approaching the coast, the United States Weather Bureau also began experimentally transmitting surface weather analysis maps to ships by radio. Small craft offshore of Mobile were recalled to the Port of Mobile, while floating dock property was removed in New Orleans. Due to the potential affects of the hurricane on the cotton industry, cotton <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> reported gains of eight to fifteenpoints from the first trades, with stock prices closing with a net gain as high as 24points.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore the causal link between <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> {{development}} and economic growth in Zimbabwe using annual time series data for the period 1980 to 2008. The study evaluated the nature of the relationship between <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> development and economic growth in Zimbabwe. The <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> development was measured using two variables namely <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> size as measured by <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> capitalization as a ratio of GDP and <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> turnover as measured by the value of stocks traded as a ratio of <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> capitalisation. The study utilised advanced econometric techniques of Unit Root Tests, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Granger Causality Tests to explore the relationships. The empirical results showed a uni-directional causal link that runs from <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> development to economic growth and there is evidence of an indirect transmission mechanism through the effect of <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> development on investment. </p...|$|R

The study confirms the presence of autocorrelation in the Indian <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> and macro economic variables which implies that the market fell into form of Efficient Market Hypothesis. Further the Granger-causality test shows evidence of bidirectional relationship between interest rate and <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> exchange rate and <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> international <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> and BSE volume, exchange rate and BSE volume.

40|$|When <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> risk, or volatility, increases, risk-averse investors tend {{to reduce}} their holding of {{equities}} relative to safe assets such as Treasury bills.
