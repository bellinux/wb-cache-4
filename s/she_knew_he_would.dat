25|$|Yates {{confessed to}} {{drowning}} her children. Prior to her second trial, she told Dr. Michael Welner that {{she waited for}} Rusty to leave for work that morning before filling the bathtub because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have prevented her from harming them. After the murders, police found the family dog locked up; Rusty advised Welner that it had normally been allowed to run free, and was so when {{he had left the}} house that morning, leading the psychiatrist to allege that she locked it in a cage to prevent it from interfering with her killing the children one by one. Rusty got a family friend, George Parnham, to act as her attorney.|$|E
25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has {{all the time in the}} world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E
2500|$|Fitz-Partington {{arrives with}} news of a new plan by Smailey: he plans to prosecute Mrs. Van Brugh for bigamy, having refused to believe her, and, to that end, has advertised for Captain Van Brugh's first wife's burial certificate. Mrs. Van Brugh is roused to anger by this, and {{declares}} that she will [...] "be punished no further". [...] Fitz-Partington leaves. Dr. Athelney announces the imminent arrival of his son and Fred, and Eve runs to Fred, crying that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come. He declares himself unable to control his father. He says he had lain awake all night, {{trying to think of}} how to lighten the burden on Eve and, finally, came to realise what he must do: Release her from her engagement to {{a member of the family}} that has been so hard on her. Eve faints. Dr. Athelney begins berating him and declares that [...] "I have been a clergyman of the Church of England for five and forty years, and, until today, I have never regretted the restrictions that my calling has imposed upon me. [...] My hands, sir, are tied. Ted, my boy, these remarks do not apply to you." [...] Ted seizes Fred and berates him. Mrs. Van Brugh asks Dr. Athenley to stop Ted, but Dr. Athelney is [...] "too fond of plain truth, and hears it far too seldom to stop it when he does hear it." ...|$|E
50|$|Stitch {{is having}} a {{nightmare}} about turning bad again and causing destruction to Earth, including hurting Lilo. After Stitch wakes up, Lilo comforts him by telling him <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never cause harm to her. Lilo also tests his goodness level by having him do a few good deeds. Discovering that they are late for hula class, they use their hovercraft to get there.|$|R
50|$|When they arrive, {{however, the}} {{suspicious}} natives will {{not touch the}} cursed bottle. Kokua determines to make a supreme sacrifice to save her husband from his fate. Since, however, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never sell the bottle to her knowingly, Kokua is forced to bribe an old sailor to buy the bottle for four centimes, {{with the understanding that}} she will secretly buy it back for three. Now Keawe is happy, but she carries the curse.|$|R
60|$|She {{moved to}} the {{entrance}} of the shelter to look for Tarzan. He was gone; but this time no fear assailed her for <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> return.|$|R
2500|$|Zelena and Hook {{are both}} {{chained to the}} wall in Emma’s basement, as Zelena thinks Emma is {{preparing}} a spell to take her magic. Emma says she’s giving her dark magic to Zelena. Hook asks why keep it a secret, and {{she says that she}} did this because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> want to stop her. She says the dark magic must be put into a vessel, and then Emma will cut her down. Emma says that’s why she needed the baby out. She reminds him that Zelena killed Marian and Neal, but Hook says that it’s still [...] "cold-blooded murder." [...] Hook says Merlin must have a better solution, but she says that he can’t help them anymore. Hook asks what happened to Merlin, and he asks her again why she’s really doing this. Mary asks David and Regina how Emma can use Zelena to end dark magic, but they can't figure it out. Regina says no one hurts her sister except for her and tells them she’s going to show Emma what dark magic is really like. Mary Margaret and David argue with Regina over going to war with Emma. Regina says Emma gave her the dagger because they knew {{she was the only one}} who could act. Emma comes out and says when she’s done with Zelena, they will all be better off. Regina says that his is not right, but Emma says she knows Regina will be happier when Zelena is gone. Emma uses Excalibur to freeze them, while putting up a magic barrier around the house.|$|E
60|$|So she {{understood}} his moral attitude, at least, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> act accordingly.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} Clementina watched for the {{vice-consul}} from her balcony. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not send; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come; but it, was nearly noon before {{she saw him}} coming. They caught sight of each other almost at the same moment, and he stood up in his boat, and waved something white in his hand, which must be a dispatch for her.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless {{she allowed}} him to return alone to the house, where <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> find her girl. [...] "Kate," [...] he said, going into the parlour {{in which she was}} sitting idle at the window,--"dear Kate." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do it. Yet {{her eyes}} {{suddenly}} beamed {{with a new}} and awakening light; she put back her hair again, and half raised herself upon the pillow, to gaze at his dark, set face.|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} a {{deceptive}} argument. Brand would stay at Allenwood if she wished. Indeed, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> make many a sacrifice to please her if she married him. She must look for a better reason.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Morel fretted {{after her}} son. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{not like the}} army. He did not. The {{discipline}} was intolerable to him.|$|E
6000|$|And as beside its doorway, [...] Deadly hued, [...] One inside, one withoutside [...] We two stood, He came--my husband--as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b>|$|E
60|$|Presently Gerald {{opened the}} door. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{not be long}} before he came. She was rarely alone, he pressed upon her like a frost, {{deadening}} her.|$|E
60|$|Stormont {{examined}} the register, and then stood by his chair {{with his fist}} clenched. He said nothing, his supporters looked embarrassed, and Agatha saw that Thirlwell had saved the situation. Her heart beat with confused emotion; <b>she</b> had <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not fail her.|$|R
50|$|Elsewhere, Admiral Adama {{has another}} meeting with Roslin. He {{brings up a}} past {{conversation}} of hers where she said that if they'd have stayed on New Caprica, she would have found a nice secluded place to build a cabin. She says Baltar's inept leadership and New Caprica's terrain {{would have made it}} too difficult. She wonders however, if the Cylons had never returned, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have eventually left Galactica to settle down himself. He evades the question saying it would have been irrelevant anyway. The image of Carolanne returns to his thoughts who tells him that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have eventually. As Adama leaves, Roslin says she would have indeed built the cabin.|$|R
60|$|She thought Percy must soon {{be coming}} this way. Though {{it was so}} late, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not go to bed. After {{the events of the}} night, his ruling passion, strong in death, would be holding him in its thrall.|$|R
60|$|Gyp {{could feel}} his wicked old smile even before she raised herself. But {{what did it matter}} if he did guess? <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> keep a stable secret.|$|E
6000|$|Oh <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> know it. But she {{had brought}} it on herself--or almost. Yet she spoke with kindness. [...] "I think I want {{not to be too}} much worried." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she dared}} {{not make a}} light, because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wake, {{and she did not}} want to break his perfect sleep, that she knew he had got of her.|$|E
60|$|But he felt {{responsible}} and bound {{to get his}} uncle Silas free; and he told Aunt Sally, the last thing, not to worry, because {{he was going to}} turn in and work night and day and beat this game and fetch Uncle Silas out innocent; and she was very loving to him and thanked him and said <b>she</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do his very best. And she told us to help Benny take care {{of the house and the}} children, and then we had a good-bye cry all around and went back to the farm, and left her there to live with the jailer's wife a month till the trial in October.|$|R
6000|$|The {{inquiries}} {{were addressed}} to Miss Fanny, who graciously replied {{that she would}} be beyond anything interested and enchanted. Mrs Gowan went to a door, looked in beyond it, and came back. 'Do Henry the favour to come in,' said <b>she,</b> 'I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be pleased!' ...|$|R
5000|$|The doctor {{questions}} Abigail Adams if she {{has asked}} her husband regarding the family's smallpox inoculation (variolation) of 1775; <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> approve without asking him because he himself was inoculated in 1764, so the doctor's question and her response were misleading.|$|R
60|$|She ran to him {{and caught}} him to her heart. In the {{reaction}} of her feeling she was half laughing, half crying. All was well again--all would be well; she never doubted this, for <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> keep his ungracious promise sacredly.|$|E
60|$|Birkin went away, {{his manner}} cold and abstracted. But <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{do things for}} her, nevertheless, he would see her through. She smiled {{slightly}} to herself, with contempt. Let him do the work, since he was so extremely GOOD at looking after other people.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him, aware of {{pleasure}} in the sight. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> dare it, but she knew also {{that it would be}} unfair. St. Vincent had had his chance, and it was not right that further sacrifice should be made. [...] "No, Vance. It is too late. Nothing can be done." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} see him, but she felt the beloved {{presence}} there, somewhere close to her, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wish her to wait.... She watched him silently... ready to help if he called... equally ready to remain still and to wait.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{the fourth}} day that Meriem began {{definitely}} to give up hope. Something had happened to Korak. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> it. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> never come now, and these men would take her far away. Presently they would kill her. She would never see her Korak again.|$|R
60|$|But he had {{the knife}} stuck into him. <b>She</b> had <b>known</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do it, and now he had done it.|$|R
60|$|The {{beautiful}} {{lady with}} the silvery hair sat and gazed on him admiringly. She {{knew she could}} trust him; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> keep it in. But she knew {{at the same time}} how desperate a struggle the effort cost him; and visionary though he was, she loved and admired him for it.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few more}} months she must leave her brother's house and {{transfer}} to another the care and thought she had given him. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> miss her, and now and then she wondered anxiously whether any other woman could understand and help him as she had done. Craig had faults and he needed indulging.|$|E
60|$|She {{would have}} stayed here for hours longer, talking to that absent personality, {{powerful}} and mysterious more than ever now, listening to the rugged voice which she would never hear again. But {{there was something that}} she must do ere she gave herself over finally to her dreams; there was a duty to accomplish which <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ask of her.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} in his voice which fully bore out what he had said, but Benicia was aware that {{it was she who}} had forced the admission from him without his quite realizing its significance. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> speak more plainly still if she kept her eyes on him.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} touched, for {{he belonged to}} the cities, and had {{nothing in common with}} the rocky wilds, but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> keep his word and indulge her generously. Nor was she {{offended}} by the touch of commercial spirit, though she <b>would</b> rather <b>he</b> had offered something that would cost him effort of body or mind.|$|R
50|$|The film {{opens at}} a Rotary Club {{function}} to honour a retired Justice Jyotin Chatterjee. The judge has served the profession {{all his life}} with honour and spotless integrity. As {{he is about to}} retire, he recognises there will now be a void in his life. His wife remarks to reporters that neither <b>he</b> nor <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do after <b>he</b> retires.|$|R
