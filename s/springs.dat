5|$|Fossil <b>Springs,</b> {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the <b>springs,</b> it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot <b>springs</b> such as Mammoth Hot <b>Springs</b> in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E
