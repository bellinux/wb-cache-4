5|$|On 6 October 2014, Key {{created a}} new ministerial {{portfolio}} called the Minister of National Security and Intelligence to serve the newly established Cabinet National Security Committee. The Prime Minister assumed the new portfolio while the Attorney General Christopher Finlayson became Minister Responsible for the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) and Minister in Charge of the New Zealand <b>Security</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Service (NZSIS), portfolios which have traditionally been held by a prime minister.|$|E
5|$|The ASD also {{includes}} the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) {{which is responsible for}} protecting Defence and other Australian Government agencies against cyberwarfare attacks. The ACSC was established in January 2010 and is jointly staffed by the DSD and personnel from the Attorney-General's Department, Australian <b>Security</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Organisation, and Australian Federal Police. Unlike the United States military, the ADF does not class cyberwarfare as being a separate sphere of warfare. In July 2017 an Information Warfare Division was raised, tasked with both defensive and offensive cyber operations.|$|E
5|$|The Australian <b>Security</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Organisation (ASIO) {{opened a}} file on Burhop in 1948, believing {{him to be}} a secret member of the Communist Party of Australia, and an {{associate}} of Ian Milner, who was known through Venona intercepts to have passed secret documents to the Soviet Union. In July 1951, the British government cancelled his passport when he accepted an offer to travel to the Soviet Union. A new passport was issued after he gave the Foreign Secretary a written assurance that he would not seek to travel to the Soviet Union or other Iron Curtain countries.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Security</b> and <b>Intelligence</b> Agency (Sigurnosno-obavještajna agencija or SOA) is the Croatian <b>security</b> and <b>intelligence</b> service {{founded in}} 2006 upon {{the passing of}} the <b>Security</b> and <b>Intelligence</b> System of the Republic of Croatia Act and by {{combining}} the former Counterintelligence Agency (POA), and the Intelligence Agency (OA) which both ceased to operate.|$|R
50|$|To {{facilitate}} the {{cooperation between the}} Croatian President and the Prime Minister in directing <b>security</b> and <b>intelligence</b> services operations, the National Security Council was founded. Furthermore, {{in order for the}} operative coordination of the <b>security</b> and <b>intelligence</b> services operations to be realized, the Council for Coordination of <b>Security</b> and <b>Intelligence</b> Agencies was founded. The Office of the National Security Council was founded for the purpose of performing expert and administrative operations for the National Security Council and the Council for Coordination of <b>Security</b> and <b>Intelligence</b> Agencies.|$|R
5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, <b>security,</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and national interests made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult. A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as a positive sign of co-operation. Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} <b>Security</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 Serong {{served as}} General Staff Officer 2 with the {{combined}} 6th and 7th Divisions on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland, {{where they were}} resting and retraining prior to conducting further operations. In early 1944 he instructed on the staff course at Cabarlah. That August, he moved to Aitape {{to prepare for the}} deployment of the 6th Division. He was later attached to American forces for the landing on Morotai Island in the Netherlands East Indies in mid-September 1944. In the last few weeks of the war, Serong was mentioned in despatches for his actions fighting the Japanese at Wewak, whilst serving with the infantry in the 35th Battalion. During an incident on 21 July 1945, he commanded a force of three platoons and native police on a patrol to destroy a Japanese ammunition dump. Although serving more time in training roles than in combat, during the war Serong had made important contacts with whom he would later work in future postings, including Colonel Reg Pollard, who went on to become Chief of the General Staff (CGS), and Colonel Charles Spry, later the Director of Military Intelligence and the Director General of the Australian <b>Security</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Organisation (ASIO).|$|E

25|$|The Labor Government was {{defeated}} at the December 1949 federal election, and in March 1950 {{the new prime}} minister, Robert Menzies, appointed the Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, Charles Spry, as the second Director-General of Security, commencing on 9 July 1950. Wake resigned shortly after Spry's appointment. On 6 July 1950, a Directive of Prime Minister Menzies set out the Charter of the Australian <b>Security</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Organization, which expanded on Chifley's 1949 Directive. ASIO was converted to a statutory body on 13 December 1956 by the Australian <b>Security</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Organisation Act 1956 (repealed by the Australian <b>Security</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Organisation Act 1979, the current legislation as amended to 2007).

25|$|The Australian Government assumed {{responsibility}} {{for national security}} and intelligence on Federation in 1901, and took over various state agencies and had to rationalise their functions. There was considerable overlap between the civil and military authorities. Similarly, there was also no Commonwealth agency responsible for enforcing federal laws. At the outbreak of World War I, no Australian government agency was dedicated to <b>security,</b> <b>intelligence</b> or law enforcement. The organisation of <b>security</b> <b>intelligence</b> in Australia took on more urgency with a perceived threat posed by agents provocateurs, fifth columnists and saboteurs within Australia.|$|E
