25|$|In {{the center}} of {{downtown}} is the Church of San Francisco, finished {{at the beginning of}} the 18th century and from then on the most important in town, serving as the cathedral until the 20th century. It and the attached cloister is all that is left of a large complex that included several chapels and an orchard that extended for blocks to the east and south. On the facade, there is a depicting of Saint James fighting the Moors, cutting the head off of one. The main altar is Neoclassic, and replaced what reputedly was a masterpiece of Baroque design. This has happened frequently in the city; those Baroque altars not plundered over the course of Mexican history were replaced by newer designs. Older Baroque side altarpieces are <b>still</b> <b>here,</b> and are covered in gold leaf. Other notable pieces here include a large Baroque music stand and the seating of the choir section both done by architect Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras of Celaya in the 18th century. There are also sculptures done by Mariano Montenegro and Mariano Arce.|$|E
25|$|The detective {{enters and}} talks with Serena {{and her friends}} about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny {{knowledge}} of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed {{in the presence of}} their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one <b>still</b> <b>here.</b> He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York ("There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.|$|E

500|$|According to Gaga, Bennett {{wanted her}} to sing {{different}} songs and was impressed by her vocals during [...] "Lush Life", referring to the Billy Strayhorn written standard that has been recorded by everyone from Nancy Wilson and Sarah Vaughan to Donna Summer and Linda Ronstadt. Gaga explained that she was nervous about recording with Bennett. [...] "I just wanted him to hear I have an authentic jazz voice and that I studied that... If he can hear that, I'm okay. If he can't hear it, I'm not an authentic jazz voice", she added. Inspiration for singing came from jazz singer Amy Winehouse, who died in July 2011; Gaga added [...] "I thought of her almost {{every day in the}} studio.

500|$|Communications between 3 RAR and Brigade Headquarters {{had failed}} early, while {{those with the}} forward {{companies}} were also poor. This was mostly due to {{the large number of}} South Koreans retreating through their position tearing out the line from the Command Post, as well the effect of heavy vehicle traffic and gunfire on the exposed line. Likewise, direct radio communication with the forward companies on the battalion command net with the new Type 31 VHF radios was obstructed by the rugged terrain due to the sitting of Battalion Headquarters in low ground relative to the forward companies and the requirement for line-of-sight. The forward companies were able to maintain communications with each other, but not with Battalion Headquarters, while the company level nets also functioned well. Ultimately contact was maintained between Ferguson and Burke through a radio set in the Middlesex Battalion Headquarters, while messages to the forward companies relied on line and a slow relay through C Company. These issues had only further complicated the conduct of the defence on the first night, with the co-ordination of the forward battle falling to O'Dowd. The next morning, O'Dowd finally managed to get through on a radio phone to a general in the US 1st Marine Division. The officer was incredulous, thinking it was a Chinese agent speaking. He told O'Dowd that the unit no longer existed and that it had been wiped out the night before. O'Dowd replied [...] "I've got news for you. We're <b>still</b> <b>here</b> and we're staying here." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{deciding}} Game 7 of the 2015 Finals {{was scheduled}} to be played at 7:00 PM on April 30, 2015 at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, Ontario. The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain and I looked in and there they were. They were <b>still</b> <b>here</b> working out. So they had been here for a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A couple of them kicked me and tried to take swings at me. And my players were there and they came to my rescue {{to be able to get}} me up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation." [...] By the time they arrived at the WFCU Centre, however, the fighting was over and the Rainmen players had already reached their team bus.|$|E

500|$|The {{record is}} highly {{regarded}} {{among the members}} of U2. Mullen said, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} record. I was very proud of it. Its success was by no means preordained. It was a real break from what we had done before and we didn't know if our fans would like it or not." [...] Bono called the album a [...] "pivot point" [...] in the band's career, saying, [...] "Making Achtung Baby is the reason we're <b>still</b> <b>here</b> now." [...] Clayton concurred, saying, [...] "If we hadn't done something we were excited about, that made us apprehensive and challenged everything we stood for, then there would really have been no reason to carry on... If it hadn't been a great record by our standards, the existence of the band would have been threatened." [...] The group's reinvention occurred at the peak of the alternative rock movement, when the genre was achieving widespread mainstream popularity. Bill Flanagan pointed out that many of U2's 1980s contemporaries struggled commercially with albums released after the turn of the decade. He argued that U2, however, were able to take advantage of the alternative rock movement and ensure a successful future by [...] "set themselves up as the first of the new groups rather than the last of the old". Toby Creswell echoed these sentiments in his 2006 music reference book 1001 Songs, writing that the album helped U2 avoid [...] "becoming parodies of themselves and being swept aside by the grunge and techno revolutions". AllMusic called the album [...] "a pivotal moment for dance-rock, happening late in the game but showing that even the biggest young band in the world had an eye on the dancefloor". A 2010 retrospective by Spin said that [...] "U2 became the emblematic band of the alternative-rock era with Achtung Baby." ...|$|E
