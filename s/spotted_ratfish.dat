50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> can {{be found}} in the {{north-eastern}} Pacific Ocean, ranging from Alaska to Baja California with an isolated population in the Gulf of California. They are abundant in much of their range. They be found most commonly off the Pacific Northwest. The range of depths in which this fish is found extends from 0 to(-) 913 m below sea level, but it is most common between 50 and(-) 400 m. <b>Spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> typically live closer to the shore in the northern part of the range than in the southern, but it is also known as shallow as 30 m off California. <b>Spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> tend to move closer to shallow water during the spring and autumn, then to deeper water in summer and winter. For most of the year they prefer temperatures between 7.2 and(-) 8.9 C, but seasonally they do move into slightly warmer water. <b>Spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> can most commonly be found living near the bottom of sand, mud or rocky reefs of the ocean floor. Unlike most of its relatives, which are entirely restricted to deep waters, the <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> has been held in public aquaria. It has also been bred in such aquaria, where two of the main issues are the requirement of low light and temperature (generally kept at 8 - 12 C).|$|E

50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> (Hydrolagus colliei) is a {{chimaera}} {{found in}} the north-eastern Pacific Ocean. Often seen by divers {{at night in the}} Pacific Northwest, this cartilaginous fish gets its characteristic name from a pointed rat-like tail. The ratfish lays leathery egg cases on the bottom of muddy or sandy areas which are often mistaken by divers as something inanimate. While mainly a deep-water species, it occurs at shallower depths {{in the northern part of}} its range. The generic name, Hydrolagus, comes from the Greek words ὕδωρ, meaning water, and λαγώς/λαγῶς, meaning hare, and the specific name honors Alexander Collie, who was a ship surgeon and early naturalist. The <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> is common in much of its range, not typically eaten by humans (the flesh is bland with an unpleasant aftertaste) and is not commercially caught.|$|E
50|$|They {{are found}} in {{temperate}} and tropical marine waters worldwide. Most species are restricted to depths below 200 m, but a few, notably the <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> and rabbit fish, can locally be found at relatively shallow depths. They range from 38 to 150 cm in maximum total length, depending on species.|$|E

Both {{the upper and lower}} teeth are plate shaped (9). Of note, the <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> does not have a cartilaginous appendage to the fronto-nasal region (2) which a common feature of the Chimera.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> {{has a very}} {{distinct}} appearance {{compared to}} unrelated fish species. The female is up to 38 in long, {{much bigger than the}} male. These fish have a smooth and scaless skin that is a silvery-bronze color, often with sparkling shades of gold, blue, and green. The speckled white spots along their back contribute to their name. Dark edges outline both the caudal and dorsal fins, whereas, the pectoral fins have a transparent outline. The ratfish’s pectoral fins are large and triangular, and extend straight out from the sides of their bodies like airplane wings. They have a venomous spine located at the leading edge of their dorsal fin, which is used in defense. It does not present a serious danger to humans, but can cause painful wounds and has been known to kill harbor seals that ate <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> (caused by the spine penetrating vital tissue in the stomach or esophagus after the ratfish was swallowed). The tail of the ratfish constitutes almost half of their overall length and closely resembles a pointed rat-like tail. The body of this fish is supported by cartilage rather than bone. It has a duckbill shaped snout and a rabbit-like face. The mouth is small and contains one pair of forward directed, incisor-shaped teeth in the bottom jaw and two pairs in the top jaw. Unlike sharks who have sharp teeth that are easily replaceable, the <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> teeth are plate shaped, mineralized and permanent which assist them in grinding their prey. Like many bony fishes but unlike its sister group, the elasmobranchii, the upper jaw of the chimaera is fused with the skull. Although their jaws are soft and mouths are relatively small, they have the largest biting force and jaw leverage found within the holocephali which supports their ability to consume the prey that they do. One of their most mesmerizing features is their large emerald green eyes which are able to reflect light, similar to eyes of a cat.|$|E
50|$|Chimaeras live in {{temperate}} ocean floors down to 2600 m deep, {{with few}} occurring at depths shallower than 200 m. Exceptions include {{the members of}} the genus Callorhinchus, the rabbit fish and the <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish,</b> which locally or periodically can be found at relatively shallow depths. Consequently, these are also among the few species from the Chimaera order kept in public aquaria. They have elongated, soft bodies, with a bulky head and a single gill-opening. They grow up to 150 cm in length, although this includes the lengthy tail found in some species. In many species, the snout is modified into an elongated sensory organ.|$|E
50|$|The feature display {{animal is}} the Giant Pacific Octopus, which at this {{northern}} latitude ranges to near the surface. Other animals {{central to the}} displays are various rockfish species, crabs, bivalves, feather duster worms, bay pipefish, sea anemones, and the sea pen. Interesting species sometimes displayed include the <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish,</b> Humboldt squid, basket star, spot prawn, and red octopus. In addition, because the aquarium continuously pumps raw sea water through its exhibits, planktonic larvae of all sorts settle out in the exhibits, providing an ever-changing challenge of interesting discoveries. Of particular abundance are the opalescent nudibranch and sand-dwelling shellfish species like clam larvae, which grow into juvenile clams over the summer and are {{then returned to the}} beach.|$|E

Marine mammals oscillate their body in an up-and-down (dorso-ventral) direction.Other animals, e.g. penguins, diving ducks, move underwater in a manner which has been termed [...] "aquatic flying". [...] Some fish propel themselves without a wave motion of the body, as in the slow-moving seahorses and Gymnotus. Other animals, such as cephalopods, use jet propulsion to travel fast, taking in water then squirting it back out in an explosive burst. [...] Other swimming animals may rely predominantly on their limbs, much as humans do when swimming. Though life on land originated from the seas, terrestrial animals have returned to an aquatic lifestyle on several occasions, such as the fully aquatic cetaceans, now very distinct from their terrestrial ancestors.|$|E
50|$|Like some sharks, <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> are oviparous. Their {{spawning}} season peaks {{during the spring}} to autumn months. During this time, the female releases up to two fertilized eggs into sand or mud areas of the seabed every 10 to 14 days. The extrusion process can last anywhere from 18 to 30 hours and the actual laying can last another four to six days. The egg sack is leather-like, five inches long, and has a filament connected to it {{which is used to}} attach it to the ocean floor when it is let go by the mother. It is not unheard of to see a female ratfish swimming around her newly laid eggs, in hopes of preventing predators from finding them. Development of the egg can take up to a year, which can be dangerous because the eggs are sometimes mistaken for inanimate objects by divers. When the young finally hatch, they are about 5.5 in in length and grow, reaching 11.8 in in length their first year.Male spotted ratfish have multiple secondary sexual characteristics, which include paired pelvic claspers, a single frontal tentaculum, and paired pelvic tentacula. The pelvic claspers are located on the ventral side of the fish. They protrude out from the pelvic fins and are responsible for the movement of sperm to the oviduct of the female. The interior of the pelvic clasper is supported by cartilage and separates into two branches, ultimately ending in a fleshy lobe on the posterior end.|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. and can be found at: [URL] ocean-climate models driven by increased greenhouse gases and higher temperatures predict a decline in oceanic dissolved oxygen (DO) as a result of greater stratification, reduced ventilation below the thermocline, and decreased solubility at higher temperatures. Since spreading of low oxygen waters is underway and predicted to increase, understanding impacts on higher trophic levels is essential. Within the California Current System, shoaling of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is expected to produce complex changes. Onshore movement of the OMZ could lead to habitat compression for species with higher oxygen requirements while allowing expansion of species tolerant of low bottom DO. As part of annual groundfish surveys, we sampled catch across a range of conditions from the upper to the lower limit of the OMZ and shoreward across the continental shelf of the US west coast. DO ranged from 0. 02 to 4. 25 mL L⁻¹ with 642 stations (of 1020 sampled) experiencing hypoxic conditions in 2008 – 2010. Catch and species richness exhibited significant and positive relationships with near-bottom oxygen concentration. The probability of occurrence was estimated for four species (<b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish,</b> petrale sole, greenstriped rockfish and Dover sole) using a binomial Generalized Additive Model. The models for each species included terms for position, day of the year, salinity, near-bottom temperature and the interaction term between depth and near-bottom DO. <b>Spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> and petrale sole were sensitive to changes in near-bottom oxygen, while greenstriped rockfish and Dover sole show no changes in probability of occurrence in relation to changes in oxygen concentration...|$|E
40|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> Hydrolagus colliei is a holocephalan {{fish that}} consumes hard prey (durophagy) but lacks many {{morphological}} characters associated with durophagy in other cartilaginous fishes. We investigated its feeding biomechanics and biting performance {{to determine whether}} it can generate bite forces comparable with other durophagous elasmobranchs, how biting performance changes over ontogeny (21 – 44  cm SL) and whether biomechanical modelling can accurately predict feeding performance in holocephalans. Hydrolagus colliei can generate absolute and mass-specific bite forces comparable with other durophagous elasmobranchs (anterior= 104  N, posterior= 191  N) and has the highest jaw leverage of any cartilaginous fish studied. Modelling indicated that cranial geometry stabilizes the jaw joint by equitably distributing forces throughout the feeding mechanism and that positive allometry of bite force is due to hyperallometric mechanical advantage. However, bite forces measured through tetanic stimulation of the adductor musculature increased isometrically. The jaw adductors of H. colliei fatigued more rapidly than those of the piscivorous spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias as well. The feeding mechanism of H. colliei is a volume-constrained system in which negative allometry of cranial dimensions leaves relatively less room for musculature. Jaw adductor force, however, is maintained through ontogenetic changes in muscle architecture...|$|E
40|$|Fjord {{estuaries}} {{are common}} along the northeast Pacific coastline, but little {{information is available}} on fish assemblage structure and its spatiotemporal variability. Here, we examined changes in diversity metrics, species biomasses, and biomass spectra (the distribution of biomass across body size classes) over three seasons (fall, winter, summer) and at multiple depths (20 to 160 m) in Puget Sound, Washington, a deep and highly urbanized fjord estuary on the U. S. west coast. Our results indicate that this fish assemblage is dominated by cartilaginous species (<b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish</b> [Hydrolagus colliei] and spiny dogfish [Squalus acanthias]) and therefore differs fundamentally from fish assemblages found in shallower estuaries in the northeast Pacific. Diversity was greatest in shallow waters (80 m) that are more common in Puget Sound and that are dominated by spotted ratf ish and seasonally (fall and summer) by spiny dogfish. Strong depth-dependent variation in the demersal fish assemblage may be a general feature of deep fjord estuaries and indicates pronounced spatial variability in the food web. Future comparisons with less impacted fjords may offer insight into whether cartilaginous species naturally dominate these systems or only do so under conditions related to human-caused ecosystem degradation. Information on species distributions is critical for marine spatial planning and for modeling energy flows in coastal food webs. The data presented here will aid these endeavors and highlight areas for future research in this important yet understudied system...|$|E
40|$|Size at maturity, fecundity, {{reproductive}} periodicity, distribution, {{and abundance}} were estimated for the <b>spotted</b> <b>ratfish,</b> Hydrolagus colliei, {{off the coast}} of California, Oregon, and Washington (USA). Skeletal muscle concentrations of the steroid hormones testosterone (T) and estradiol (E 2) predicted similar, but slightly smaller sizes at maturity than morphological criteria. Stage of maturity for males was estimated identically using internal organs or external secondary sexual characters, thus allowing non-lethal maturity assessments. Peak parturition occurred from May through October, with increased concentrations of E 2 and progesterone (P 4) in skeletal muscle of females correlating with ovarian recrudescence during November through February. Extrapolation of the hypothesized 6 to 8 mo egg-laying season to observed mean parturition rates of captive specimens yielded an estimated annual fecundity of 19. 5 to 28. 9 egg cases. Differences in fecundity among higher taxonomic classifications of chondrichthyans were detected, with chimaeriform fishes more fecund than myliobatiform, squaliform, and rhinobatiform fishes. Delta-lognormal generalized linear models (GLMs) and cluster analysis indicated the presence of two distinct stocks of H. colliei on the U. S. West Coast. Abundance of the continental slope, and northern continental shelf and upper slope populations did not vary between 1977 and 1995, but increased from 1995 to 2006. Abundance trends in the southern shelf and upper slope region were not as straightforward, with increasing abundance from 1977 to 1986, and lesser abundance thereafter, with the exception of an increase between 1992 and 1995. Although the life history, movement patterns, and aggregative behavior of H. colliei indicated that it may be vulnerable to population depletion by excess fisheries mortality, temporal abundance trends indicated that their population size has increased significantly within the last decade. The paradigm that all chondrichthyans are particularly susceptible to exploitation, therefore, may not apply to chimaeroids. The hypothesis that the dorsal-fin spine of H. colliei is a reliable structure for age estimation was tested by analyzing growth characteristics and imageing with polarized light microscopy and micro-computed tomography. Variation among individuals in the relationship between spine width and distance from the spine tip indicated the technique of transverse sectioning may impart imprecision and bias to age estimates. The number of growth band pairs observed by light microscopy in the inner dentine layer was not a good predictor of body size. Mineral density gradients, indicative of growth zones, were not observed in the H. colliei dorsal-fin spine, but were present in hard parts used for age determination of the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), roughtail skate (Bathyraja trachura), and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). The absence of mineral density gradients in the dorsal-fin spine of H. colliei decreases the likelihood that the bands observed by light microscopy represent a record of growth with consistent periodicity...|$|E
