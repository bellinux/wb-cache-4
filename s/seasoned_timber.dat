500|$|Her keel {{was laid}} down before 3 October 1862 at Webb's {{shipyard}} in New York City, even though Webb {{was forced to}} use unseasoned oak for Dunderberg because the supply of <b>seasoned</b> <b>timber</b> had been exhausted earlier in the war. Unseasoned wood was far more prone to rot and significantly shortened the ship's life. Her hull was very strongly built with the space between her frames filled with timber and diagonal iron straps tied her frames together. The sides of the casemate {{at the level of}} the main deck were approximately [...] thick. Before beginning construction, Webb redesigned the hull, increasing its length to [...] between perpendiculars and its overall length to [...] Her beam decreased from [...] to [...] and she displaced, at her nominal draft of [...] forward and [...] aft, [...] These changes made her the longest wooden ship ever built. Dunderbergs hull was protected from biofouling by two external layers of zinc and copper. The ship was fitted with two rudders, the primary one in the usual location aft of the propeller, but she also had an auxiliary rudder placed in the deadwood above and ahead of the propeller.|$|E

50|$|In the 2006/2007 off <b>season</b> <b>Timber</b> Wolf {{underwent}} renovation involving extensive wood work. When the {{new season}} started, riders reported that the ride was smoother. In addition to the wood work, new faceplates were installed featuring airbrushed original Timber Wolf logos, rather than decals that formerly had to be replaced every couple of years.|$|R
50|$|Most barn raisings were {{accomplished}} in June and July when the mostly agrarian society members had time between planting season and harvest <b>season.</b> <b>Timber</b> for the framing was mostly {{produced in the}} winter by the farmer and his crew hewing logs to the correct shape with axes or felling the trees and bringing them to a sawmill.|$|R

60|$|Facing {{the gateway}} and the proclamation, {{the crowd of}} men took its stand. The moon, from behind them, cast fitful, silvery glances at the weary heads bent in anxiety and watchful expectancy: on old heads and young heads, dark, curly heads and heads grizzled with age, on backs bent with toil, and hands rough and gnarled like <b>seasoned</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Lord Clyde-class ironclads were {{a pair of}} wooden-hulled {{armoured}} frigates {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the 1860s. They were designed by Sir Edward Reed and built {{to make use of}} the large stocks of <b>seasoned</b> <b>timber</b> available in the royal shipyards.|$|E
50|$|The base {{variant of}} G.V offered no {{performance}} {{improvement over the}} G.IV. The G.V was up to 450 kg (990 lb) heavier than the G.IV due to additional equipment {{and the use of}} insufficiently <b>seasoned</b> <b>timber.</b> The Mercedes D.IVa engines could not produce the rated 190 kW (260 hp) due to inferior quality of fuel.|$|E

50|$|The Dockyard was {{suffering}} from a shortage of <b>seasoned</b> <b>timber</b> at the time Rodney was being built.

50|$|HMS Pallas was a {{purpose-built}} wooden-hulled ironclad of the Royal Navy, {{designed as}} a private venture by Sir Edward Reed, and accepted by the Board of Admiralty because, as an economy measure, they wished to use up the stocks of <b>seasoned</b> <b>timber</b> held in the Woolwich Dockyard. The fact that Woolwich was not equipped to build iron ships was also relevant.|$|E
50|$|The Australian <b>Seasoned</b> <b>Timber</b> Company's {{finishing}} and seasoning {{works were}} located in the township of Wandong, north of Melbourne {{on the edge of}} the Mount Disappointment forest.

The Wandong seasoning works were established by a different company in 1889 and were one of the earliest attempts to season hardwood in Australia.|$|E

50|$|The {{availability}} of timber also influenced {{the style of}} architecture, with timber buildings prevailing in Scandinavia. Availability of timber affected methods of roof construction across Europe. It is thought that the magnificent hammer-beam roofs of England were devised as a direct response {{to the lack of}} long straight <b>seasoned</b> <b>timber</b> {{by the end of the}} Medieval period, when forests had been decimated not only for the construction of vast roofs but also for ship building.|$|E

Renamed USS California on 15 May 1869, she {{first went to}} sea on 7 October 1870, and served briefly in the Pacific. However, {{because she had been}} constructed of partially <b>seasoned</b> <b>timber</b> due to an unprecedented volume of shipbuilding during the war, her hull deteriorated rapidly and she was sold at Mare Island Navy Yard in May 1875.|$|E
