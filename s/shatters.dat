40|$|Seed <b>shattering</b> is {{a common}} problem in early soybean {{production}} system (ESPS) in the Midsouth, which mainly uses maturity group (MG) IV soybeans. Many {{studies have been conducted}} on the genetics of soybean <b>shattering</b> resistance for individual varieties; however, information on the physiology of soybean <b>shattering</b> pattern under specific environmental conditions, which is often critical to soybean growers, is very limited. Field experiments were conducted at Stoneville MS from 2007 to 2009 to investigate the <b>shattering</b> patterns of 80 - 132 MG IV soybean varieties each year. Results from 2007 and 2008 indicated that, when April-planted MG IV soybeans matured in mid- to late August, pods of most soybean varieties did not <b>shatter</b> within the first three weeks after maturity (WAM) and there was no significant <b>shattering</b> effect on final yields. However, differences in pod <b>shattering</b> among the varieties became apparent in the fourth WAM. Late-planted MG IV soybeans, which matured in early September, had a low <b>shattering</b> rate and could hold seeds up to 6 WAM before reaching a critical <b>shattering</b> point. Most soybean varieties planted in April 2009 did not show significant pod <b>shattering</b> {{by the end of the}} fourth WAM. The critical point of <b>shattering</b> was not reached until 6 - 7 WAM. Relatively lower temperatures and abundant rainfall during the late growing season in 2009 may be the main reasons causing delayed <b>shattering</b> in April-planted MG IV soybeans.

5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and volcanic glass, created during volcanic eruptions and measuring less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term volcanic ash is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas <b>shatters</b> the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Seed <b>shattering,</b> or shedding, is an {{important}} fitness trait for wild and weedy grasses. U. S. weedy rice (Oryza sativa) is a highly <b>shattering</b> weed, thought to have evolved from non-shattering cultivated ancestors. All U. S. weedy rice individuals examined to date contain a mutation in the sh 4 locus associated with loss of <b>shattering</b> during rice domestication. Weedy individuals also share the <b>shattering</b> trait with wild rice, but not the ancestral <b>shattering</b> mutation at sh 4; thus, how weedy rice reacquired the <b>shattering</b> phenotype is unknown. To establish the morphological basis of the parallel evolution of seed <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice and wild, we examined the abscission layer at the flower-pedicel junction in weedy individuals in comparison with wild and cultivated relatives. Results Consistent with previous work, <b>shattering</b> wild rice individuals possess clear, defined abscission layers at flowering, whereas non-shattering cultivated rice individuals do not. <b>Shattering</b> weedy rice from two separately evolved populations in the U. S. (SH and BHA) show patterns of abscission layer formation and degradation distinct from wild rice. Prior to flowering, the abscission layer has formed in all weedy individuals and by flowering it is already degrading. In contrast, wild O. rufipogon abscission layers have been shown not to degrade until after flowering has occurred. Conclusions Seed <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice involves the formation and degradation of an abscission layer in the flower-pedicel junction, as in wild Oryza, but is a developmentally different process from <b>shattering</b> in wild rice. Weedy rice abscission layers appear to break down earlier than wild abscission layers. The timing of weedy abscission layer degradation suggests that unidentified regulatory genes may {{play a critical role}} in the reacquisition of <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice, and sheds light on the morphological basis of parallel evolution for <b>shattering</b> in weedy and wild rice. </p...|$|R

Since the first game, Kain has revived the vampire race, and has become the despotic ruler of the land. When the game's protagonist, his lieutenant Raziel, surpasses Kain, Raziel is executed for his transgression. Resurrected by The Elder God, Raziel returns to destroy his former brethren and Kain, and eventually confronts Kain at {{the ruins of the}} Pillars. Kain attacks Raziel with the Soul Reaver, but the blade <b>shatters</b> when it strikes him, and Kain escapes, strangely satisfied. Raziel discovers, to his horror, that Kain created him and his other lieutenants from the corpses of the Sarafan, an ancient order of vampire hunters.

5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those {{that occur in the}} deep sea, forming piles of pillow lava {{at the base of the}} volcanic structure. Some of the lava <b>shatters</b> when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more effusive and thicken as the lava cools much more slowly, often forming columnar jointing. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E

40|$|Seed <b>shattering</b> in crops {{is a key}} {{domestication}} trait due to {{its relevance}} for seed dispersal, yield, and fundamental questions in evolution (e. g., convergent evolution). Here, we focused on pod <b>shattering</b> in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the most important legume crop for human consuption in the world. With this main aim, we developed a methodological pipeline that comprises a thorough characterization under field conditions, including also the chemical composition and histological analysis of the pod valves. The pipeline was developed {{based on the assumption}} that the <b>shattering</b> trait itself can be treated in principle as a “syndrome” (i. e., a set of correlated different traits) at the pod level. We characterized a population of 267 introgression lines that were developed ad-hoc to study <b>shattering</b> in common bean. Three main objectives were sought: (1) to dissect the <b>shattering</b> trait into its “components,” of level (percentage of <b>shattering</b> pods per plant) and mode (percentage of pods with twisting or non-twisting valves); (2) to test whether <b>shattering</b> is associated to the chemical composition and/or the histological characteristics of the pod valves; and (3) to test the associations between <b>shattering</b> and other plant traits. We can conclude the following: Very high <b>shattering</b> levels can be achieved in different modes; <b>shattering</b> resistance is mainly a qualitative trait; and high <b>shattering</b> levels is correlated with high carbon and lignin contents of the pod valves and with specific histological charaterstics of the ventral sheath and the inner fibrous layer of the pod wall. Our data also suggest that <b>shattering</b> comes with a “cost,” as it is associated with lowpod size, low seed weight per pod, high pod weight, and low seed to pod-valves ratio; indeed, it can be more exaustively described as a syndrome at the pod level. Our work suggests that the valve chemical composition (i. e., carbon and lignin content) can be used for a high troughput phenotyping procedures for <b>shattering</b> phenotyping.
