5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as the Arctic hare, mustelids such as the <b>stoat,</b> and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|Four {{species of}} small mammal are {{considered}} native: the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), the Jersey bank vole (Myodes glareolus caesarius), the Lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens) and the French shrew (Sorex coronatus). Three wild mammals are well-established introductions: the rabbit ({{introduced in the}} mediaeval period), the red squirrel and the hedgehog (both introduced in the 19th century). The <b>stoat</b> (Mustela erminea) became extinct in Jersey between 1976 and 2000. The Green lizard (Lacerta bilineata) is a protected species of reptile; Jersey is its only habitat in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to organized beagling, beagles {{have been used}} for hunting or flushing to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including snowshoe hare, cottontail rabbits, game birds, roe deer, red deer, bobcat, coyote, wild boar and foxes, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt <b>stoat.</b> In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stoats</b> are {{vulnerable}} to ectoparasites associated with their prey and the nests of other animals on which they do not prey. The louse Trichodectes erminea is recorded in <b>stoats</b> living in Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. [...] In continental Europe, 26 flea species are recorded to infest <b>stoats,</b> including Rhadinospylla pentacantha, Megabothris rectangulatus, Orchopeas howardi, Spilopsyllus ciniculus, Ctenophthalamus nobilis, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, Nosopsyllus fasciatus, Leptospylla segnis, Ceratophyllus gallinae, Parapsyllus n. nestoris, Amphipsylla kuznetzovi and Ctenopsyllus bidentatus. Tick species known to infest <b>stoats</b> are Ixodes canisuga, I. hexagonus, and I. ricinus and Haemaphysalis longicornis. Louse species known to infest <b>stoats</b> include Mysidea picae and Polyplax spinulosa. Mite species known to infest <b>stoats</b> include Neotrombicula autumnalis, [...] Demodex erminae, Eulaelaps stabulans, Gymnolaelaps annectans, Hypoaspis nidicorva, and Listrophorus mustelae.|$|R

25|$|The {{nematode}} Skrjabingylus nasicola {{is particularly}} serious to <b>stoats,</b> as it erodes {{the bones of}} the nasal sinuses and decreases fertility. Other nematode species known to infect <b>stoats</b> include Capillaria putorii, Molineus patens and Strongyloides martes. Cestode species known to infect <b>stoats</b> include Taenia tenuicollis, Mesocestoides lineatus and rarely Acanthocephala.|$|R
5|$|In {{areas where}} the least weasel is {{sympatric}} with the <b>stoat,</b> the two species {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E
5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the Arctic hare, Arctic fox, <b>stoat,</b> and rock {{ptarmigan}} have snow camouflage, changing their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E
5|$|The area {{shares a}} common brown bear {{population}} with Norway and Russia. Other predators include red fox, <b>stoat,</b> pine marten and the rare wolverine and Eurasian lynx. The gray wolf was common until the 1940s. There {{is also a}} large population of moose. Inari–Pasvik has a shared population of 6,000 reindeer, which are herded to different areas depending on the season. Fences have been installed to hinder reindeer from wandering across the national borders.|$|E
5000|$|It is the {{intention}} of <b>Stoats</b> to [...] "modernise porridge". <b>Stoats</b> founder Tony Stone said that Stoats' recipe makes it lighter and fluffier with a much better texture.|$|R
50|$|Falshed {{attempts}} to stop Sylver, arriving with {{a troop of}} <b>stoats,</b> but the outlaws cleverly ward off the attack by using missiles filled with ants, thus driving the <b>stoats</b> into the vast forest. They strap Falshed to a raft and send him off down the river, where, after an interval with the rats, he makes it back to his home, Castle Rayn, home of the <b>stoats.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Stoats</b> is a British {{company which}} sells {{porridge}} and other oat based products. Based in Edinburgh, Scotland, <b>Stoats</b> {{was founded in}} 2005 and retails in most British supermarkets with distribution across the world including Europe, Asia and UAE.|$|R
5|$|The least weasel has a circumboreal, Holarctic distribution, {{encompassing}} much of Europe and North Africa, Asia {{and parts}} of northern North America, where it occurs mainly in places where the <b>stoat</b> is not found, though it has been introduced in New Zealand, Malta, Crete, the Azore Islands and also Sao Tome off west Africa. It is found throughout Europe and on many islands, including the Azores, Britain (but not Ireland), and all major Mediterranean islands. It also occurs on Honshu and Hokkaido islands in Japan and on Kunashir, Iturup, and Sakhalin Islands in Russia.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or squeal. During encounters {{between males and}} females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the <b>stoat.</b> Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E
5|$|The male common {{chiffchaff}} {{is highly}} territorial during the breeding season, with a core territory typically 20metres (66ft) across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds {{may also be}} attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the <b>stoat</b> if they approach the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the Eurasian jay. His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears {{to be used to}} advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a paternity guard strategy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stoating,</b> {{sometimes}} written stoting or stotting, {{is a type}} of stitching made to join {{two pieces}} of woven material, with raw edges placed together, such that the resulting stitches are not visible from {{the right side of the}} cloth. <b>Stoating</b> is accomplished by passing the needle only halfway through the pieces of material to be <b>stoated,</b> using a very fine needle and thread, such as silk, or even hair. Stitches would be drawn from side to side across the opening to be sewn closed, in a pattern resembling a zig-zag or the rungs of a ladder. <b>Stoating</b> may be used on heavier fabrics, such as felt and some types of tweed, or fabrics that will not fray easily. <b>Stoating</b> would also be used in place of seaming on heavy furs. When completed, the join should lie flat and not be visible from the right side of the fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Every four to {{six years}} or so, Nothofagus {{produces}} a heavier crop of seeds and {{is known as the}} beech mast. In New Zealand, the beech mast causes an increase in the population of introduced mammals such as mice, rats, and <b>stoats.</b> When the rodent population collapses, the <b>stoats</b> begin to prey on native bird species, many of which are threatened with extinction. [...] This phenomenon is covered in more detail in the article on <b>stoats</b> in New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We present two {{statistical}} models documenting variations in density indices of <b>stoats</b> and of mice in New Zealand southern beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests. They confirm previous, simpler correlations {{showing that the}} summer capture rate of <b>stoats</b> increases with spring mouse density index up to about 20 – 25 mouse captures per 100 trap-nights (C/ 100 TN). However, at much higher mouse densities (60 – 80 C/ 100 TN), observed in the Grebe and Borland Valleys in southern Fiordland in 1979 / 80 and again in 1999 / 2000, fewer <b>stoats</b> were caught than expected. These models quantify a serious decline in capture rate of <b>stoats</b> during periods of high mouse abundance over the range 25 - 80 C/ 100 TN. At such times, management strategies aiming to protect threatened birds by intensive lethal trapping of <b>stoats</b> during the nesting seasons may be least effective just when they are most needed. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
5|$|Some {{animals of}} the far north, like the showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, <b>stoat,</b> and rock {{ptarmigan}} change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the presumption that natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
5|$|The larger Welsh mammals {{died out}} during the Norman period, {{including}} the brown bear, wolf and the wildcat. Today, mammals of note include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. Other animals of note include, otter, <b>stoat</b> and weasel. The pine marten which has had the occasional sighting, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats {{can be found in}} Snowdonia.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{is small}} enough to be preyed upon by a range of other predators. Least weasel remains {{have been found in}} the {{excrement}} of red foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecat, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards. The owls most efficient at capturing least weasels are barn, barred, and great horned owls. Other birds of prey threatening to the least weasel include broad-winged and rough-legged buzzards. Some snake species may prey on the least weasel, including the black rat snake and copperhead. Aside from its smaller size, the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the <b>stoat</b> because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>stoats</b> were {{recognised}} as {{a potential}} pest before being introduced into New Zealand, they were given protection as late as 1936. As a means of preventing a loss of biodiversity, there are now severe penalties for introducing <b>stoats</b> into protected areas.|$|R
50|$|Although Bauza Island is {{relatively}} small, {{it has a}} high conservation value, with pristine native bush and the only animal pest to have ever made it onto the island being <b>stoats.</b> <b>Stoats</b> were eradicated with a pest trapping campaign between 2002 and 2004, with over 40 traps along tracks following the main ridge of the island. Even though the island is now pest-free, the traps need to be checked and re-baited periodically as <b>stoats</b> {{have been known to}} swim distances of over 1 km.|$|R
40|$|<b>Stoats</b> (Mustela erminea) {{and ship}} rats (Rattus rattus) in New Zealand are {{targeted}} by trapping to mitigate their predation on native wildlife. Internationally recognized guidelines {{for assessing the}} effectiveness and welfare performance of kill traps are supported by New Zealand legislation under the Animal Welfare Act 1999. The Victor® Easy Set® rat trap was tested and passed a similar standard for killing short-tailed weasels in Canada but failed for <b>stoats</b> when tested in New Zealand in 2002 (short-tailed weasels and <b>stoats</b> are the same species). We tested {{a modified version of}} the trap in 2011 - 12, modified by changing the treadle trigger to a pull trigger and adding a plastic shroud to direct and align approach by animals to the front of the trap. These traps, in vertical and horizontal sets, were tested with both <b>stoats</b> and ship rats. During each test the trap had to render 10 of 10 animals irreversibly unconscious within 3 minutes to meet approval requirements. The modified trap passed with both species in both trap sets. All <b>stoats</b> were struck across the cranium whereas rats were struck either on the cranium or neck. We recommend this trap design for use by community conservation groups for targeting <b>stoats</b> and ship rats in New Zealand...|$|R
5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and <b>stoat</b> {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, <b>stoat,</b> least weasel, American mink and European pine marten. The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian coats are colored for {{a variety}} of reasons, the major {{selective}} pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), <b>stoat</b> (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, {{is the result of a}} symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.|$|E

50|$|In 2000, {{after being}} {{recognised}} by IUCN, they {{were placed in}} the Vulnerable status group. They have an occurrence range of 9800 km2 and population of 27,000 was estimated in 1996. Brush-tailed possums, Trichosurus vulpecula, and <b>stoats,</b> Mustela erminea, will eat the eggs, while <b>stoats</b> and cats will eat chicks and juveniles. Adults are also under threat as dogs, ferrets, and brush-tailed possums, attack them and the juveniles. The Stewart Island population is stable {{due to the lack of}} these predators, however <b>stoats</b> may have colonised the island in 2000.|$|R
50|$|The rabbit was {{introduced}} by European settlers as a food and game animal, and by the 1870s it was becoming {{a serious threat to}} the newly developed farming economy. Farmers began demanding the introduction of mustelids (including <b>stoats)</b> to control the rabbit plague. Warnings about the dangers to bird life from <b>stoats</b> were given by scientists in New Zealand and Britain, including the New Zealand ornithologist Walter Buller. The warnings were ignored and <b>stoats</b> began to be introduced from Britain in the 1880s. Within six years, drastic declines in bird populations were noticed.|$|R
25|$|The <b>stoat</b> was a {{fundamental}} {{item in the}} fur trade of the Soviet Union, with no {{less than half the}} global catch coming from within its borders. The Soviet Union also contained the highest grades of <b>stoat</b> pelts, with the best grade North American pelts being comparable only to the 9th grade in the quality criteria of former Soviet <b>stoat</b> standards. However, <b>stoat</b> harvesting never became a specialty in any Soviet republic, with most stoats being captured incidentally in traps or near villages. Stoats in the Soviet Union were captured either with dogs or with box-traps or jaw-traps. Guns were rarely used, as they could damage the pelt.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stoat</b> is a usually silent animal, but {{can produce}} a range of sounds {{similar to those of}} the least weasel. Kits produce a fine {{chirping}} noise. Adults trill excitedly before mating, and indicate submission through quiet trilling, whining and squealing. When nervous, the <b>stoat</b> hisses, and will intersperse this with sharp barks or shrieks and prolonged screeching when aggressive.|$|E
25|$|The stoat's direct {{ancestor}} was Mustela palerminea, {{a common}} carnivore {{in central and}} eastern Europe during the Middle Pleistocene, that spread to North America during the late Blancan or early Irvingtonian. The <b>stoat</b> {{is the product of a}} process begun 5–7 million years ago, when northern forests were replaced by open grassland, thus prompting an explosive evolution of small, burrowing rodents. The stoat's ancestors were larger than the current form, and underwent a reduction in size as they exploited the new food source. The <b>stoat</b> first arose in Eurasia, shortly after the long-tailed weasel arose as its mirror image in North America 2 million years ago. The <b>stoat</b> thrived during the Ice Age, as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows. The <b>stoat</b> and the long-tailed weasel remained separated until half a million years ago, when falling sea levels exposed the Bering land bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{restoration}} of New Zealand’s mainland ecological communities {{has been extremely}} challenging. The use of aerial and bait station poisoning for rats and possums and kill-trapping of mustelids has been attempted in many mainland forests. This has resulted in increased breeding success of native bird species. Poisoning of <b>stoats</b> rather than trapping {{has the potential to}} greatly reduce the cost of controlling <b>stoats</b> as fewer visits to the area are required and because <b>stoats</b> are difficult to trap and it has been identified that secondary poisoning of <b>stoats</b> in South Island beech forest could be an effective means of control. In a study by Alterio (2000) on the use of 1080 and brodifacoum for controlling rodents such as rats and mice, secondary poisoning of <b>stoats</b> and cats was found to be significant and so this could be an especially useful way of restoring New Zealand mainland ecological communities. However, it is necessary that poisoning is carried out {{in a way that it}} will not have any impacts on non target native species.|$|R
