5000|$|The {{controller}} {{attempts to}} instruct {{the driver to}} pick up a client from Victoria Station, but the driver declines to move, focusing on his current client (who is apparently unmoving, perhaps even dead, in the back <b>seat).</b> The <b>Controller's</b> mood shifts through various degrees of mystification towards irritation and then possibly compassion masking some more nefarious intention {{of what to do with}} this Driver.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Parker {{was elected}} City Controller. [...] She was re-elected in 2005 and 2007 unopposed. In addition, Parker also secured a <b>seat</b> for a <b>controller's</b> {{appointee}} on the Houston Municipal Pension System Board of Trustees, marking {{the first time}} the city's chief financial officer has had any involvement in the pension system." ...|$|R
50|$|Almost every episode {{begins with}} Ashly, comfortably <b>seated</b> with a <b>controller,</b> as her brother walks {{up behind her}} and title-drops the show. Ashly then answers him with the episode's game in a childlike accent. All audio here is {{supplemented}} with a game font, and the camera abruptly clips {{to the content of}} the week's episode.|$|R
50|$|The city's {{organized}} {{labour movement}} convened {{shortly after the}} close of nominations to study the issue of mayoral endorsement. Rather than take the side of Mayor Jackson, a conservative-minded politician or that of Coulson, an avowed Communist, the city's unions pushed for a stronger get-out-the-vote campaign and made individual endorsements for aldermanic and <b>controller</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Shock Cannons (...) : The nine main 46 cm and six {{secondary}} 15.5 cm guns of {{the original}} Yamato, with the 46 cm guns housed in three triple-barreled turrets and the 15.5 cm guns housed in two triple-barreled turrets fore and aft respectively; have been converted into powerful energy guns. Each turret fires three energy beams which spiral around each other to form a single, more powerful beam, capable of severely damaging or destroying enemy warships. The cannons are operated by <b>seated</b> human <b>controllers,</b> whose aiming orders are transmitted from Bridge One. In addition to firing energy blasts, the guns can be loaded with other ammunition, most notably cartridges containing the devices used in the Rotating Asteroid Defense (see below). Space Battleship Yamato 2199 sometimes features the shock cannons firing Type 3 projectiles, designed to pierce enemy armour {{a few seconds before}} detonation. In the film Be Forever, Yamato (1980), they are used to fire missiles containing Wave Motion energy, which even with a hundredth the power of the Wave Motion Gun cause tremendous destruction.|$|R
5000|$|Palladino {{dictated}} the lighting and [...] "controls" [...] {{that were to}} be used in her mediumistic séances. The fingertips of her right hand rested upon the back of the hand of one [...] "controller." [...] Her left hand was grasped at the wrist by a second <b>controller</b> <b>seated</b> on her other side. Her feet rested on top of the feet of her controllers, sometimes beneath them. A controller's foot was in contact with only the toe of her shoe. Occasionally her ankles were tied to the legs of her chair, but they were given a play of four inches. During the sitting in semi-darkness, her ankles would become free. Generally she was unbound. In one instance, a controller cut her free so that phenomena might occur.|$|R
30|$|For {{the rail}} industry, {{considerations}} into the redesign of <b>seating,</b> the master <b>controller,</b> and the foot pedal are advocated to achieve more flexibility and correct posture for tram drivers when driving. Work {{is currently being}} undertaken in one site involving cab design modifications to determine optimum driver interface with the master controller and foot pedal {{based on the findings}} to date with the aid of mock-ups. This will be the subject of further reporting when the testing is completed. Further academic research should also consider the specific make-up of the tram-driving task using task analyses. Towards achieving this aim, more analysis of the data collected in this work may be used to develop a framework for further analysis, specifically in terms of how the task demands interact with the specific ergonomic and human factors issues.|$|R
25|$|All-round pilot {{vision was}} {{provided}} by a wrap-around windshield and bubble canopy. Unlike the F-16's steeply raked <b>seat</b> and sidestick <b>controller,</b> however, the Lavi employed a conventional upright seat and central control column. The cockpit employed HOTAS (hands-on-throttle and stick) controls, while a Hughes Aircraft wide-angle diffractive optics head up display (HUD) was integrated onto a single El-Op up-front control panel. There were {{a total of three}} conventional display units, two of which were color. Display redundancy was ensured via data-sharing between the HMDs. A fully computerised Elta ARC-740 ultra high frequency (UHF) radio was incorporated along with a navigation suite, the latter of which included the Tuman TINS 1700 advanced inertial navigation system. Aspects such as flexibility and situational awareness were emphasized to reduce pilot workload while under high g-forces and within a dense threat environment.|$|R
40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) fluids (MRFs) {{are smart}} fluids that have {{reversible}} field dependent rheological properties {{that can change}} rapidly (typically 5 - 10 ms time constant). Such an MRF can be changed from a free flowing fluid into a semi-solid when exposed to a magnetic field. The rapid, reversible, and continuous field dependent variation in rheological properties can be exploited in an MRF-based damper or energy absorber to provide adaptive vibration and shock mitigation capabilities to varying payloads, vibration spectra, and shock pulses, {{as well as other}} environmental factors. Electronically controlled electromagnetic coils are typically used to activate the MR effect and tune the damping force so that feedback control implementation is practical and realizable. MR devices have been demonstrated as successful solutions in semi-active systems combining advantages of both passive and active systems for applications where piston velocities are relatively low (typically < 1 m/s), such as seismic mitigation, or vibration isolation. Recently strong interests have focused on employing magnetorheological energy absorbers (MREAs) for high speed impact loads, such as in helicopter cockpit seats for occupant protection in a vertical crash landing. This work presents another novel application of MREAs in this new trend - an adaptive magnetorheological sliding seat (AMSS) system utilizing controllable MREAs to mitigate impact load imparted to the occupant for a ground vehicle {{in the event of a}} low speed frontal impact (up to 15 mph). To accomplish this, a non-linear analytical MREA model based on the Bingham-plastic model and including minor loss effects (denoted as the BPM model) is developed. A design strategy is proposed for MREAs under impact conditions. Using the BPM model, an MREA is designed, fabricated and drop tested up to piston velocities of 5 m/s. The measured data is used to validate the BPM model and the design strategy. The MREA design is then modified for use in the AMSS system and a prototype is built. The prototype MREA is drop tested and its performance, as well as the dynamic behavior in the time domain, is described by the BPM model. Next, theoretical analysis of the AMSS system with two proposed control algorithms is carried out using two modeling approaches: (1) a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) rigid occupant (RO) model treating the seat and the occupant as a single rigid mass, and (2) a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) compliant occupant (CO) model interpreting the occupant as three lumped parts - head, torso and pelvis. A general MREA is assumed and characterized by the Bingham-plastic model in the system model. The two control algorithms, named the constant Bingham number or Bic control and the constant stroking force or Fc control, are constructed in such a way that the control objective - to bring the payload to rest while fully utilizing the available stroke - is achieved. Numerical simulations for both rigid and compliant occupant models with assumed system parameter values and a 20 g rectangular crash pulse for initial impact speeds of up to 7 m/s (15. 7 mph) show that overall decelerations of the payload are significantly reduced using the AMSS compared to the case of a traditional fixed seat. To experimentally verify the theoretical analysis, a prototype AMSS system is built. The prototype seat system is sled tested in the passive mode (i. e. without control) for initial impact speeds of up to 5. 6 m/s and for the 5 th percentile female and the 95 th percentile male. Using the test data, the CO model is shown to be able to adequately describe the dynamic behavior of the prototype seat system. Utilizing the CO model, the control algorithms for the prototype seat system are developed and a prototype controller is formulated using the DSPACE and SIMULINK real time control environments. The prototype <b>seat</b> system with <b>controller</b> integrated is sled tested for initial impact speeds of up to 5. 6 m/s for the 5 th female and 95 th male (only the 95 th male is tested for the Bic control). The results show that the controllers of both control algorithms successfully bring the seat to rest while fully utilizing the available stroke and the decelerations measured at the seat are substantially mitigated. The CO model is shown to be effective and a useful tool to predict the control inputs of the control algorithms. Thus, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sliding seat system is theoretically and experimentally verified...|$|R
