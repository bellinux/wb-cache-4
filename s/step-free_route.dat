25|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is on the}} west side of the station (at the top of the diagram, right), facing Courtenay Park and Queen Street which leads into the town centre. The {{main entrance}} is through South Devon House, the building opened in 1927. This involves a couple of steps up to the platform, but a <b>step-free</b> <b>route</b> leads from the taxi rank on the south side of the building. The car park is beyond this on the site of the former Platform 4. At the north end of this platform are a former terminal platform and sidings alongside Tucker's Maltings which used to serve the Moretonhampstead branch.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} built well above street level and is {{accessed}} via either a subway and stairs {{or a more}} circuitous but <b>step-free</b> <b>route</b> along a narrow access road.|$|E
50|$|In 2011-12, {{the station}} was made step-free, in {{preparation}} for the Olympics. A <b>step-free</b> <b>route</b> was provided between the station entrance and platforms 1 and 2 for the first time, with the installation of two new lifts and a stair lift. The toilets were refurbished to make them fully accessible. Two platforms were extended as well. This improvement scheme cost £2.5m.|$|E
50|$|The site generates both A to B and {{circular}} routes, providing printable written {{directions and}} maps. As walkit.com is specifically tailored to pedestrians, it includes data that is omitted from many traditional vehicle-based journey planners, such as routes across parks, beside rivers and canals and along footpaths and alleyways. There {{is also the}} option to select a 'less busy' route, which avoids main roads where possible. Some cities also have additional features, such as <b>step-free</b> <b>routes,</b> hill profiles, and air-pollution aware routes.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} a ticket office on {{platform}} 2, {{but this is}} only manned on a limited basis (mornings only, Mondays to Saturdays). At other times tickets must be purchased on board the train. The main building on platform 1 is now used as an art studio. Standard shelters are available on both platforms, along with a waiting room on platform 1. Train running information is provided via CIS displays, automatic announcements and customer help points. The station subway has steps and is not therefore accessible to wheelchair or mobility-impaired users, but there are <b>step-free</b> access <b>routes</b> to each side via public roads. All trains on the route to and from Perth use platform 1 in both directions, so this {{should be taken into}} account if changing trains here.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{the railway}} station was {{refurbished}} {{to improve the}} station's accessibility. Funded by the Department for Transport's Access for All Scheme, the main change was {{the construction of a}} new footbridge allowing a <b>step-free</b> <b>route</b> between the station entrance and both platforms using two lifts. Other improvements include new tactile paving along the edge of the platform, new toilet facilities, new customer information screens and lighting, the redecoration of the ticket office and changes to the car park layout.|$|E
50|$|Sittingbourne {{railway station}} {{is on the}} Chatham Main Line and the Sheerness Line in north Kent. The station is 44 miles 1260 yards from London Victoria {{according}} to the mileage sign on the footbridge. Train services are provided by Southeastern. Ticket barriers are sometimes in operation, depending {{on the time of}} day.Two new lifts linked by a new footbridge have created a <b>step-free</b> <b>route</b> between the station entrance and platforms to provide better access to train services. The improvements have been funded through the government’s Access for All programme and cost around £1,800,000.|$|E
