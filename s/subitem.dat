40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this article}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of amisulpride on the behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Materials and methods: In this open-label study, we observed 18 outpatients affected by moderate to severe AD, complicated with agitation and disruptive behaviours. Behavioural, cognitive and motor effects of amisulpride at baseline and after 12 weeks were rated by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Mini Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, activities of daily living, and the motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Results: After treatment with amisulpride (200 mg/day), the patients showed a significant decrease in NPI total scores, particularly for the <b>subitem</b> 'agitation'. Cognitive and motor variables did not worsen significantly over the 12 -week period.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Globus pallidus internus (GPi) {{deep brain}} {{stimulation}} (DBS) represents a validated, effective, and safe treatment for patients affected by generalized dystonia resistant to conservative treatment. Segmental and multisegmental dystonia have more recently been proposed as further indications for GPi DBS {{despite the lack of}} long-term homogenous follow-up. Here we present an original and detailed long-term follow-up (5 years) of a homogeneous population of 11 patients affected by segmental or multisegmental dystonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients underwent bilateral GPi DBS electrode implantations under a Leksell stereotactic guide, with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. The follow-ups at 1, 3 and 5 years were collected using video-BFMDRS for motor and disability scores. The statistical analysis of the results is provided. RESULTS: We reported a statistically significant improvement in motor and disability overall scores until 5 years after treatment. At the last follow-up, even the single motor <b>subitems</b> were statistically improved. DISCUSSION: We observed a continuous and statistically significant improvement in all of the motor <b>subitems</b> and in the overall disability score until the 3 -year follow-up. These results did not improve any further but they appeared steady at the last follow-up. We also report a significant improvement in the cranial-cervical <b>subitems.</b> CONCLUSIONS: GPi DBS should definitely be considered a safe and effective treatment also for segmental and multisegmental dystonia even in cases of relevant or prevalent cranial-cervical involvement...|$|R

MethodsA prospective study was conducted on 12 patients with femoral neck fractures who underwent partial hip arthroplasty between June 2013 and July 2014. Female patients predominated (58. 3 %). The mean age was 83 years and, in 91. 7 %, the fracture was due to falling from a standing position. The SF- 36 questionnaire was applied before the operation and 3 and 6 months after the operation. ResultsWith regard to physical health, the patients presented low scores for functional capacity and physical aspects. They had good scores for the <b>subitem</b> of general state and high scores regarding pain. Vitality, social aspect and mental health had moderate scores and emotional aspects had a low score. ConclusionWith the sample analyzed here, we can say that the hip hemiarthroplasty procedure for cases of unstable femoral neck fractures, in patients with low functional demands analyzed over a postoperative period of 6 months, does indeed allow quality of life to be maintained...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the target symptoms that show the most improvement at 1 year and at 5 years after STN-DBS. MethodsThis was a 5 -year cohort study of 41 consecutive patients treated with bilateral STN-DBS. Clinical evaluations were performed 1 month prior to surgery and 1 year and 5 years after surgery. The outcome measurements at 1 year and 5 years were the changes compared with the baseline in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) parts I, II, III, and IV scores, the Hoehn and Yahr stage, and Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SEADL) scores in the conditions of off-medication/on-stimulation and off-medication/off-stimulation. Further analysis included changes in the levodopa equivalent daily dose. ResultsWhen compared to the preoperative baseline off-medication condition, significant improvements were observed in the UPDRS parts I, II, III, and IV and SEADL (p <  0. 001) scores in the off-medication/on-stimulation condition 1 year after STN-DBS. Five years after STN-DBS, improvements in UPDRS scores were observed only for parts II, III, and IV (p <  0. 001). In the off-medication/off-stimulation condition, no significant improvement was observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{evidence}} for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in dementia care is growing but the implementation of available evidence is not automatic. Our objective was to develop valid quality indicators (QIs) for psychosocial dementia care that facilitate the implementation process in various countries and settings. METHODS: A RAND-modified Delphi technique was used to develop a potential set of QIs. Two multidisciplinary, international expert panels were involved in achieving content and face validity. Consensus on the final set was reached after a conference meeting where a third panel of dementia experts discussed measurability and applicability of the potential set. A retrospective cohort {{study was conducted to}} study the feasibility of using the final set in day care centers, hospitals, and nursing homes in Spain and The Netherlands. RESULTS: A total of 104 recommendations were selected from guidelines and systematic reviews and appraised for their contribution to improving the quality of dementia care by 49 dementia experts. Twenty-five experts attended the conference meeting and reached consensus on a set of 12 QIs representing the key elements of effective psychosocial care, such as shared decision-making and interventions tailored to needs and preferences. Data from 153 patient records showed that all but one QI <b>subitem</b> were applicable to all three settings in both countries. CONCLUSION: Our multidisciplinary and multinational strategy resulted in a set of unique QIs that aims exclusively at assessing the quality of psychosocial dementia care.

Best cut-off value of the total NIHSS score to predict LVO was 7 (PPV 84. 2  %, sensitivity 81. 0  %, specificity 76. 6  %, NPV 72. 4  %, ACC 79. 3  %). Receiver operating characteristic curves of various combinations of NIHSS <b>subitems</b> and published scores were equally or less predictive to show LVO than the total NIHSS score. At intersection of sensitivity and specificity curves in all scores, at least 1 / 5 of patients with LVO were missed. Best odds ratios for LVO among NIHSS <b>subitems</b> were best gaze (9. 6, 95  %-CI 6. 765 - 13. 632), visual fields (7. 0, 95  %-CI 3. 981 - 12. 370), motor arms (7. 6, 95  %-CI 5. 589 - 10. 204), and aphasia/neglect (7. 1, 95  %-CI 5. 352 - 9. 492).

Subjects: The study population consisted of 77 elderly people with mild dementia diagnosed according to standardised criteria. Methods: Structured clinical interviews and physical, neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychological examinations were performed and routine blood tests were taken. Depression was assessed using the depression <b>subitem</b> of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). A standardised protocol for magnetic resonance imaging scan was used, and the volumes of WMH were quantified using an automated method, followed by manual editing. Results: The volumes of total and frontal deep WMH were significantly and positively correlated with baseline severity of depressive symptoms, and depressed patients had significantly higher volumes of total and frontal deep WMH than non-depressed patients. Higher volumes of WMH were also associated with having a high MADRS score and incident and persistent depression at follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounders, frontal deep WMH, in addition to prior depression and non-AD dementia, were still significantly associated with baseline depressive symptoms (p = 0. 015, OR 3. 703, 95 % CI 1. 294 – 10. 593). Similar results emerged for total WMH. Conclusion: In elderly people with mild dementia, volumes of WMH, in particular frontal deep WMH, were positively correlated with baseline severity of depressive symptoms, {{and seemed to be}} associated with persistent and incident depression at follow-up.

40|$|Learned {{predisposition}} to choice in a favorable or unfavorable manner {{with respect to}} a given food is a complex and plastic trait resulting from interactions between both nutritional properties of food and individual chemosensory perception, this last modulated by personality properties and interoceptive awareness (alexithymia). We report data obtained by a total of ~ 700 individuals (aged 18 - 76) coming from 6 different small villages in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in northern Italy. Participants completed a food preferences questionnaire on 66 different foods, rating their liking of each item on a 9 point scale ranging from “extremely like” to “extremely dislike”. Standardized questionnaires were also administered to characterize subjects on selected personality traits (Temperament and Character Inventory – TCI) and alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale – TAS- 20). We conducted a linear regression between the mean of all food preferences and neuropsychological traits, using sex and age as covariates. The mean of food preferences was associated negatively with TAS total score (p= 7. 5 e- 05) and externally oriented cognitive style (<b>subitem</b> 3 of TAS- 20) (p= 2. 0 e- 07), and was positively associated with self-transcendence total score (ST) (p= 5. 9 e- 04) and spiritual acceptance (ST 3) (p= 6. 5 e- 04) among TCI dimensions. We conclude that food preferences are modulated by the enduring tendency to transcend contingent sensorimotor representations (ST) on the one hand, by difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal, and concrete thinking, often with the exclusion of emotional responses to stimuli of the other.

E and PROG levels varied significantly along the menstrual cycle, while those of FT, of global aggressiveness (GA) and of its <b>subitems</b> did not change. Values of global aggressiveness did not correlate with any of the hormonal parameters studied. However, E values correlated positively with "verbal aggression" scores in the follicular phase and positively with "resentment" in the premenstruum, while PROG levels correlated negatively with "suspiciousness" and "resentment" in the premenstrual phase of the cycle. Hormonal and psychological changes from one phase to the next (Δ) revealed that Δ E in the second half of the cycle correlated negatively with "verbal aggressiveness", while Δ PROG from follicular to luteal and from luteal to premenstrual phases correlated negatively with "resentment". Thus, although aggressiveness did not seem to vary along the menstrual cycle, nor to correlate with hormonal changes, hormone secretions and fluctuations might possibly modulate some of the physiological aspects of the behavioral parameter. © 2009 Elsevier B.

However, because of cultural and language difference, it is difficult for Chinese subjects to understand and answer questions in AD 8. This paper aims to make a new dementia self-rating questionnaire for Chinese people based on the AD 8, and to determine its value for dementia screening.   Methods According to early symptoms of dementia and life style of old Chinese people, a dementia self-rating questionnaire was made based on the AD 8. The new questionnaire includes 10 questions, and can be finished in 3 min. The reliability and validity was validated by a questionnaire survey in senior citizens older than 50 years in urban Xi'an. All patients were screened by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and dementia was diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Forth Edition (DSM-Ⅳ) criteria.   Results A total of 620 patients finished the new questionnaire, and among them 17 patients (2. 74 %) were diagnosed as dementia. The score of each question in the questionnaire was positively correlated with the total score (r s = 0. 300 - 0. 709; P = 0. 000, for all). The Cronbach α was 0. 795, indicating that the questionnaire got good internal consistency reliability. Two principal components were extracted, and the cumulative variance contribution ratio was 49. 771 %. Factor loading of each <b>subitem</b> was > 0. 500, indicating a good construct validity. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the critical value was 2, with the sensitivity 94. 10 % and specificity 82. 10 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND - Web-based {{and mobile}} health {{interventions}} (also called "Internet interventions" or "ehealth/mhealth interventions") are tools or treatments, typically behaviorally based, that are operationalized and transformed for delivery via the Internet or mobile platforms. These include electronic tools for patients, informal caregivers, healthy consumers, {{and health care}} providers. The " Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials " (CONSORT) was developed to improve the suboptimal reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). While broadly the CONSORT statement {{can be applied to}} provide guidance on how ehealth and mhealth trials should be reported, RCTs of web-based interventions pose very specific issues and challenges, in particular related to reporting sufficient details of the intervention to allow replication and theory-building. OBJECTIVE - To develop a checklist, dubbed CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile HEalth Applications and onLine TeleHealth), {{as an extension of the}} CONSORT statement that provides guidance for authors of ehealth and mhealth interventions. METHODS - A literature review was conducted, followed by a survey among ehealth experts and a workshop. RESULTS - An instrument and checklist was constructed as an extension of the CONSORT statement. The instrument has been adopted by the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) and authors of ehealth RCTs are required to submit an electronic checklist explaining how they addressed each <b>subitem.</b> CONCLUSIONS - CONSORT-EHEALTH has the potential to improve reporting and provides a basis for evaluating the validity and applicability of ehealth trials. Subitems describing how the intervention should be reported can also be used for non-RCT evaluation reports. As part of the development process, an evaluation component is essential, therefore feedback from authors will be solicited, and a before-after study will evaluate whether reporting has been improved...|$|E

The SF- 36 scores of the study patients were significantly lower than controls except in the Physical Role (PR) score (p 0. 05) score (p< 0. 01). The pain by VAS score was found to negative correlate with the SF- 36 <b>subitems</b> of PR (r=- 0. 37, p< 0. 01), Pain (r=- 0. 35, p< 0. 05) and Social Function (r=- 0. 35, p< 0. 01). Furthermore, it was found that a negative correlation between duration of dialysis and Physical Function score (r=- 0. 42, p< 0. 01) and positive correlation between duration of dialysis and vitality score (r= 0. 35, p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The follow-up criteria of the patients with hemodialysis should be questioned by quality of life and emotional states. Depression should be evaluated and if present it should be treated properly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are {{ubiquitous}} lipid mediators {{that act}} on specific (CB 1, CB 2) and non-specific (TRPV 1, PPAR) receptors. Despite many experimental animal studies proved eCB {{involvement in the}} pathogenesis of stroke, such evidence is still lacking in human patients. Our aim was to determine eCB peripheral levels in acute stroke patients and evaluate their relationship with clinical disability and stroke volume. Methods A cohort of ten patients with a first acute (within six hours since symptoms onset) ischemic stroke {{and a group of}} eight age- and sex-matched normal subjects were included. Groups were also matched for metabolic profile. All subjects underwent a blood sample collection for anandamide (AEA), 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) measurement; blood sampling was repeated in patients on admission (T 0), at 6 (T 1) and 18 hours (T 2) thereafter. Patients neurological impairment was assessed using NIHSS and Fugl-Meyer Scale arm <b>subitem</b> (FMSa); stroke volume was determined on 48 h follow-up brain CT scans. Blood samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry. Results 1) T 0 AEA levels were significantly higher in stroke patients compared to controls. 2) A significant inverse correlation between T 0 AEA levels and FMSa score was found. Moreover a positive correlation between T 0 AEA levels and stroke volume were found in stroke patients. T 0 PEA levels in stroke patients were not significantly different from the control group, but showed a significant correlation with the NIHSS scores. T 0 2 -AG levels were lower in stroke patients compared to controls, but such difference did not reach the significance threshold. Conclusions This is the first demonstration of elevated peripheral AEA levels in acute stroke patients. In agreement with previous murine studies, we found a significant relationship between AEA or PEA levels and neurological involvement, such that the greater the neurological impairment, the higher were these levels. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Long-standing {{evidence}} indicates that Alzheimer's disease patients with behavioral symptoms have a worse prognosis and a more rapid disease progression. The current retrospective analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of memantine in a subpopulation of patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibiting behavioral symptoms of agitation/aggression or psychosis at baseline. METHOD: A pooled analysis was conducted in people with agitation/aggression or psychosis from 3 large 6 -month, randomized studies in moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease. The effect of memantine and placebo on these specific symptoms was evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) <b>subitem</b> cluster of agitation and psychosis. Outcomes on global, cognitive, and functional measures were also analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty {{percent of the total}} patient group had baseline symptoms of agitation/aggression, delusions, or hallucinations on the NPI. At both 12 and 24 / 28 weeks, there was a significant treatment advantage for memantine over placebo for the proportion of patients showing improvement on the defined neuropsychiatric symptom cluster (55. 6 % vs. 44. 4 % at week 12, p =. 008; 58. 0 % vs. 44. 8 % at week 24 / 28, p =. 002) and specifically for the treatment of agitation/aggression (55. 3 % vs. 43. 1 % at week 12, p =. 011; 61. 0 % vs. 45. 0 % at week 24 / 28, p <. 001). Placebo-treated patients in this population demonstrated an accelerated disease progression for global (Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input), cognitive (Severe Impairment Battery), and functional (Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory 19 -item scale) outcomes, but memantine conferred statistically significant benefit for all measures. Tolerability in this population remained good, and fewer memantine-treated patients than placebo-treated patients withdrew due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis provides important evidence from placebo-controlled trials that memantine may be a safe and effective treatment in Alzheimer's disease patients with agitation/aggression or psychosis, who are otherwise prone to rapid progression. Memantine treatment provided benefits in cognitive, functional, and global outcomes in these patients and for their agitation/aggression...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{predictive}} validity of Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH; v. 3. 0) in monitoring healing of neuropathic foot ulcers in patients with diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: This is a 13 -week descriptive, prospective study describing the trajectory of change over time and the time-to-heal associated with PUSH scores. The study monitored a convenience sample of 18 subjects with Wagner 2 or greater neuropathic, nonischemic ulcers on the plantar surface of the foot, which healed completely over a 13 -week follow-up period. Every 2 weeks, the study ulcers were evaluated via PUSH. Healing was defined as complete reepithelialization. RESULTS: PUSH scores were modeled using a piecewise linear regression. PUSH values decreased significantly (P 3 ̆c. 0001) at a rate of 0. 6656 per week, until 2 weeks before healing, and then decreased significantly (P 3 ̆c. 0001) at a rate of 2. 2496 per week for the last 2 weeks of healing. Conversely, the time-to-heal (in weeks) increased significantly (P 3 ̆c. 0001), at a rate of 0. 6412 per each unit increase in PUSH for PUSH values of 4 or less, and then significantly (P 3 ̆c. 0001) increased at a rate of 1. 072 for PUSH values greater than 5. In predicting time-to-heal, the <b>subitem</b> of length x width alone (R = 0. 81) is comparable to the total PUSH score (R = 0. 76). Individually, exudate (R = 0. 36) and tissue type (R = 0. 42) are not nearly as useful as length x width. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that PUSH scores significantly decrease over time in healing neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that have no arterial etiologic component. Findings also suggest that total PUSH scores predict time-to-heal for DFU. We showed that a DFU with a PUSH score of 10 would be expected to heal in 8. 8 weeks (95...|$|E

50|$|That said, {{applications}} to development {{are discussed in}} Sen (1999), Nussbaum (2000), and Clark (2002, 2005), and are now numerous {{to the point where}} the capabilities approach is widely accepted as a paradigm in development. The programme of work operationalising the capability approach by Anand and colleagues draws heavily on Nussbaum's list as a relatively comprehensive, high-level account of the space in which human well-being or life quality is experienced. This work argues that the <b>subitems</b> on Nussbaum's list are too distinct to be monitored by single question and that a dashboard of some 40-50 indicators is required to inform the development of empirical work.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} depression on functional recovery after stroke. Design: Multicentre cohort study of 85 patients admitted for clinical rehabilitation. A two-stage case-finding procedure was used to identify patients with depression. For the control group, consecutive nondepressed stroke patients were enrolled. Patients were interviewed at 3 - 6 weeks and six months after stroke onset. Setting: Three rehabilitation centres {{in the vicinity of}} Amsterdam. Main outcome measures: Functional outcome was determined by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the Rehabilitation Activities Profile (RAP). Results. The prevalence of depression (35 %) was comparable with the findings of earlier studies in other settings. Patients classified as depressed according to DSM III R criteria had a significantly lower functional score, both at onset and after follow-up (FIM and RAP). There was, however, no significant difference in functional improvement between the depressed and the nondepressed group. Mean functional improvement in the six patients treated with antidepressants was 30 % better than in the untreated (depressed) patients; numbers were too small for the results to attain statistical significance. Subset analysis showed a significantly higher outcome for nondepressed patients for the FIM <b>subitems</b> personal care and transfers. However, functional improvement was not significantly different for any of the <b>subitems</b> in depressed versus nondepressed patients. Conclusion: Stroke patients with depression have significantly lower functional scores both at onset and after six months. Our results suggest under-recognition of post-stroke depression and a possible beneficial effect of antidepressant medication in depressed stroke patients. Further studies are required to determine the effect of antidepressants...|$|R
