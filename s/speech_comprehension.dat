25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} linguistic intelligence, {{it is important to}} understand the mechanisms that control speech and language. These mechanisms can be broken down into four major groups: speech generation (talking), <b>speech</b> <b>comprehension</b> (hearing), writing generation (writing), and writing comprehension (reading).|$|E
25|$|The Language Comprehension Department, {{headed by}} Anne Cutler, {{undertakes}} empirical investigation and computational modeling of {{the understanding of}} spoken language. Until 2009, the work within the department was largely divided between two research projects: decoding continuous speech and phonological learning for speech perception. From 2009 onwards, {{most of the work}} of the department goes into the project called Mechanisms and Representations in Comprehending Speech. This project focuses on core theoretical issues in <b>speech</b> <b>comprehension</b> such as on how episodic memories - such as hearing someone speak in an unfamiliar dialect - influence the speech perception system, or how is prior knowledge about one's language (phonotactic probabilities, lexical knowledge, frequent versus infrequent word combinations) used during perception.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the first}} 20 weeks after a {{cotton-top}} tamarin is born, {{it is not}} fully capable of producing the range of vocalizations that an adult monkey can. Despite this limitation on speech producibility, researchers believe that language acquisition occurs early on with <b>speech</b> <b>comprehension</b> abilities arising first. Infants can at times produce adult-like chirps, but this is rarely done in the correct context and remains inconsistent across the first 20 weeks of life. Regardless, infant cotton-tops are able to respond in behaviorally appropriate ways to varying contexts when presented with adult chirps. This indicates that verbal perception is a quickly acquired skill for offspring, followed closely by auditory comprehension, and later by proper vocal producibility.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>speech</b> and {{listening}} <b>comprehensions</b> are taught.|$|R
50|$|Therapists {{have been}} {{developing}} multiple methods of improving <b>speech</b> and <b>comprehension.</b> These techniques utilize three general principles: maximizing therapy occurrences, ensuring behavioral and communicative relevance, and allowing patients {{to focus on}} the language tools that are still available in his or her repertoire.|$|R

500|$|Neurolinguistics is {{historically}} {{rooted in the}} development in the 19th century of aphasiology, the study of linguistic deficits (aphasias) occurring {{as the result of}} brain damage. [...] Aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing. [...] One of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was Paul Broca, a French surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies, and found that most of them had brain damage (or lesions) on the left frontal lobe, in an area now known as Broca's area. Phrenologists had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain, but Broca's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship, and has been described as [...] "epoch-making" [...] and [...] "pivotal" [...] to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science. [...] Later, Carl Wernicke, after whom Wernicke's area is named, proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks, with Broca's area handling the motor production of speech, and Wernicke's area handling auditory <b>speech</b> <b>comprehension.</b> [...] The work of Broca and Wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain. [...] Early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of Korbinian Brodmann, who [...] "mapped" [...] the surface of the brain, dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area's cytoarchitecture (cell structure) and function; these areas, known as Brodmann areas, are still widely used in neuroscience today.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cognitive}} or linguistic {{part of a}} neurocomputational {{model of}} speech processing comprises the neural activation or generation of a phonemic representation {{on the side of}} speech production (e.g. neurocomputational and extended version of the Levelt model developed by Ardi Roelofs: [...] WEAVER++ as well as the neural activation or generation of an intention or meaning on the side of speech perception or <b>speech</b> <b>comprehension.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Such {{speech input}} output {{imitation}} often occurs independently of <b>speech</b> <b>comprehension</b> {{such as in}} speech shadowing when a person automatically says words heard in earphones, and the pathological condition of echolalia in which people reflexively repeat overheard words. This links to speech repetition of words being separate in the brain to speech perception. Speech repetition occurs in the [...] dorsal speech processing stream while speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by this route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay following [...] storage in phonological memory.|$|E
40|$|Depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{frequently}} associated with executive deficits, which can influence nonliteral comprehension and lexical access. This study explores whether depressive symptoms in PD modulate verbal fluency and nonliteral language comprehension. Twelve individuals with PD without depressive symptoms, 13 with PD and depressive symptoms (PDDSs), and 13 healthy controls completed a semantic and phonemic verbal fluency task and an indirect <b>speech</b> acts <b>comprehension</b> task. All groups {{had the same}} performance in the phonemic fluency task while the PDDS group was impaired in the semantic task. For the indirect <b>speech</b> act <b>comprehension</b> task, no difference was observed between the groups. However, the PDDS group had difficulty answering direct speech act questions.

50|$|Conduction Aphasia {{is a rare}} form of aphasia {{in which}} fibres in the arcuate {{fasciculus}} and superior longitudinal fasciculus are damaged. These fibres are {{the link between the}} Wernicke's and Broca's area. Damage to the area connecting comprehension and expression together has the following symptoms: fluent <b>speech,</b> good <b>comprehension,</b> poor oral reading, repetition is poor and transpositions of sounds within words is very common.|$|R
2500|$|The {{effect of}} damage to the {{superior}} temporal sulcus is consistent with several types of neurolinguistic deficiencies, and some contend that agnosia is one of them. The superior temporal sulcus is vital for <b>speech</b> <b>comprehension</b> because the region is highly involved with the lexical interface. According to the 1985 TRACE II Model, the lexical interface associates sound waves (phonemes) with morphological features to produce meaningful words. This association process is accomplished by lateral inhibition/excitement of certain words within an individual's lexicon (vocabulary). For instance, if an experimenter were to say DOG aloud, the utterance would activate and inhibit various words within the subjects lexical interface: ...|$|E
2500|$|Vocal imitiation {{arises in}} {{development}} before <b>speech</b> <b>comprehension</b> and also babbling: 18-week-old infants spontaneously copy vocal expressions provided the accompanying voice matches. [...] Imitation of vowels {{has been found}} as young as 12 weeks. It is independent of native language, language skills, word comprehension and a speaker's intelligence. Many autistic and some mentally disabled people engage in the echolalia of overheard words (often their only vocal interaction with others) without understanding what they echo. Reflex uncontrolled echoing of others words and sentences occurs in roughly half of those with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. The ability to repeat words without comprehension also occurs in mixed transcortical aphasia where it links to the sparing of the short-term phonological store.|$|E
50|$|Cognitive domains {{other than}} {{language}} are rarely affected early on. However, as the disease progresses other domains can be affected. Problems with writing, reading and <b>speech</b> <b>comprehension</b> can occur as can behavioural features similar to frontotemporal dementia.|$|E

2500|$|Through careful {{analysis}} of neuroimaging studies, a correlation {{has been developed}} with motor function and the understanding of action verbs.

5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{mechanisms}} involved in activity-dependent plasticity. These include LTP, long-term depression (LTD), synaptic elimination, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis. [...] The mechanisms of activity-dependent plasticity result in membrane depolarization and calcium influx, which in turn trigger cellular changes that affect synaptic connections and gene transcription. In essence, neuronal activity regulates gene expression related to dendritic branching and synapse development. Mutations in activity-dependent transcription-related genes can lead to neurological disorders. Each of the studies’ findings aims to help proper development of the brain while improving a wide variety of tasks such as <b>speech,</b> movement, <b>comprehension,</b> and memory. More so, the findings better explain the development induced by plasticity.|$|R
