40|$|Investigation of the {{conditions}} under which formal <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultations</b> of the Directorate General Energy of the European Commission can help integrate climate change policy in energy policy in the European Union suggests that <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultations</b> that aim at producing soft law and binding recommendations are rather insular, have low diversity of participants, and do not integrate climate change issues. Forums that aim at providing a discussion platform have higher diversity and integrate climate change issues to a certain extent. <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>consultations</b> can facilitate climate policy integration in European Union energy policy, as they take place early in the policy process. However, integration requires political commitment, and a concrete structure and format of the consultations that would facilitate integration. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{increased}} use of <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultations,</b> little is known about their impact on the legislative process. We examine how consultation of external actors during policy preparation affects decision making duration and efficiency. We test our predictions on EU legislative decision making and we find that whereas <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultations</b> in policy preparation may increase the democratic legitimacy of decision making, they result in efficiency losses in the subsequent legislative processes. Hence, rather than smoothing the way for quick legislative reconciliation, consultations increase the transaction costs of subsequent bargaining by prolonging the time needed to form the necessary coalitions and reach legislative deals. However, despite the proliferation of different tools for involving external actors, we find no differences in legislative speed between open and restricted consultations...|$|R
