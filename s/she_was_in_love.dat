5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In {{the beginning of her}} life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|After their {{marriage}} Chandrakumar takes Divya to Delhi, but she cannot accept him {{as her husband}} and ignores him. When he asks her what she would like as a wedding gift, she asks him for a divorce. Startled, Chandrakumar asks her why; in a flashback, Divya remembers when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with Manohar, whom she met as a college student. Manohar and his gang assault and rob the son of Thamizhmani, an MP. Divya reports Manohar to the police, and he is arrested. She later learns that Thamizhmani's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole {{the money to pay}} for the girl's medical treatment. Divya feels guilty, and bails him out.|$|E
5|$|The Divas {{rivalry between}} Mickie James and Trish Stratus over the WWE Women's Championship {{continued}} entering the event. Stratus and James first fought over the title at New Year's Revolution, with Stratus retaining. In {{the months that}} followed, James' obsession with Stratus grew {{to the point that}} she confessed to Stratus that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with her; making Stratus uncomfortable. James made one final attempt to kiss Stratus at Saturday Night's Main Event on March 18, after the duo defeated Candice Michelle and Victoria. After she was rebuffed, James attacked Stratus and later vowed to destroy her, turning James into a villainess. At WrestleMania 22, the evil James defeated Stratus to capture the Women's Championship {{for the first time in}} her career. In the following weeks, James continued her mind games by dressing like Stratus and claiming to be her. Stratus eventually confronted James by dressing like her and mocking her personality. It was later announced that a Women's Championship rematch between James and Stratus would take place at Backlash.|$|E

25|$|Tsukuru stays {{alone with}} Kuro, now a {{successful}} pottery artist. Eri prefers {{to dispense with}} nicknames and explains that Yuzu was mentally ill. The rape accusation was a fabrication, but he was cut off {{as a way of}} not frontally contradicting Yuzu to enable her to deal with her problems. Eri reveals that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with Tsukuru, which could {{have played a role in}} the accusation, but also that Yuzu was actually raped and had a miscarriage, then developed anorexia as a way of never being pregnant again. Eri told him nothing, maybe because he never noticed her love, but mostly to prevent a confrontation with Yuzu. Tsukuru was sacrificed to protect Yuzu because the group believed he was the strongest emotionally and could deal with the ban. These redemptive revelations give the lie to Tsukuru's own perception of himself as plain and colorless.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, {{while living}} in New York City, Humbert {{receives}} a letter from Dolores, now 17, telling him that she is married, pregnant, and {{in desperate need of}} money.

Humbert immediately leaves New York for Coalmont. He quickly tracks down Dolores and finds her living in clapboard house with her husband. Upon arriving, Humbert and Dolores discuss her new married life. Humbert realizes he's still in love with her and asks her to leave with him. She gently refuses. Also, he asks her who it was that abducted her from the hospital two years earlier. She reveals it was Quilty and that she willingly left because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with him. However, after moving into his mansion in Ramsdale, Quilty tried to make her star in one of his pornographic films but that she refused. He then expelled her from his home.

25|$|Outside the Indian subcontinent, in Indonesia, {{a version}} was {{developed}} in ancient Java as Kakawin Bhāratayuddha in the 11th century under the patronage of King Dharmawangsa (990–1016) and later it spread to the neighboring island of Bali, which remains a Hindu majority island today. It has become the fertile source for Javanese literature, dance drama (wayang wong), and wayang shadow puppet performances. This Javanese version of the Mahābhārata differs slightly from the original Indian version. For example, Draupadi is only wed to Yudhishthira, not to all the Pandava brothers; this might demonstrate ancient Javanese opposition to polyandry. The author later added some female characters to be wed to the Pandavas, for example, Arjuna is described as having many wives and consorts next to Subhadra. Another difference is that Shikhandini does not change her sex and remains a woman, to be wed to Arjuna, and takes {{the role of a}} warrior princess during the war. Another twist is that Gandhari is described as antagonistic character who hates the Pandavas: her hate is out of jealousy because during Gandhari's swayamvara, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with Pandu but was later wed to his blind elder brother instead, whom she did not love, so she blindfolded herself as protest. Another notable difference is the inclusion of the Punakawans, the clown servants of the main characters in the storyline. These characters include Semar, Petruk, Gareng and Bagong, who are much-loved by Indonesian audiences. There are also some spin-off episodes developed in ancient Java, such as Arjunawiwaha composed in 11th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1819-1820, Droste spent a {{year with}} the Haxthausens at Bökerhof, {{interrupted}} only by a stay at the nearby spa town of Bad Driburg, where she hoped {{to find a cure}} for her health problems. Here she became romantically involved with Heinrich Straube (1794–1847), a law student with literary interests, who was a friend of her step-uncle August. What happened next is unclear, but it appears that some members of the Haxthausen family, led by Annette's step-aunt Anna (who was in fact four years her junior), disapproved of the relationship because Straube was a middle-class Protestant, and they devised a scheme {{to put an end to}} it. While Straube was away pursuing his legal studies at the University of Göttingen, they persuaded another young man with literary ambitions, August von Arnswaldt, who came from an upper-class Protestant family, to pretend to pay court to Annette. At first flattered by Arnswaldt's attentions, she gave some indications <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with him, before telling him she really loved Straube. By this time it was too late, however, as Arnswaldt had all the evidence he needed. He travelled to Göttingen and told Straube of Annette's behaviour. The two men wrote a joint letter (which has not been preserved), breaking off all contact with her. She never saw either man again. A few years later, Arnswaldt married Anna von Haxthausen, the ringleader of the intrigue. Straube became a lawyer in Kassel and married in 1824. When he died in 1847, a lock of Droste's hair was found among his possessions. The affair was a catastrophe for Droste and damaged her future marriage prospects. Shocked by the role the Haxthausens had played in the intrigue, she refused to visit Bökerhof for the next 18 years.|$|E

The writers debated several aspects of her character, her status and reaction to Donna in particular. Raynor elected to emphasise Martha's medical career over her military career, and avoided a [...] "handbags at dawn" [...] scenario because she felt it would rehash Rose Tyler's (Billie Piper) initial opinion of former companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) from the second series episode [...] "School Reunion".|$|E

500|$|Using the {{theories}} of Michel Foucault as their guide, Casey Finch and Peter Bowen in their 1990 essay [...] "'The Tittle-Tattle of Highbury': Gossip and the Free Indirect Style in Emma" [...] argued the free indirect discourse in Austen validates Fouucault's thesis that the Enlightenment was a fraud, an insidious form of oppression posing as liberation. Finch and Bowen argued that voice of the omnipresent narrator and together with the free indirect discourse summarizing the thoughts of characters in Emma were a form of [...] "surveillance" [...] that policed the thoughts of the character; seen in this light, Emma Woodhouse's discovery that she loves Mr. Knightley is not an expression of her real feelings, but rather society imposing its values on her mind by persuading {{her that she had}} to engage in a heterosexual marriage to produce sons to continue the Establishment and the while fooling her into thinking <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>love.</b>|$|E
