25|$|The pusher was {{designed}} to FAR Part 23 certification standards of the time. It uses aluminum construction for the wings and tail surfaces. The fiberglass landing gear and flaps are hydraulically activated. The nosegear steering is also hydraulic with electric controls. The fuselage uses a 4130 steel welded <b>square</b> <b>steel</b> tube frame with composite skin covering. Every component can be installed prior to skin installation, and in theory, could even be flown without the skins. The wing skins are formed cold using dry ice, then age hardened to T-42 standards. The engine is mounted far aft with a 12-inch propeller extension.|$|E

50|$|The <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> {{is a tool}} used in carpentry. Carpenters use various {{tools to}} lay out {{structures}} that are square (that is, built at accurately measured right angles), {{many of which are}} made of steel, but the name <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> refers to a specific long-armed square that has additional uses for measurement, especially of various angles. Today the <b>steel</b> <b>square</b> is more commonly referred to as the framing square or carpenter's square. It consists of a long arm and a shorter arm, which meet at an angle of 90 degrees (a right angle). It can also be made of aluminum or polymers, which are light and resistant to rust.|$|R

When lowered, the Francis gate seals the city's canal system off from its source on the Merrimack. The Great Gate, as it is also called, was built in 1850 under the direction of James B. Francis.

Three algorithms were developed to simulate the grain structures on chill, columnar and equiaxed zones. These include routines to simulate grain nucleation and growth. These routines were compiled separately from the main routine {{in order to make}} more efficient the simulator. Algorithms analyze each node at every step time during simulation and a graphical interface is used to display the results on the screen. Chaos theory is used for integrating a random selection process. The result is an image formed with cells that represent grains (cellular automaton) displayed on the screen based on a numeric code assigned to the nodal positions...|$|R
