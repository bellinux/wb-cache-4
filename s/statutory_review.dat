50|$|Concern {{continued}} to grow about {{the structure of the}} NHS and weaknesses of the tripartite system. Powell agreed the creation of a Royal Commission on doctors’ pay, which resulted in a <b>statutory</b> <b>review</b> body.

This resulted in the concept of the primary health care in better housed and better staffed practices, stimulating doctors to join together and the development of the modern group practice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first two}} types of review listed above are not of much {{relevance}} to administrative law, although there is some overlap between the grounds for reviewing the decisions of inferior courts and the grounds for reviewing the decisions of administrators. For the most part, the term [...] "judicial review"—when used {{in the context of}} administrative law, and when used without qualification—means the review of administrative decisions and delegated legislation. Special <b>statutory</b> <b>review</b> is also a concern of administrative law, as it generally operates as an alternative or potential alternative to the review of administrative decisions and delegated legislation under the PAJA.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the Commission {{completed}} its Fourth <b>Statutory</b> <b>Review</b> of Electoral Arrangements, {{as required by}} the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, producing new wards for use in single transferable vote elections which each return 3 or 4 councillors. These were first used in elections in 2007. The review resulted in a total of 353 wards across Scotland, returning a total of 1222 councillors. A subsequent interim review in 2011 did not change any ward boundaries, but increased the number of councilors to 1223 from May 2012. A fifth review in 2016 resulted in ward boundaries being changed yet again, though some of the proposed were not implemented, such as in Argyll and Bute.|$|E

5000|$|The statute book {{is replete}} with {{examples}} of special <b>statutory</b> <b>review.</b> One example is the review of decisions made {{in terms of the}} Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA), which takes place on grounds to be gleaned from that statute. Others are the review of a [...] "decision, ruling, order or taxation" [...] of the Master in terms of section 151 of the Insolvency Act and the provision in section 145 of the Labour Relations Act for review of arbitration awards made by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). The review of private (consensual) arbitration takes place in terms of section 33(1) of the Arbitration Act on grounds that overlap somewhat with those applying to the proceedings of inferior courts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{legislature}} may {{and often}} does confer {{on the courts}} a statutory power of review. This is [...] "special" [...] because it differs from [...] "ordinary" [...] judicial review in the administrative-law sense (as now governed by PAJA).

While Innes CJ spoke of the <b>statutory</b> <b>review</b> power as being [...] "far wider" [...] than the first two kinds of review mentioned by him, [...] "it is clear that the precise extent of the power always depends on the particular statutory provision concerned."

40|$|This paper {{emerges from}} {{a case study of}} the system of <b>statutory</b> <b>reviews</b> in older people’s care homes in the UK. Informed by a review of {{selected}} literature on gaining access, this paper provides a critical account of the process of negotiating access with gatekeepers (chiefly, care home managers). The negotiations were time-consuming and largely fruitless in terms of actually gaining access to care home residents. Nevertheless, much was learned about the field, in particular, about the attitudes of those with responsibility for caring for older care home residents. The residents in care homes became “hard to reach” research subjects not necessarily because of any cognitive or communicative impairments on their part, but by the defensive attitudes adopted by gatekeepers. It concludes by suggesting that, in this case, the ambiguous shades of meaning conveyed by the concept of “screener” make it a more appropriate term to describe the role than that of “gatekeeper”...|$|R
50|$|McClellan was {{admitted}} to practise law as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 26 July 1974, and worked {{for a short time}} as a solicitor at Hall and Hall. He was called to the Bar on 2 May 1975. His legal practice primarily consisted of planning and environmental law, administrative law, valuation and water-related matters, as well as advising government agencies. From 1984 to 1985, he held the role of Counsel Assisting the Maralinga Royal Commission into British nuclear testing in Australia. Also that year, he was appointed Queen's Counsel. He later served as Chairman of the New South Wales State Government Inquiry into Swimming Pool Safety from 1988 to 1991, Acting and Assistant Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption from 1992 to 1993, and supervised the <b>statutory</b> <b>review</b> of the Sydney Casino licence in 1997 and 2000.|$|E
50|$|Warrants {{are valid}} for 90 days from issuance. In the Second Reading Speech the Hon. Michael Gallacher (member for the Opposition) {{provided}} that the 90-day period is too long. Under the old Act, the period a warrant was valid for was 21 days. If it was needed {{for a longer period}} of time an application for an extension could be made. He spoke of the ease at which police officers were able to extend their warrants if necessary under the old act and stated that the 21-day provision put forward by the Opposition will enable “a degree of checks and balances and ensure the maintenance of probity”. Member for the Greens Ms Rhiannon Lee describes the extension of the warrant period as “an extraordinary shift. The Government was offered no convincing case for such a lengthy extension.” Hatzistergos replied that “a bunch of bleeding hearts, the Council for Civil Liberties actually supported it to a 90-day warrant period”. In a submission to the Department of Attorney-General and Justice regarding the <b>statutory</b> <b>review</b> of the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) dated 27 September 2013, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties state that they never supported this extension, and maintain the position that the 90-day period should be reduced to 21 days.|$|E
5000|$|The commissioners {{held their}} first public meeting on 6 May 2010. The National Government {{initially}} promised {{a return to}} elected councillors with the local elections in October 2013. In September 2012, this was revised for commissioners to stay until the October 2016 local elections. In March 2014, a <b>statutory</b> <b>review</b> in ECan was begun, and the National Government released a public discussion document in March 2015 outlining a proposal for the regional council's future, with a stated preference for a mixed model of seven elected members and six members appointed by the government. Nick Smith, as Minister for the Environment, stated that [...] "it may be appropriate to consider these options beyond 2019". Louise Upston, as Associate Minister for Local Government, justified the mixed model as it [...] "could provide the necessary stability for Canterbury from 2016". Former district councillor and now member of parliament Sage criticised the government backdown as denying Cantabrians {{to make their own}} decisions. Artist Sam Mahon, who is a strong opponent of the sacking of the councillors, gave his opinion as the proposal presenting [...] "just status quo, that gives the perception of democracy". Smith confirmed the mixed model in July 2015, with seven councillors to be elected in 2016 alongside six appointed commissioners, with a return to a fully elected council in 2019.|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} of the <b>statutory</b> care home <b>review</b> system in one Local Authority. <b>Statutory</b> <b>reviews</b> of older people's care home {{placements}} are {{a legacy of the}} Community Care reforms of the 1990 s in the UK. Using a mixed method approach this small-scale qualitative study was designed to explore how the <b>statutory</b> care home <b>review</b> system operated from the perspectives of its multiple stakeholders, but paying particular attention to the role played by the older person. The study also set out to assess the relevance and usefulness of the concept of 'street-level bureaucracy' as developed by Upsky (1980) in understanding how discretion was used in operating the system. It is argued that, in a context in which the adult social care sector has been 'transformed' by processes of privatisation, marketization and 'modernisation', the exercise of discretion is no longer the sale preserve of 'street-level bureaucrats' (front-line practitioners), but rather, it is dispersed among the various statutory and non-statutory actors in the review system, including managers, care home providers relatives and older -people themselves. The study revealed a system which had undergone multiple reorganisations in response to a variety of national and local policy initiatives and, against this context, was struggling to cope with the implementation of ambiguous and, often, conflicting policy agendas. Overall, the system was compromised by the need to balance ensuring care standards with the need to meet performance targets, often leading managers, practitioners and care providers to have to tolerate sub-optimal standards of care. It is proposed that, generally, in order for review actors to manage the tensions inherent in the system, it was helpful if the older person either voluntarily adopted or was steered into a position of passive participation in care reviews, suggesting that reviews can be as much a source of disempowerment for older people as empowerment.

5000|$|Summary [...] The 2007 Welfare Reform Act {{made it a}} {{statutory}} requirement {{for the performance of}} the WCA to be reviewed annually for parliament. Reviews took place from 2010 to 2014, carried out by doctors who were not part of the civil service. These reviews made recommendations for improvements to the end-to-end process, many of which were accepted in principle by the DWP. The key recommendations for the central outsourced part of the testing process were made in 2010; some of these were put into practice in 2011. The most significant change to the WCA took place in early 2011, when the criteria for judging fitness to work were changed in law (after an overhaul by medically-qualified civil servants, in a separate process from the <b>statutory</b> <b>reviews</b> for parliament). In 2016, the DWP announced that it would try to avoid reassessing recipients with conditions that would only get worse, and those whose level of disability was expected to remain the same. Other small ad hoc modifications were made sporadically {{over the course of the}} WCA's deployment.|$|R
