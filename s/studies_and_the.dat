5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's <b>studies,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction <b>studies,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.|$|E

5|$|A Master of Business Administration (MBA) {{program was}} added in 1961, {{and the school}} formed its National Advisory Council in 1966. In 1973, the school {{bestowed}} its first International Executive of the Year Award to AT President Robert D. Lilley. Bruce B. Orton served as interim {{dean of the school}} for a year until 1975, when Merrill J. Bateman was recruited from a management position at candy-maker Mars, Inc. for the job as dean. That same year, the school was separated into the School of Management for undergraduate <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Graduate School of Management, which grouped together the MBA, MPA, MOB, and MAcc programs. A year later (1976), the business school created a School of Accountancy within its jurisdiction and printed its first issue of Exchange magazine (now Marriott Alumni Magazine). In 1977, the BYU Management Society was organized.|$|E
5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E

5|$|Following German reunification, the US {{government}} {{announced plans to}} fully withdraw its troops from Frankfurt, Germany by 1995, at which time control of the entire site would be restored to the German Federal Government. It was suggested that the building could become the location for the European Central Bank. In 1996, the state of Hesse bought the building and associated land for the University of Frankfurt. The buildings were refurbished {{at a cost of}} 50 Million German Mark (about US $26M or 25M €), by the Copenhagen-based architecture practice Dissing+Weitling and were handed over to the university. The complex now houses the Westend Campus of the university, which includes the departments of Philosophy, History, Theology, Classical Philology, Art and Music, Modern Languages and Linguistics, Cultural and Civilization Studies, the Center for North American <b>Studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Fritz-Bauer-Institute.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University offers {{undergraduate}} {{degrees in}} forty-eight majors {{in the four}} undergraduate schools, {{as well as the}} opportunity for students to design their courses of study.

Students in the School of Foreign Service can complete select certificates which complement the school's focus on foreign affairs and attain a minor in one of twelve languages but {{do not have access to}} the same minor selection as the other three schools. All courses are on a credit hour system. Georgetown offers many opportunities to study abroad, and about 50% of the undergraduate student body spends time at an institution overseas.|$|E

Six private universities are located in Chittagong Division. All six have their main campuses in Chittagong city. One has its urban campus in Kumira, outside the main city. Five of them are general universities, while one specializes in science and technology. The only private university in Rajshahi Division has its campus in Bogra.

5|$|Rubin {{studied for}} her Ph.D. at Georgetown University, the only {{university}} in Washington, DC that offered {{a graduate degree}} in astronomy. She was 23 years old and pregnant when she began her doctoral <b>studies,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rubins had one young child at home. She began to take classes with Francis Heyden, who recommended her to George Gamow, her eventual doctoral advisor. Her dissertation, completed in 1954, concluded that galaxies clumped together, rather than being randomly distributed through the universe, a controversial idea not pursued by others for two decades. Throughout her graduate studies, she experienced discouraging sexism, including an incident where she {{was not allowed to}} meet with her advisor in his office, because women were not allowed in that area of the university.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Medicine is {{affiliated}} with a network of ten teaching hospitals, providing medical treatment, research and advisory services to patients and clients from Canada and abroad. A core member of the network is University Health Network, itself a specialized federation of Toronto General Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Western Hospital, and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. Physicians in the medical institutes have cross-appointments to faculty and supervisory positions in university departments. The Rotman School of Management developed the discipline and methodology of integrative thinking, upon which the school bases its curriculum. Founded in 1887, the Faculty of Law's emphasis on formal teachings of liberal arts and legal theory was then considered unconventional, but gradually helped shift the country's legal education system away from the apprenticeship model that prevailed until the mid-20th century. The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education is the teachers college of the university, {{affiliated with}} its two laboratory schools, the Institute of Child Study and the University of Toronto Schools. Autonomous institutes at the university include the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval <b>Studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Fields Institute.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> world of Aristotle.|$|E
