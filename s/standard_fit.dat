25|$|The ships' {{armament}} {{concentrated on}} anti-aircraft (AA) defence and comprised two 4-inch AA guns in single mounts, eight Bofors 40mm AA guns in twin mounts, and 21 Oerlikon 20mm AA cannons in single or twin mounts as the <b>standard</b> <b>fit.</b> In practice all the ships had slightly different weapons mounted. Attacker, Chaser, and Hunter only had four single 20mm AA cannons, the rest being double mounts. Of the other ships, Battler had two, Stalker had six, and Fencer had seven single 20mm cannons. Pursuer had four extra 40mm AA guns, and Striker had six extra {{in place of}} twin 20mm mounts.|$|E
25|$|Other sonars {{such as the}} {{airborne}} sonar Mihir are in trials, whilst work is proceeding apace on {{a new generation of}} sonars. Sonars may be considered one of DRDO's most successful achievements as the Indian Navy's most powerful ships rely on DRDO made sonars. The <b>standard</b> <b>fit</b> for a front line naval ship would include the HUMSA-NG hull mounted sonar and the Nagin towed array sonar. The Mihir is a dunking sonar meant for use by the Naval ALH, working in conjunction with its Tadpole sonobuoy. The Panchendriya is in production for the Kilo class submarine upgrades.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} fixed armament {{system for}} the US Army's AH-1S Upgunned Cobra (eventually redesignated AH-1E Enhanced Cobra Armament System or ECAS) and the AH-1S Modernized Cobra (eventually redesignated the AH-1F), as well as, the US Marine Corps' AH-1J, AH-1T, AH-1W, and AH-1Z helicopters. The system was designed to fit either the M197 20mm three barreled cannon or the XM188 30mm three barreled cannon. In practice the M197 was the <b>standard</b> <b>fit</b> and the XM188 was not adopted for service. The turret has 110 degrees of motion in azimuth, 21 degrees of elevation, and 50 degrees of depression, with a slew rate in azimuth of 80 degrees per second and in elevation and depression of 60 degrees per second.|$|E

50|$|Electronic {{multi-function}} fuzes {{started to}} appear around 1980. Using solid-state electronics they were relatively cheap and reliable, {{and became the}} <b>standard</b> <b>fitted</b> fuze in operational ammunition stocks in some western armies. The early versions were often limited to proximity airburst, albeit with height of burst options, and impact. Some offered a go/no-go functional test through the fuze setter.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} {{vehicles}} has also evolved to improve protection after collision, both for vehicle occupants {{and for those}} outside of the vehicle. Much of this work was led by automotive industry competition and technological innovation, leading to measures such as Saab's safety cage and reinforced roof pillars of 1946, Ford´s 1956 Lifeguard safety package, and Saab and Volvo's introduction of <b>standard</b> <b>fit</b> seatbelts in 1959. Other initiatives were accelerated {{as a reaction to}} consumer pressure, after publications such as Ralph Nader's 1965 book Unsafe at Any Speed accused motor manufacturers of indifference towards safety.|$|E
50|$|Even {{at the end}} of the {{war there}} was a need for more ships able to carry minor landing craft, and two of the LST (3)s then {{completing}} were specially fitted to carry LCM (7). These craft, which were 58 ft long and weighed about 28 tons, were carried transversely on the upper deck of the ship. They were hoisted on by means of a specially fitted 30-ton derrick; This 30-ton derrick replaced a 15-ton derrick, two of which were the <b>standard</b> <b>fit</b> of the LST (3). The 30-ton derrick was taller and generally more substantial than the 15 ton one.|$|E
