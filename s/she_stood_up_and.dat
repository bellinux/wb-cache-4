She also performed it at Britney Spears: In the Zone, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. [...] "Everytime" [...] was also performed by Spears at 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour. Before the tour began, Spears said that it was one of the songs she was looking most forward to perform, explaining, [...] "I really think I'm talking to everyone when I perform 'Everytime'". It was the first song of the third act, titled [...] "Mystic Garden". It began with a video interlude in which Spears walked into a garden wearing a rainbow-colored dress and sat in a flower-covered piano. As the video ended, it was revealed that she was sitting onstage in a similar setting. She started the performance talking to the audience about the media coverage of her personal life. She played the piano and sang until the second verse, where <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walked to the center of the stage to continue the performance. Neil Strauss of The New York Times commented, [...] "It was the only song that she appeared to sing unaccompanied by backing tapes". Kelefa Sanneh of Blender called it the best performance of the show.|$|E

50|$|Emma {{sees her}} father inside a Dallas jail. He blames the Ewings for her behavior. She informs {{him that he}} is the one whom <b>she</b> emulates. <b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walks away. When he sees Ann in the doorway, he scolds her for relishing his misfortune. Ann retorts that she is not as sadistic as he is.|$|R

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{the heavy}} fur coat slipped easily {{away from her}} slim, elegant little body.|$|E
60|$|But {{he made no}} sign. Then <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> her cry {{of horror}} rang through the house.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> faced Duane {{with the}} fire and {{intelligence}} {{of a woman in}} her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "That he would, without {{anything}} but what <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> in. <b>And</b> he'd behave very handsome to anyone {{that would help}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|They were {{obliged to}} tell Sophy {{of the state of}} things. <b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> straight, <b>and</b> said, slowly and clearly, 'I do not like the world at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She spoke not, nor turned not, [...] Nor {{any sign}} she cast, [...] Only <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> {{straight}} <b>and</b> free, [...] Between the flowers in Athelney, [...] And the river running past.|$|R

60|$|When {{she came}} to, <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looked round, astonished. Her face was white, her eyes {{brilliant}} and large.|$|E

50|$|Beth goes to Lianne's {{house to}} find her daughter. She finds Lianne, who tells her that Jodie has gone home. Beth flees the house, {{narrowly}} avoiding the soldiers.

60|$|So {{astonishing}} was {{the wondrous}} sight that {{one and all}} of us, save <b>She,</b> who <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> stretched her hands towards the fire, sank down before it, and hid our faces in the sand.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{looked him}} {{straight}} in the face. He met her eye to eye, and never wavered till her own fell.|$|E
60|$|Josie's {{self-control}} wasn't proof {{against this}} second shock. Her blue eyes stared amazed. With a low exclamation <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> faced the woman.|$|E

When Toby isn't aggressive enough for Kelly Kapoor's taste, <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> begins threatening and swinging at him, after which Andy defends Toby and gets punched in his other eye.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} chorus, Burke steps onto a train and sits down right at the rear of the carriage.

Burke then continues to dance in an empty car park, where she and her team perform a further dance routine. The video finishes with Burke and her dancers posing in the car park.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> silently, <b>and</b> Wolfenden, {{with slow}} fingers, raised her cloak {{from the back}} of the chair and covered her shoulders. She thanked him softly, and turning away, walked down the room {{followed}} by the two men. In the ante-room Mr. Sabin stopped.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> faced me {{with the}} fire and {{intelligence}} {{of a woman in}} her eyes. [...] "Tell me now. You were spying on my uncle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{her face}} was bright. [...] "Why did you not tell me before?" [...] she asked. [...] "And all this time we have been here!" ...|$|E

60|$|They {{were close}} {{to the line of}} surf now; they had passed it, indeed, a little on the left, and the boat was drifting. <b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> {{straight}} <b>and</b> stern, and her face, as she looked towards the land, was lit with the fire of the prophetess.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{featured}} Gloria, a convicted escapee {{on the run}} from government officials, seeking refuge in a movie theater. The parallels between what are scenes from the feature presentation and what is actually occurring becomes diluted as the video progresses, culminating in what appears to be Gloria's apprehension by the government agents on a rooftop. However, this proves to be a false climax as the agents then enter the theater. One of them points at the projected image on the screen and the three agents approach it, believing it to be Gloria. Meanwhile, Gloria is actually sitting in the theater, a couple of rows in front of the band. <b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sneaks out of the theater undetected.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> smiling graciously, <b>and</b> {{her little}} figure {{seemed to be}} diminished still more by the heavy mass of her hair and the long train of her gown.|$|R
