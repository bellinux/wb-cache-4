By 1200UTC on June24, the storm weakened into a tropical depression while situated roughly 100mi (155km) west of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Shortly after, the depression sharply turned north and degenerated into a trough of low pressure, no longer a tropical cyclone.|$|E

50|$|Urban dust domes are a {{meteorological}} phenomenon in which soot, dust, and chemical emissions become {{trapped in the}} air above urban spaces. This trapping is a product of local air circulations. Calm surface winds are drawn to urban centers, they then rise above the city and descend slowly {{on the periphery of the}} developed core. This cycle is often a cause of smog through photochemical reactions that occur when strong concentrations of the pollutants in this cycle are exposed to solar radiation.

Recent studies suggest that around 5 % of global dust emissions come from sources in the highlatitudes (≥ 50 °N and ≥ 40 °S). A substantial proportion of this dust remains within the high latitudes and is deposited in marine and terrestrial environments. <b>Stable</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> and limited atmospheric convection associated with cold climates reduce vertical mixing of dust plumes and can restrict the altitudes at which the deposition of dust originating from high latitudes can take place.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters and the definitive published version is available at [URL] contribution of mineral dust from high-latitude sources has remained an under-examined feature of the global dust cycle. Dust events originating at high latitudes can provide inputs of aeolian sediment to regions lying well outside the subtropical dust belt. Constraining the seasonal variability and preferential pathways of dust from high-latitude sources is important for understanding the potential impacts that the dust may have on wider environmental systems, such as nearby marine or cryospheric domains. This study quantifies dust pathways from two areas exhibiting different emission dynamics {{in the north and}} south of Iceland, which is a prominent Northern Hemisphere dust source. The analysis uses air parcel trajectory modelling, {{and for the first time}} for high-latitude sources, explicitly links all trajectory simulations to time-specific (meteorological) observations of suspended dust. This approach maximises the potential for trajectories to represent dust, and illustrates that trajectory climatologies not limited to dust can grossly overestimate the potential for dust transport. Preferential pathways emerge that demonstrate the role of Iceland in supplying dust to the Northern Atlantic and sub-Arctic oceans. For dust emitted from northern sources, a dominant route exists to the northeast, into the Norwegian, Greenland and Barents Seas, although there is also potential for delivery to the North Atlantic in summer months. From the southern sources, the primary pathway extends into the North Atlantic, with a high density of trajectories extending as far south as 50 ºN, particularly in spring and summer. Common to both southern and northern sources is a pathway to the west-southwest of Iceland into the Denmark Strait and towards Greenland. For trajectories simulated at ≤ 500 m, the vertical development of dust plumes from Iceland is limited, likely due to the <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> of the region suppressing the potential for vertical motion. Trajectories rarely ascend high enough to reach the central portions of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The overall distribution of trajectories suggests that contributions of Icelandic dust are relatively more important for neighbouring marine environments than the cryosphere...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the water budget and surface energy balance of a Svalbard glacier (midre Lovénbreen) over a 6 year period (1997 - 2002). Fresh-water yields {{are found to}} lie between 1. 1 and 1. 5 m a− 1 and reflect variable amounts of glacier ice ablation (0. 27 ± 0. 15 m a− 1) and more consistent amounts of snowmelt and summer precipitation (0. 40 ± 0. 10 and 0. 49 ± 0. 12 m respectively). Between 24 % and 36 % of the annual runoff is thought to pass through a subglacial drainage system. Although the site is heavily influenced by <b>stable</b> maritime <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> during the summer, surface melting is achieved largely by net shortwave radiation fluxes (74 - 100 % of ablation). Water budget analysis shows that the annual runoff yields may be strongly influenced by water storage within the glacial system. Storage can occur over the winter period and force the early development of the subglacial drainage system during the following summer. Thus annual water fluxes from this glacier cannot be estimated from glacial mass-balance data alone {{and there is a}} need to assess the implications of overwinter storage for our understanding of glacial dynamics, annual fluvial process rates and mixing processes in Svalbard's fjords...|$|R

We compare here the diurnal, seasonal and vertical variability of urban aerosols as described by a lidar ceilometer and surface particulate matter (PM 10) concentrations using 4 years of observations available at Santiago, Chile, a city having a serious PM 10 air pollution problem. Large diurnal variation of ceilometer backscatter values is observed on average up to 600 m (400 m) above the surface in spring and summer (fall and winter). The diurnal cycles of near-surface ceilometer backscatter and PM 10 concentrations show prominent morning peaks. The large PM 10 evening peak is less marked in the ceilometer backscatter values, suggesting that this significant feature of Santiago's air pollution is constrained to a shallow atmospheric layer. Daily averages of PM 10 concentrations and ceilometer backscatter have correlations of 0. 5 for the full data set, and a maximum of 0. 75 for April. Results are supplemented with recently available observations gathered with a 355 nm elastic lidar. While the smaller blind region of the ceilometer provides a more complete picture of the aerosol layer dynamics, the higher resolution of the lidar allows a better definition of the aerosol layer structure. Both instruments suggest the frequent development of complex aerosol layers appearing over Santiago during the evening transition.

40|$|According to the Norwegian cyclone model, {{whether a}} warm-type or cold-type {{occluded}} front forms de-pends upon which cold <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> is colder: the prewarm-frontal <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> or the postcold-frontal <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> For example, a cold-type occlusion {{is said to}} occur when the occluded front slopes rearward with height because the prewarm-frontal airmass is warmer than the postcold-frontal airmass. This temperature difference and the resulting occluded-frontal structure in the Norwegian cyclone model {{is part of what}} is called the temperature rule. Paradoxically, no clear example of a rearward-sloping, cold-type occluded front has been found in the literature, even though the required temperature difference has been documented in several cases. This article presents the first documented, rearward-sloping, cold-type occluded front. This occluded front forms in a cy-clone over the North Atlantic Ocean on 3 – 5 January 2003 and is documented in model output from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Cross sections through the evolving cyclone show the occluded front forms as the less statically stable warm-frontal zone ascends over the more stable cold-frontal zone. Such a stability difference between the cold- and warm-frontal zones is consistent with a pre-viously published hypothesis that the less <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> is lifted by the more <b>stable</b> <b>air</b> to form occluded fronts, in disagreement with the temperature rule. Because warm-frontal zones and the cold air underneath tend to be more stable than cold-frontal zones and the postcold-frontal air, warm-type occluded fronts are much more common than cold-type occluded fronts, explaining why well-defined, rearward-sloping, cold-type occluded fronts are not common in the meteorological literature. 1...|$|R
