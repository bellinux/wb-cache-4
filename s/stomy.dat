2500|$|She [...] {{performed}} a duo with <b>Stomy</b> Bugsy in 2001 {{under the title}} [...] "Aucun Dieu ne pourra me pardonner" [...] (No God Will Ever Forgive Me). The single [...] "J'ai confiance en toi" [...] (I Trust You), released in February 2001, became the first single that charted in the French Singles Chart, peaked at #38 in France and stayed in the chart for 13 weeks. The second single slated from the album did perform better than the first one. [...] "Chaque fois" [...] (Every Time) was released in August 2001 and peaked at #27 in the French Top 100 Singles, remaining in the chart for 18 weeks, five more than the first single. After the success of both singles, Nâdiya recorded a full studio album that became [...] "Changer les choses" [...] (Changing the Things). Though the singles became reasonable hits, the album wasn't very popular in France, not charting {{at all in the}} French Top 200 Albums. She was nominated for the Victoires de la musique in 2002.|$|E

40|$|Classic {{treatment}} of high anal fistulas by the laying open technique requires total or subtotal {{section of the}} sphincter muscles and results in anal incontinence. This study assesses {{the efficacy of the}} flap advancement technique in these cases. It entails the resection of the crypt at the origin of the fistula, the area being covered by a mucomuscular flap of the rectal wall. From 1977 to early 1992, 18 patients (13 female and 5 male patients; mean age : 40 years) presenting with a deep anal fistula underwent such an operation. There were 16 suprasphincteric and 2 high transsphincteric tracts. Associated IBD was noted in 7 cases (5 Crohn's colitis, 2 UC). Five fistulas were of obstetrical origin. In 8 cases, patients had undergone previous surgical treatments without success. All patients had a flap advancement. In 2 cases, a colostomy had been previously carried out. Two more diverting <b>stomies</b> were performed (combined abdominal procedures). No mortality or morbidity was encountered. Mean postoperative stay was 8 days. Current status could be established in all patients. Three immediate failures were observed (1 case of Crohn's disease, two recurring cases). All the other patients did well with persistent healing of the fistula after a mean follow-up of 61 months (range, 6 - 150). Three <b>stomies</b> were closed; one patient delayed the procedure. Functional results were excellent. In the > group, all the evaluable patients (14 / 15) had normal fecal continence. Two female patients are still complaining of mild flatus incontinence. In the failure group, the preoperative anorectal function was maintained. These good results are confirmed by the literature. The flap advancement technique is an effective operation respecting both anatomy and function in the {{treatment of}} the deep anal fistulas...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Transferring unstable, ill {{neonates}} to {{and from}} the operating room carries significant risks and can lead to morbidity. We report on our experience in performing certain procedures in critically ill neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We examined the feasibility and safety of such an approach. Methods: All surgical procedures performed in the the NICU between January 1999 and December 2005 were analyzed in terms of demographic data, diagnosis, preoperative stability of the patient, procedures perfformed, complications and outcome. Operations were performed at bedside in the NICU in critically ill, unstable neonates who needed emergency surgery, in neonates of very low birth weight (&# 60; 1000 g) and in neonates on special equipment like high frequency ventilators and nitrous oxide. Results: Thirty-seven surgical procedures were performed including 12 laparotomies, bowel resections and <b>stomies,</b> 7 repairs of congenital diaphragmatic hernias, 4 ligations of patent ductus arteriosus, and various otheers. Birthweights ranged between 850 g and 3500 g (mean, 2000 g). Gestational age ranged between 25 to 42 weeks (mean, 33 weeks). Age at surgery was between 1 to 30 days (mean, 10 days). Preoperatively, 19 patients (51. 3 &#x 0025;) were on inotropic support and all were intubated and mechanically ventilated. There was no mortality related to surgical procedures. Postoperatively, one patient developed wound infection and disruption. Conclusion: Performing major surgical procedures in the the NICU is both feasible and safe. It is useful in very low birth weight, critically ill neonates who have a definite risk attached to transfer to the operating room. No special area is needed in the the NICU to perform complication-free surgery, but designing an operating room within the the NICU would be ideal...|$|R
