25|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in Washington, Lombardi was aware of tight end Jerry Smith's sexual orientation. “Lombardi {{protected}} and loved Jerry,” <b>said</b> <b>former</b> teammate Dave Kopay. Lombardi brought Smith {{into his office and}} told him that his sexual orientation would never be an issue {{as long as he was}} coaching the Redskins; Smith would be judged solely on his on-the-field performance and contribution to the team's success. Under Lombardi's leadership Smith flourished, becoming an integral part of Lombardi's offense, and was voted a First Team All-Pro for the first time in his career, which was also Lombardi's only season as Redskin head coach.|$|E

500|$|Lofton {{accepted}} a basketball scholarship {{to play at}} the University of Arizona. Wildcats head coach Lute Olson said of Lofton, [...] "He's quick and a great leaper." [...] At one point Lofton performed a 360-degree slam dunk for his unsuspecting teammates. For the Wildcats, Lofton was the backup point guard (to Craig McMillan and Steve Kerr) on a team that made it to the Final Four of the 1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. He was the starting point guard the following year when the Wildcats made it to the Sweet Sixteen. Lofton is one of only two men to play in a college basketball Final Four (1988) and a MLB World Series. (The other is fellow East Chicago Washington High School alumnus Tim Stoddard.) He left as the Wildcats' leader in career steals (a record eventually broken). [...] "In strength and agility drills, he just killed it. He's a guy who could have played pro football or basketball or baseball", <b>said</b> <b>former</b> Wildcats teammate Bruce Fraser.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{was long}} {{regarded}} as one of the great teammates in baseball. He was known as a leader in the clubhouse and a tutor to younger players. He mentored his successor in San Diego, Heath Bell, and the pitcher who supplanted him in Milwaukee, John Axford. [...] "Just watching him go about his business was a big thing to me", Bell said. In his first game pitching setup to Axford after losing his closer role, Hoffman stayed in the dugout to watch Axford finish. Many relievers retire back to the clubhouse after being removed from a game. Hoffman's teammates noticed that he stayed supporting Axford through a bases-loaded jam. Axford [...] spent the season absorbing Hoffman's advice, and the two bonded. [...] "He took young players under his wing, especially relief pitchers", <b>said</b> <b>former</b> Padres teammate Brad Ausmus. Hoffman regularly organized team dinners on the road or had team family gatherings at his home, whether it was with the Padres or the Brewers. [...] "It's very unusual for a pitcher, especially a relief pitcher, to be the team leader", Padres first baseman Phil Nevin said in 2002, [...] "but everybody here looks to Trevor. This is his team." ...|$|E
500|$|John Pomfret of The Washington Post said a wide {{spectrum}} of Chinese and foreigners believed that Liu's award [...] "could actually resonate more deeply within China than any similar act in years". The open letter by Xu Youyu et al, which described Liu as [...] "a splendid choice" [...] because of his advancement of human rights causes and the peaceful fight against social injustice, amassed signatures from about 200 mainland intellectuals and activists; it was posted in Chinese, English, French and Japanese on websites hosted outside China. Artist and critic Ai Weiwei said that, although the regime ought to feel the most ashamed, [...] "intellectuals who had drifted away from their public responsibilities" [...] should bear some of that burden for betraying values they once strove for. Ai said that the Prize was a message from the international community to the Chinese government to respect universal human values, notwithstanding China's economic performance. Writer Liao Yiwu, a close friend of Liu, described it as [...] "a big moment in Chinese history". Another writer, Yu Jie, said he spent the night awake with tears streaming down his face – [...] "Twenty years ago Liu Xiaobo said that China needed someone with moral clarity about what China needs. Now he has become just that person, that he himself was looking for", he <b>said.</b> <b>Former</b> Chinese diplomat Yang Hengjun described it as a strong signal to the Chinese government to speed up political reform [...] "or you will have a lot of enemies around you and within you." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", <b>said</b> <b>former</b> rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E
500|$|Pakistani {{reactions}} to the US apology were different. [...] "We appreciate Secretary Clinton's statement, and hope that bilateral ties can move to a better place from here. I am confident that both countries can agree on many critical issues, especially on bringing peace to the region," [...] Pakistan's ambassador to the US Sherry Rehman said in a statement. In general the decision to reopen the supply routes was met in Pakistan with a general sense of befuddlement and muted criticism that the Pakistani government had given up a much-trumpeted increase in transit fees for NATO trucks. Opposition politicians criticised the move and demanded more of an explanation from the Pakistani government and military. [...] "Now government should let the people know about the terms and conditions for reopening the NATO supply lines. What were the demands?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>former</b> foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. And Enver Baig, an opposition politician belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz complained about Americans: [...] "They did not apologize. They said ‘sorry.’" [...] Some Pakistani vowed civil disobedience to stop the convoys. [...] "The decision to reopen NATO supplies is a big crime against the country, {{and we will not}} sit silently over this," [...] retired Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, a leader of the Defense Council of Pakistan (a coalition of Islamic parties that includes pro-Taliban clerics and other foes of the NATO routes) and a former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, told the Pakistani cable channel Express News. [...] "We will come to roads and streets and protest against the decision and will also try to stop the supplies." [...] Pakistani Taliban announced that they will attack any NATO supply trucks travelling along the routes. Transporters who resume supplies will be [...] "considered a friend of the U.S." [...] and will face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said. Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder said that both NATO and Pakistani forces had taken into account losses in the past. [...] "The losses, {{despite the fact that they}} have become a problem are nowhere near the levels that would cause alarm bells to ring" [...] the correspondent said. According to his analysis it would cause a problem if [...] "the Pakistani Taliban attack bridges or decide to take these people head on in the tribal areas" [...] connecting Pakistan to the southern Afghan province of Kandahar.|$|E

2500|$|In 1947-1948, {{the road}} to Jerusalem was blocked, as passage through the hills {{surrounding}} Jerusalem was crucial for getting supplies to the Jewish parts of the besieged city.

In 2006, the Labor Party under Kim Beazley took a stance against the importation of increasingly large numbers of temporary skilled migrant workers by employers, arguing that this is simply a way for employers to drive down wages.|$|E

Probst claimed his retirement was properly handled because he had suffered on-duty injuries in a crash with a drunk driver.
