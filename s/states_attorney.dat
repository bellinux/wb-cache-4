50|$|The {{institution}} {{of a public}} attorney's office (<b>Attorney</b> General - <b>State</b> <b>Attorney)</b> {{has a long tradition}} in Serbia. Since the year of 1842, in, then existing, Principality of Serbia, the State Financial Manager (Правитељствени фишкал) was established as a separate organ of the state, with the competence to perform the duty of a <b>state</b> <b>attorney.</b> This separate organ of the state was abolished only after a year, and the function of a <b>state</b> <b>attorney's</b> office was sent back within the competence of the Ministry of finance. However, within that Ministry, the function of the <b>state</b> <b>attorney's</b> office was always performed by particular employees - <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> (Правитељствени правобранитељ / Државни правобранитељ), of which fact we can find a trace in the Manual for a <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> from the year of 1848. In this form, the <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office existed in Serbia until the year of 1934, when a Law on the <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office came to power. By this Law, for the first time, the position and organization of the <b>State</b> <b>Attorney's</b> Office as a separate organ of the state within the Ministry of finance, was established in whole details.
