40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} preliminarily {{estimated}} carbon <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> forest and carbon <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> grassland of 13 provinces {{of the northern}} China, analyzed their spatial pattern characteristics and revealed the effect of carbon reduction of the northern vegetation system in China using the forest carbon sink volume method and grassland carbon sequestration rate method by using the forest resources inventory data in China and the relevant statistical data. Analysis results illustrated that the total volume <b>of</b> forest carbon <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> the northern China was about 1. 2 * 108 t, of which {{the advantages of the}} forest carbon <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Jilin were significant. The total volume <b>of</b> carbon <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> grassland was about 1. 78 * 108 t, of which the advantages of the forest carbon <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang and Shanxi were significant. It was suggested in this paper that the north China should transform mode of development to further strengthen afforesting and forestation work. The Northeast China should further dig potential <b>of</b> carbon <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> forest and participate in the international carbon trading.
