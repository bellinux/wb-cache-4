5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic <b>sedimentary</b> rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged <b>sedimentary</b> and metamorphic rock.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic <b>sedimentary</b> rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic <b>sedimentary</b> and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of <b>sedimentary</b> rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|North of Mount Tom and the Holyoke Range, the {{apparent}} {{crest of the}} Metacomet Ridge is broken by a discontinuity in the once dominant traprock strata. Underlying <b>sedimentary</b> layers remain but lack the same profile. Between the Holyoke Range and the Pocumtuck Ridge, a stretch of , the Metacomet Ridge exists only {{as a series of}} mostly nondescript rises set among flat plains of <b>sedimentary</b> bedrock. Mount Warner, , in Hadley, Massachusetts, the only significant peak in the area, is a geologically unrelated metamorphic rock landform that extends west into the <b>sedimentary</b> strata.|$|E
5|$|Rocks in {{this region}} include <b>sedimentary</b> rocks from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic into which granite has intruded during the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Argon-39, with a {{half-life}} of 269 years, {{has been}} used for a number of applications, primarily ice core and ground water dating. Also, potassium–argon dating and related argon-argon dating is used to date <b>sedimentary,</b> metamorphic, and igneous rocks.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Precambrian {{a shallow}} inland sea covered {{much of the}} Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group, layers of <b>sedimentary</b> rocks {{overlying}} 2700-million-year-old Archean rocks. The Rove Formation is {{the youngest of the}} many Animikie layers.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the ejected {{material}} from a meteorite impact crater was discovered near Ullapool in Wester Ross. Preserved within <b>sedimentary</b> layers of sandstone, {{this is the}} largest known bolide impact from what are now the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Interbedded <b>sedimentary</b> rock {{makes up}} 93% {{of the surface}} rock in the Catawissa Creek watershed, while the {{remaining}} 7% is sandstone. South of Mainville, the Catawissa Creek river valley is made of red shale. There is also conglomerate, greenish-gray sandstone, olive-colored shale, and anthracite coal near Catawissa Creek.|$|E
5|$|Its <b>sedimentary</b> structure, or bedding, is {{moderately}} well developed. Like most shales, {{it tends}} to split easily along the bedding plane, a property known as fissility.|$|E
5|$|Taftan {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} arc in Iran, together with Bazman, also in Iran, and Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan. This volcanic arc has formed on Cretaceous-Eocene <b>sedimentary</b> layers and has resulted from the subduction of the oceanic Arabian plate beneath Iran at the Makran trench.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Rockies are {{composed}} of <b>sedimentary</b> rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff {{range in age from}} Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600–145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145–66 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These <b>sedimentary</b> rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east and over top younger rocks during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.|$|E
5|$|The Canning Dam Catchment {{lies within}} the Darling Scarp which forms {{part of an}} Archaean Shield {{composed}} largely of granite with some invaded linear belts of metamorphosed <b>sedimentary</b> and volcanic rocks.|$|E
5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by {{four large}} crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and <b>sedimentary</b> rocks that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Mélange and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also Paleozoic to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger granitic intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of <b>sedimentary</b> and metamorphic rocks derived from the North American continent. The rocks of these two terranes are displaced and autochthonous in nature.|$|E
5|$|The Rove Formation {{is located}} in the upper northeastern part of Cook County, Minnesota, United States, and extends into Ontario, Canada. It is the {{youngest}} of the many Animikie layers, a layer of <b>sedimentary</b> rocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{continental}} crust {{consists of}} lower density material {{such as the}} igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. <b>Sedimentary</b> rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by <b>sedimentary</b> rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic <b>sedimentary</b> rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. <b>Sedimentary</b> rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other <b>sedimentary</b> bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} soil where the Valley of the Kings is located are an {{alternating}} sandwich of dense limestone and other <b>sedimentary</b> rock (which form the cliffs {{in the valley}} and the nearby Deir el-Bahri) and soft layers of marl. The <b>sedimentary</b> rock was originally deposited between 35–56 million years ago {{during a time when}} the precursor to the Mediterranean Sea covered an area that extended much further inland than it does today. During the Pleistocene the valley was carved out of the plateau by steady rains. There is currently little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional flash floods that hit the valley, dumping tons of debris into the open tombs.|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of Arad {{is made up of}} Loess land, while the eastern part is made up of <b>sedimentary</b> rock, {{including}} chalk, flint and dolomite.|$|E
5|$|Tremendous {{pressure}} {{caused the}} formation of the <b>sedimentary</b> rocks that are found in the park and in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} nine {{different}} bivalves with widespread distributions in tropical marine waters {{concluded that the}} mussel, Trichomya hirsuta, most nearly reflected in its tissues the level of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, and Ag) in its environment. In this species there was a linear relationship between the <b>sedimentary</b> levels and the tissue concentration of all the metals except zinc. In the Persian Gulf, the Atlantic pearl-oyster (Pinctada radiata) {{is considered to be}} a useful bioindicator of heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} <b>sedimentary</b> rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were {{deposited}} in water, probably in a caldera lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
5|$|All erosion types took {{advantage}} of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of lithification, {{and the presence of}} cracks or joints in the rock. Basalt flows concentrated in valleys but subsequent erosion removed <b>sedimentary</b> rock that once stood at higher elevations. The resulting inverted relief consists of ridges capped by basalt which are separated by adjacent drainages.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} landforms in the Yosemite {{area are}} cut from the {{granitic}} rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and <b>sedimentary</b> rocks. These rocks are called roof pendants because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying granitic rock.|$|E
5|$|At {{certain times}} in the {{geological}} past, corals were very abundant. Like modern corals, these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in <b>sedimentary</b> rocks. Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, {{and the remains of}} many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This makes some corals useful index fossils. Coral fossils are not restricted to reef remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, which occurs in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E
5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks {{are part of the}} Franciscan Assemblage, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These <b>sedimentary</b> rocks are primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of metamorphic rocks such as greenstone. For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of the}} creek, schist and other metamorphic rocks {{can be found}}, while <b>sedimentary</b> rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Precambrian {{a shallow}} inland sea covered {{much of the}} Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group, which are layers of <b>sedimentary</b> rocks which unconformably overlies 2700-million-year-old Archean rocks. This group {{contains}} both the Rove and Gunflint Iron formations. The Rove Formation is {{the youngest of the}} many Animikie layers; it consists of gently tilted fine-grained sediments. It is composed of greywackes and black shale, and contains lower concentrations of iron and taconite than the underlying Gunflint Iron Formation does.|$|E
5|$|From I-805 to SR163, {{the highway}} goes through {{an area with}} visible Pliocene <b>sedimentary</b> rocks {{estimated}} to be 10million years old. After passing the Miramar Recycling Center and an interchange with Convoy Street, SR52 intersects SR163, a freeway heading towards downtown San Diego. SR52 intersects Kearny Villa Road before an interchange with I-15. A collector-distributor road serves these three interchanges.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origin}} to Birdwood the river follows rolling, {{relatively}} level country before entering a hilly section {{that continues to}} Gumeracha. The river then follows <b>sedimentary</b> rock strata before entering a gorge after Cudlee Creek. It flows through the gorge to Athelstone, passing over the Eden Fault Zone of the Adelaide Hills face and associated escarpment. After the scarp it flows over <b>sedimentary</b> rocks of varying resistance to erosion, {{which has led to}} interspersed narrows and broad basins. From the base of the Adelaide Hills to Adelaide's central business district it runs in a shallow valley with a terraced floor, then down the slope of its own alluvial fan. The structure of this fan shows that the river formerly entered Gulf St Vincent via the Port River. Over time the Torrens deposited sediment, choking its own outflow; becoming locked behind coastal sand dunes and forming the swampy areas of the Cowandilla Plains and the reedbeds.|$|E
5|$|Further <b>sedimentary</b> {{deposits}} {{were formed}} through the Cambrian period (541–485 Ma), some of which, {{along with the}} earlier Precambrian sediments, metamorphosed into the Dalradian series. This is composed {{of a wide variety}} of materials, including mica schist, biotite gneiss schist, schistose grit, greywacke and quartzite. The area that would become Scotland was at this time close to the south pole and part of Laurentia. Fossils from the north-west Highlands indicate the presence of trilobites and other primitive forms of life.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s a {{study was}} {{commissioned}} by Wessex Water to investigate the likely effects of constructing a tide-excluding barrier, aimed at stopping the silt, just upriver of Dunball Wharf on the hydraulic, <b>sedimentary</b> and pollutant regime of the estuary. Results showed that a site further upriver could be viable.|$|E
5|$|In the White Sea {{region of}} Russia, all three {{assemblage}} types {{have been found}} in close proximity. This, and the faunas' considerable temporal overlap, makes it unlikely that they represent evolutionary stages or temporally distinct communities. Since they are globally distributed – described on all continents except Antarctica – geographical boundaries {{do not appear to be}} a factor; the same fossils are found at all palaeolatitudes (the latitude where the fossil was created, accounting for continental drift) and in separate <b>sedimentary</b> basins.|$|E
5|$|Many {{varieties}} of Precambrian bedrock are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, {{as well as}} metamorphic rocks derived from volcanic and <b>sedimentary</b> rocks. Greenstone of the Superior craton located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7billion years old. Igneous rocks of the Duluth Complex comprise the bedrock of the eastern Boundary Waters. Ancient microfossils {{have been found in}} the banded iron formations of the Gunflint Chert.|$|E
5|$|Minerals in {{the acid}} mine {{drainage}} {{areas of the}} Mahanoy Creek watershed include goethite, ferrihydrite, schwertmannite, amorphous aluminum-hydroxysulfates, quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, and gypsum. Red shale of the Mauch Chunk Formation is found in {{a substantial part of}} the watershed. The main rock types in the watershed are interbedded <b>sedimentary</b> rock, which occupies 70 percent of the watershed, and sandstone, which occupies 30 percent.|$|E
5|$|Most of Gyeongju {{lies in the}} Gyeongsang Basin, but a {{few areas}} of the city belong to the Pohang Basin, such as Eoil-ri and Beomgok-ri in Yangbuk-myeon, and part of Cheonbuk-myeon. The Gyeongsang Basin areas consist of Bulguksa {{intrusive}} rock penetrating layers of <b>sedimentary</b> rocks, mainly granite and porphyry. By contrast, the Pohang Basin areas are made up of stratum that formed in the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic era, which consist of igneous rock, aqueous rock, porphyry, sandstone, and tuff.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Black Hills, much {{of western}} South Dakota {{features}} rock formed during the Mesozoic Era, from 250 million to 66million years ago. At the time, much of western and central South Dakota was again {{covered by a}} shallow inland sea. Marine skeletons from this ocean settled to the seafloor and were compacted to form the <b>sedimentary</b> rocks in the area today. During this period, the Black Hills, which had been pushed up to an elevation of around 15,000feet (4,500m), lost around 6,000feet (1,800m) worth of rock layers due to erosion. Many of these sediments {{ended up in the}} same area as the marine deposits from the inland sea, and both contribute to western South Dakota's present-day geological makeup. In several areas in western South Dakota, tertiary deposits may also be found. These were formed between 66 and 2.5million years ago from eroded mountains to the west. There is also volcanic material deposited here that presumably came from the Yellowstone area. These layers of <b>sedimentary</b> rock are distinctly visible in the multi-colored rocks and cliffs of Badlands National Park.|$|E
5|$|Radiometric dating of {{lava flows}} {{has been used}} to {{establish}} a geomagnetic polarity time scale, part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis of magnetostratigraphy, a geophysical correlation technique {{that can be used to}} date both <b>sedimentary</b> and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies.|$|E
