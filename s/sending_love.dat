25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re <b>sending</b> <b>love</b> notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she can teach her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus says you have to show you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus. The Knight removes his helm, who is then revealed to be Arthur.|$|E

6000|$|He {{had just}} two {{disturbing}} factors: one was Nettie's relation to him, {{and the other}} was his desire to see Miss Wilbur. Nettie wrote quite often at first, letters all very much alike, and very short, <b>sending</b> <b>love</b> and kisses. She was not a good letter writer, and even under the inspiration of love could not write above two pages of repetitious matter. [...] "It's dreadfully hard work to write," [...] she kept saying.

6000|$|In {{relation}} to our Congress matter here, {{you were right}} in supposing I would support the nominee. Neither Baker nor I, however, is the man, but Hardin, so far as I can judge from present appearances. We shall have no split or trouble about the matter; all will be harmony. In {{relation to}} the [...] "coming events" [...] about which Butler wrote you, I had not heard one word before I got your letter; but I have so much confidence in the judgment of Butler on such a subject that I incline to {{think there may be}} some reality in it. What day does Butler appoint? By the way, how do [...] "events" [...] of the same sort come on in your family? Are you possessing houses and lands, and oxen and asses, and men-servants and maid-servants, and begetting sons and daughters? We are not keeping house, but boarding at the Globe Tavern, which is very well kept now by a widow lady of the name of Beck. Our room (the same that Dr. Wallace occupied there) and boarding only costs us four dollars a week. Ann Todd was married something more than a year since to a fellow by the name of Campbell, and who, Mary says, is pretty much of a [...] "dunce," [...] though he has a little money and property. They live in Boonville, Missouri, and have not been heard from lately enough for me to say anything about her health. I reckon it will scarcely be in our power to visit Kentucky this year. Besides poverty and the necessity of attending to business, those [...] "coming events," [...] I suspect, would be somewhat in the way. I most heartily wish you and your Fanny would not fail to come. Just let us know the time, and we will have a room provided for you at our house, and all be merry together for a while. Be sure to give my respects to your mother and family; assure her that if ever I come near her, I will not fail to call and see her. Mary joins in <b>sending</b> <b>love</b> to your Fanny and you.|$|E

50|$|Courtship in the Philippines is one known {{complex form}} of courtship. Unlike what is {{regularly}} seen in other societies, {{it takes a}} far more subdued and indirect approach. It is complex in that it involves stages, and it is considered normal for courtship to last a year or longer. It is common to see the male showing off by <b>sending</b> <b>love</b> letters and love poems, singing romantic songs and buying gifts for the female. The parents are also {{seen as part of}} the courtship practice, as their approval is commonly needed before courtship may begin, or before the female gives the male an answer to his advances.|$|E

50|$|Costard is a comic {{figure in}} the play Love's Labour's Lost by William Shakespeare. A country bumpkin, he is arrested in the first scene for flouting the king's {{proclamation}} that all men of the court avoid the company of women for three years. While in custody, {{the men of the}} court use him to further their own romantic endeavors. By <b>sending</b> <b>love</b> notes to the wrong women and blurting out secrets (including that of an unplanned pregnancy), Costard makes fools of the royal court. Along with Moth the page and Jaquenetta, a country wench, Costard pokes fun at the upper-class. While mocking a pedantic schoolmaster, Costard uses the word honorificabilitudinitatibus, the longest word by far from any of Shakespeare's works.|$|E

50|$|The legend {{states that}} Ann {{had fallen in}} love not with the wealthy Maddocks, but with the poet and thatcher, Wil Hopcyn (William Hopkin) and when {{discovered}} were forbidden to see each other. Ann was kept prisoner, locked in her bedroom in the Manor house. The families were determined that the union between Anthony Maddocks and Ann would take place. However, the couple continued their relationship by <b>sending</b> <b>love</b> letters to each other in secret, taken by one of her maidservants and hidden in a hollow in an oak tree on the Cefn Ydfa estate. When these communications were uncovered, Ann's mother took away her writing materials. Legend then has it that she took to writing on leaves plucked from the tree outside her bedroom window in her own blood. Unable to be with Ann, Hopcyn left the area; Ann married Anthony Maddocks. Ann is said to have pined so desperately for her lover that she fell seriously ill. On her death bed she asked to see Hopcyn, and when he arrived she died in his arms.|$|E

Hiccup realizes that Fishlegs is the one who sent the letters, and spares Fishlegs life by telling UG that he himself wrote the letters. UG then tells him the Impossible Task: to give them a barrel of mead made from the honey made by the bees on the Island of Berserk, an island inhabited by crazy lunatics who enjoy feeding people alive to a dragon known as [...] "the Beast" [...] in wicker baskets. UG then tells Hiccup that he should be back at UG's castle on Midsummer's day at five o'clock in the morning with five pots of Berserk honey.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{variation}} {{is that the}} scammer insists they need to marry in order to inherit {{millions of dollars of}} gold left by a father, uncle, or grandfather. The young woman will contact a victim and tell them of their plight {{of not being able to}} remove the gold from their country due to being unable to pay the duty or marriage taxes. The woman will be unable to inherit the fortune until she gets married, the marriage being a prequiste of the father, uncle or grandfather's will. The scammer keeps the victim believing that they are sincere, until they are able to build up enough rapport to ask for thousands of dollars to help bring the gold into the victim's country. The scammer will offer to fly to the victim's country to prove that they are a real person. The victim will send money for the flight. However, when the victim goes to meet the scammer they never show up. The victim contacts the scammer to ask what happened. The scammer will provide an excuse such as not being able to get an exit visa, or illness of themselves or a family member. Scammers are very adept at knowing how to [...] "play" [...] their victims - <b>sending</b> <b>love</b> poems, sex games in emails, building up a [...] "loving relationship" [...] with many promises of [...] "one day we will be married". Often photos of unknown African actresses will be used to lure the victim into believing they are talking to that person. Victims may be invited to travel to the scammer's country; in some cases the victims arrive with asked-for gift money for family members or bribes for corrupt officials, and then they are beaten and robbed or murdered.|$|E
