5|$|Bosa {{appears as}} a saint in an 8th-century liturgical {{calendar}} from York, the only <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was venerated as a saint before the Norman Conquest of England. The 16th-century English antiquary John Leland included Bosa in his list of saint's resting places in England, giving it as York. Bosa's feast day is 9 March.|$|E
5|$|Colbert dropped {{hints of}} a {{potential}} presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, I Am America (And So Can You!), which was rumored (invariably by Colbert himself) to be a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. Colbert staunchly refused to confirm or deny his candidacy, stating {{he had not yet}} made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.|$|E
5|$|William {{returned}} to England to release his army from service in 1073 but quickly {{returned to}} Normandy, {{where he spent}} all of 1074. He left England {{in the hands of}} his supporters, including Richard fitzGilbert and William de Warenne, as well as Lanfranc. William's ability to leave England for an entire year was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt that his control of the kingdom was secure. While William was in Normandy, Edgar the Ætheling returned to Scotland from Flanders. The French king, seeking a focus for those opposed to William's power, then proposed that Edgar be given the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer on the Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William. Edgar was forced to submit to William shortly thereafter, however, and he returned to William's court. Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, turned his attentions to Brittany, leading to a revolt in 1075.|$|E

5|$|Back in Tokyo after Shishio's defeat, Yahiko notices Yukishiro Enishi's revenge {{plot against}} Kenshin. Sensing his own {{inability}} to help, he trains {{much harder to}} learn the two succession techniques in Kamiya Kasshin-ryū. Such moves allow him to block an opponent's attack and then hit him with his weapon. He successfully learns both of this techniques and becomes so adept at using them, that Yahiko starts performing several variations. He uses these moves against one of Enishi's partners Otowa Hyōko and defeats him. While Yahiko rests from to his injuries, Kaoru is kidnapped by Enishi, and Yahiko and his friends start searching for her. When another of Enishi's comrades, Kujiranami Hyōgo escapes from jail and goes on a rampage, Yahiko stands up against him. However, he is not strong enough on his own to defeat him and Kenshin saves him at the last moment. After he and Kenshin recover from their fight injuries, they go to rescue Kaoru from Enishi. While on his island fortress, Yahiko defeats {{one of the four}} bodyguards from Enishi's partner, Heishin, and witnesses Kenshin's fight against Enishi, which Kenshin wins. Five years later, he is the acting instructor at the Kamiya Kasshin-ryū dojo. One day Kenshin calls him to test his skills; when he lands a hit on Kenshin, he gives Yahiko his own reverse-blade sword as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has become a true samurai.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Devagiri, Shiva comes {{to know of}} the treacherous wars that the Chandravanshis are {{carrying}} on the Meluhans. He also meets Brahaspati, the Chief Inventor of the Meluhans. Brahaspati invites Shiva and the royal family on an expedition to Mount Mandar, where the legendary Somras is manufactured using {{the waters of the}} Saraswati river. Shiva learns that the potion which made his throat turn blue was actually undiluted Somras, which can be lethal when taken in its pure form. However, Shiva was unaffected, which was the first <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the Neelkanth. He also learns that Somras was the reason why the Meluhans lived for so many years. Brahaspati and Shiva develop a close friendship and the royal family returns to Devagiri. One morning, the whole of Meluha wakes up to loud noises coming from Mount Mandar. Shiva and his troops reach the hill to find out that a large part of Mandar has been blasted off and many of the inventors killed. There is no sign of Brahaspati, but Shiva finds the insignia of the Nagas, confirming their involvement in the treacherous wars of the Chandravanshis.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing his}} job as school {{inspector}} following the decisions of a hostile National Liberal executive, Mihai Eminescu {{spent much of his}} time in Bojdeuca, where he was looked after by the couple. For five months after quarreling with Samson Bodnărescu, his fellow poet and previous landlord, Eminescu even moved inside the house, where he reputedly pursued his discreet love affair with woman writer Veronica Micle, and completed as many as 22 of his poems. Creangă introduced his younger friend to a circle of companions which included Zahei Creangă, who was by then a cantor, as well as Răceanu, priest Gheorghe Ienăchescu, and clerk Nicșoi (all of whom, Călinescu notes, had come to share the raconteur's lifestyle choices and his nationalist opinions). Eminescu was especially attracted by their variant of simple life, the rudimentary setting of Creangă's house and the group's bohemian escapades. Circumstances drew the two friends apart: by 1877, Eminescu had relocated in Bucharest, the capital city, regularly receiving letters in which Creangă was asking him to return. He was however against Eminescu's plan to marry Veronica Micle, and made his objection known to the poet. In 1879, as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was formalizing his own affair with Tinca Vartic, Creangă purchased the Bojdeuca in her name, paying his former landlord 40 Austrian gulden in exchange. That same year, he, Răceanu and Ienăchescu published the textbook Geografia județului Iași ("The Geography of Iași County"), followed soon after by a map of the same region, researched by Creangă and Răceanu. A final work in the area of education followed in 1880, as a schoolteacher's version of Maiorescu's study of Romanian grammar, Regulile limbei române ("Rules of the Romanian Language").|$|E
25|$|In 1318, he {{embarked}} on a coronation campaign. The pope, though initially unwilling, finally granted his approval and Władysław was crowned King of Poland on 30 January 1320 in Kraków. The coronation was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had overcome Poland's internal fragmentation and re-united the country as an independent kingdom under his rule.|$|E
25|$|Sverre, however, was not {{suited for}} a priestly life. The saga {{states that he}} had several dreams which he {{interpreted}} as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was destined for greater things. Further, in 1175, his mother revealed that Sverre was really the son of king Sigurd Munn. In the following year, Sverre travelled to Norway to seek his destiny.|$|E

25|$|The Liberal Party's {{two main}} support bases, left-leaning urban workers and {{conservative}} small farmers, were increasingly at odds, and Ward lacked any coherent strategy {{to solve the}} problem – any attempt to please one group simply alienated the other. Ward increasingly focused on foreign affairs, which was seen by his opponents as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not cope with the country's problems.|$|E
25|$|On 5 April 1963, he headlined at the Paris Olympia, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had arrived. At {{the end of}} that year, François created {{original}} new dance steps, and Michel Bourdais drew them. For {{the first}} time, they brought up the idea of setting up a show with female dancers. In 1964 he began a relationship with a 17-year-old Eurovision-winning singer France Gall which lasted until 1967.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan's {{previous}} {{attempt to}} create an agreement at the May 1960 summit in Paris had collapsed due to the 1960 U-2 incident. He was a force in the negotiations leading to {{the signing of the}} 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty by the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union. He sent Lord Hailsham to negotiate the Test Ban Treaty, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was grooming him as a potential successor.|$|E

25|$|Edward's cousin, the 3rd Baronet, {{sent him}} to nearby Brewood School, a clear <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{regarded}} him as a likely heir. The school {{was at that time}} under the headship of the celebrated William Budworth, who benefited considerably from the Baronet's generosity. During 1740 Fisher Littleton died and the young Edward, while still a schoolboy, inherited his father's land. In January 1742 he also inherited the much larger estates, as well as the titles, of his cousin, the 3rd Baronet. Still a minor, he was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1744.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{year after}} Barbarossa, Stalin reopened the churches in the Soviet Union. He may have wanted to motivate the {{majority}} of the population who had Christian beliefs. By changing the official policy of the party and the state towards religion, he could engage the Church and its clergy in mobilising the war effort. On 4 September 1943, Stalin invited the metropolitans Sergius, Alexy and Nikolay to the Kremlin. He proposed to reestablish the Moscow Patriarchate, which had been suspended since 1925, and elect the Patriarch. On 8 September 1943, Metropolitan Sergius was elected Patriarch. One account said that Stalin's reversal followed a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> supposedly received from heaven.|$|E
25|$|The bad {{election}} result in 2001 was quickly {{followed by a}} leadership battle between Jagland and Stoltenberg. Both Jagland, as leader, and Stoltenberg, as deputy leader, said they were open to be challenged for their positions at the party's congress in November 2002. Stoltenberg refused to say whether he would challenge Jagland for the leadership position, which was seen by political commentators as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> probably would seek the leadership position. In the beginning of February 2002, Jagland, who had been briefly hospitalized in January, and had a subsequent sick leave, {{said that he would}} not seek reelection as leader. In November 2002, Stoltenberg was unanimously elected new leader at the party's congress.|$|E

25|$|The {{short time}} between {{his release from}} prison and {{the time when he}} was sent to the United States has been seen as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had links to the Romanian Securitate. This idea has been {{supported}} by Ion Mihai Pacepa, who argued in a 1992 book that Archimandrite Bartolomeu was an agent of the External Intelligence department of the Securitate who was sent to the United States to divide the Romanian community. Anania has admitted that he signed denunciations against other high-ranking clerics for the Securitate in 1959, but he claims that he was not a collaborator and that these denunciations were made after he was given tea containing a truth drug at the Securitate's Ploiești headquarters.|$|E
25|$|Baxter {{retained}} {{command of}} his brigade during {{the reorganization of}} the Army of the Potomac in March 1864, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> held the confidence of his superiors. His brigade {{was assigned to the}} 2nd Division, V Corps, under Maj. Gen. Robinson. At the Battle of the Wilderness, he was shot in the left leg, the bullet also killing his horse. After recuperating, he led a brigade in the 3rd Division, V Corps, during later stages of the siege of Richmond and Petersburg. He was mustered out of the volunteers on August 24, 1865. On May 31, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Baxter for the award of the brevet grade of major general to rank from April 1, 1865 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on July 23, 1866.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{entered into}} further {{negotiations}} with the Lombard League cities and with Pope Celestine III on his Imperial coronation, and ceded Tusculum to the Pope. At Easter Monday on 15 April 1191, in Rome, Henry and his consort Constance were crowned Emperor and Empress by Celestine. The crown of Sicily, however, was harder to gain, as the Sicilian nobility had chosen Count Tancred of Lecce as their king. Henry began his work campaigning in Apulia and besieging Naples, but he encountered resistance when Tancred's liensman Margaritus of Brindisi came to the city's defence, harassed Henry's Pisan navy, and nearly destroyed the later arriving Genoese contingent. Moreover, the Imperial army had been heavily hit by an epidemic, and Henry ultimately had to abandon the siege. Constance, who {{was left in the}} palace of Salerno as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would soon return, was betrayed and handed over to Tancred.|$|E
