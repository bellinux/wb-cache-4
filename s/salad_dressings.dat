5000|$|Outside Greece, [...] "Greek salad" [...] {{may be a}} lettuce {{salad with}} Greek-inspired ingredients, even though the {{original}} dish is distinguished {{by the absence of}} lettuce. Meanwhile, the variant without lettuce may be called horiatiki, [...] "country salad", [...] "peasant salad", or [...] "village salad". Lettuce, tomatoes, feta (often served in multiple cube-shaped cuttings mixed with the vegetables), and olives are the most standard elements in an American-style Greek salad, but cucumbers, peperoncini (pickled hot peppers), bell peppers, onions, radishes, dolmades, and anchovies/sardines are common. In Detroit for example, a Greek salad also includes beets, and in the Tampa Bay Area it often includes potato salad. Rather than simple olive oil and vinegar, as in a normal Greek lettuce <b>salad,</b> prepared <b>dressings</b> containing various herbs and seasonings are frequently employed. This style of Greek salad is rarely encountered in Greece.|$|R

Part of the product, a pita salad, was quickly {{dropped from the}} salad bar, as were {{plans to use the}} bar unit to boost breakfast sales. In 1987 the company augmented its salad bar with a test line of prepackaged salads, including chef and garden salads. The salad bar was eventually eliminated in favor of packaged salads. In 1990, BK introduced a new salad line accompanied by a licensing agreement with Paul Newman's Newman's Own, Inc., whose <b>salad</b> <b>dressings</b> accompanied the products. Burger King revamped its salad line again in 2004, with the introduction of its Fire Grilled Salad products. Burger King sought to differentiate this line of salads by packaging the warm meat toppings—a choice of grilled shrimp or broiled chicken—separately from the cold salad; this added the appearance of an additional layer of freshness. At one point in the United States, the salads are pre-made off-site. They are sold with two toppings and Ken's Foods Ken's Steakhouse brand salad dressing.

Olive oil is a staple cooking oil of the region and has been since the days of Junípero Serra; today the mission olive is a common tree growing in a Southern Californian's back garden; as a crop olives are increasingly a signature of the region along with Valencia oranges and Meyer lemons. Soybeans, bok choy, Japanese persimmon, thai basil, Napa cabbage, nori, mandarin oranges, water chestnuts, and mung beans are other crops brought to the region from East Asia and are common additions to salads as the emphasis on fresh produce in both Southern and Northern California is strong. Other vegetables and herbs have a distinct Mediterranean flavor which would include oregano, basil, summer squash, eggplant, and broccoli, with all of the above extensively available at farmers' markets all around Southern California. Naturally, salads native to Southern California tend to be hearty affairs, like Cobb salad and Chinese chicken <b>salad,</b> and <b>dressings</b> like green goddess and ranch are a staple. California-style pizza tends to have disparate ingredients with an emphasis on vegetables, with any combination of chili oil, prawns, eggs, chicken, shiitake mushrooms, olives, bell pepper, goat cheese, and feta cheese.

40|$|International audienceThe {{monitoring}} of food additives and recent dietary surveys {{carried out in}} Denmark have earlier been used to estimate the intake of sweeteners and nitrite in relation to ADI values. The ubiquitous use of the preservatives benzoic and sorbic acid {{raises the question of}} the magnitude of the intake of these preservatives in relation to ADI values, which is explored in the present investigation. The content of benzoic and sorbic acid in all food groups, where they are allowed, has been monitored in Denmark 17 times from 2001 to 2006 with a total of 1526 samples. Transgressions of maximum limits, illegal use or declaration faults have been found in about 3 % of the samples. From repeated investigations on fat based foods (<b>salads</b> and <b>dressings),</b> marmalade and stewed fruit it can be concluded that the amounts used by the industry have been relatively stable through the whole period, although limited data for marmalade show some variation. Most foods in the categories soft drinks, dressing, fat based salads, pickled herrings and marmalade contain benzoic and sorbic acid, and sliced bread contain in some cases also sorbic acid. The median daily intake and intake distribution of benzoic and sorbic acid have been calculated with data from the Danish National Survey of Dietary Habits and Physical Activity (age: 4 - 75 years) conducted in 2000 - 04 with 5785 participants. The median intakes of both benzoic acid and sorbic acid are well below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) values of 0 - 5 mg/kg bw/day and 0 - 25 mg/kg bw/day for benzoic and sorbic acid respectively. However, the 90 th percentile based on the average of the samples with a content of benzoic acid is higher than the ADI value {{for both men and women}} with the highest value of 16 mg/kg bw/day for both boys and girls in the age group 4 - 6 year old [...] Based on the average of all the samples the 95 th percentile is over the ADI value for men up to 34 years and for women up to 24 years and the 90 th percentile for men up to 18 years and for women up to 10 years. Soft drinks, salads and dressing are the main contributors to the benzoic acid intake. The sorbic acid intake based on the average of all samples is well below the ADI value. However, for the intake based on the average of samples with content the 95 th percentile exceeds the ADI. This is caused by the dominating contribution to the intake of sorbic acid from sliced bread, but since only 7 out of 42 samples have added sorbic acid, the calculation based on the average of samples with content will exaggerate the intake. With the built in safety factor of 100 in the ADI values and judging from the literature the high intakes of benzoic acid should not cause any concern for ill effects. However, there must be reason to reconsider the maximum limits especially for benzoic acid in soft drinks, dressing and salads and for sorbic acid in sliced bread...|$|R

40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Ciências da Saúde, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Nutrição, Florianópolis, 2014 Ambiente alimentar caracteriza-se pela acessibilidade aos alimentos e bebidas aos indivíduos. Ambientes com maior disponibilidade e acesso a alimentos mais saudáveis, exercem maior influência nas escolhas alimentares, facilitando o consumo destes alimentos. Pelo fato de estudantes frequentarem a universidade por vários anos, os alimentos e bebidas comercializados neste ambiente e arredor, podem influenciar na qualidade da sua alimentação. Nesse sentido, o objetivo do presente estudo foi caracterizar o ambiente alimentar do campus sede de uma universidade pública da região sul do Brasil, identificando a qualidade alimentar e nutricional, tipos e preços dos alimentos e bebidas comercializados nas lanchonetes e restaurantes do campus. A coleta de dados foi realizada nos meses de outubro e novembro de 2013, por meio de um censo dos estabelecimentos situados no campus sede da universidade, totalizando 13 lanchonetes e seis restaurantes. Os instrumentos utilizados para a coleta de dados foram o Nutrition Environment Measures Survey - Restaurants (NEMS-R), traduzido para o português e adaptado para o Brasil para ser aplicado em restaurantes e similares com diferentes tipos de serviço, e um formulário para complementar os dados nas lanchonetes. Houve aprovação prévia pelo Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa com Seres Humanos com consentimento de todos os responsáveis pelos estabelecimentos avaliados, bem como do órgão que regulamenta os serviços prestados por estes estabelecimentos na universidade analisada. Cerca de 16 % disponibilizavam informação alimentar ou nutricional, o apelo para opções saudáveis, considerado um facilitador para promoção de alimentação saudável era praticado por apenas um restaurante e 92. 3 % das lanchonetes ofereciam porções reduzidas. Entre as lanchonetes, 23 % comercializavam ofertas combinadas de alimentos e bebidas por um preço único. Quanto aos restaurantes, a mediana do preço por peso da refeição foi R$ 20. 80 por quilo, enquanto os restaurantes da universidade serviam refeição completa ao preço fixo de R$ 1, 50 para estudantes. Metade destes ofertavam fruta in natura como sobremesa e café sem adição de açúcar aos clientes, gratuitamente. Cerca de 67 % destes locais disponibilizavam cereais integrais no bufê; 83 % ofereciam carne vermelha assada, cozida ou chapeada, 50 % carne branca frita e 50 % carne branca não frita; 100 % dispunham de saladas sem molhos adicionados e leguminosas sem embutidos. Nas lanchonetes, os salgados assados refinados e integrais eram comercializados em todas, enquanto os salgados fritos de massa refinada estavam em 69 % das lanchonetes. Os recheios mais evidenciados nos salgados comercializados eram compostos por carne vermelha e embutidos (100 % das lanchonetes). Os bolos de massa refinada com recheio e/ou cobertura eram os comercializados em um maior número de opções (média de 3 opções). Os sanduíches com carne vermelha eram os mais encontrados nas 12 lanchonetes que comercializam esta categoria de alimento, nas versões {{integral}} e refinada, sendo o sanduíche de carne vermelha no pão refinado o mais barato. Não foi encontrada fruta in natura nas lanchonetes analisadas, apenas salada de frutas em 11 delas. Dentre a variedade de bebidas comercializada, o suco natural de fruta era a única bebida ofertada por todas as 13 lanchonetes. No entanto, ao comparar os preços de opções com menor e maior qualidade alimentar e nutricional, constatou-se nas lanchonetes que as opções de menor qualidade alimentar e nutricional apresentaram menor preço em relação às opções de melhor qualidade. Estas diferenças de preço foram significativas entre o chá industrializado e o chá infusão preparado na lanchonete (p Abstract: Food {{environment is}} characterized by the accessibility to food and beverages by individuals. Environments with greater availability and access to healthier food influence more on food choices, facilitating the consumption of these foods. Because of the fact that students attend the university for many years, the food and beverages sold in this environment and surroundings can influence the quality of feeding. Accordingly, the goal {{of the present study was}} to characterize the food environment of the head office of a public university in the south region of Brazil, identifying the food and nutritional quality, types and prices of food and beverages sold in the campus cafeterias and restaurants. The data collection was performed during the months of October and November of 2013, by a census of establishments placed in the head campus of the university, adding up to 13 cafeterias and 6 restaurants. The instruments used for the data collection were the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey - Restaurants (NEMS-R), translated to Portuguese and adapted to Brazil to be applied in restaurants and similar with different types of services, and a form to complement the data in cafeterias. There was preview approval by the Ethics comity in research with human beings with consent of all the responsible for the establishments in the analyzed university. About 16 % displayed food or nutritional information, the appeal for healthier choices, considered a facilitator for the promotion of healthy feeding was practiced by 1 restaurant and 92, 3 % of the cafeterias offered reduced portions. Among the cafeterias, 23 % sold offers combined of food and beverages for a single price. As for the restaurants, the average price for weight of food was R$ 20, 80 for kilo, while the restaurants of the university served a complete meal for the fixed price of s for the restaurants, the average price for weight of food was R$ 20, 80 for kilo, while the restaurants of the university served a complete meal for the fixed price of R$ 1, 50 for students. Half of these offered fruits in natura as a desert and coffee without sugar to clients, for free. About 67 % of these places had whole cereals in the buffet; 83 % offered roasted, grilled or boiled red meat; 50 % fried white meat and 50 % white meat not fried; 100 % had <b>salads</b> without added <b>dressings</b> and legumes without sausages. In the cafeterias, the refined baked salted goods and the whole salted goods were sold in all, while the fried refined salted goods sold were made of red meat and sausages (100 % of the cafeterias). The refined mixed cakes with filling and/or icing were sold in a higher number of options (average of 3 options). The sandwiches with red meat were the most found in the 12 cafeterias that sold this category of food, the versions whole and refined, the red meat with refined bread being the cheapest. Fruits in natura were not found in the analyzed cafeteria, just fruit salads in 11 of them. Among the variety of beverages sold, the natural juice was the only beverage sold by all the 13 cafeterias. However, when comparing the prices of options with less and high food and nutritional quality, it was found that the cafeterias that the options of less nutritional and food quality showed lower prices when compared to the options of better quality. These differences of price were significant between an industrialized tea and an infused tea prepared in the cafeteria (p< 0, 001), as well as the difference between the price of a refined fried salted good and a baked whole salted good (p< 0, 001), and among the refined cookie without filling and the whole cookie without filling (p= 0. 028). In the restaurants, the soda showed higher prices than the natural fruit juice (p< 0, 001). The food environment of the campus analyzed can improve the options available to incentive and ease the healthier food choices, since the elevated offer of products with lower food and nutritional quality are cheaper. The restaurants have a high offer of vegetables, fruits and legumes. However, the thin meats were prepared with techniques that increased the fat percentage; the offer of whole cereals was not made in every place; and many refined cereals were offered, with low percentage of fiber and high of fat. A vast offer of products of low food and nutritional quality were found in the cafeterias, such as salted goods, hot sweets, cakes, cookies and sandwiches prepared with refined flour, stuffed with ingredients containing high levels of sugar and fat. Also, the beverages, the salted goods and the hot sweets, and the healthier cookies were more expensive than the rest. The possibility and the necessity of improving food and nutritional quality of the products sold in the studied campus, having seen the number of students and servers that attend these environments for many hours of the day and during many years of their lives is fundamental...|$|R
