500|$|Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 {{said one}} song {{would have to}} be chosen as the country's {{national}} anthem and the government resolved to form a joint committee to review the status of the two musical works. The next year, Pearson put to the House of Commons a motion that [...] "the government be authorized to take such steps as may be necessary to provide that 'O Canada' shall be the National Anthem of Canada while 'God Save the Queen' shall be the Royal Anthem of Canada," [...] of which parliament approved. In 1967, the Prime Minister advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the <b>Special</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems; the group first met in February and, within two months, on April 12, 1967, presented its conclusion that [...] "O Canada" [...] should be designated as the national anthem and [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] as the royal anthem of Canada, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song. For [...] "O Canada", the Robert Stanley Weir version of 1908 was recommended, with a few minor changes, for the English words; two of the [...] "stand on guard" [...] phrases were replaced with [...] "from far and wide" [...] and [...] "God keep our land." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Keyes {{lost his}} battle for shared-custody of his {{children}} in 1984, he led a shared-parenting advocacy group in Nova Scotia. In 1998 he testified on shared parenting before <b>Special</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> on Child Custody and Access of the Government of Canada. [...] "I think that situation, where 60,000 children a year are forcibly denied any kind of equal parenting time with their fathers, {{is one of the}} worst state-enforced abuses of human rights in Canada today," [...] he told the committee. [...] "The court ordeals we go through are sickening and unbelievable. Abusive lawyers are rewarded by adversarial, winner-take-all courts. We have debtors' prison for fathers only. We have children moved away at the mother's whim. We have shattered families, devastated fathers, and scarred children. These are the dark ages of family law in Canada." [...] Keyes submitted a 17-page brief called Family Rights for Children of Divorce, a document his Nova Scotia advocacy had created.|$|E
2500|$|... "God Save the Queen" [...] {{has been}} sung in Canada {{since the late}} 1700s and by the mid 20th century was, along with [...] "O Canada", one of the country's two de facto {{national}} anthems, {{the first and last}} verses of the standard British version being used. By-laws and practices governing the use of either song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] was employed, while in Montreal it was [...] "O Canada". Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country's national anthem and, three years later, he advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the <b>Special</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems. Within two months, on 12 April 1967, the committee presented its conclusion that [...] "God Save the Queen", whose music and lyrics were found to be in the public domain, should be designated as the Royal Anthem of Canada and [...] "O Canada" [...] as the national anthem, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song; for [...] "God Save the Queen", the English words were those inherited from the United Kingdom and the French words were taken from those that had been adopted in 1952 for the coronation of Elizabeth II. When the bill pronouncing [...] "O Canada" [...] as the national anthem was put through parliament, the joint committee's earlier recommendations regarding [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] were not included.|$|E
2500|$|After {{one version}} of the Charter drawn in June 1980 that lasted until September, which said in its {{preamble}} that Canadians [...] "shall always be, {{with the help of}} God, a free and self-governing people," [...] the Charter was {{not going to have a}} preamble. [...] The current preamble only first appeared in the April 1981 draft, which came relatively late in the process. [...] It was included despite the fact that there was no call for the Charter to have a preamble by the <b>Special</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> which was reviewing the Constitution, and that according to George Egerton, the prime minister of Canada at the time, Pierre Trudeau, called it [...] "strange" [...] that some of his colleagues wanted God referenced in the Charter. [...] (Trudeau told his MPs, [...] "I don't think God gives a damn whether he's in the constitution or not.") [...] There were, however, various religious and Conservative criticisms of the Charter during its drafting, with fears that denominational schools and Canada's abortion law were threatened. [...] At this time as well, religious groups in Canada such as 100 Huntley Street and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada were growing and wanted God acknowledged in the Constitution. [...] Despite the Liberal Party of Canada's protests that a better preamble could be written after patriation was achieved, and thus there was no need for the preamble being proposed at the time by the Conservatives, religious groups increased their activism. [...] Trudeau's Justice Minister, Jean Chrétien, said it was the top issue in all of the letters the government was sent during patriation.|$|E
