500|$|Threni is scored for one soprano, one contralto, two tenor and two bass soloists, chorus and an {{orchestra}} of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets (second doubling alto clarinet in F), bass clarinet, contrabass <b>sarrusophone,</b> flugelhorn, 4 horns, 3 trombones (1 alto, 1 tenor, 1 bass), tuba, timpani, tamtam, harp, celesta, piano and strings. (The flugelhorn is actually listed as [...] "bugle" [...] by the publisher, {{though in the}} [...] "orchestration" [...] list {{at the head of}} the score the specification is for [...] "Contralto Bugle in B (Fluegelhorn)", and in the score itself, where all the other instruments are named in Italian, it is called in French and German, [...] "Bugle C-alto (Flügelhorn)". However, the part is played on the flugelhorn. The French word for flugelhorn is bugle à pistons, and the Italian is flicorno.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The tubax, {{developed}} in 1999 by the German instrument maker Benedikt Eppelsheim, plays the same range, {{and with the}} same fingering, as the E contrabass saxophone; its bore, however, is narrower {{than that of a}} contrabass saxophone, making for a more compact instrument with a [...] "reedier" [...] tone (akin to the double-reed contrabass <b>sarrusophone).</b> It can be played with the smaller (and more commonly available) baritone saxophone mouthpiece and reeds. Eppelsheim has also produced subcontrabass tubaxes in C and B, the latter being the lowest saxophone ever made. Among the most recent developments is the aulochrome, a double soprano saxophone invented by Belgian instrument maker François Louis in 2001.|$|E
50|$|The B-flat bass <b>sarrusophone</b> is {{the bass}} {{member of the}} <b>sarrusophone</b> family of metal double reed instruments. It has a range almost {{identical}} to a bass saxophone. There are very few pieces written for it, although one of them includes Roupen Shakarian's Sarruso Rex. It is among the rarer of the <b>sarrusophone</b> family, and they were only produced by Gautrot (a company run by Pierre L. Gautrot, who invented the <b>sarrusophone),</b> Couesnon (a descendant of the Gautrot Company), and the Orsi firm, who still makes them as special order items.|$|E
50|$|Contrabass <b>sarrusophones</b> are {{extremely}} light for contrabass instruments, weighing only {{about as much}} as a baritone saxophone, and being approximately four feet tall, about the same height as a bass saxophone. This makes them more convenient to carry around, fitting into cars more easily, and putting less strain on one's muscles while carrying or playing it. Conn made contrabass <b>sarrusophones,</b> instead of contrabass saxophones, because the <b>sarrusophones</b> were easier to ship across seas, and to send through the mail, due to their lightness.|$|R
50|$|The EE and BB <b>sarrusophones</b> are {{transposing}} instruments.|$|R
50|$|The score very unusually {{calls for}} three <b>sarrusophones,</b> a tambour de Basque, a thunder sheet and an organ. The full {{instrumentation}} is: piccolo, 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in A, bass clarinet in A, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 4 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, tuba, 3 contrabass <b>sarrusophones</b> in E, timpani, percussion (triangle, cymbals, tambourine, bass drum, tambour de Basque, tam-tam, glockenspiel, bells, thunder sheet), harp, organ and strings.|$|R
5000|$|A {{very unusual}} {{example of the}} <b>sarrusophone</b> in jazz is on the 1924 {{recording}} by the Clarence Williams Blue 5 of [...] "Mandy, Make Up Your Mind," [...] with the <b>sarrusophone</b> played by the jazz soprano saxophone and clarinet virtuoso Sidney Bechet. One can conjecture that the <b>sarrusophone</b> played was most likely a contrabass with a single reed mouthpiece, as Bechet was not a trained double reed player. Bechet later denied having ever played the <b>sarrusophone.</b> According to the biography by Chilton, Sidney [...] "pulled a face" [...] {{when asked about the}} solo on [...] "Mandy", though he did not deny playing it.|$|E
5000|$|Frank Zappa {{used the}} E {{contrabass}} <b>sarrusophone</b> in his scores for [...] "Think It Over", [...] "Big Swifty", [...] "Ulterior Motive", [...] "The Adventures of Greggery Peccary", [...] "For Calvin", [...] "Waka/Jawaka", and many others. These pieces {{can be found}} on his albums [...] "Waka/Jawaka", [...] "The Grand Wazoo", & [...] "Zappa/Wazoo". The <b>sarrusophone</b> was played by Earl Dumler. In 2013, Franklin Stover composed a Concerto Breve for E contrabass <b>sarrusophone</b> and winds.|$|E
50|$|The EE♭ <b>sarrusophone</b> has {{the tone}} of a reedy {{contrabass}} saxophone, while the CC <b>sarrusophone</b> sounds much like the contrabassoon. The BB♭ contrabass <b>sarrusophone</b> is the lowest of the sarrusophones, and was the lowest-pitched wind instrument until {{the invention of the}} EEE♭ octocontra-alto and the BBB♭ octocontrabass clarinets, and the BB♭ subcontrabass tubax. Contrabass sarrusophones come in two bore widths: big pipes, which sound mellower and softer, but are still reedy; and small pipes, which are extremely reedy.|$|E
60|$|MITCHENER. Ive {{subscribed to}} the {{regiment}}al band all my life. I bought two <b>sarrusophones</b> for {{it out of}} my own pocket. When I sang Tosti's Goodbye for Ever at Knightsbridge in 1880, the whole regiment wept. You are too young to remember that.|$|R
50|$|Benedikt Eppelsheim is a German {{maker of}} high- and low-voiced saxophones, the soprillo (sopranissimo) and tubax (sub{{contrabass}} and contrabass saxophone), {{which are available}} exclusively from him. He also makes bass saxophones, contrabass saxophones, subcontrabass saxophone (available as a special order), and contrabass clarinets. He builds <b>sarrusophones</b> as a special order as well.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sarrusophones</b> are {{a family}} of {{transposing}} musical instruments patented and placed into production by Pierre-Louis Gautrot in 1856. It was named after the French bandmaster Pierre-Auguste Sarrus (1813-1876) who is credited {{with the concept of}} the instrument, though {{it is not clear whether}} Sarrus benefited financially from this association. The instrument was intended to serve as a replacement in wind bands for the oboe and bassoon which, at that time, lacked the carrying power required for outdoor band music.|$|R
50|$|The E-flat alto <b>sarrusophone</b> is the alto {{member of}} the <b>sarrusophone</b> family of metal double reed instruments. Its body is folded only once, and has a bocal that resembles the neck of a tenor saxophone. It is {{currently}} in production by the German instrument maker Benedikt Eppelsheim.|$|E
5000|$|The B-flat tenor <b>sarrusophone</b> is {{a smaller}} type of <b>sarrusophone,</b> and has {{about the same}} range as a tenor sax. They were {{originally}} made by companies such as Orsi, Gautrot, and Triebert, but are currently made only by Orsi, and are [...] "special order" [...] items.|$|E

50|$|The French firm of G. Leblanc {{for many}} years (1950s-1980s?) {{featured}} photographs of its EEE octocontra-alto and BBB octocontrabass clarinets, instruments that could play lower still, in its advertising. However, despite their notoriety and frequent citing in books on musical instruments and in on-line discussion forums, these instruments were never placed in production and were, perhaps, more {{along the lines of}} engineering achievements and curiosities (despite the fact that the EEE model could be a viable instrument, it is said that only three were made). Even then, it appears that few BB contrabass <b>sarrusophones</b> were ever built, the EE being much more portable and perhaps, practical.|$|R
50|$|The Rothphone is a metal double reed {{instrument}} {{similar to}} the <b>sarrusophone</b> built in saxophone form. It was invented by Ferdinando Roth (1815-1898) and {{is also known as}} the rothophone, rothaphone, or saxsarrusophone. The bore of this instrument is narrower than that of either the <b>sarrusophone</b> or saxophone.|$|E

50|$|The rothphone, {{also known}} as the rothophone or saxarrusophone, is a <b>sarrusophone</b> hybrid that is rewrapped to look like a saxophone. It was {{manufactured}} by the German born (Adorf im Vogtland) maker Roth of Milan and was introduced around 1900, but found no popular acceptance, even in Italy (some instruments may be labeled Bottali, as Antonio Bottali was Ferdinando Roth's son-in-law and took over the company after Roth's death in 1898). They are, nowadays, even less common than the <b>sarrusophone.</b> They came in sizes from soprano to bass. It had a less conical and wide bore than both the saxophone and the <b>sarrusophone.</b> As per advertising of the time, the well-known American saxophone manufacturer, Buescher imported a number of these instruments into the United States during the late 1920s or early 1930s, perhaps as an answer to C.G. Conn's production of the contrabass <b>sarrusophone.</b> Per advertisements for this instrument and photos that have appeared in books, the lowest note on the Rothphone is a low B natural, not low B as with the saxophone and <b>sarrusophone.</b> In the 1930s the band at the University of Illinois under Austin Harding had a full <b>sarrusophone</b> section from soprano to E contrabass that included at least the tenor rothphone. However, this appears to have been an isolated use of the instrument.|$|E
5000|$|All {{members of}} the <b>sarrusophone</b> family are made of metal, with a conical bore, and the larger {{members of the}} family {{resemble}} the ophicleide in shape. Like the oboe and bassoon, all sizes of <b>sarrusophone</b> were originally designed to be played with a double reed. Later, single reed mouthpieces were developed which resemble alto or soprano saxophone mouthpieces. It is unclear if these were available for all sizes of the <b>sarrusophone</b> family, the most common examples being for the E contrabass. Approximate reed measurements (mm) for certain sarrusophones, expressed as (tip width, blade length, distance to first wire), are as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{contrabass}} <b>sarrusophone</b> is {{the deepest}} {{of the family}} of sarrusophones, and was made in three sizes. The EE version was the only <b>sarrusophone</b> that was ever mass-produced in the United States. It was made by companies such as Gautrot, Couesnon, Romeo Orsi, Rampone (and Cazzani), Buffet Crampon (Evette and Schaeffer), and C.G. Conn.|$|E
50|$|The E-flat {{baritone}} <b>sarrusophone,</b> sometimes jokingly {{known as}} the combat bassoon, has the same range and key as the baritone saxophone, and {{is about the same}} size as a bassoon. Its body is wrapped around only once, whereas the contrabass <b>sarrusophone</b> wraps around twice. It is currently in production by the German instrument maker Benedikt Eppelsheim.|$|E
50|$|Today, the <b>sarrusophone</b> {{is used in}} {{a handful}} of symphonic wind {{ensembles}} and as a novelty instrument on occasions. There appears to be a resurgence of interest in the instrument and there are amateur players (mostly of the EE contrabass). Bruce Broughton made extensive use of a contrabass <b>sarrusophone</b> in his score for the film Tombstone.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sarrusophone</b> {{is rarely}} scored in {{classical}} music today, {{but there are}} a few examples. Pieces written for it include Percy Grainger's Over the Hills and Far Away, Paderewski's Symphony in B Minor (Polonia), which called for three EE♭ contrabass <b>sarrusophone</b> players, Maurice Ravel's Rapsodie Espagnole, Sheherazade and L`heure espagnole, and Arrigo Boito's Nerone. Paul Dukas also used it in his orchestral tone poem The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Claude Debussy includes the CC instrument in Jeux, as does Frederick Delius in Eventyr, Requiem and Songs of Sunset. Jules Massenet writes for it in Esclarmonde. Igor Stravinsky's first fully serial work, Threni (1958), a symphonic/choral setting of passages from the Latin Vulgate of the Book of Lamentations, includes a <b>sarrusophone</b> in its unusual scoring, which also features a solo Flugelhorn. American composer Barney Childs composed a chamber work, The Golden Bubble (1967), for EE♭ contrabass <b>sarrusophone</b> and one percussionist.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>sarrusophone</b> was {{manufactured}} in the following sizes and had the following theoretical ranges: ...|$|E
50|$|The English {{composer}} Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji {{used the}} contrabass <b>sarrusophone</b> in various of his orchestral works.|$|E
50|$|The {{contrabass}} <b>sarrusophone</b> {{is sometimes}} {{confused with the}} reed contrabass, to which it bears a superficial resemblance.|$|E
50|$|The non-transposed {{range of}} the <b>sarrusophone</b> is nearly {{identical}} {{to that of the}} saxophone. The traditional conventional {{range of the}} saxophone is written B-F. Initially, Gautrot advertised the range of the <b>sarrusophone</b> to high F as well, but later fingering charts indicated a range to high G. Sometime after 1868, Gautrot also released a fingering chart indicating fingerings higher still up to a top B-flat, giving a range of three full octaves.|$|E
5000|$|A soprano <b>sarrusophone</b> is {{seen and}} heard in the song [...] "Humpty-Dumpty Heart" [...] played by Kay Kyser's band in the 1941 film Playmates.|$|E
50|$|The {{fingering}} of the <b>sarrusophone</b> {{is nearly}} identical {{to that of the}} saxophone. This similarity caused Adolphe Sax to file and lose at least one lawsuit against Gautrot, claiming infringement upon his patent for the saxophone. Sax lost {{on the grounds that the}} tone produced by the two families of instruments is markedly different, despite their mechanical similarities. However, because the <b>sarrusophone</b> never gained wide acceptance, makers were not inclined to develop its mechanism to the same extent as that of the saxophone.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the concert}} band literature, Percy Grainger used the EE {{contrabass}} {{in the original}} scoring of his children's march [...] "Over the Hills and Far Away". In early 20th century Italian band scores, parts for the B tenor, E baritone, and B bass sarrusophones {{as well as the}} contrabass are common. It appears that higher members of the <b>sarrusophone</b> family were not as popular as the lower members, with the sopranino in E♭ along with its distant cousin, the high E oboe, being particularly rare. For the most part, the use of the <b>sarrusophone</b> was primarily in France, Italy and Spain. During or after World War I, US Military personnel noted the use of the contrabass <b>sarrusophone</b> in French military bands and thereafter, commissioned the U.S. firm Conn to manufacture the EE contrabass for use in U.S. military bands beginning in approximately 1921, as per Conn's advertising of the time. The instrument was offered for sale to the general public as well, but production appears to have ceased in the 1930s. Conns as late as 1936 are known to exist. Beginning in 1921, the John Philip Sousa band used the Conn <b>sarrusophone</b> for an unknown period of time. In 1908 when Sir Thomas Beecham wished to perform the work [...] "Apollo and the Seaman" [...] by the British composer Josef Holbrooke (who had included parts for several sizes of sarrusophones), the <b>sarrusophone</b> parts had to be played by performers brought over from France. Paderewski included three E contrabass sarrusophones in his Symphony in B Minor ("Polonia").|$|E
5000|$|The {{tone of the}} <b>sarrusophone</b> is {{less clear}} but much reedier {{than that of the}} saxophone. In humorous terms, the <b>sarrusophone</b> can be said to sound rather [...] "industrial" [...] or perhaps [...] "unrefined." [...] New sarrusophones can still be bought by request from the Orsi Instrument Company, in Italy. Historically, Orsi, Rampone (later Rampone & Cazzani), Buffet (under the {{ownership}} of Evette & Schaeffer), Conn (E contrabass only), Gautrot and Couesnon (Gautrot's successor) were the best known and possibly, only makers that produced in quantity.|$|E
50|$|The Soprano <b>sarrusophone</b> is {{a member}} of the <b>sarrusophone</b> family. It is a keyed metal double reed {{instrument}} with a conical bore, pitched in B-flat. Its range is approximately the same as that of the soprano saxophone and its tone is similar to that of the oboe, although louder and less refined, more like a shawm. Although used in wind bands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it is today extremely rare, as few original specimens survive. New instruments can still be purchased on a special order basis from the ORSI firm of Italy.|$|E
50|$|Although obscure, the {{instrument}} {{may still be}} procured, on request, from the Italian instrument manufacturer Orsi. The reed contrabass is sometimes confused with the contrabass <b>sarrusophone,</b> to which it bears some superficial resemblance.|$|E
5000|$|No palm keys {{for playing}} the top range. Using the non-automatic {{register}} keys, 3rd harmonics are easily available, rendering palm keys unnecessary. The relatively narrow bore of the <b>sarrusophone</b> also aids in the rendering of these 3rd harmonics ...|$|E
