30|$|In the {{following}} sections, {{the concept of}} the CEF will be described. We start with describing how the CEF access activation is selected by the specific system parameter useCEF accepting the values FALSE and TRUE. If the value useCEF is FALSE, the whole calculation will be executed in the PSE on the local machine separately. The scientist is able to use all features of the PSE, such as debugging, printing, but must wait until the calculation is completely finished. Without parallel extensions a PSE uses only one core. Depending on the power of the computer used, long running calculations can take a while. If the scientist sets useCEF to TRUE, the CEF will be used. The Code Execution Controller starts the required amount of VMs, transmits the calculation to VMs, executes the calculations, and generates the combined result. The administrator of the CEF must define which cloud platforms (e.g. Amazon EC 2, Eucalyptus) are used. For each cloud platform he/she must set (a) what machines types should be used (e.g. m 1.small, m 1.xlarge), (b) how many instances can be started simultaneously, (c) the shut down behavior (e.g. shut down immediately after all waiting calculations are finished or just before the researcher has to pay for another hour for this idle machine), and (d) the total available daily/monthly budget for this cloud platform. The Code Execution Controller (CEC) is able to call the WorkerNodeStatus Web service from each VM to request the number of available cores, core usage, total and available memory. At the moment the CEC starts the maximum available amount of virtual machines if required, the maximum cost boundary is not yet implemented. The CEC stores all started VMs in a queue. If a calculation is waiting, the first free VM will be used for this execution. In terms of security, the worker node (VM) only accepts requests of the CEC that started the VM. When the calculation at a worker node is finished or failed, the result and log information will be sent to the CEC and afterwards all files from this calculation will be deleted immediately. In the future, the CEC will send sub-calculations from one user to a worker node at the same time, even if multiple cores are available. Therefore it is impossible to <b>spy</b> <b>out</b> <b>data</b> <b>of</b> other users by executing dangerous PSE code.|$|R

5000|$|Klingberg's {{motives for}} spying are not {{definitively}} known. Klingberg {{claimed that he}} <b>spied</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ideological reasons, {{and that he was}} never paid. However, he told his interrogators that he had not completed his medical studies and lacked a diploma, and that the KGB had blackmailed him by threatening to expose this.|$|R
50|$|In an {{interview}} after his release, Klingberg maintained {{that he had}} <b>spied</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ideological reasons, but had lied to his interrogators {{and said he had}} been blackmailed so he would receive a lighter sentence. In {{an interview}} in 2014 he said that he also felt he owed the Russians a debt for saving the world from the Nazis. He said he had always been a communist, and had recruited his wife Wanda and two friends.|$|R
50|$|A book {{by author}} Edward Jay Epstein {{published}} in 1978 described Fedora in enough detail {{to make it}} likely that the KGB was able to identify Kulak as the source. With his cover probably blown, the CIA offered to exfiltrate Kulak, devising an elaborate ruse to carry out {{what would have been}} a first-of-its-kind operation to pull a <b>spy</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Moscow, but when Kulak was finally contacted, he politely thanked the CIA for its offer, but declined saying he was not concerned for his safety.|$|R

50|$|In 1977, back in Moscow, Kulak resumed {{contact with}} the CIA and {{provided}} a valuable list of Soviet scientists attempting to steal U.S. scientific secrets. He promised to provide even more valuable sets <b>of</b> <b>data</b> about the inner-most workings of the KGB and the Soviet Union's efforts to steal American technology. However, when he signaled {{to make contact with}} CIA agents, he got no response. CIA director Stansfield Turner had issued orders to the Moscow CIA station to halt contacts with undercover <b>spies,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fear the station had been compromised. Despite Kulak's attempts to signal for a meeting a second time, contact was never made and his offer of more material was never taken up.|$|R

Sandstede had started to flood the vessel, but they were quickly taken into custody. Sanstede attempted suicide by slashing his wrists, but eventually both Eppler and Sandstede cooperated fully with their interrogators, and were spared execution (the usual fate <b>of</b> <b>spies</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> uniform during World War II).

50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, John Colton (Warde) sends his son Jack (Vaughn) to Russia to compete {{the details of a}} loan to that government. While there, Jack assists the Countess Olga (Eagels), who is hounded by <b>spies,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country. She sails for America and on the steamer meets Vera Ladislaus (Gregory), who is going to stay with the Coltons. The steamer is torpedoed and Vera loses her life. Olga, on arrival in New York, poses as Vera in order to obtain information in the John Colton home as she has been told that he is aiding the Russian government. After being established in the home, the kindness of the Coltons make her regret her situation. Jack's return home and the arrival of Vera's father complicates matters. However, upon Colton's statement to the assembled Russians at their headquarters that he is really helping the cause of freedom, Olga's true feelings to the Coltons, and especial Jack, are seen.|$|R

5|$|In May 1934, {{following}} {{reports of}} a Japanese <b>spy</b> operating <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Dutch Harbor, the United States Navy dispatched Edwin T.

During the 1930s, a number of United States governmental committees, boards and reports concluded that air bases in the Aleutians would be for the most part impractical due to the region's inclement weather.|$|R
50|$|It was daybreak on December 18, 1860, when Ranger Captain Ross himself scouted out {{the camp}} on the Pease River as his scouts {{reported}} {{the presence of a}} fairly large hunting party and {{camp on the}} banks of the Pease.
