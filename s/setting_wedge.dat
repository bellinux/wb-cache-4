40|$|Documents {{written in}} {{cuneiform}} script {{are one of}} the largest sources about ancient history. The script is written by imprinting wedges (Latin: cunei) into clay tablets and was used for almost four millennia. This three-dimensional script is typically transcribed by hand with ink on paper. These transcriptions are available in large quantities as raster graphics by online sources like the Cuneiform Database Library Initative (CDLI). Within this article we present an approach to extract Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in 2 D from raster images as we previously did from 3 D models. This enlarges our basis of data sets for tasks like word-spotting. In the first step of vectorizing the raster images we extract smooth outlines and a minimal graph representation of <b>sets</b> of <b>wedges,</b> i. e., main components of cuneiform characters. Then we discretize these outlines followed by a Delaunay triangulation to extract skeletons of <b>sets</b> of connected <b>wedges.</b> To separate the <b>sets</b> into single <b>wedges</b> we experimented with different conflict resolution strategies and candidate pruning. A thorough evaluation of our methods and its parameters on real word data shows that the wedges are extracted with a true positive rate of 0. 98. At the same time the false positive rate is 0. 2, which requires future extension by using statistics about geometric configurations of <b>wedge</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Nondestructive {{inspection}} of whole structures {{is important for}} the safety and reliability. For the {{inspection of}} internal defects, ultrasonic testing (UT) with bulk waves has been widely used, whereas such UT cannot inspect surface due to a dead zone. To this end, we proposed a phased array with surface acoustic wave (SAW PA) [1, 2] for rapidly inspecting surface defects with a high sensitivity. However, the performance has yet to be fully educed because it was not optimized in terms of the wedge and imaging region. The objective {{of this study is to}} improve SAW PA and to demonstrate the wide-range and detailed imaging capabilities for screening and sizing, respectively. The schematic of SAWPA is illustrated in Fig. 1. An array transducer is <b>set</b> on a <b>wedge</b> with a critical angle of Rayleigh wave. Following a delay law, SAWis focused on multiple focal points on the surface, providing an image over the scan area. Note that SAWPA has a capability of a real-time imaging. In this study, the wedge for SAW generation was improved. In the previous study [1], the wedge was made of acrylic resin that is inexpensive and has good workability. It is however relatively attenuative, so that the incident wave was significantly attenuated during the propagation in the wedge. Therefore, it was changed to polystyrene that is less attenuative. The polystyrene has smaller critical angle than acrylic resin, thus also shortening the propagation distance in the wedge. This is useful for both screening and sizing. To show the wide-range imaging capability, a hole specimen (A 6063) was imaged with varying the propagation distance of Rayleigh wave. As a result, a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio was obtained even in a far distance of 400 mm (Fig. 2). Subsequently, it was applied to the crack specimen, where the imaging area was <b>set</b> beneath the <b>wedge</b> to attain high resolution and sensitivity, although the region outside the wedge was selected for screening and in Ref. [1]. As a result, the crack was clearly imaged with a high resolution. These results show that the improved SAWPA is useful for both screening and sizing...|$|R
40|$|Implementation of the {{ultrasonic}} {{second harmonic}} generation has typically been restricted to simple setups such as through-transmission or Rayleigh surface waves. Recent research has evaluated the {{second harmonic generation}} in P- and SV- waves reflected from a stress-free surface to enable the single-sided interrogation of a specimen. This research considers the second harmonic generation in an aluminum specimen, which is analytically evaluated using an approach based on the perturbation method. Here, the model is chosen to mimic an experimental setup where a longitudinal wave is generated at an oblique angle and the reflected wave is detected using a <b>set</b> of <b>wedge</b> transducers. Due to mode conversion at the interface of the wedge and the specimen, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate longitudinal and shear waves, determining all second harmonic waves generated in the bulk and at the stressfree boundary. The theoretically developed model is then implemented in a commercial finite element code, COMSOL, using increasing fundamental wave amplitudes for different values of third order elastic constants. The results of this computational model verify the analytical approach and the proposed measurement setup, taking into account assumptions and approximations of the solution procedure. Furthermore, the computational model is used to draw important conclusions relevant to the experimental setup, including the need to avoid evolving surface waves and interactions with diffracted waves. These numerical results are used to develop a recommendation for the measurement position and incident angle. Finally, the nonlinearity of two different aluminum specimens is measured with the suggested measurement setup and the results confirm the feasibility of the single-sided determination of the acoustic nonlinearity using reflected bulk waves.

Nevertheless, {{there is still a}} demand for improved quantitative characterization of bond quality. Furthermore, in service, adhesively bonded joints are subjected to complex combinations of mechanical and environmental loads, which are not covered by conventional failure and life prediction models. In a co-operative project, wedge test specimens, thick adherent specimens for shear strength determination, and bulk specimens were manufactured in order to investigate three different adhesives, a commercial epoxy adhesive and two model adhesives, a two component and a one component epoxy adhesive, respectively. Before and after combined mechanical and environmental loading, the samples were examined with ultrasonic non-destructive techniques by IZFP. In order to understand the damage mechanisms, the adhesives were analysed via IR spectroscopy by one of the project partners. The wedge test samples were made of 3 mm thick stainless steel substrates with 0. 3 mm thick adhesive layers. They were aged at 60 °C in water immersion and at 60 °C in dry air. In addition, they were loaded mechanically by <b>wedge</b> insertion. Two <b>sets</b> of <b>wedge</b> test samples were imaged in situ during the ageing process by high-frequency ultrasonic microscopy at 25 MHz and at 50 MHz. To this end, a special set-up was developed allowing ultrasonic imaging in immersion in water at controlled temperatures up to 60 °C. By evaluation of the ultrasonic data, the crack propagation was imaged during the ageing process. As shown here, the final crack front detected non-destructively by ultrasound agreed to the optical fracture image taken after destruction of the samples. In addition, the ultrasonic data are discussed with respect to the damage mechanisms in comparison to the IR spectroscopic findings...|$|R

This study extends a well established film-screen noise equalization scheme developed by Veldkamp et al. for application to full-field digital mammogram (FFDM) images. A simple noise model is determined {{based on the assumption that}} quantum noise is dominant in direct digital X-ray imaging. Estimation of the noise as a function of the gray level is improved by calculating the noise statistics using a truncated distribution method. Experimental support for the quantum noise assumption is presented for a <b>set</b> of step <b>wedge</b> phantom images. Performance of the noise equalization technique is also tested as a preprocessing stage to a microcalcification detection scheme. It is shown that the square root model based approach which FFDM allows leads to a robust estimation of the high frequency image noise.

(In the specific application, failsafe signifies that the brake is normally engaged; that is, power must be supplied to allow free rotation.) The magnetic failsafe brake must be supplied with about 8 W of electric power to initiate and maintain disengagement. In contrast, the magnetostrictive brake, which would have about the same dimensions and the same torque rating {{as those of the}} magnetic fail-safe brake, would demand only about 2 W of power for disengagement. The brake (see figure) would include a stationary base plate and a hub mounted on the base plate. Two solenoid assemblies would be mounted in diametrically opposed recesses in the hub. The cores of the solenoids would be made of the magnetostrictive alloy Terfenol-D or equivalent. The rotating part of the brake would be a ring-and spring- disk subassembly. By means of leaf springs not shown in the figure, this subassembly would be coupled with the shaft that the brake is meant to restrain. With no power supplied to the solenoids, a permanent magnet would pull axially on a stepped disk and on a shelf in the hub, causing the ring to be squeezed axially between the stepped disk and the hub. The friction associated with this axial squeeze would effect the braking action. Supplying electric power to the solenoids would cause the magnetostrictive cylinders to push radially inward against a <b>set</b> of <b>wedges</b> that would be in axial contact with the stepped disk. The wedges would convert the radial magnetostrictive strain to a multiplied axial displacement of the stepped disk.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{generating}} wedge-shaped dose distributions through dynamic multileaf collimator dose delivery rather than computer-controlled jaw motion is presented. The method {{starts with the}} calculation of a wedge-shaped beam profile for the desired wedge angle. The resultant wedge beam profile is then passed to the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) leaf sequence generation algorithm to create multileaf collimator (MLC) segments for dose delivery. Wedge-shaped dose distributions are achieved through dynamic MLC dose delivery guided with the generated MLC segments. The method has been tested by generating wedgeshaped doses for a <b>set</b> of conventional <b>wedge</b> angles (i. e., 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, and 60 °). Film dosimetry is used for dose distribution verification. For each dose delivery guided with MLC segments created for the indicated wedge angle, the desired wedge-shaped dose distributions are observed. It is concluded that the dynamic MLC {{can be used to}} implement dynamic wedges in the clinic. This technique is different from the virtual wedge or the dynamic wedge developed for a particular type of LINAC. The same method can be applied to any machine equipped with a MLC.

The synthetic protocol involved the preparation of presynthesized dendron wedges that subsequently were attached to a tetra-valent alkyne functional cyclen core. These constructed structures integrated stable triazole groups "intra-locked" between the cyclen and dendron wedges. The incorporation of a lanthanide metal ion, europium, into the interior of all cyclen dendrimers was monitored by FT-IR. Interestingly, the photophysical results showed that the proximate triazole not only acts as a stable linker but also as a sensitizers, transferring its singlet–singlet excitation in the ultraviolet region (270 – 290 nm) to the partially filled luminescent lanthanide 4 f shell. An increase of luminescence decay time from the lanthanide 5 D 0 → 7 F 2 emission was observed with increasing dendrimer size, indicating that the shielding effect of the dendron wedges is important for the relaxation of the photo-excitation and energy transfer.

Regarding the vertical surface deformation, subsidence was dominant {{across the entire}} Tohoku district and was controlled mainly by relaxation in the oceanic mantle (Fig.  4 e). This model can explain the observed horizontal deformation, although it cannot explain the vertical deformation characteristics. The main problem with this model is the assumption of the same viscosity for all viscoelastic media. Previous studies of viscoelastic relaxation at subduction zones have reported that the difference in viscosity between the mantle wedge and the oceanic mantle significantly affects the surface deformation (Hu et al. 2004; Wang 2007). In addition, these two media contribute differently to the surface deformation, as mentioned in the previous subsection. Moreover, DeMets et al. (2014) recently reported that the viscosity of the asthenosphere below the oceanic plate is greater than 1  ×  1019  Pa s. Since we considered that the viscosity of the oceanic mantle is {{higher than that of}} the mantle wedge, we used a viscosity value for the oceanic mantle of at least 1  ×  1019  Pa s. On the basis of Model 1 and the results of the previous studies, we next designed Model 2, which assumes different viscosities between the mantle <b>wedge,</b> <b>set</b> at 2  ×  1018  Pa s, and the oceanic mantle, set at 1  ×  1019  Pa s.|$|R
