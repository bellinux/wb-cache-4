25|$|These trades {{appear to}} be mostly small arms sales to {{middlemen}} arms dealers who in turn sell to both governments and rebels in Africa. The available evidence suggests these amounts are not major, especially compared to the U.S. supply of nearly 50% of the world's weapons, and that the direct leverage of the Peoples Liberation Army or the civilian ministries is modest in most African conflicts. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates China's 2000–2004 unpublished arms exports at about $1.4b, and US exports at about $25.9b. A 2005 UN arms destruction operation in Congo reported that 17% of them were Chinese made, while the remaining 83% came from other manufacturers.

The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential. The magazine rated the Jaguar version similarly, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions {{of the game}}, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play. A GamePro review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying Wolfenstein 3D [...] "set a new standard for PC gaming" [...] and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities. Major Mike of GamePro commended the 3DO version's complete absence of pixelation, fast scaling, [...] "rousing" [...] music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, [...] "still packs a punch as a first-person shooter". Wolfenstein 3D won GamePros Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed The Need for Speed and D.

A reviewer for Next Generation asserted that Wolfenstein 3D was [...] "still as addictive as it ever was" [...] but essentially agreed with Maximum, contending that anyone interested in first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or [...] "moved on" [...] to more advanced games in the genre. A more modern review by Daemon Hatfield of IGN gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was [...] "dated and flawed", it was [...] "required playing for any first-person shooter fan".|$|E
