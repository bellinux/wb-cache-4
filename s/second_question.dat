5|$|In {{the third}} round, one {{contestant}} from each team faces {{the same question}} simultaneously. Contestants have their own money countdown, which starts at $1,000 and decreases by $50 per second. The other contestant from each team then faces a more difficult question, with an opening value of $2,500 and decreasing by $100 per second. The host usually reads the question to the contestants during this round. After this <b>second</b> <b>question,</b> the team that has more money wins and plays the bonus round for $10,000.|$|E
5|$|Litras {{then took}} her turn. She earned three spins in the <b>second</b> <b>question</b> round, but {{since she had}} {{received}} passed spins she was required to take them first. She also hit a Whammy on her first spin, which reduced her score to zero. The three remaining spins that Larson had passed her were added to her earned spins, giving her a total of six. Litras picked up $9,385 in cash and prizes in five total spins, but because she managed to hit spaces with extra spins, she only used three.|$|E

5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the <b>second</b> <b>question,</b> no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E

50|$|Also, if McGuire {{believes}} that the contestant is taking too long to make a decision, the contestant may be put on a shot clock of 60 seconds. If the shot clock expires, the contestant is forced to walk away with their current winnings. This rule was introduced because the format was live. The previous format was pre-recorded where the producers could edit the contestant's deliberations in case they were longer than the producers preferred. The host {{has to make the}} decision, which is unlike the US version, which adopted a fixed 15 second (first five), 30 seconds (second five), 45 <b>seconds</b> (<b>questions</b> 11-14) and total time saved plus 45 <b>seconds</b> (15th <b>question)</b> clock in 2008.|$|R
30|$|The {{first and}} <b>second</b> <b>questions</b> looked at preconceived notions of Japan and/or JAIST. Based on the {{literature}} in the field (Thomas and Althen 1989; Murphy-Shigematsu 2002), {{it is said that}} the understanding of people in relation to these preconceived notions has impact on how the individual may interact and participate at the initial stages of acculturation, thus any contradictions may in fact cause the individual to have a delay in relation to acculturation.|$|R
30|$|The <b>second</b> {{research}} <b>question</b> {{was about}} what the students considered to be valuable in the study process organised in an open innovation environment.|$|R
25|$|The ballot {{consisted}} of two questions; voters could vote on one or the other, or on both. The first question asked whether Gray Davis should be recalled. It was a simple yes/no question, and if a majority voted no, then the <b>second</b> <b>question</b> would become irrelevant and Gray Davis would remain California governor. If a majority voted yes, then Davis would {{be removed from office}} once the vote was certified, and the <b>second</b> <b>question</b> would determine his successor. Voters had to choose one candidate from a long list of 135 candidates. Voters who voted against recalling Gray Davis could still vote for a candidate to replace him in case the recall vote succeeded. The candidate receiving the most votes (a plurality) would then become the next governor of California. Certification by the Secretary of State of California would require completion within 39 days of the election, and history indicated that it could require that entire time frame to certify the statewide election results. Once the results were certified, a newly elected governor would have to be sworn into office within 10 days.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{very little}} is known about the <b>second</b> <b>question</b> of {{classifying}} the smooth structures on a smoothable 4-manifold; in fact, there is not a single smoothable 4-manifold where the answer is known. Donaldson showed that there are some simply connected compact 4-manifolds, such as Dolgachev surfaces, with a countably infinite number of different smooth structures. There are an uncountable number of different smooth structures on R4; see exotic R4.|$|E
25|$|On October 7, 2003, {{the recall}} {{election}} resulted in Governor Gray Davis being {{removed from office}} with 55.4% of the Yes {{vote in favor of}} a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the <b>second</b> <b>question</b> on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862.|$|E

50|$|During {{the last}} {{thirteen}} weeks of this series, {{and the aforementioned}} follow-up weekly syndicated series, two married couples competed instead of three individual contestants. Each couple was given $20 {{at the start of}} the game. On the syndicated version, the first round consisted of questions worth $5, and in the <b>second</b> <b>questions</b> were valued at $10. A series of five questions worth $20 each were asked to conclude the game. If either couple's score reached $0, both couples were given an additional $20.|$|R

25|$|The {{answer to}} the first {{question}} is provided by introducing the Zariski topology, a topology on An whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of k. Then U = V(I(U)) if and only if U is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The {{answer to the}} <b>second</b> <b>question</b> is given by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. In one of its forms, it says that I(V(S)) is the radical of the ideal generated by S. In more abstract language, there is a Galois connection, giving rise to two closure operators; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the example is elaborated at Galois connection.|$|E
25|$|Blackmun ruled for the {{government}} on both questions. Since Schmuck had enjoyed a continuing relationship with the dealers he sold to, and the cars could not be resold to a retail customer without titles obtained using false information, the dealers' applications were {{an essential element of}} his crime and thus constituted mail fraud. On the <b>second</b> <b>question,</b> Blackmun said the court should have considered whether the elements of odometer tampering were a subset of the elements of the mail fraud, and since {{that was not the case}} Schmuck had been properly denied the instruction. Scalia's dissent focused exclusively on the mail fraud issue. Since Schmuck had already received his payment for the altered vehicles, it did not matter what happened afterwards, a holding he found more consistent with the Court's earlier rulings on the subject.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} the <b>second</b> <b>question.</b> Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the U.S. version {{changed its}} format so that contestants were {{required}} to answer questions within a set time limit. The time limits were 15 <b>seconds</b> for <b>questions</b> 1–5, 30 <b>seconds</b> for <b>questions</b> 6-10, and 45 <b>seconds</b> for <b>questions</b> 11-14. After each of the 14 questions were answered correctly, the remaining time after giving an answer was banked for the million-dollar question. The clock for each question began counting down immediately after all of the question was revealed, and was temporarily paused when a lifeline was used. Contestants who exceeded the time limit were forced to walk away with any prize money they had won up to that point. The clock was later adopted by other international versions; for example, the British version adopted it on 3 August 2010, and the Indian version adopted it on 11 October the same year.|$|R

500|$|In 2019 Los Angeles, {{former police}} officer Rick Deckard is {{detained}} by officer Gaff {{and brought to}} his former supervisor, Bryant. Deckard, whose job as a [...] "blade runner" [...] was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and [...] "retire" [...] (kill) them, is informed that four are on Earth illegally.

500|$|Larson {{earned a}} total of seven spins in the <b>second</b> <b>question</b> round. Since he was in third place, he got to play first at the [...] "Big Board" [...] and went to his pattern play, aiming for squares #4 and #8. Larson quickly bumped his total to over $10,000. Early on, his pattern play was irregular, as he stopped four times on squares that did not follow his pattern: a trip to Kauai worth $1,636 in square #7, $700 and one spin in square #17; [...] "Pick a Corner" [...] in square #6 (where {{he was given the}} choice of $2,250 in square #1, $2,000 in square #10, or $1,500 and one spin in square #15—he chose $2,250); and a {{sailboat}} worth $1,015 in square #7.|$|E
500|$|The court's {{decision}} {{was the subject}} of significant legal debate. In 2007, Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had reached the opposite conclusion. [...] In June 2011, the Supreme Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to resolve two questions.

500|$|As customary, {{the game}} {{began with the}} first of two rounds in which contestants {{answered}} questions to earn spins for the [...] "Big Board"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him here, and he struggled early. On the <b>second</b> <b>question,</b> host Peter Tomarken asked, [...] "You've probably got President Franklin D. Roosevelt in your pocket or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side". Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, [...] "$50 bill", after which Tomarken finished the question [...] "of what American coin?" [...] with the answer being [...] "a dime"; the other choice was [...] "a nickel". He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the <b>second</b> <b>question</b> is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{regards the}} <b>second</b> <b>question,</b> in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{identified}} {{three categories of}} legitimate expectations. Category (b) involves procedural legitimate expectations, and so are not discussed here because breaches of them are a form of procedural impropriety rather than illegality. Categories (a) and (c) relate to substantive legitimate expectations. Category (a) cases are those which lie [...] "in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field". The public authority [...] "is only required {{to bear in mind}} its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness. On the other hand, category (c) cases are usually those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract". When assessing such a case, the court decides whether for a public authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy. A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice John Laws. In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie (1999), he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not [...] "hermetically sealed", and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005), he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach: ...|$|E
