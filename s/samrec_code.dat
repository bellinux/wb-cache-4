40|$|Abstract: The <b>SAMREC</b> <b>Code</b> {{sets out}} the minimum {{standard}} for the Public Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. When making a declaration the Competent Person (CP) must disclose relevant information concerning the status and characteristics of a mineral deposit that could materially influence the economic value of the deposit and promptly report any material changes. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Listing enlists Panel Readers to review all CP Reports and annual reports for their compliance with the <b>SAMREC</b> <b>Code</b> and Section 12 of the JSE Listing Requirements. The JSE Readers Panel assists in achieving reporting compliance. However {{there are still many}} Public Reports that are not formally reviewed. Thus, the <b>SAMREC</b> <b>Code</b> is largely reliant on self-regulation. Although Clause 11 of the <b>SAMREC</b> <b>Code</b> makes provision for complaints made in respect of Public Reporting, complaints are rarely made. Yet, noncompliant reporting remains an issue within the southern African mineral industry. This paper investigates compliance of Public Reports and some of the common compliance issues currently being experienced. The paper also discusses methodologies to improve compliance and Public Reporting, such as self-regulation, coaching and training and other means to promote good reporting compliance...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to document recent personal thoughts, opinions, and debate around the South African Mineral Resource Committee (<b>SAMREC)</b> <b>Code</b> (2009) (the Code) and its current usage by competent Persons. Admittedly, some debates are {{as old as the}} <b>SAMREC</b> <b>Code</b> itself and have been ‘parked’ as no consensus could be reached by members of the SAMREC Working Group. Some of the more critical issues currently under examination are the definition of Competent Person and the potential registration of Competent Persons, the current re-write of the Code and the introduction of reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves on an ‘if not why not’ basis, noncompliance to the Code and discipline, the role of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Readers Panel, and the valuation of mineral assets based on scoping studies...|$|E
40|$|The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (the <b>SAMREC</b> <b>Code</b> or the Code) {{sets out}} minimum standards, {{recommendations}} and guidelines for public reporting of exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves in South Africa. The Code is being rewritten and updated, with work on-going since 2013. The revision is being undertaken {{to ensure the}} Code remains relevant, incorporates developments within the international mining industry and keeps abreast of technology. Some of the changes and their reasons are discussed...|$|E
5000|$|The {{requirement}} for a Qualified Person in the NI 43-101 {{is different from}} that required by the JORC <b>Code,</b> and the <b>SAMREC</b> and SAMVAL <b>Codes,</b> wherein the person must have 5 years experience relevant to the deposit type or style of mineralization but is otherwise similar in terms of {{who may or may not}} sign off on such a document.|$|R
5000|$|Two main {{regulatory}} documents exist {{depending on}} the national jurisdiction the company is filed with. In Canada, the National Instrument 43-101 report details requirements of reporting mineralized findings. In Australia, the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (JORC Code), and South Africa mandates the South African Code for the Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (<b>SAMREC).</b> All 3 <b>codes</b> are similar but not identical on requirements, definitions, and terminology. Regardless of the technicalities of each document, all exist to: ...|$|R
50|$|Venmyn Deloitte MD Andy Clay {{and other}} staff members have {{assisted}} {{and continue to}} assist with drafting the <b>SAMREC</b> and SAMVAL <b>codes</b> that govern the South African minerals industry. The South African Code for the Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (SAMREC) sets out minimum standards, recommendations and guidelines for the public reporting of exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves in South Africa while the South African Code for the Valuation of Mineral Assets (SAMVAL) sets down the minimum standards, recommendations and guidelines for the valuation of mineral assets.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of the CRISCO family of International reporting Codes {{is a response to}} a number of mining industry “bubbles” e. g. Poseidon Nickel Boom and Bust of 1969 / 70 and Bre-X Scandal of 1997. Although the USA and Australians had started developing their codes (1988 and 1989 respectively), the international initiative to standardise reporting definitions for mineral resources and mineral reserves began at the 15 th Council of Mining and Metallurgical Institutions (CMMI) Congress at Sun City, South Africa in 1994. The ad-hoc International Definitions Group (later to become CRIRSCO) was provided with the primary objective of developing a set of international standard definitions for the reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves. Deliberations continued with agreement being reached for the definitions of the two major categories, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, and their respective sub-categories Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources, and Proved and Probable Mineral Reserves under the Denver Accord in 1997. Following these agreements, an updated version of the JORC Code was released in Australia in 1999 and the first <b>SAMREC</b> <b>Code</b> was issued in 2000. In 2002, the Combined Reserves International Reporting Standards Committee (CRIRSCO, now known as the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards) was formed, replacing the CMMI International Definitions Group, with the mission to continue coordination between member countries of the {{development of}} international standards for the definition and reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. Subsequently various other codes have been developed based on the CRIRSCO template. These now include eight national representative organisations (NROs); namely Australasia (JORC), Canada (CIM), Chile (National Committee), Europe (National Committee PERC), Mongolia (MPIGM), Russia (NAEN), South Africa (SAMREC) and the USA (SME). The combined value of mining companies listed on the stock exchanges of these countries accounts for more than 80 % of the listed capital of the mining industry (CRIRSCO website) ...|$|E
50|$|The National Instrument 43-101 is broadly {{comparable}} to the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (JORC Code) which regulates the publication of mineral exploration reports on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). It is also broadly comparable with the South African Code for the Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (<b>SAMREC).</b> The reporting <b>codes</b> are, however, not entirely congruent in practice, in that NI 43-101 is more prescriptive {{in terms of the}} manner in which mineral exploration reporting is presented, although the content of the technical reports, and the scientific rigors to which the mineral resource classifications within them are put, are often very similar.|$|R
