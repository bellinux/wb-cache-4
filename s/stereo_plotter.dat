5000|$|In 1975, the US Wildlife Service {{initiated}} a national program to map and digitize all the wetlands in the US. In 1976 they awarded {{a contract to}} Autometric to develop a software application that allowed stereo imagery to be digitized using an analytical <b>stereo</b> <b>plotter.</b> Later support for 2d digitization from single photos (aka single photo resection) on a digitizing table was added. The software was called WAMS (Wetlands Analytical Mapping System). The WAMS data store used a tiled vector structure. Each tile was called a “geounit”. A geounit corresponded {{to one of the}} USGS quadrangle scales, typically 1:24000. As the data were digitized, they were immediately stored in the tiled data store and topologically structured. Lines crossing geounit boundaries were automatically split. The storage Coordinate Reference System (CRS) was WGS 72 lat/long. WAMS is described in detail in “The wetlands analytical mapping system: WAMS" [...] and Niedzwiadek, 1980 ...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{reported}} from an ongoing program of radargrammetric experimentation with SIR-B data. Six stereo models of orbits over Australia were processed in an analytical <b>stereo</b> <b>plotter.</b> Height accuracies {{were up to}} + or - 25 m or 1. 8 times the range resolution. This is better than in previous SIR-B stereo work, probably due to better image quality. Some inconsistencies were encountered between look angle geometries and height measurement accuracies. While general observations about earlier SIR-B stereo results were confirmed, inconsistencies with theoretical expectations could not be fully explained...|$|E
40|$|The acronym E-FOTO {{stands for}} an Educational Digital Photogrammetric Workstation. This is a {{multidisciplinary}} research project developed in The Rio de Janeiro State University. The E-FOTO project has two pillars: self-learning and gratuity. This dissertation evaluates {{the quality of}} the photogrammetric measurements performed by the 1. 0 &# 946; integrated version of the E-FOTO software. One photogrammetric blocks of airborne imagery: the former photogrammetric dataset is assembled from 12 photograms of the city of Seropédica-RJ, flown in 2005. The photogrammetric measurements taken in the E-FOTO were compared with those taken using the Leica Photogrammetry Suite (LPS 2010) commercial software. The ground truth is a set of 30 ground testing points (GCP) measured with a geodetic, dual frequency receiver of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS/GPS). A digital photogrammetric mapping procedure was used to evaluate the E-FOTO software. For doing so, both interior and exterior orientation parameters of every image were computed. The photogrammetric computation of object-space coordinates of testing points was performed in the 1. 64 version of the <b>stereo</b> <b>plotter</b> module of the E-FOTO. The comparisons {{of the results of the}} E-FOTO measurements with those taken from the LPS software can be considered identical, at the confidence level of 95 %. The photogrammetric measurements performed in the 1. 64 version of the E-FOTO stereoplotter module also match the tridimensional UTM coordinates (E, N and H) of the ground testing points at the same confidence level of 95 %.

2500|$|In the mid-to-late 20th century, {{advances}} in electronic technology {{have led to}} further revolution in cartography. Specifically computer hardware devices such as computer screens, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic <b>stereo</b> <b>plotters</b> along with visualization, image processing, spatial analysis and database software, have democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps, particularly with their ability to produce maps that show slightly different features, without engraving a new printing plate.

25|$|In the 20th century, aerial photography, {{satellite}} imagery, {{and remote}} sensing provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. Advancements in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography. Ready availability {{of computers and}} peripherals such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic <b>stereo</b> <b>plotters,</b> along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also digital raster graphic.|$|R
40|$|In 1999, a big {{project for}} the {{documentation}} of the Great Omayyad mosque in Aleppo / Syria under UNESCO was conducted. By {{end of the last}} century, still analogue cameras were still being used, like the UMK Zeiss, RolleiMetric System. Digital cameras and digital automatic data processing were just starting to be on the rise and laser scanning was not relevant. In this situation, photogrammetrical measurement used stereo technology for complicated situations, and object and single-image technology for creating photoplans. Hundreds of photogrammetric images were taken. However, data processing was carried out on digital <b>stereo</b> <b>plotters</b> or workstations; it was necessary that all analogue photos were converted to digital form using a photogrammetric scanner. The outputs were adequate {{to the end of the}} last century. Nowadays, after 19 years, the photogrammetric materials still exist, but the technology and processing is completely different. Our original measurement is historical and nowadays quite obsolete. So we was it decided to explore the possibilities of the new processing of historical materials. Why? The reason is that in the last few years there has been civil war in Syria and the above mentioned monument was severely damaged. The existing historical materials therefore provide a unique opportunity for possible future reconstruction. This paper refers to the completion of existing materials, their evaluation and possibilities of new processing with today’s technologies...|$|R
40|$|Topographic contour maps of Mars are {{compiled}} by synthesizing data acquired from various scientific experiments of the Mariner 9 mission, including S-band radio occultation, the UV spectrometer, the IR radiometer, the IR interferometer spectrometer, and television imagery, {{as well as}} earth-based radar information. The entire planet is mapped at scales of 1 : 25, 000, 000 and 1 : 5, 000, 000 using Mercator, Lambert, and polar stereographic map projections. For the computation of map projections, a biaxial spheroid figure is adopted. The semimajor and semiminor axes are 3393. 4 and 3375. 7 km, respectively, with a polar flattening of 0. 0052. For the computation of elevations, a topographic datum is defined by a gravity field {{described in terms of}} spherical harmonics of fourth order and fourth degree combined with a 6. 1 -mbar occultation pressure surface. This areoid can be approximated by a triaxial ellipsoid with semimajor axes of A = 3394. 6 km and B = 3393. 3 km and a semiminor axis of C = 3376. 3 km. The semimajor axis A intersects the Martian surface at longitude 105 deg W. The dynamic flattening of Mars is 0. 00525. The contour interval of the maps is 1 km. For some prominent features where overlapping pictures from Mariner 9 are available, local contour maps at relatively larger scales were also {{compiled by}} photogrammetric methods on <b>stereo</b> <b>plotters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Some {{attempts}} to produce, with an AP/C analytical <b>plotter,</b> <b>stereo</b> models using Mariner 9 pictures are reported. The first attempt using geometrically uncorrected mission test video system (MTVS) imagery failed; the second, using corrected reduced data record (RDR) pictures also failed, probably {{because they were}} reconstructed through a vidicon display which introduces additional distortion. By using images obtained from RDR tape data through the Optronics Photowrite device, models were successfully obtained...|$|R
