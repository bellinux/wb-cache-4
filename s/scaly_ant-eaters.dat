60|$|The {{nature of}} the bond of {{correlation}} is very frequently quite obscure. M. Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked, that certain malconformations very frequently, and that others rarely coexist, without our being able to assign any reason. What can be more singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the tortoise-shell colour with the female sex; the feathered feet and skin between the outer toes in pigeons, {{and the presence of}} more or less down on the young birds when first hatched, with the future colour of their plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here probably homology comes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental, that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal coverings, viz. Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, <b>scaly</b> <b>ant-eaters,</b> etc.), that these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth.|$|E

Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked that certain malconformations frequently, and that others rarely, coexist without our being able to assign any reason. What can be more singular than the relation in cats between complete whiteness and blue eyes with deafness, or between the tortoise-shell colour and the female sex; or in pigeons, between their feathered feet and skin betwixt the outer toes, or between the presence of more or less down on the young pigeon when first hatched, with the future colour of its plumage; or, again, {{the relation between the}} hair and the teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here no doubt homology comes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental that the two orders of mammals which are most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz., Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, <b>scaly</b> <b>ant-eaters,</b> etc.), are likewise on the whole the most abnormal in their teeth, {{but there are so many}} exceptions to this rule, as Mr. Mivart has remarked, that it has little value.|$|E
5000|$|The Veo (Manis cryptus) is a cryptid {{described}} in The Beasts That Hide from Man: Seeking the World's Last Undiscovered Animals by Karl Shuker as {{living on the}} island of Rintja (Rinca) and resembling other pangolins, or <b>scaly</b> <b>ant-eaters.</b> This creature is reported to be as big as a horse. No modern Pangolin approaches that size but on the nearby islands of Java and Borneo, large pangolins of up to 8 feet did once live.|$|E
60|$|We {{saw many}} small animals, such as porcupines, a <b>scaly</b> <b>ant-eater,</b> and a wild pig, piebald {{in color and}} with long curved tusks. Once, through {{a break in the}} trees, we saw a clear {{shoulder}} of green hill some distance away, and across this a large dun-colored animal was traveling at a considerable pace. It passed so swiftly that we were unable to say what it was; but if it were a deer, as was claimed by Lord John, it must have been as large as those monstrous Irish elk which are still dug up {{from time to time in}} the bogs of my native land.|$|R
60|$|Among {{the wild}} animals {{of the region}} the hunter may pursue the black or brown {{mountain}} bear, an occasional leopard, markhor, and several varieties of wild goat, sheep and antelope. The smaller quadrupeds include hares and red foxes, not unlike the British breed, only with much brighter coats, and several kinds of rats, {{some of which are}} very curious and rare. Destitute of beauty but not without use, the <b>scaly</b> <b>ant-eater</b> is frequently seen; but the most common of all the beasts is an odious species of large lizard, nearly three feet long, which resembles a flabby-skinned crocodile and feeds on carrion. Domestic fowls, goats, sheep and oxen, with the inevitable vulture, and an occasional eagle, complete the fauna.|$|R
50|$|Forest {{officials}} {{decided in}} 1960 that including rare {{plants and animals}} in the Odisha pavilion at the World Agricultural Fair in Delhi would help increase attendance. Word {{was sent to the}} forest department to capture as many small animals as possible for the display. In all, the forest department managed to capture two spotted deer (Axis axis), two barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), two black buck (Antilope cervicapra), one mouse deer, one leopard cat, one flying squirrel, one racket-tailed drongo, one hornbill, two parrots, two hill mynah, one peacock, and a mongoose. In addition, the divisional forest officer of Deogarh captured a pangolin (<b>scaly</b> <b>ant-eater)</b> and two porcupines, and the divisional forest officer of Puri captured a pair of wild boars and a Python. All of these animals were delivered to the Delhi fair and exhibited at the Odisha pavilion.|$|R
