5|$|Safdarjung's Tomb is a {{sandstone}} {{and marble}} mausoleum in New Delhi, India. It {{was built in}} 1754 in the late Mughal Empire <b>style</b> <b>for</b> the statesman Safdarjung. The monument has an ambiance of spaciousness and an imposing presence with its domed and arched red brown and white coloured structures. Safdarjung was made prime minister of the Mughal Empire (Wazir ul-Mamlak-i-Hindustan) when Ahmad Shah Bahadur ascended the throne in 1748.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Toshiyuki Itahana. In common with his typical drawing <b>style</b> <b>for</b> characters, Itahana created Wol to be a heroic fantasy character that both fitted within and did not conform to earlier Final Fantasy titles. He and other designers created the multiple job outfits to further convey the fantasy setting. After its reveal, some changes {{were made to the}} character's initial costume: due to negative player feedback about the amount of skin shown, the Onion Swordsman outfit was adjusted to be more covering. The game's environments were designed by Takako Miyake, who had previously worked on console Final Fantasy titles. She did not change her working <b>style</b> <b>for</b> Mobius Final Fantasy: all the assets were designed in high definition, and only adjusted slightly when they were brought into the mobile environment. The visual effects were handled by company veteran Shintaro Takai, whose main preoccupation was to make sure the game did not slow down during the flashier visual combat effects due to hardware constraints. The cutscenes were not affected by these issues.|$|E

5|$|Art {{directors}} Kathy Altieri and Richard Chavez and Production Designer Darek Gogol led {{a team of}} nine visual development {{artists in}} setting a visual <b>style</b> <b>for</b> the film that was representative of the time, the scale and the architectural style of Ancient Egypt.

5|$|Balzac wrote Louis Lambert {{during the}} summer of 1832 while he was staying with friends at the Château de Saché, and {{published}} three editions with three different titles. The novel contains a minimal plot, focusing mostly on the metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius protagonist and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is not a significant example of the realist <b>style</b> <b>for</b> which Balzac became famous, the novel provides insight into the author's own childhood. Specific details and events from the author's life – including punishment from teachers and social ostracism – suggest a fictionalized autobiography.|$|E

50|$|With the {{expansion}} of Sahelian kingdoms south to the rural areas in the savannas (inhabited by culturally or ethnically similar groups {{to those in the}} Sahel), the Sudano-Sahelian <b>style</b> was reserved <b>for</b> mosques, palaces, the houses of nobility or townsfolk (as is evident in the Gur-Voltaic style), whereas among commonfolk, there was a mix between either typically distinct Sudano-Sahelian <b>styles</b> <b>for</b> wealthier families, and older African roundhut <b>styles</b> <b>for</b> rural villages and family compounds.|$|R

5|$|Both {{the north}} tower and the south tower of the Rincon Hill complex bear a {{resemblance}} to The Heritage at Millennium Park in Chicago, a building of a similar height to the south tower also designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates. The architectural <b>style</b> <b>for</b> both buildings of the Rincon Hill complex is late-modernist. The three sides of the South Tower facing southeast, northeast, and northwest have a linear glass curtainwall. The North Tower has a similar design, except it is shorter and the curved aluminum and glass side faces northeast. Both skyscrapers of the Rincon Hill project contain an oval-shaped crown housing mechanical equipment.|$|E
5|$|Following on from Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire <b>style</b> <b>for</b> republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E

Team Canada held leads of 3–1 and 4–2, but the Soviet side responded and the game ended in a 4–4 tie.|$|E
