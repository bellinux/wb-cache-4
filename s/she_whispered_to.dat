500|$|Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet [...] "had {{the thing}} that you look for" [...] and that there was [...] "a quality in her face, in her eyes," [...] that he [...] "just knew people would be ready to go the {{distance}} with her". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, [...] "She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [...] that's not going to happen." [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Gabrielle Anwar had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, 20-year-old Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as [...] "an Audrey Hepburn type" [...] and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Cameron, [...] "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." [...] Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, [...] "From Your Rose", and lobbied him by phone. [...] "You don't understand!" [...] she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. [...] "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Garðar won the {{principal}} role of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny, in The Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre in London's West End. It {{was in this}} role that he discovered his ability to sing high notes. [...] "I'd been having a bad evening and I was miserable, felt I wasn't even {{good enough to be}} in the chorus. Then in my next scene I went up to the C sharp and it just stayed there. Christine, the soprano, was walking towards me and her mouth fell open and <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> me, 'Wow, is that really you?' I've had those notes ever since." ...|$|E
2500|$|Algerian {{authorities}} still {{refused to}} agree to the hijackers' demands. Burgniard recalled realising, with the other occupants, that [...] "things were going wrong" [...] when the hijackers came to collect another passenger. The hijackers selected 48-year-old Bui Giang To, a commercial attaché at the Embassy of Vietnam in Algeria. Burgniard described To as [...] "the real foreigner on this plane." [...] She recalled that To was not intimidated by the hijackers and believes that this attitude upset the hijackers. The diplomat believed {{that he was going to}} be released because he was a foreigner. Instead he was shot dead on the boarding stairs. Delhemme recalled that when the flight attendant appeared with a bottle of water and glasses, <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> him that two passengers, not one, have died.|$|E

6000|$|... "Wake, Frank! wake {{and defend}} yourself! Richard Wardour knows that I love you--Richard Wardour's vengeance {{will take your}} life! Wake, Frank--wake! You are {{drifting}} to your death!" [...] A low groan of horror bursts from her, sinister and terrible to hear. [...] "Drifting! drifting!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> herself--"drifting to his death!" ...|$|R
50|$|At {{work the}} next day, Pavla is seen {{attempting}} sabotage. <b>She</b> <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> Tartu to protect himself by denouncing her. He does, and she is summarily executed. The factory manager rewards Tartu by arranging the transfer he wants, to the chemical plant.|$|R

60|$|She lay flat {{down upon}} the grass and was silent for several minutes. Then <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Jeanne.|$|E
6000|$|... "Janey, {{something}} must have happened," [...] <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> her friend, who was hardening her own heart for the dreadful interview.|$|E
60|$|Then in much {{agitation}} <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> something <b>to</b> him, {{at which}} {{he seemed to be}} much surprised.|$|R

6000|$|... "In--deed!" [...] {{returned}} Miss Flite. [...] "Very {{proud to}} have the honour! A military man, my dear. You know, a perfect general!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's Reggie Farwel, who did {{my house}} in town," [...] <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Honora. [...] "He's never been near me since it was finished. He's utterly ruined." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Go {{and speak}} to your aunts and uncles, my dears," [...] said Mrs. Tulliver, looking anxious and melancholy. <b>She</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> Maggie a command to go and have her hair brushed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{the last}} word you say in the house be a prayer of thankfulness," [...] <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> him when they were taking a final glance at the old home.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a sly demure little wretch {{you have}} been," [...] <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Laura--while Pen, in great spirits, was laughing, and telling his story about Huxter--"and {{how you have}} kept your secret!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shan't say, my dear, {{that your}} wife {{has helped to}} make you uneasy by {{so much as a}} word or a look," [...] <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> me as we left the inn.|$|E
50|$|As they {{explore the}} yard, they are {{approached}} by a young woman. She offers to tell them each a secret {{that will help them}} find The Sound. <b>She</b> <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> Diddy that they have a plan to attack Yved. She tells him there is a gun hidden below a girder in a nearby building that he should retrieve while pretending to look for The Sound. He retrieves the gun and is then given further instructions through a low-volume speaker.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This {{is not my}} ancestral trade,' <b>she</b> <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> the {{accomplice}} sea. 'If {{everybody had}} their rights I should be doing something quite different; for my father, he was the Junk, and my mother, she was the Dhow, and {{between the two of}} 'em they made Asia.' Then she tacks, disorderly but deadly quick, and shuffles past the unimaginative steam-packet with her hat over one eye and a knife, as it were, up her baggy sleeves.|$|R

He points, at least with whole hand, and is almost walking (can stand with support). His mother and Anna were eliciting interaction with him, mostly successfully. <b>She</b> <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> {{him a lot of}} the time. Filmed partly in the rain, bad back light sometimes...|$|R

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> him (while Mrs. Clark considerately turned away), [...] "I {{love you}} for understanding. I'm just--I'm beastly over-sensitive. Too many books. It's {{my lack of}} shoulder-muscles and sense. Give me time, dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arthur is charming to-night," [...] <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Laura, across Cornet Perch's shell-jacket, as Pen was {{performing}} cavalier seul before them, drawling through that figure with a thumb {{in the pocket}} of each waistcoat.|$|E
50|$|Tensions in {{the dining}} room reach a peak and Rym decides <b>to</b> step in. <b>She</b> <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> the musicians, and {{suddenly}} the music stops and the lights go out.

The musicians play for her and she entrances the guests with a fervent performance, charged with youthful, sexual energy. Latifa uses the opportunity to slip off the boat and return to the hotel to start a new pot of couscous.|$|R
6000|$|MRS WARREN. Yes; {{and young}} people have to get all that {{nonsense}} taken out of them, and good deal more besides.
