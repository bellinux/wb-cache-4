5000|$|The six-track EP, Knifefight, was {{released}} on Anticon on September 3, 2013. It featured guest appearances from Cities Aviv, Kool A.D., and <b>Sub</b> <b>Con.</b> The EP was described by Blake Gillespie of Impose Magazine as [...] "a danger funk that orchestrates a balance between their experimentation of Anti-Pop Consortium and the Ghostly vibes of Planet High School." ...|$|E

25|$|The TDC was {{a rather}} bulky {{addition}} to the <b>sub's</b> <b>conning</b> tower and required two extra crewmen: one as an expert in its maintenance, the other as its actual operator. Despite these drawbacks, {{the use of the}} TDC was an important factor in the successful commerce raiding program conducted by American submarines during the Pacific campaign of World War II. Accounts of the American submarine campaign in the Pacific often cite the use of TDC. Some officers became highly skilled in its use, and the navy set up a training school for its use.|$|R
5000|$|Almost 1 year later, Menemsha, on {{a weather}} patrol, sighted a German submarine. As she steamed about midway between the Virginia Capes and the Azores on the moonlit night of 11 August 1943, her lookout spotted a {{surfaced}} sub, , about 6,000 yards off her starboard bow. She closed for attack and began shelling the U-boat with 4 inch gunfire. During {{the next half-hour}} she chased the enemy which responded with [...] "incoherent recognition signals" [...] rather than with torpedoes or return fire. The determined weather patrol ship fired 20 rounds, one of which struck close aboard the fleeing <b>sub's</b> <b>conning</b> tower.|$|R
2500|$|At 22:00, as Ringgold and {{the cruiser}} [...] pushed {{ahead of the}} attack force, they picked up a radar contact. Word had been passed to watch for the submarine, but it was {{believed}} that she had moved westward that afternoon to rescue a downed flier, and that she would submerge once she encountered friendly forces. However, Nautilus being near a reef, did not submerge. Admiral Hill, anxious to avoid any encounters with possible Japanese patrols, gave the order to take the contact under fire. Ringgolds first salvo struck the base of the <b>sub's</b> <b>conning</b> tower. Although it ruptured her main induction valve, it did not explode. Nautilus submerged in [...] "dire circumstances", but was able to make it to Abemama and complete her mission.|$|R
5000|$|More recently, after {{transfer}} to the US, Pisces IV was certified {{for use by the}} American Bureau of Shipping in 2000, and underwent modernization and upgrading in 2001 in preparation for the diving season. During training cruises in 2002, Pisces IV and its sister Pisces V found a Japanese midget submarine outside Pearl Harbor that had been detected {{on the morning of the}} attack on the harbor in 1941. Associate director of the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory, John Wiltshire, said the discovery was [...] "probably the most significant archaeological find in the Pacific". At the time of its discovery, on 28 August 2002, the search for the sub had been ongoing for 61 years. Analysis of the wreck shows that it was brought down by a shell from the USS Ward that breached the <b>sub's</b> <b>conning</b> tower, confirming that the United States fired the first shot in its war with Japan.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the initial growth in diameter and height, the survival and the quality of seedlings of C. odorata planted in four different types of substrates (t 0 = common earth, t 1 = 90 % sawdust and 10 % sand, t 2 = 90 % de poultry manure and 10 % sand, t 3 = 30 % sawdust, 30 % poultry manure, 30 % common earth and 10 % sand). Field work took place in the tree nursery of the Loreto Regional Government located in the Quistococha Tourist Complex, Loreto, Peru, where an area of 12 m 2 were divided in 12 subplots to randomly distributed the 4 treatments with 3 replications per treatment. Results show that seedlings planted in the substrate t 3 attained the highest increment in diameter and height of 1, 90 mm and 14, 20 cm, respectively. After six months of evaluation a highest survival of 32, 28 % with regular conditions of seedlings was attained. TesisEl estudio se realizó en el vivero forestal del Gobierno Regional de Loreto ubicado en el Complejo Turístico de Quistococha, Loreto, Perú. El objetivo fue determinar el incremento en crecimiento inicial en diámetro y altura, la sobrevivencia y la calidad de las plántulas de Cedrela odorata, en cuatro diferentes tipos de sustratos (t 0 = tierra natural, t 1 = 90 % de aserrín y 10 % de arena, t 2 = 90 % de gallinaza y 10 % de arena, t 3 = 30 % de aserrín, 30 % de gallinaza, 30 % de tierra natural y 10 % de arena). Se utilizó un área de 12 m 2 dividido en 12 <b>sub</b> parcelas <b>con</b> diseño experimental simple al azar y 3 repeticiones. Los resultados indican que el tratamiento t 3 presentó mayor incremento en diámetro y altura con 1, 90 mm y 14, 20 cm, respectivamente; así como la mayor sobrevivencia de 32, 28 % y la calidad de las plántulas fue regular...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} aims at developing and demonstrating {{the influence of}} the addition of thermoplastic acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) as stabilizer to the subbase granular material with a CBR = 51. 04 % for flexible pavements; In this way different percentages of thermoplastic ABS were added: 1. 5 %; 2. 5 %; 3. 5 % and 4. 5 % of the dry weight of the material. Thus, by acting together the material added with said stabilizer (ABS); the pavement will be able to dissipate the loads imposed by the traffic (vertical loads) contributing to our main objective, which is to increase its support capacity (CBR) and thus avoid failures due to permanent deformation of the pavement besides giving the structure a longer shelf life. The reason why we chose to use this additive for the {{present research}} was not only for its favorable physical and chemical properties, but also for the interest of knowing how this type of plastic will act in engineering soils. In addit ion to the growing market for 3 D prints and ABS being the material used to make them, it is very likely that in the future we will have many wastes of this material, that is why we are {{looking for a way to}} reuse them. For the experimental development of the research work, the elements that formed our sub-base design were aggregates of Quillahuata quarry and ABS thermoplastic (spheres with a diameter of 3 mm) as stabilizing agent; All this to analyze the ability to support the sub-base material. In this way we conclude that adding the ABS thermoplastic from the 2. 5 % dosage of the dry weight of the material revealed a higher increase of CBR in relation to the sub-base material without additive. TesisEl presente tema de investigación intenta desarrollar y demostrar la influencia que tiene la adición del termoplástico Acrilonitrilo Butadieno Estireno (ABS) como estabilizador al material granular de <b>sub</b> base <b>con</b> un CBR = 51. 04 % para pavimentos flexibles; de esta manera se agregaron diferentes porcentajes de termoplástico ABS: 1. 5 %; 2. 5 %; 3. 5 % y 4. 5 % del peso seco del material. De este modo, actuando en conjunto el material adicionado con dicho estabilizador (ABS); el pavimento logrará disipar las cargas impuestas por el tráfico (esfuerzos verticales) contribuyendo a nuestro objetivo principal que es incrementar su capacidad de soporte (CBR) y así evitar fallas por deformación permanente del pavimento además de dotar a la estructura un mayor tiempo de vida útil. La razón por la que se optó por utilizar este aditivo para la presente investigación no fue solo por sus favorecedoras propiedades físicas y químicas, sino también por el interés de saber cómo actuará en suelos este tipo de plástico con fines ingenieriles. Además que con el creciente mercado de las impresiones 3 D y siendo el ABS el material que se usa para realizarlas, es muy probable que en el futuro tengamos muchos desechos de este material, es por eso que se busca un modo de reutilizar los mismos. Para el desarrollo experimental del trabajo de investigación los elementos que conformaron nuestro diseño de sub base fueron agregados de la cantera de Quillahuata y el termoplástico ABS (esferas con un diámetro de 3 mm) como agente estabilizante; todo esto para analizar la capacidad de soporte del material sub base.
