5|$|The {{director}} told CanWest News Service that {{he hoped}} the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, sexual slang and its media use. Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on NYPD Blue, and how parents should discuss its use with their children. He emphasized that artists and filmmakers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> express their views without censorship, deferring to public opinion on the appropriateness of his documentary's title.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> do so, within broad limits.|$|E
50|$|The Monetary Authority should, of course, {{have the}} widest {{possible}} discretion {{with respect to}} the methods it might find most suitable for attaining the objectives laid down in the mandate. That <b>is,</b> it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> absolutely <b>free</b> <b>to</b> use any or all of its powers over money and the banks according to its own best judgment; but, as has been stressed before, the Monetary Authority <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> deviate from the mandate given to it by Congress.|$|R

5|$|In August 2011, a Florida {{judge ordered}} Jack to stop selling nude {{photographs}} of Runnels. Runnels filed suit, accusing Jack of making libelous comments {{about her and}} requested that a court ban him from distributing sexually-explicit photographs of her. Jack said that he took the photos, that they belonged to him and that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> pass them on to whoever he pleases. A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Runnels ahead of a hearing.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the days}} of the Constituent Assembly in 1823, and with renewed vigor in 1826 {{with the opening of the}} General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological {{struggle}} over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared PedroI's views, politicians who believed that the monarch <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, who believed that cabinets should have the power to set the government's course and should consist of deputies drawn from the majority party who were accountable to the parliament. Strictly speaking, both the party that supported PedroI's government and the Liberal Party advocated Liberalism, and thus constitutional monarchy.|$|E

25|$|Timaru Public Library {{was officially}} opened in 1909 {{on the present}} Timaru District Council site.

The current library was opened on Sophia Street by the roundabout in 1979. It was designed by Miles, Warren and Mahoney.|$|E
25|$|By the 19th century, {{the liberals}} had evolved into Unitarians. Not {{only did they}} deny the {{doctrine}} of the Trinity as unscriptural, they believed the Bible should be interpreted rationally, not in a literal manner. Their preaching focused on ethics rather than on doctrine and did not limit church membership to the converted. Unitarians did not participate in evangelistic societies due to their conviction that people informed by reason and scripture <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> believe what they wanted. When they did organize, they tended to focus on education and philanthropic causes.|$|E

25|$|Straw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education {{spokesman}} from 1987. In this role, {{he called}} on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right {{to opt out of}} the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.|$|E
25|$|Israeli {{authorities}} {{state that}} their reason of these restrictions is fear of his spreading further state secrets {{and that he}} is still bound by his non-disclosure agreement. While a court found in 2005 that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> go to the Gaza Strip and West Bank, a year later further restrictions explicitly forbade him to visit either, reversing the court's initial decision. Vanunu said his knowledge was outdated and that he had nothing more he could reveal that is not already widely known. Despite the stated restrictions he gave interviews to the foreign press since his release, for which he has been arrested.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 the Chinese {{government}} {{reacted to}} these complaints and incidents by prescribing {{a set of}} standardized routines for all dancers to follow, claiming they would be culturally unifying and healthier. The move was met with widespread criticism. Some Chinese complained that it did nothing to address the noise issues; others said the dancers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> choose their own routines. The real problem, yet others said, {{was not only the}} lack of better places for the dancing but the lack of other social opportunities for the women. The government soon clarified that the routines it created and promoted were only meant to be healthy alternatives to existing ones and were not required.|$|E
5000|$|One {{theory of}} short-tailed cats in Japan {{indicates}} that they {{arrived from the}} Asian continent at least 1,000 years ago. In 1602, Japanese authorities decreed that all cats <b>should</b> <b>be</b> set <b>free</b> <b>to</b> help deal with rodents threatening the nation's silkworm population and associated industry. At that time, buying or selling cats was illegal, and from then on, bobtailed cats lived on farms and in the streets. Japanese Bobtails thus became the [...] "street cats" [...] of Japan.|$|R

25|$|This {{decision}} quickly {{brought on}} a crisis. While the Earl of Manchester (with Cromwell as his lieutenant-general) {{was appointed to}} head {{the forces of the}} Eastern Association against Newcastle, and Waller was given a new army wherewith again to engage Hopton and Maurice, the task of saving Gloucester from the King's army fell to Essex. Essex was heavily reinforced and drew his army together for action in the last days of August. Press-ganging had to be resorted to in order to fill the ranks, and recruiting for Waller's new army was stopped. London sent six regiments of trained bands to the front, closing the shops so that every man <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> take his part in what was thought to be the supreme trial of strength.|$|E
25|$|Discussing ethical issues, Ruse {{distinguishes between}} {{involuntary}} inclination and willful behavior, arguing that while a homosexual orientation is morally blameless, {{this is not}} necessarily true of homosexual behavior. Ruse finds no justification for homosexual or heterosexual promiscuity, but nevertheless maintains on utilitarian grounds that people <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> be promiscuous. He criticizes ethical arguments that appeal to scientific claims about the naturalness or unnaturalness of homosexuality, for example the views of the Greek philosopher Plato, according to whom homosexual behavior did not occur in animals. Ruse finds this claim to be mistaken, and dismisses the idea that homosexuality is unnatural. Ruse argues that both neo-Kantian and utilitarian theories of the just state must affirm the moral worth of homosexual relationships and support equal rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals.|$|E
25|$|The Perfectionist movement, led by John Humphrey Noyes, {{founded the}} utopian Oneida Community in 1848 with fifty-one devotees, in Oneida, New York. Noyes {{believed}} {{that the act of}} final conversion led to absolute and complete release from sin. The Onedia Community believed in the abolition of marriage or monogamous relationships and that sex <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> whoever consented to it. As opposed to 20th century social movements such as the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s, the Onedians did not seek consequence-free sex for mere pleasure, but believed that, because the logical outcome of intercourse was pregnancy, that raising children should be a communal responsibility. After the original founders died or became elderly, their children rejected the concept of free love and returned to traditional family models. Transforming into a joint-stock company, Oneida thrived for many years and continues today as a silverware company.|$|E
